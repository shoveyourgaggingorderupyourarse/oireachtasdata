Are they agreed to?  Agreed.</p><p>The next item is correspondence.  No. 1610B is correspondence received from the Department of Health on the implementation of the Scally report and was circulated to members yesterday.  We will discuss the timing of the issue in the context of our work programme, but for now we can note and publish the correspondence.</p><p>Category A comprises briefing documents and opening statements received by the committee.  Nos. 1598A and 1608A are correspondence received from Teagasc, including briefing documents and the opening statement for today's meeting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  </p><p>Category B comprises correspondence received from Accounting Officers and/or Ministers, as well as follow-up material requested at previous meetings.  We held over a number of items from last week's meeting and are awaiting further information on some of them.  We will continue to hold them over until we receive the information.</p><p>The first item held over was No. 1482B, correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on the Dublin Institute of Technology.  At our meeting last week we agreed to note and publish the correspondence and request the Secretary General&rsquo;s views on the relevant legislation.  That letter has been sent and the correspondence published.  </p><p>Nos. 1486B and 1566B, dated 12 September 2018, are correspondence received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, providing a copy of the review and report on Kildare-Wicklow ETB.  We agreed to note and publish this correspondence.  The secretariat is working on isolating matters mentioned in the report that are not subject to investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>The next item held over was No. 1490B, correspondence received from Mr. Stephen Blake in the Government accounting unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, enclosing a minute from the Minister for Finance in response to our periodic report which was published last January.  I am proposing that we hold the item over again.  At this stage there are two or three reports, each of which merits further discussion.  I have had a look at the correspondence and have mixed views on the quality of the response received.  We will come back to the matter in public session at a later date.</p><p><b></b>The next item held over was No. 1502B, correspondence, dated 31 July 2018, received from Mr. Fergal Costello in the Department of Rural and Community Development, providing a copy of the statutory review of the Dormant Accounts Fund.  We agreed to note and publish the correspondence, as well as a number of other items related to our periodic reports.  The Dormant Accounts Fund will be included as an item in a future work programme.  We will come back to this item.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#G00200"><p>That is good because I have attempted to come to terms with it and failed.  I need help.  We need to look at this matter more closely to find out what is happening.  Approximately 50% of the fund, perhaps more, is unspent, while organisations are struggling for money.  Some Departments are much worse than others.  I have tried to get to the bottom of the matter and, like other Deputies, have tabled questions in the D&aacute;il about it, but I have failed utterly to grasp it.  An effort was made by the committee to have a review carried out.  Now that one has been carried out, we must look at it and decide if value for money is being obtained and find out what exactly is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#G00300"><p>We will come back to it.  Representatives of the Dormant Accounts Fund were with us last year and it was one of the most pathetic meetings I had ever attended.  Commitments were made to concepts and projects, but there was not a sheet of paper to be had and projects never happened.  Money was locked up as part of a concept that had passed its sell-by date.  Responsibility for the fund had moved from one Department to another and then another.  It ended up being nobody's child in the sense that nobody wanted to take responsibility for it.  Meanwhile, because there was no sunset clause, money that had been committed was locked up and could not be used.  It was the worst example I had seen in quite a while of poor administration in the use of scarce public resources.  We will come back to the matter as part of our work programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#G00400"><p>A lack of preparedness was the main factor in causing the underspend, in addition to low levels of uptake which reached almost 90% in some Departments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#G00500"><p>That lack of preparedness meant that proposals were submitted but there were no details behind them.  They were not really proposals but concepts or notions.  Somebody had a notion about spending &euro;2 million on a concept which was approved and the money set aside.  However, nothing ever happened and the money was locked away.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#G00600"><p>Whatever about notions, there is huge demand for money on the ground-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#G00700"><p>Yes, there is.  That is the sad part.  We will definitely come back to the matter which we will be highlighting in a future periodic report.  The correspondence received from Mr. Costello will help us in coming to conclusions.</p><p>The next item held over was No. 1510B<b>, </b>correspondence received<b></b>from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, enclosing a minute from the Minister for Finance in response to our second periodic report.  We will hold it over again.  </p><p>The next item held over was No.<b></b>1513B, correspondence received<b></b>from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, providing further details as requested by the committee of the status of non-screening cervical cancer misdiagnosis claims.  We agreed to note and publish the correspondence and hold it over for further discussion at a later meeting.  We will discuss the State Claims Agency and CervicalCheck in the context of our work programme in a few minutes.  </p><p>Also held over were Nos. 1526B, 1528B and 1530B, correspondence received from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, providing follow-up information as requested at our meeting on 5 July.  A considerable amount of information was enclosed.  We noted and published the correspondence last week and will come back to the matter as part of our work programme.  Mr. Mitchell has provided very extensive and comprehensive information which will take some time to go through.  When we come back to the issues, the correspondence will form part of our work programme.  We also held over No. 1538B, correspondence received from Mr. Mitchell, providing follow-up information as requested at our meeting on 14 June.  Again, very extensive documentation has been submitted.  The correspondence has been noted and published and will be held on file as part of our work programme.  </p><p>The next item held over was No. 1560B, correspondence received from Dr. Barry O' Connor, president of Cork Institute of Technology, providing a detailed note as requested by the committee on the preparation of terms of reference for the KPMG review of anonymous allegations against Cork Institute of Technology in 2014.  We agreed to note and publish the correspondence which we will hold over for now.  </p><p>Also held over was<b></b>No. 1561B, correspondence received from Ms Anne Hession of the Higher Education Authority on the HEA's examination of expenditure associated with retirement events for the former president of Cork Institute of Technology, enclosing a note on the ability of technological universities to borrow.  At our meeting last week we noted and discussed this correspondence which was read into the record.  It will form part of our ongoing work.  The memo is the only piece of positive information on the topic I have seen to date.  </p><p>No. 1599B is correspondence, dated 27 September 2018, received from Ms Michelle Lowe, corporate communications manager, NTMA, providing information as requested by the committee for the preparation of our next periodic report.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  We are continuing work on our periodic reports.  The secretariat has been going through the transcripts and is following up on questions that have not been answered fully by various bodies.</p><p>That is part of that process.  We will note and publish that in the meantime, but it will come back to us when we are finalising our periodic report.<br/><br/><b></b>The next item is No. 1600 B<b></b>from Ms Margaret Fitzgerald, private secretary to the Secretary General, Department of Finance.  The secretariat requested an update relating to the review of staffing, governance and operations in the Tax Appeals Commission, and the Department advise a copy of the review is expected to be issued to the Committee of Public Accounts in the next week or so.  It has been completed.  It is on the Minister's desk, and we are told we will have it in a week or so.  We look forward to receiving that, hopefully very shortly.  We will note and publish that.<br/><br/><b></b>The next item is C, correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence.  The first one is No. 1491 C<b></b>from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 19 July 2018, enclosing an information note as requested regarding what appears to be a far from complete remediation of a landfill site in County Wicklow.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this correspondence and hold it over for further discussion.  In the meantime, we have received further correspondence from the original correspondent, and we will return to it as part of our work programme.<br/><br/><b></b>Held over from the last meeting also was No. 1572 C<b></b>dated 15 September 2018 related to the previous item to which I have just referred.  At our last meeting, we agreed to send the response from the Department to the correspondent.  We have received further correspondence from him and we may return to that as part of our future work programme.<br/><br/><b></b>Held over from the last meeting is No. 1578 C<b></b>from an individual dated 14 September 2018 requesting the committee to make recommendations to the Government regarding accountability for the management of the State's property assets.  This matter is related to a forthcoming Comptroller and Auditor General report and refers to an issue raised with the previous committee.  We agreed to note and publish that and hold it over for further discussion.  Is that the item we discussed in private session?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#H00200"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

This is one of the items we discussed in private session.  I call Deputy Kelly to summarise where we are going with this letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#H00400"><p>This is a fairly significant letter in regard to the Office of Public Works, OPW, from a former valuer who worked in the OPW.  As I said in private session, I have spoken and met with the individual.  I believe the issues he has brought forward in this letter are very serious.  We are meeting with the OPW next week and can go through the different issues, particularly those highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Further to that, at a later date, as a committee, we should meet with this individual.  We will take advice on whether that will be a public or, potentially, a private meeting to go through his correspondence and his backup documentation, some of which I have seen, in regard to what he has brought forward.  Very serious issues are being brought forward by this individual, who has just retired from the OPW as its most senior valuer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#H00500"><p>Deputy Connolly indicated.</p></speech>

It should be brought to the attention of the Office of Public Works.  It should have a chance to look at it so that it is in a position to deal with questions raised.  If there is a report or anything else we should have prior to the meeting - a report is referred to here - inquiries should be made about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#H00700"><p>We will forward this letter to the OPW.  We discussed it in private session.  We might redact a few words because of the parliamentary privilege issue, but, by and large, the substance of the letter will be published during the course of the day by the Committee of Public Accounts, subject to minor redactions.  We will send it then to the OPW and ask it to send us whatever report is referred to.</p></speech>

A report is referred to in here that was compiled by this individual, with another individual, who remains employed in the OPW.  That report is with the chairperson of the OPW.  As I understand it, there has been no reply to that report so we may want to ask the chair of the OPW, in advance of next week, for this report to be sent to the committee-----</p></speech>

We have that.  We will ask the secretariat to communicate that to the OPW in advance of next week's meeting.  We are conscious there is a Comptroller and Auditor General chapter in his report relating to a particular matter dealing with the OPW and the Department of Health, and we will come to our work programme shortly.</p><p><b></b>The next item is No. 1595 C from an individual dated 22 September 2018 highlighting matters regarding the appointment of a capital projects manager in Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services, in Harold&rsquo;s Cross.  I propose we note the item, and members are free to address it as part of a future work programme with the Health Service Executive, HSE.  It is a section 38 organisation.  We will hold over that issue and it can form part of our work programme with the HSE.</p><p><b></b>The next item is No. 1602 C from an individual dated 25 September 2018 regarding pension arrangements and the President.  We will note it, and there will be no debate.</p><p><b></b>The next item is No. 1607 C, correspondence<b></b>from Deputy Bobby Aylward dated 1 October 2018 requesting the committee to examine the operation, financial arrangements and oversight of the school transport service.

Approximately 350 children who are on concessionary tickets are being left on the side of the road.  That is my concern.  I have a particular concern in my own parish where 11 children have been left behind.  That is the reason I raise this matter.  It is an issue that raises its head at this time of the year.  Is the roll-out of the system in place now fit for purpose?  Does it need to be reviewed?  We should examine the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to see if we are getting value for money.</p></speech>

We will have a discussion on that in a few minutes.</p> <p>  The next item is statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  This will take a few minutes because since July, 101 statements and accounts have been submitted to this committee.  Normally, we note ten or 20 every week but, due to the summer period, members will have to bear with me.  I will move through them as fast as I can, although it does not sound too bad.  There are 70 financial statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which has 40 Votes for each of the State bodies.  That is one composite document, but there are approximately 70.  If some members have issues, we can hold over a particular one for a later date, but we will try to move on them as fast as we can.  We will give it a few minutes and then come back to our work programme before we go into public session.  All of these have been received over the summer period.</p> <p>  The first one is 4.1, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, clear audit opinion.  It assesses compensation entitlements in personal injury claims.  The next is 4.2, Enterprise Ireland, clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to expenditure where the procurement procedures did not comply with public procurement guidelines.  I suspect it will not be the only public body about which that remark will be made.  I am marking that one.  Enterprise Ireland's annual turnover for 2017 is &euro;350 million.  The next is 4.3, Solas, funding of &euro;603 million.  It plans and co-ordinates further education and training.  Again, there are issues of non-compliance-----</p></speech>

We will come back to the issue.  We would probably like to have a summary of the accounts of all of the bodies with procurement issues on a spreadsheet.  It is an issue with which we must deal because we cannot hop on it every week and never do anything about it.  It is little like getting organisations' financial reporting up to date, on which we have great progress in the past year or two.  We must move on a topic such as this, as well as on everything else we must do.</p> <p>  Representatives of Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority, will appear before us shortly.  Again, there is a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to expenditure where public procurement procedures were not full complied with.  </p> <p>  The next item concerns Bord na gCon, in respect of which there is a clear audit opinion.  There is a clear audit opinion in respect of Kingdom Greyhound Racing Company Limited.  Obviously, we are dealing with a lot of bodies that are subsidiaries of Bord na gCon.  There are clear accounts in respect of Cork Greyhound Racing Company Limited, Clonmel Racing Company Limited and Limerick Greyhound Racing Track Limited.  Abergrove Limited, Bord na gCon's food and beverages operation, is a separate company, in respect of which there is a clear audit opinion.  There is also a clear audit opinion in respect of Galway Greyhound Stadium Limited and Dublin Greyhound and Sports Association Limited.  The latter company ceased trading in February 2017.  Agreement was reached for the sale of Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium for a sum of &euro;23 million which, coincidentally, was sufficient to allow the company to discharge its residual liabilities.  I think it was sold to the Department of Education and Skills.  People in Dublin will be more familiar with the issue.  Will there be a set of accounts for 2018 for that organisation?</p></speech>

There is also a clear audit opinion in respect of Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, the National Transport Authority and Microfinance Ireland.  There is a clear audit opinion in respect of NSCDA (Operations) Designated Activity Company which is involved in developing and operating the National Sports Campus.  There is a clear audit opinion in respect of NAMA and a number of its subsidiaries, including the National Asset Management Designated Activity Company, the National Asset Loan Management Designated Activity Company, the National Asset Management Group Services Designated Activity Company, the National Asset Joint Venture Designated Activity Company, the National Asset Residential Property Services Designated Activity Company, the National Asset Property Management Designated Activity Company, the National Asset North Quays Designated Activity Company, the National Asset Management Services Designated Activity Company and National Asset Sarasota Limited.  The last named company is a subsidiary in the United States.  We recently had a meeting with NAMA at which we covered all of those subsidiaries.</p> <p>  The next item is the Public Trustee Account which administers 148 trusts related to activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, including former Land Commission Trust balances.  As there is only a figure of &euro;38,000, it really only involve a sheet of paper.  There is a clear audit opinion.  There are no actual current transactions.  </p> <p>  The next item is the finance accounts which involves the annual statement on the transactions of the Central Fund.  They were lodged on 18 July.  In involves the small matter of &euro;53.6 billion, the full income and receipts of the State.  There is a clear audit opinion, but, obviously, it is an issue to which we will return.  </p> <p>  The next item is the Local Government Fund 2017.  There was a total of &euro;1.9 billion which formed part of the expenditure of local authorities.  There is a clear audit opinion.  We will deal with that matter as part of our interaction with the relevant Department.  </p> <p>  There is a clear audit opinion in respect of the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund which only has a turnover of &euro;8.3 million.  </p> <p>  The next item is the State Property (Miscellaneous Deposits) Account for the collection of windfall receipts, for example, from residual property remaining where a company is dissolved or struck off.  The figure came to &euro;14.4 million.  When we discussed this item previously, I raised the issue of where a company was dissolved but there was a residual asset.  Nobody was able to tell me that there was a State account that actually dealt with the matter.  Everyone was vague about where the money ended up.  I take it that it is somewhere in the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

If somebody comes back within a 25-year period and can prove that he or she is the one remaining shareholder, that he or she has been living in Australia and realises the building the company owned has been sold, he or she can claim back the money.  It is a little like the Dormant Accounts Fund.  It probably happens very little, but in theory, there is that option, which is why the money is held in an account in the event that somebody might show up some day.  We learn something new every day.</p> <p>  There is a clear audit opinion in respect of the Ireland-United States Educational Fund which collects funds for the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange.  There is a total of &euro;7,000 in transactions, a small amount.  </p> <p>  The next item concerns the Health Products Regulatory Authority, in respect of which there is a clear audit opinion.  It involves the cost of superannuation entitlements accounted for as the amounts become payable, rather than in the year of entitlement.  This happens in all of the health organisations.  The Comptroller and Auditor General highlights the fact that there is no proper accounting for pension payments.</p></speech>

It was set up for and with a very specific purpose and function, but it has been mired in difficulty from day one.  Is there an avenue by which we can return to this matter?  There have been serious issues, including there being no chairman, monitoring and governance, as well as the renting of a building with a limited fund.

It is definitely within the remit of this committee, as is everything I am mentioning this morning.</p> <p>  The next item is from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  It has a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to expenditure on goods and services that were not procured by way of a competitive process, and weaknesses in the agency&rsquo;s oversight and monitoring of grants to outside agencies.  We will take up that issue.  The HSE had some of those issues, in terms of monitoring grants to outside agencies and seems to have improved its system, so Tusla needs to do the same.  We might come back to that Department as part of our work programme, and we can look at Tusla specifically. </p> <p>  The next item concerns the National Disability Authority.  It has a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The next item concerns the National Cancer Registry Board, which collects and classifies information on all cancer cases which occur in Ireland.  It has a qualified audit opinion, but costs of superannuation entitlements are accounted for as they become payable rather than in the year the entitlements are earned.  That was not a clear audit opinion because it does not adequately or properly account for its pension costs.</p> <p>  The next item concerns the Health Insurance Authority, which regulates the private health insurance market and administers the risk equalisation fund.  The next item, under separate accounts, is the risk equalisation fund itself.  The fund involves an audit of &euro;673 million, and the Health Insurance Authority regulates it.  The risk equalisation fund, for people wondering what it is, is a fund that concerns the age mix and profile of customers of the three private health insurers in the market.  VHI probably has older customers, so there is a transfer of funds, approved by the Health Insurance Authority, from Laya Healthcare and the other insurer, the name of which I cannot recall at the moment, to VHI which equalises the risk across the industry.  A large amount of money moves around between the insurers.</p></speech>

It seeks to ensure a fair market for everyone in the country rather than allowing companies to cherry-pick customers.  The principle is good.</p> <p>  The next item concerns the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  It has a clear audit opinion, although costs of superannuation entitlements are accounted for as they become payable rather than in the year the entitlements are earned.  The same issue arises here.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might explain why the Food Safety Authority of Ireland got a clear audit opinion even though the same issue arises.</p></speech>

Here we go again with this organisation.  It has a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to non-compliance with national procurement guidelines and delays in finalising the financial statements for 2016 due to changes in senior personnel, restructuring of the organisation and knock-on impact from the delays in 2015.

It is the National College of Art and Design.  It has a clear audit opinion, but attention is drawn to procurement issues, a number of governance issues - the college was not in full compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies - the board&rsquo;s decision to discontinue a human resources management project resulting in a waste of public money amounting to &euro;138,000, and the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset of &euro;87 million, which is the standard for universities and third level institutions.  We will write to the National College of Art and Design asking it to explain why it discontinued a project it had spent &euro;138,000 on, with no benefit to the organisation or the public for that outlay, and also to deal with the governance issues, including its non-compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  We will ask for a specific note from the organisation to explain that.  Has the Comptroller and Auditor General received its accounts for 2017?</p></speech>

The next item concerns the Educational Research Centre.  It has a clear audit opinion.  The deferred pension assets issue is noted again.  It is also noted that the board did not carry out a review of the effectiveness of systems of internal control, which will be noted in the set of financial statements.</p> <p>  The next item concerns the Higher Education Authority, which is the statutory funding body for higher education.  Its turnover is &euro;1.2 billion.  It is on our work programme and we will be dealing with it shortly.  It has a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The next item concerns the 2017 accounts of Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh.  It has a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to the deferred pension asset - the same issue affecting all universities - payments where the procurement procedures employed did not comply with public procurement guidelines, and omission from a disclosure about severance of a payment of &euro;91,000 to a staff member in respect of a period of non-attendance treated incorrectly as sabbatical leave.

They are published and are available through the Oireachtas too.  The next item is the 2017 accounts of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, which have been given a qualified audit opinion.  The financial statements give a true and fair picture except that the cost of superannuation entitlements is accounted for as they become payable rather than in the year they are earned.  The same issue arises with all of the health bodies.</p> <p>  The Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim ETB 2016 accounts are given a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to delays in the production of the financial statements.  This is the 2016 account-----</p></speech>

The finance committee met just once during the year and there was no review by the board of the effectiveness of the system of internal financial control.</p> <p>  The 2016 account for Dundalk Institute of Technology received a qualified audit opinion.  The financial statements give a true and fair view except that the group income for 2015-2016 has been materially overstated.  Contrary to accounting standards, the institute has recognised &euro;812,000 that should be treated as a prior period adjustment as current income but the end of August 2016 financial position is not affected.  Attention is also drawn to non-recognition of pension costs and liabilities and a material level of non-compliance with public procurement rules.  The issue with the &euro;812,000 relates to whether it should have been accounted for in one year or another.  It is in there now-----</p></speech>

However, attention is drawn to a payment of &euro;853,000 made to the Revenue Commissioners in 2017 in respect of the misclassification of a number of employees for PRSI purposes between 1997 and 2011.  We will have to write to Donegal ETB on this matter, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention.  Did that &euro;853,000 include interest and penalties?

That letter will be noted and published and we will discuss the issue with the OPW next week.

That is arising from the press statement by the HEA's chief executive, Dr. Graham Love, that he is stepping down.  We agreed in private session that we would invite Dr. Love to attend to assist the committee in its work in the education area.  We also agreed to invite Mr. Michael Horgan, the chairman of the HEA and the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills to that meeting.  The Secretary General has come before us previously with the chief executive but given the fact that the HEA is in transition in the context of its chief executive, we felt that it was important to invite the chairman of the board to attend as well.  It was agreed to proceed on that basis and to contact those concerned as soon as possible to give them sufficient notice in respect of that meeting.</p> <p>  In private session, we also agreed to have a private meeting with a person who has made a protected disclosure regarding the Irish Prison Service.</p></speech>

It will keep all members informed by email.</p> <p>  As already stated, we are going to arrange a private meeting as soon as possible with a person who made a protected disclosure.  We also had a discussion in private session earlier on Dr. Gabriel Scally's report.  The Joint Committee on Health is meeting Dr. Scally and the HSE on 10 October.  The clerk to this committee will liaise with the clerk to the Joint Committee on Health regarding any matters that arise which may be of significance to us, such as, for example, contracts, contract management, procurement and so forth.  We also agreed that we will deal specifically with the State Claims Agency regarding how claims are being dealt with, whether through mediation or in court.  We will get an update on that as soon as possible.  We will also get updates after the Joint Committee on Health meets next week.  Essentially, the health committee is doing work on this and there is a role for us too.  We will try to ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication.</p></speech>

We will see how we get on.  In terms of general ideas for the work programme, we have agreed meetings for 11 October and 18 October.  On 25 October, we will be dealing with matters relating to housing.  We will be meeting representatives from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government solely in connection with housing.</p><p>As part of that issue we are going to bring in representatives of the Irish Council for Social Housing, the umbrella group for approved housing bodies, AHBs.  Most of the funding is now being channelled through approved housing bodies.  It is very clear from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that there is no statutory regulation of housing bodies.  I think he said the Department cannot confirm how many houses have been built by approved housing bodies.  There is a lacuna of information.</p></speech>

I think nearly &euro;1 billion has been spent by local authorities on house acquisitions in the past seven years.  Are we going to structure the day in order to deal with the various issues?  Otherwise, we could go all over the place.</p></speech>

We all know who the approved housing bodies are.  Essentially, most Government funding is being channelled through them for house construction and long-term leasing, as opposed to the local authorities.  We will have a major gap if they or their representatives are not in the room.</p> <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection still pays up to &euro;250 million for rent supplement, not to mind the substantial amounts of money being paid in HAP.  The issues are all connected.  Perhaps we will not get everything covered in one meeting.  I would hate to have a discussion here without the approved housing bodies.  If they are the main agents to deliver houses then they must be present.  Perhaps we could leave rent supplement and HAP for another meeting.  I would prefer to start by having everyone present and they can come back if need be.</p></speech>

It could be a case of having a different time for different sections or an agenda and timetable for the meeting.

Such information should be provided to us ahead of the meeting.</p> <p>  In terms of capital construction, we hear a lot of talk about where the possibilities exist for the tens of thousands of homes that could be built.  Could we ask the Department to provide us with tabular information on a county-by-county basis on land in local authority and State ownership, a breakdown of the status of the land in terms of zoning, and if it is part of the land aggregation scheme?  We will need to get the information in good time.  I ask that we would make the request now in order that we can have the information well in advance of the meeting.</p></speech>

HAP is under the remit of the Department.  This year the amount will be &euro;300 million.  The amount doubled this year.  It has gone from &euro;150 million to &euro;300 million.</p> <p>  I read the chapter on the approved housing bodies.  It is clear that there is no statutory regulation of them.  There are many schemes concerning them with names such as  the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, and others that make it difficult to follow.  There are also various types of tenancies.  My understanding is that one got a local authority house or one could seek a house from an approved housing body.  The only distinction in the past is that one could buy out the local authority house but one could never buy out the other one.  Now it seems there are many other distinctions, not least of which is the oversight in relation to AHBs and the absence of security of tenure.  With millions being expended, there are serious issues to be examined.</p> <p>  It should be simple for the city council and the county council in Galway to be able to tell the Department what land they have in their direct ownership, the zoning of it and the plans they have for it.  They should be able to tell us in plain, simple English, and what other public lands are available.  In Galway we have Ceannt Station, where there are 14 acres.  The site has huge potential yet it is being developed by a private person on behalf of CI&Eacute;, with no regard to an overall plan.  The docks are waiting to be taken in charge.  I understand all the other small ports have been taken in charge.  One might ask what relevance that has.  The port has a significant landbank with major potential for housing.  We have the existing land that is under the direct control of the city council and then we have public land under CI&Eacute; or the docks authority.</p></speech>

Could we request the Department to get all 31 local authorities to submit the capital projects they currently have with the Department requiring funding and also what is currently in the pipeline in terms of construction on the ground so that we can get an appraisal of where they are and where they want to be.  We hear consistently about the projects and the funding the Department has provided to all 31 local authorities and the work that is in progress at the moment.  We should be able to get that information by tomorrow.</p></speech>

That is separate.  If we have the Secretary General here we want to get a sense of where the local authorities are at as well.  You might decide to break the meeting into two distinct sections, Chairman.

From my observations, more requests are going to the Department for funding from approved housing bodies than from local authorities.  AHBs are the elephant in the room.</p></speech>

I think what is important is to see what the Department is doing in terms of oversight given the volume of work undertaken by the AHBs and the type of schemes the Department has set up.  That is the most important thing.  Otherwise, we could spend half the day talking to AHBs about their vision and mission rather than oversight and the amount of expenditure.  We should get confirmation that the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency will be represented at the meeting.</p></speech>

The big issue in respect of housing - no one has mentioned it yet even though we mention it every day in this House - is the issue of homelessness.  Do we keep that funding for homelessness?  There is &euro;109 million support for homelessness in 2019.  We cannot do everything on the one day if we want to deal with the construction and all that sort of stuff.  I will list that as an issue in case someone asks why we did not talk about homelessness.  I will ask the secretariat to draft a structured way of dealing with the housing issue.  It will not all happen on that day.  We will have to decide which topics we are dealing with.  I think we will start with house starts and house building.</p> <p>  As everyone knows, the Comptroller and Auditor General issued his report last Friday.  He has chapters on approximately half the Departments and organisations like the Revenue Commissioners.  I make these as suggestions.  We have ongoing things in our work programme.  The issues relating to the Revenue Commissioners need to be examined fairly soon.  There is a chapter on tobacco smuggling, high-wealth individuals' tax liabilities, corporation tax losses, which we dealt with, and PRSI contributions for the self-employed.  There is quite a bit there for the Revenue Commissioners and we can start with them fairly early on in our work programme.</p></speech>

I know it is an historical issue, but we are on the verge of starting another one of these issues with CervicalCheck.  Someone will be here in five or ten years.  I want to interrogate the Department.  We want to know at the end of that process what lessons were learned to prevent some of these major scale issues arising again.  We have not seen evidence that they worked.  I want to address that issue because it is such a big issue.  The State Claims Agency's handling of the CervicalCheck issues is on our work programme.</p> <p>  For the next meeting members should indicate if they want any particular issue from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to be discussed early.

Today, we will be dealing with Teagasc's financial statements for 2016 and 2017.  We are joined by Professor Gerry Boyle, director, and Mr. Tom Doherty, chief operations officer.  The representative from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is Dr. Kevin Smyth.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the public Gallery to turn off all mobile phones.  That means switching them to aeroplane mode.  Switching them to silent mode is not sufficient because they can still interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and he or she continues to so do, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>We will start by taking the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement.</p></speech>

Its primary function is to provide education, training, advisory and research services to the agriculture and food industries and to rural communities.</p> <p>  The Teagasc financial statements before the committee this morning relate to 2017.  They are consolidated statements incorporating the results of the Teagasc subsidiary Moorepark Technology Limited, in which the authority has a majority shareholding.  The financial statements record total income of &euro;183 million.  Over three quarters of Teagasc's income is accounted for by direct Oireachtas grants.  The bulk of the remainder comprises advisory service and course fee income, research grants and commissions, and trading income from Teagasc's own farming operations, including the sale of livestock.</p> <p>  The authority's expenditure for 2017 totalled &euro;178 million, and is detailed in notes 7 and 8 to the financial statements.  As the figure in the presentation indicates, pay, pensions and other staff costs accounted for two thirds of the expenditure.  Other expenditure related to Teagasc's operations, including depreciation, amounted to &euro;50 million or 28% of the total.  Grants of various kinds accounted for &euro;10.2 million, or 6%.  The operating surplus for the year was just over &euro;5 million.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the financial statements for 2017.  However, I drew attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control regarding expenditure in 2017 of &euro;1.35 million where the procurement procedures employed did not comply with public procurement guidelines.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note the presentation with the financial statements of a governance statement and authority members' report.  Presentation of a report of this kind is a requirement from 2017 for all State bodies operating under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As well as describing the governance structures in place in Teagasc, the governance statement includes additional information about expenditure on consultancy and legal services, travel and subsistence costs incurred, and spending on staff and corporate hospitality.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#O00600"><p>I welcome this opportunity to present a brief opening statement to the committee.  The Teagasc mandate, as set out in the 1988 Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, comprises three components, namely, "to provide or procure educational, training, and advisory services in agriculture"; "to obtain and make available to the agricultural industry the scientific and practical information in relation to agriculture required by it"; and "to undertake, promote, encourage, assist, co-ordinate, facilitate and review agricultural research and development (including research and development in relation to food processing and the food processing industry)."</p> <p>  In regards to governance, the Teagasc authority is accountable to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and is responsible for ensuring good governance through setting strategic objectives and targets and by taking strategic decisions on all key business issues.  The day-to-day management, control and direction of Teagasc are the responsibility of the director and the senior management team.</p> <p>  Teagasc fully adheres to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and adheres to all circulars emanating from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Teagasc's system of internal control is supported by its audit and risk committee, comprising three authority members, one of whom serves as chair, another is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's representative on the authority and there is also an external member with significant financial and audit expertise.  The audit and risk committee is supported by an internal audit function which reports to it.  The authority's operations committee provides oversight on the effectiveness and efficiency of all Teagasc's administrative functions.</p> <p>  Teagasc maintains regular contact with the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine on administrative and programme matters.  At the end of each year, a business plan for the year ahead is approved by the authority and a oversight agreement, OA, based on this plan is agreed with the Department.  The OA is regularly reviewed by the Department in consultation with Teagasc.  Each year, as required under the 1988 Act, Teagasc also submits a proposed annual programme of activities for review to the Department.  Teagasc also operates a rigorous performance and evaluation system involving external peer reviews of all of its programme as well as the monitoring and tracking of key performance indicators.</p><p>The mission of Teagasc, as adopted by the authority, is to support science-based innovation in the agrifood sector and the wider bioeconomy to underpin profitability, competitiveness and sustainability.  The Teagasc authority has adopted four goals.  These are to improve the competitiveness of agriculture, food and the wider bioeconomy to encourage diversification of the rural economy and enhance the quality of life in rural areas; to support sustainable farming and the environment; and to enhance organisational capability and deliver value for money.</p><p> Teagasc has six operational programmes.  These are animal grassland research and innovation; food research; crops, environment and land use; rural economy and development; advisory and extension; and education and training.  In addition, Teagasc has a central administration service embracing finance, HR, ICT and corporate service functions.  Teagasc is a national organisation with sites distributed throughout every county in the country.  It has 51 advisory offices, which is down from 90 following a recent rationalisation programme.  It also has four colleges of further education and seven research centres.</p><p> In regard to finances, Teagasc is obliged each year to match its expenditure with its income.  It is unique as a non-commercial body in having a relatively large proportion of non-grant-in-aid, GIA, income, some &euro;56 million in 2017.  This non-GIA income comprises grants awarded to Teagasc as a result of success in competitions for research and advisory funds at national and EU level, advisory and education fees, farm operations, industry levies and the sale of various professional services.  In 2017, Teagasc received &euro;125 million grant-in-aid, including &euro;43 million for pensions, to meet its current expenditure needs and a further capital grant of &euro;3.15 million.  Turning to capital requirements, in the absence of access to borrowing facilities, Teagasc faces significant challenges in funding its working capital requirements.  This issue has become more acute in recent years as Teagasc&rsquo;s non-grant-in-aid income has increased significantly.</p><p> Similarly, in the absence of a borrowing facility, longer-term capital funding for our research and educational infrastructure is even more challenging.  Teagasc&rsquo;s grant-in-aid earmarks a relatively small amount of funding for infrastructural purposes which is only sufficient to partially cover maintenance costs and undertake some minor capital works.  More substantial infrastructural needs are funded as the opportunity arises through the sale of assets that are no longer programme priorities, or through once-off special capital grants from Government.  Reliance on asset sales as a funding mechanism is not a sustainable basis on which to fund ongoing infrastructural needs.  While the availability of special capital grants is welcome, the process results in an episodic funding schedule.</p><p> Teagasc received an unqualified audit certificate in 2017, but the Comptroller and Auditor General did draw attention to some procurement issues.  Teagasc is making every effort to be as fully compliant as possible in regard to its procurement practices.  Significant improvement in procurement procedures has been implemented in recent years through the recruitment of specialist staff and the development of robust systems.  It should be noted that procurement in Teagasc is complex due to our diversified activities and the geographical dispersal of our sites.  The issues reported in the financial statements were discovered and brought to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General by Teagasc.</p><p> In the main, the reported matters were due to two factors.  The first was quotes being sought from a number of local suppliers rather than advertising through eTenders.  We are satisfied that this did not adversely impact value for money, given the number of quotes sought and the type of services procured.  The second factor was the extension of existing contracts for services where the requirement was being reviewed, where there were delays in the implementation of the Office of Government Procurement process or where a similar service had been procured from that supplier.  While no breaches can be tolerated, it is noted that the breaches amounted to tender values of &euro;1.35 million out of a total expenditure of &euro;42 million, or 3.2%.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions but I might not take 20 minutes as I have to go to another meeting.  The operating surplus for last year was reduced by almost &euro;3 million year on year.  Will Professor Boyle give the committee an indication of why that is the case?  The advisory fees have gone up considerably in the same period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#P00400"><p>I thank Deputy Deering.  The first point I will explain about the operating surplus is that Teagasc does not aim ever to have a surplus.  We are obliged to match expenditure with income.  The second point is that attention should be focused on the surplus for the financial year, which is lower down the column on the page Deputy Deering is referring to, under note 11.  The surplus declined from &euro;6.152 million to &euro;2.398 million.  There is a simple reason for that.  We do not expect, normally, to have a surplus, but in recent years we have had significant difficulty in trying to manage cashflow.  We sought leave to put in place an overdraft facility but permission was not forthcoming from our parent Department or from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The decision was taken then to try to build up a capital reserve to be able to meet our recurrent capital requirements on a sustainable basis.  In 2016, we were able, through prudent management, to generate such a surplus.  I want to emphasise that would not be the norm-----</p></speech>

We felt that was a prudent thing to do because we were quite concerned about our ability to manage cashflow in a prudent way.  The Department did support us in this respect.  In 2017, because this is an opportunistic type of activity, the same opportunity did not generate itself because of demands on current expenditure.  The &euro;2.398 million surplus is broken down roughly between &euro;1 million from the capital side of our activities - we did not spend as much as we thought we would on capital - and the other &euro;1.83 million from the current budget side.  In summary, it is unusual to have any surplus but there is a reason we have a surplus.  Whenever we have the opportunity over the next couple of years, we want to build that up to probably a significantly higher sum given the nature of our activities-----</p></speech>

To be honest, I would far prefer to be able to use a fund like this for long-term capital investment because we have serious infrastructural deficits in the organisation.  At the same time, we are being prudent in wanting to ring-fence a fund to ensure we can meet our recurrent capital requirements.  An example would be that much of the time when we get income, we incur the costs of those activities before we get paid for them.  It can also take a long time to recover moneys on projects where we have spent resources.  We have a very clear cashflow issue and that is the basis of the surplus.</p></speech>

The authority committee makes a recommendation to the full authority and if it is adopted by the full authority it has to be approved by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We are going to recover the full cost of our activities because much of our advisory activity is classified as public good activity.</p><p> In recent years the Government has put out tenders for the delivery of some large schemes, such as GLAS, which underlines the growth in external income to a significant extent.  We competed to provide that service and that generates a large amount of income on top of the charges we impose on farmers.</p></speech>

I do not have the percentage but we can supply it to the Deputy.  The audit committee makes a determined effort to recover all bad debts, and we only write a debt off when we have reached the end of the road.  We wrote off &euro;113,000 in 2017.  That is across 12 advisory regions.  We have 45,000 clients so, while no write-off is acceptable, in the context of the overall income generated by our advisory fees of close to &euro;12 million it is not an entirely bad figure.</p></speech>

The process involves various committees of the authority, which then decides whether to proceed.  The key issue is to ensure appropriate value is obtained and this has to be sanctioned by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The decision to dispose of any property is not taken lightly and we always ensure any land to be sold is not a programme priority for Teagasc.</p></speech>

In 2017, Teagasc made a loss of &euro;192,000 in the disposal of assets and it was over &euro;1 million in the previous year.

Teagasc undertook a rationalisation programme in the period up to 2012 and 2013 and we identified a number of properties to be sold.  These were mainly advisory offices, of which we had 91 in 2010 but have now sold off around 40.  The rationalisation plan concluded that we could accommodate all our research requirements at that time at our Ashtown site so the Kinsealy site, which had been used for horticultural research purposes, was earmarked for closure.  We migrated all our staff from Kinsealy to Ashtown and we are now in the process of selling the site, though we have not yet commenced the process.  We have secured professional advice on how to maximise value to the State.</p></speech>

We have had an initial valuation, without planning permission, of &euro;12 million.  We would like to retain all the proceeds of the sale for investment in our infrastructural requirements, which are many, but that is a matter to be determined by our parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We certainly hope they will accept the logic of our position, because other than once-off grants we do not have recourse to any funds other than the proceeds of such sales.

My colleagues, in Teagasc and in the universities, have identified a number of measures relating to mitigation, sequestration and the replacement of fossil fuels by renewables such as biomass.</p><p>We have identified nearly 30 individual measures that, if adopted, could significantly address the likely targets under the EU effort sharing agreement by 2030.</p></speech>

Is there a public relations job to be done by Teagasc, the Department and all farming organisations in order to highlight what has been done?  While much has been done in the whole sector, this issue is coming at us at 100 miles an hour.  We have targets to meet which we will not meet in the short term but will in the long term.  Is there a need for a public relations campaign to be waged by Teagasc to enlighten and inform what has been and can be done?</p></speech>

We are involved on several fronts on environmental enhancement and improvement.  For example, there is a huge appreciation in the agricultural sector that concerns over water quality have to be dealt with.  The Deputy is correct in suggesting the same appreciation does not extend at this point in time to climate change because the visibility is not there.  We have been working closely with Bord Bia trying to generate visibility among the farming community as to the consequences and potential solutions to mitigate climate change.</p> <p>  For example, we have introduced the concept of the carbon navigator which is widely regarded across Europe as being an innovative device which indicates to farmers how normal practices can improve efficiency and the environmental footprint.  In other words, there is a win-win, which is positive.  Our plan for the next year is to build on that and on the publication, which I mentioned earlier, with regard to mitigation options in order to build a whole campaign around driving sustainability on farms.</p> <p>  We are also discussing with our parent Department where that can be extended in terms of policy.  There has to be a suite of incentives for farmers to adopt some of the measures we have identified.  For example, there are two clear quick wins.  We have suggested a significant mitigation option on farming is to replace calcium ammonium nitrates with stabilised urea which can address nitrates oxide emissions, as well as the problem with ammonia, an important area to which we have been drawing attention.  We think that is a wider problem beyond agriculture and is probably not as fully appreciated.  The spreading of slurry is a critical mechanism to reduce emissions.  We are looking at various technologies such as injection systems, trailing shoes and so on.  Farmers will have to be informed and incentives will probably have to be put in place to ensure those technologies are adopted.</p></speech>

I have gone on record in public that there is an incompatibility between the trajectory for cow numbers and our greenhouse gas obligations by 2030.  Teagasc, along with the Department and other bodies researching this area, has identified mitigation and sequestration options.  They will not be sufficient to offset the trajectory in terms of cow numbers.  That is the reality and has to be faced up to.  The Deputy made the point about awareness, the importance of identifying the problem in the first instance and then coming up with solutions.  That is a dilemma for the industry.</p></speech>

It was to establish a farm that could be sustainable in economic terms at a relatively low cost.  It has been immensely successful in that respect.  We have established several discussion groups - this is the role of the Moorepark officers on the farm - of young people who have come into dairying for the first time.  They are enabled through the model to put together the investment needed.</p> <p>  We are conscious of the importance of communicating full information on the operation of the farm, the successes and the failures.  Most recently, during Storm Emma, there were concerns around several animal deaths.  Two cows and six calves died during that storm.  We have commissioned a review, carried out by the former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, along with the other partners in the project.  We are awaiting finalisation of that review.  Lessons will certainly be learned in terms of the model and managing an extreme event like that into the future.</p></speech>

It has been useful as a demonstration facility for other farms because it is a full-cost model.  For example, all of the labour and land are fully costed.  There is no other entity that has that financial data.  It is not available in a normal farming situation.  The farm was also affected by the drought to a significant degree.

For example, the famous Curtins Farm in Moorepark is leased.  The land on the agricultural colleges, such as the 158 ha we own at Kildalton college, is primarily used for educational projects and the training of students.  However, we have taken the decision in recent years to also locate significant research projects on all of our college farms.  For example, we have a major project on the way at Clonakilty agricultural college on the use of clover in rye grass swards which has been generating really interesting results of international significance.  On the Kildalton site we have what we call a sustainable farm.  It is early days, but our intention there is to establish a farm that meets the full spectrum of demanding sustainability requirements but is commercial.  That is a research project.  For several years we have had a research programme under way at Ballyhaise college on dairying in the region.  That project has established that it is possible to generate significant profits in a more challenging landscape than Moorepark.  Our plan has been to have a research programme under way in the colleges.</p></speech>

All the meat research that Teagasc does is located in Ashtown.  We work very closely with the Grange production research facility on beef.  It is also the centre for our horticulture activity.  We recently invested in state-of-the-art glasshouses.  We also use the site for our education programmes, as an adjunct to our horticulture education facility at the National Botanic Gardens.  It is also the location of Meat Technology Ireland.

We did a survey around June that showed a 30% fodder deficit.  I think that is where the Deputy's figure comes from.  We carried out a new survey more recently, and there was significant improvement between the first and the second surveys.  The first one showed an average deficit of about 30%, though of course there is a range of results.  The second survey showed an average deficit of about 12%.</p></speech>

This is our best available information.  It is given completely independently.  We believe that is the situation and it has improved.  In fact, a lot of farmers plan to graze for a lot longer this year if the weather holds up.  Having said all of that, we are very conscious of an enormous range.  One thing that I found travelling around the country this year is a huge variation on this very small island between the western seaboard, from Clare right up to Donegal - I made a trip along that line - and the south-east of the country, particularly Wexford, parts of Kilkenny and parts of my own county of Tipperary.</p><p>The challenge is to help farmers to manage a difficult situation that some will find themselves in over the winter.  We have clear sets of protocols in place to help farmers stretch the fodder in the drying off period.  We believe that with careful and proper management farmers can get through the winter.  That is our view.</p><p> I am quite concerned that this is unlikely to be a once-off event because one of the predictions of climate change is that these kinds of episodes will be more frequent and when they occur they will be more severe.  We are sitting down with our research colleagues and asking how we need to adjust the recommendations around the farm model, which is most resilient, given the expectation that these events will be more frequent.</p></speech>

Are we pushing farmers to the limits, especially in the dairy industry where we have too much stock and not enough capacity?  This applies in particular in the context on climate change, the weather we are having now and the changes in the seasons.  Are we pushing too much without thinking about the consequences?  It is alright having 300 or 400 cows but is Teagasc worried that farmers will have enough fodder to ensure viability?</p></speech>

There are fewer cows - less livestock - in the country now than there were in the late 1990s.  That is a reality.  Clearly what has happened is that expansion has taken place over a very short period of time, particularly in the dairy farms, in certain areas.  Sometimes Teagasc is criticised unfairly - and the Deputy might say that I would say that - for advocating an unsustainable expansion strategy.  We did nothing of the kind.  Time and again, we told farmers to look to their own farm gate first and improve their efficiency before increasing their cow numbers.  That message does not always get across, especially in a rapidly changing situation where farmers who may have been used to providing fodder for 50, 60 or 70 cows took a chance and doubled their cows over a couple of years.  We say to these farmers that it is time to pull back and look at improving their grassland.  The Deputy will be aware that we still have the situation where the average utilisation of grass on dairy farms is only 7 tonnes per ha.  With PastureBase Ireland we can track grass growth all over the country so we know that capacity is double that figure.</p></speech>

We can double grass production on most farms and PastureBase Ireland has demonstrated that.  We have a Grass 10 programme, which is a four-year programme supported by the Minister and a number of other private companies are involved.  We are focusing all our efforts around efficiency but if a farmer, clearly, is not capable of generating the efficiencies in grass production for the stock on his or her farm, that is not a sustainable position.  That is the clear message we are trying to send out.  I admit it can be difficult at times to get that message across.</p></speech>

The amount that is realised from a suckler-to-beef herd for a livelihood makes it hard to survive.  What research is done on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.322" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#T00700"><p>The Deputy is absolutely right.  Without the basic payment scheme, farmers could not survive on the income levels from suckler farming.  According to the Teagasc national farm survey, the typical family income from a suckler farm is about &euro;10,000.  That mainly involves the basic payment to the farmer.  Clearly there is a viability issue.  When one analyses the problem it is not difficult to explain why it is at that level.  There is quite a spread of people engaged in suckler farming.  Very few of them would be full-time, commercial type farmers.  Many of these farmers are older people who perhaps are stepping down from a career in dairy farming or the fattening of animals and they like to be involved in farming.  A lot of them are part-time farmers whose livelihood is not dependent on the income from their suckler enterprise.  It is, therefore, a very challenging area.  There is no escaping the fact that this has not happened today or yesterday.  I am in this business a fair long time now at this stage, and we have always had this problem within the suckler industry.  The fattening sector is a little better but it is highly variable.  The suckler industry, however, has a huge difficulty.</p> <p>  Teagasc tries to emphasise that we can have a win-win pathway for dry stock farmers from dairy, but it will take a while for a mindset change.  There are huge opportunities, for example, for dry stock farmers who are expert at managing cattle and herding to rear young animals.  There is already a small number of farmers engaging in that and they are doing very well.  We also believe there are opportunities for farmers to fatten animals coming off the dairy herd, which was much more common prior to the dairy quota.  There are far fewer animals coming off the dairy herd, for example, beef animals, than we had before the dairy quota.  There are opportunities there and rather than this false antagonism between dairy and the rest, we should be trying to see how income earning opportunities can be complemented as dairying is moving forward.</p></speech>

Those rearing continental breeds, especially the Charolais breeders, say the genomics scheme is destroying the animal because people are choosing small lean animals of between 22 months and 24 months for beef as opposed to the big, honest animals of years ago.  This is especially the case with continental breeds.  What is Professor Boyle's general opinion of the scheme and the research on it?</p></speech>

Alongside the improvements in efficiencies of grassland use, the second biggest area where we have made substantial advances in the agriculture sector has been in the breeding of animals.  We can see the huge benefits in the dairy industry by promoting the economic breeding index, EBI.  The difficulty when it comes to the beef animals is that the group is much more heterogeneous in terms of types of breeds and so on.  The principle, however, is the same.  The beef data and genomics scheme provides us with the hard information to enable us to improve the efficiency of the breeding indices.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that breeding is the one area where there is most discussion, and it is very often emotional and, at times, virulent.  The science is very clear.  The breeding index is based on science.  It is not based on the look of an animal.  While it will take longer, the beef data and genomics scheme is the pathway towards improving the quality of the beef herd.</p></speech>

Does Professor Boyle believe that we are ready for Brexit?  We do not know what will happen with regard to Brexit but how is Ireland's agriculture community prepared?  Brexit will have a bigger effect on the agriculture community than on any other sector in Ireland.  Are we prepared for it or will there be serious consequences arising from whatever outcome emerges from Brexit?</p></speech>

With regard to Teagasc's responsibilities, we work very closely with the Department and with Bord Bia in particular.  Our responsibility relates to the innovation agenda.  We have a capability in our economic division and we also have a responsibility around analysing the economic impacts of Brexit as it affects the dairy sector.  Teagasc was the first to produce a comprehensive analysis two years ago on the impact of the so-called hard Brexit option.  We are all aware of the devastating consequences it would have.</p><p>In terms of actions to combat Brexit, we have been focusing on identifying opportunities for innovation.  If there is to be a silver lining in Brexit, it will be the opportunities presented and the drive to market diversification, which is positive.  Most of the markets being identified are outside of Europe.</p></speech>

As members will be aware, a number of companies are building and expanding facilities in the UK.  We are interested in the potential that lies in Asian markets, particularly south east Asia.  This will require innovation.  The example I always give is the outlook for cheddar.  We are hugely dependent on the UK market in this regard in that 70% of our cheddar exports are to the UK.  The Irish and the British like cheddar but the continentals do not.  While other cheeses can be produced on a cheddar platform, we are working with a number of companies to identify a cheese that could be built off a cheddar platform which would be of interest to the Chinese consumer.  That is a long haul.  Hopefully, we will have a sufficiently long transition period to enable us to bring forward these new products.</p> <p>  The farmer is in a more difficult position in that he or she cannot relocate the farm to the UK.  Insofar as we can be of assistance, we are advising farmers to promote, develop and implement efficiency on their farms.</p></speech>

Does Teagasc provide courses on farm safety and what initiatives has it put in place to try to stop these unfortunate tragedies occurring?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.331" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018100400002#U00500"><p>Farm safety is the remit of our advisory service.  We do a significant volume of research on the causes of farm accidents, focusing not only on mortality rates but farmer health in general.  We have a specialist adviser dedicated to farm safety.  This person is responsible for training Teagasc advisers throughout the country, of which we have approximately 280, on the latest thinking in regard to reducing accidents on farms.  This person also ensures farm safety is on the agenda of all discussion groups on a regular basis.  We are in the process of recruiting a second specialist because we think the workload has become too onerous for one specialist.  This person also works in collaboration with our frontline advisers.  Everything we do on farm safety is in partnership with the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  We work hand in glove with the HSA to deliver our annual farm safety course.  Farmers sign up for this course.  Along with the HSA, we have identified that awareness is one thing but getting farmers to do the things they know they should be doing is the challenge.  For this reason, we have undertaken research to identify the underlying behaviour that causes a man or woman to do something on the farm that he or she knows is hazardous.</p> <p>  There is particular concern at the moment with regard to elderly farmers.  Unfortunately, a lot of the tragic accidents in recent times involved elderly farmers, some of them aged 80 plus, overturned tractors and livestock.  The reason for this is, we think, pretty obvious.  Many young people are taking up jobs off-farm and leaving management of the farm to their elderly relatives.  This is an area on which we intend to increase our focus.  We also work closely with the Department and other bodies such as the FBD Trust, which has a major farm safety programme, and the committees within the farm organisations.  We have been talking about this issue for a long time.  Unfortunately, the statistics are still moving in the wrong direction.  I do not know the answer.</p></speech>

First, there was an improvement in subsistence rates, which had been fixed for a number of years, and this accounts for a significant part of the increase.  Second, we have additional staff.  All of our travel and subsistence is driven by activity levels on farms.  Owing to the fodder situation, we have been engaging in more on-farm visits, which gives rise to additional expenses.  While we have 45,000 clients, when it comes to fodder advice we give that to non-clients as well, which is another additional cost.</p> <p>  As regards the foreign trips-----</p></speech>

On foot of the President's visit there last year, it was felt that Teagasc might be able to advise on how farmers could be helped to transition from the FARC-dominated violence in some of the regions.  Many of the other trips are directly related to research.  Teagasc is involved in research all over the world, but substantially in Europe.  We are also involved in joint research projects.  For example, we might win a project from the European Union in respect of which there would be partners in other countries and we would have to meet up them, or meet in Brussels.  A lot of our activity is increasingly international, which is another factor in terms of cost.  I assure the Deputy that every item of expenditure is rigorously assessed.  When an increase arises, the audit committee reviews the reasons for it.</p></speech>

No, I take that back.  I will leave it for the Minister.  I just highlight it because we had discussions earlier, though not today, about this in the context of value for money.  Gender balance will clearly bring more value for money.  There are many studies about that.  I will leave that.</p> <p>  With regard to governance, I congratulate the witnesses on a clean audit, which is good.  Is the audit and risk committee established and sitting?</p></speech>

I was in the west of Ireland all day on Monday.  It was a tale of neglect.  We met from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. with various groups and co-operatives.  Their words were that they feel they are forgotten.</p> <p>  Teagasc's documents are good.

The most important driver of rural development, in our view, is having viable family farms.  That filters down into the rural community, if we can establish solid income-earning farms.  That is the first requirement.  That part of the world is similar to where I live.  I live in a relatively remote and challenging area.  We would emphasise the work that we do on sheep production there.  We have an active programme under way involving both research at our site in Athenry, which we try to promulgate the messages from, and what we call a better sheep programme, an advisory programme which involves selecting a number of farms around the country that can demonstrate how commercial sheep production can be enhanced.  Similarly, with beef, I committed to establishing a beef demonstration farm in the west.  We have located one in Athenry for a number of years.  That demonstrates to farmers in those regions how they can improve their income-earning activity.  On top of that, a big part of this programme relates to succession planning and assisting farmers in moving the farm from one generation to the next.</p></speech>

A better way for me to deal with this may be to pursue it afterwards and talk to the Teagasc officials because I will run out of time.  I have not used up my time but I am conscious that two more speakers are due to contribute.</p><p>The perception on the ground from people in some rural areas is that they are being forgotten, and I wonder whether Teagasc could take a proactive approach towards that.  I may come back to that because I want to deal with a number of practical things along with climate change.  I am looking at the mitigation plan and I am heartened by what Professor Boyle said about the trajectory of dairy farming being contradictory to the aims that we need to meet under climate change.

Has a team been set up in Teagasc on climate change to monitor the targets set out in the mitigation plan?  I looked at Teagasc's annual statement and Brexit got two pages.  Brexit is very important but it has opportunities associated with it as well as risks.  We are in serious trouble with climate change, however, and there is only half of a page on it in Teagasc's report.

I may have picked him up wrong but Professor Boyle said earlier that climate change is not visible.  It is very visible.  We see it practically every day.

If the other speakers are going to look at these details, I will stop and let them do so.  There was a big jump between 2016 and 2017 in financial charges.  It went from &euro;95,000 up to &euro;439,000.  Will the witnesses clarify those financial charges for me?</p></speech>

On the grants to private colleges on note 28 which is on page 94 as well, will the witnesses explain that to me?  There are three colleges, one of which is in my county although Mountbellew is not in my area.  Will the witnesses explain the rationale behind that?</p></speech>

There is Gurteen College, the Salesians run the Salesian Agricultural College in Pallaskenry, and the Franciscans run the Mountbellew Agricultural College.  They provide educational courses on behalf of Teagasc in their communities and therefore Teagasc is required to subvent a substantial number of the staff at those colleges.  We also second staff there who are on our payroll, but that is a separate matter.  Additionally, we are required to assist in the maintenance of those facilities insofar as we can because the entities in question do not have the resources.  We supply a small amount of funding every year to help with basic maintenance.  These are a very important resource to Teagasc in delivering education throughout the country-----</p></speech>

Going forward, how sustainable is it to sell assets to fund daily operations?  He said that "this fund will be ring-fenced and only used as we need it".  That seems to me to be contradictory so perhaps Professor Boyle might clarify what he meant by that.</p> <p>  On the wage bill where two thirds of the budget goes on pay and pensions, I understand that it is not the same model as any business but could someone outline how this compares internationally, perhaps with the United Kingdom equivalent?  Is it normal to have two thirds of the total spend going on pensions and wages?</p> <p>  On the 18,000 ha of land owned by Teagasc, will someone tell me what percentage of that is in forestry?  Is that managed by Coillte or Teagasc?</p> <p>  One of the speakers asked about who decided what assets to sell.  We did not get an answer on that.  We were talking about the Kinsealy site.  Who prioritised what lands should be disposed of in that rationalisation programme and is there a list of those assets anywhere?</p> <p>  On the fodder crisis, in relation to which we have had a number of incidents in the past year, many of the EU directives refer to farming by calendar.  During the summer at the start of the good weather in July, in areas of Ireland such as the west and the midlands, many farmers wanted to cut hay early.  As it turned out the weather stayed good longer than anticipated and it all worked out well in the end.  Will Professor Boyle give his view on the wisdom of farming by calendar while on the other hand speaking about erratic climate incidents?  It does not make sense to me that on the one hand there are rigid timeframes for cutting silage or hay or spreading slurry and then on the other hand to say that weather changes and it is unlikely to be a one-off, as one of the witnesses said earlier.  If we look to the future of farming, that incident caused a lot of stress to farmers over the summer months because they were worrying about the winter ahead of their animals.</p><p>Is there anything the professor can suggest that we can do to mitigate some of that concern and worry?</p><p> The professor said - maybe I misinterpreted him - that most farms could double their grass output, which would obviously offset a fodder incident.  Could he give us some examples of how he is getting down to the grassroots farmers?  I am sure it is like anything in that it is probably those who need it the most do not engage in the process.  Could the professor speak to that?</p><p> On the six research facilities, I would imagine that these facilities do a lot of work with disease control and testing.  Do these facilities do testing for other countries?  What I am getting at here is how prepared those research facilities are for Brexit.  Can Professor Boyle elaborate on the cross-Border and UK relationships in this respect?</p></speech>

This is for managing cashflow.  We do not spend these resources on current expenditure.  It is simply to manage the gap between the timing of doing the work and getting the income in.  That is the problem we have.  A company in this situation would normally have overdraft facilities.  We do not have overdraft facilities.</p></speech>

At present, this is the only way we see of doing that.<br/><br/>As to the question on pay and pensions, I do not have the comparable figure for international organisations, but my strong view would be, from my knowledge of these organisations, that we are very similar.  A research organisation is people-heavy, so to speak.  All our research staff would be at PhD level, so there would tend to be on higher grade salaries relative to the rest of the public sector.  I do not have the data at present, but bodies like Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, INRA, or Scotland's Rural College, SRUC, Rothamsted in the UK or any of these bodies would have a very similar structure.<br/><br/>On the forestry area, we do not have that information, but I will get that for the committee.  We have forests on a lot of our sites.  In Moorepark, we have a small forest area around the periphery on the Dungarvan-Lismore Road, and significant forestry in Oak Park.  The Deputy is probably aware that a number of years ago the Teagasc authority, with the consent of the Government, handed over a forest and lake area for recreational purposes to the people of Carlow.  There is about 50 ha involved in that, but we also have forest on site.  We have forest in Ballyhaise and in Johnstown Castle.  We conduct a certain amount of research on those activities.  We can extract that figure for the Deputy, by site.<br/><br/>On the question of who decides to sell the assets, the process is well set out.  During the rationalisation programme that issue obviously came to a head.  The management proposed a series of criteria by which assets would be sold.  We were dealing with a particular challenging period in the financial history of the country, so there was an absolute necessity to rationalise, which was the context.  Management proposed a series of criteria on which, for example, an advisory office would be closed.  As one might expect, that included the usage of the office the farmers in the hinterland and the state and age of the office and so on.  Then, the authority adopted these criteria, following consultation, and we came forward with a list of properties that were deemed suitable to sell.  The authority decided <i>en bloc</i>and stuck with that decision.  Given the number of offices we have around the country, it is a very difficult thing to sell even one office.  By having a set of criteria, we managed to get buy-in for the entire suite of rationalisation, including the sale of the Kinsealy offices.  That was the basis and it had to be approved subsequently by the Ministers.<br/><br/>The Deputy raised a very difficult question on farming by calendar.  The popular view among some farmers is that we should move to farming by calendar. One might think that is the sensible way to go.  My colleagues, when they have looked at this, found that it can give rise to unexpected implications.  It is not as straightforward as it might seem.  I believe that the current system, while it has disadvantages, is useful.  This year is a good example, where the Minister has been able to exercise flexibility in how it is implemented.  We have the best of both worlds.  One thing that is very important here is there is at least certainty with the current system.  People know exactly on what day they have to cease spreading slurry and what day they can commence.  That is useful for a lot of people.  If there is a crisis situation, where that does not make sense, one needs the flexibility and, by and large, it has been demonstrated.  There a number of ways one could view that issue.  I do not think it is entirely straightforward.<br/><br/>On the point I made on the potential to grow grass, it is a massive challenge.  It is one our key performance indicators, KPIs, and we track that each year.  We have a trend now.  While there has been growth in grass utilisation, it has not been as we would have liked.  It has grown over the last three or four years, averaging out the extremes.  It is a huge puzzle because our research colleagues estimate that every extra tonne of grass utilised is worth about &euro;180 per hectare for a dairy farmer and about &euro;105 for a beef farmer.  What are we doing about it?<br/><br/>We have a number of programmes in place in recent years.  We have invested a lot in developing a whole methodology for measuring grass.  On the front of our report, there is a photograph of colleagues engaged in that activity.  We have set up a programme called PastureBase Ireland.  This allows us to track grass growth performance right around of the country.  With that information, we can benchmark.  If one is a farmer in west Tipperary and is interested in what one's colleagues in east Limerick are doing, a comparison can be made with their performance.  Benchmarking has proved to be a useful tool to improve performance.  That data is published regularly and is very much like a weather map and has been very useful in the last year, in particular, in tracking the impact of the fodder situation, because grass growth diminished particularly during the drought.  That is one tool.  This is an example of precision agriculture at work in the dairy sector, in particular, although the technology can be used elsewhere.  We can learn a huge amount from that information.  It is unique worldwide and we are talking to the New Zealanders and the Australians about using that technology.  Hopefully, they will buy it off us.<br/><br/>We also have a programme in place to promote the utilisation of grass more aggressively.  It is called Grass 10 and we are in the second year of a four year programme.  The ten stand for a target of ten tonnes, utilised grass per hectare, which is a little less ambitious than what I said, but it is considered to be a reasonable target.  Ten also stands for the number of grazings that we would advocate farmers to conduct during the season, because there is a high correlation between grazings and production and utilisation.  That is strongly supported by the Department and is also supported by a number of companies.</p><p>The biggest challenge we face as an organisation is to persuade farmers to adopt these kinds of technologies with regard to grass in particular.  I will give the committee an example.  As I said, there are two main technologies that we have been promoting within Teagasc.  One is breeding technology.  There has been huge success in this area as we have been working with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, and the artificial insemination companies.  The adoption of the economic breeding index, EBI, has been very successful, for example.  Grassland faces a massive challenge and we have not yet cracked how we can encourage farmers to make the transition to what is clearly in their interests and what is also very important from an environmental point of view.</p><p> On the Deputy's final question in respect of disease control, we do not have responsibility in that area.  We do have responsibility in respect one dimension or aspect, that of food safety.  We do a lot of research around food safety from our Ashtown site, and we are also the national laboratory for the analysis of residues in meat.  We liaise with the Department regularly in regard to that area.  As far as the general economic diseases are concerned, we work very closely with Animal Health Ireland.  That is where we feature.  We also work closely with the Department in that area.  We have joint programmes under way and we subvent or provide a contribution to the work of Animal Health Ireland to enable it to recruit a technical officer.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I have a few brief questions.  First, I am not impressed that we could not get a detailed explanation for the financial charges in the accounts when we have the head of finance and the chief operations officer before us.  An increase of 362% is substantial.  We should be able to detail that in the accounts.  That disappoints me.  On Teagasc's investment strategy, a part of its model involves doing farm works and advising farmers in organic practices.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I was wondering about how that circle is squared.  I see Teagasc has investments in private companies.  It is an ordinary shareholder in Glanbia, Kerry Group and Lakeland as part of its business model.  Their business models involve selling fertilisers.  Another key part is to sell animal remedies etc.  How does Professor Boyle safeguard his organisation in promoting organic farming when it, in theory, benefits from share dividends and investments in private companies, part of whose business model contradicts organic farming?</p></speech>

We automatically receive shares on foot of that.  It is not that we go out and actively seek to invest in these companies.  It is something-----</p></speech>

To add to and complement that point, we have a number of what we call joint programmes with virtually all the dairy co-ops in the country.  We jointly agree a programme of advisory activity.  We pride ourselves on our independence.  In the contracts we draw up with all of those co-ops, and it arises specifically and directly in the case of what we call the joint programmes, we only agree to a programme of activity which absolutely does not compromise our independence.  Again, the process goes through the internal committee, the advisory and research committee of the organisation.</p></speech>

In no way does that compromise our independence.  I have given the Deputy the example of a situation where, separate to this matter, we have these joint programmes in which we draw up a specific contract with the same co-ops.  These contracts might have regard to improvement in protein on farms, reducing carbon footprint, or whatever else it might be.  The Deputy is right.  It is a challenging issue.  It is very challenging.  It is something we repeatedly discuss at the full authority level.  The question always comes back to me being asked by the chairman or members of the authority whether I am absolutely sure that Teagasc's independence is not compromised.</p></speech>

The vote in the D&aacute;il is on but I will carry on.  Committee members have put their questions and I will ask a few more to complete the process.</p> <p>  Deputy Aylward touched on the issue of fatalities.  Teagasc provides agricultural advice and the farmers are its clients.  I have read the report.  Health and safety is mentioned on page 51, and I know Dr. Jim Phelan has been active in this area, but I do not get a feel from the report that it is a significant priority for Teagasc.  What I mean by this is we know it is a priority but it is not an adequate priority.  On page 51, it states that in 2017 a total of 24 people died in accidents on Irish farms, which was an increase of three on the 2016 number.  To date this year, I believe there have been 16 or 17 farm deaths.  The very next sentence of the report states that Teagasc works with a number of partners to promote health and safety among rural stakeholders.  In the first paragraph on this issue Teagasc outsources much of the issue.  Even though everyone is concerned about this, I get the feeling no one has ownership when it comes to dealing with the problem.  It is a health and safety issue.  If there is a farm death, the Health and Safety Authority conducts the investigation, not Teagasc.</p></speech>

I heard a debate this week in the D&aacute;il from which I understand that many agencies are involved in health and safety.  Various Departments can have a stake in health and safety issues, and I am sure the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a role.  Teagasc has a role, as does the Health and Safety Authority.  I get the feeling that no one is taking full ownership of the issue.  I would have hoped it was Teagasc that did so.  I know that when something goes wrong, we have a statutory body to investigate it.</p> <p>  This point has been touched on a little and I ask Professor Boyle to give us a bit more information on the age profile of those involved in accidents.  All of us who live in rural Ireland have come across the situation of an old man out on his own trying to do what he used to do and do the work of three people.  He is not able to do it and should not be doing it.  We also have five year old children running around behind tractors.  All of these accidents are tragic.  Will Professor Boyle give us an age breakdown of all of the deaths?</p> <p>  Many younger people now work off the farms.  We are all talking about the situation this creates but we are not doing much about it.  A few years ago, I used to meet farmers who would tell me they had never been as well off as they were in the farm retirement scheme.  They had never had as much money in their working lives.  Many of those farms were vulnerable and not viable.  Now I meet farmers in their 70s who tell me they are working harder than they ever did because their sons are trying to hold down a day job.  We have 70 year old farmers out on their own with big machines and big tough animals.  I feel there is a growing risk.  It is a reflection of where we are in rural Ireland at present.  Will Professor Boyle also give us details on how many people involved in accidents were farming on their own at the time?  We have all heard of tragic accidents where a lot of time had elapsed before someone spotted there was a problem.</p> <p>  I am trying to spur on Teagasc to do more in this area.  This is where I am coming from.  I do not get it.  Teagasc has trained its staff through events it has run.  The staff it sends to farms have had training.  Professor Boyle has told us the Teagasc national safety conference took place in Clare last November.  How many farmers attend these events?  Teagasc's staff and consultants, the consultants who do reports for farmers and representatives from some farmers' organisations attend.  We feel bad when farm accidents happen and they are the biggest cause of workplace fatalities in Ireland.  This should not be the case.  Industry has been forced to take quite a step up and I do not think farmers have.  I ask Professor Boyle to reflect, come back and give us a bit more information.  No one is specifically responsible.  This is a plea from rural Ireland to help.  Professor Boyle knows all about this, but I would like a greater emphasis on it.</p> <p>  With regard to Teagasc's financial statements, I always ask a basic question when I do not understand something.  If I do not understand something, I am quite sure I am not alone in that regard.  The Teagasc representatives understand what it means in the financial statements.  The financial statements contain the heading "knowledge transfer", which seems to be a very big source of income and expenditure.  It is a significant part of the accounts.  Teagasc's income also includes operations income, research income and Oireachtas grants, but knowledge transfer is a big part of it.  Will Professor Boyle explain to the people watching this, who are not familiar with Teagasc financial statements, what this is all about?  What does the heading mean?</p></speech>

We are very used to the terminology.  Knowledge transfer activity in Teagasc embraces two divisions.  Our advisory activity, whereby we have offices throughout the country, is one branch.</p><p>We have a dedicated head of that activity.  We also have 284 front-line advisers in the field who are backed up by an administrative support team and so on.  The other branch covers our educational activity.  It comprises the four Teagasc colleges and all of their teachers, technicians and farmer staff.  In recent years we have taken on some contract lecturers because of the big growth in demand for part-time courses.  We generate income on both sides.  Advisory fee income in the accounts last year was &euro;11.8 million.  The figure for educational activity was about &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million.</p></speech>

The figure for Teagasc is down by &euro;3 million.  Can Professor Boyle give me a headline on the divisions in which the loss occurred?  The profit figure decreased from &euro;8 million in 2016 to &euro;5 million.  Does he want to send us a schedule?  He can see my obvious question.

It is programme-driven.  We have rented land form Dairygold because we are rolling out a new programme for next generation dairy herd precision farming.  We fund that activity from a variety of sources.  Much of the time we generate research income that enables us to take on a new programme.  That is often the driver.  We are very careful about the land we rent.  It is a question I ask continually when there a proposal is made.  There has been none in recent years.  Everything has to be programme-driven.  If something makes sense, we will rent.  We own most of our offices, but if there is an area where we have an office or think we need one and it makes more sense to rent rather than commit to a new build, we will rent.</p></speech>

It involves deferred income.  I will try to put it simply because I have only had a quick look at it.  I get the impression that if Enterprise Ireland gives Teagasc a grant of a couple of million to do a job, if Teagasc does the job, the income is recorded in that year.  If Enterprise Ireland gives Teagasc &euro;3 million and it lodges it in its bank account and has to do the work the following year, it holds it as deferred income.  It does not come within current income and is recorded as income in the year Teagasc incurs the expenditure.</p></speech>

I just do not understand how the two work together.  This comes under investments.  On investments, I understand what Deputy Burke said, namely, that Teagasc might have a conflict of interest with shareholding in the co-operatives.  I refer to the figure of &euro;438,000.  It is not major.  Teagasc can always sell its shares.  Let us be clear: farmers can get shares.  They are entitled to sell them if they want.

It was a collaboration between us and the dairy industry.  Not all of those in the dairy industry had joined up and were involved in the shareholding or contributed to the equity of the company at the time.  In the first tranche of activity, I believe Enterprise Ireland was involved as well.  In recent years, we have sought additional investment of &euro;10 million to upgrade the facilities in light of Brexit and everything else, and Enterprise Ireland dropped out.  It is not currently a shareholder.</p></speech>

I had a beautiful walk in the garden, with the branches of the lovely trees hanging down over the lakes.  It is fantastic.  It was my first time there.  The one thing that saddened me was that I went up to the castle and looked inside - as the witnesses know, one can walk right up and look in the windows - and it looked very shabby.  Some of the floorboards were not in great nick.  I did not even do a tour of the grounds.  It would only take a couple of people to tidy it.  I accept that a major renovation may be required and that is almost beyond the scope-----</p></speech>

Teagasc will pass its operation to the Irish Heritage Trust.  Unfortunately, historical buildings never generate money.  They consume far more money than they generate, so Teagasc has agreed to subvent it with a subsidy in the region of &euro;300,000 per year on a sliding scale.  That &euro;300,000 in year 1 will hopefully slide to a small amount in year 10.</p></speech>

Dr. Smyth from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine got off lightly, but that is the way the meeting went.  It is approximately ten years since representatives from Teagasc came before us, so the committee is very happy.  The only reason our guests from Teagasc are here is that, earlier in the year, the committee asked what large, State-funded organisations are out there that have not been before the committee in a while.  There was no other agenda, only a matter of routine because the Committee of Public Accounts had not met Teagasc in so long.  Our guests heard the tone of the questions.  Compared with others, this was a non-confrontational meeting.  The witnesses can take that as a good thing.</p> <p>  I thank everyone from Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Comptroller and Attorney General and his staff for attending.</p></speech>

Last week, the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment stated that he was about to present a consultation paper on how we will meet the new national energy and climate action plan to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, which would be published and a copy of which would be sent to the committee.  The Minister has not received the paper and neither has the committee.  Similarly, we asked in advance of this meeting that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport provide a list of the new projects or initiatives it is considering.  However, the opening statement of Mr. Doyle provided to the committee in advance contains a litany of measures from the national mitigation plan, which is not working, as the Minister admitted.  The public service must recognise that it needs to provide a service to the committee by being absolutely frank and providing such modelling detail in order that we know what are the options.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has done very good work in presenting some of the analysis but it cannot do so effectively without knowing what the Departments are thinking.  Unfortunately, that has been our experience so far and the practice must stop.</p></speech>

I will first address the formalities of the meeting and then allow members to comment on the issues raised by Deputy Eamon Ryan.<br/><br/>I ask members and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the broadcasting service.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Ms Laura Behan, principal officer, and Ms Carol O'Reilly, public transport investment division.  I also welcome Ms Anne Graham, chief executive officer of the National Transport Authority.<br/><br/>Before we commence our formal proceedings, I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>Before I call Mr. Doyle to make his opening statement, I call Deputy Pringle, who wishes to address the issue raised by Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p></speech>

It is clear from the contributions of the witnesses last week that the committee does not figure in how the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment views the work it is doing, which is a very worrying development.  That is no fault of our guests.  The situation may be entirely different in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  However, it is very worrying that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which should be answerable to this committee, may hold that view.  It raises doubts as to what we will be able to achieve if that view is representative of the engagement the committee will have with officialdom.</p></speech>

This is about the tough questions we will have to answer in terms of the recommendations we make from here on.</p><p> In the context of taking us back through everything that has happened, we know all that.  To make use of the time, we can take a lot of what has been provided as read except any new information and detail on how we will close the gap on the transportation side in respect of emissions.  If the witnesses are not prepared for that, I suggest they leave it and return on another day.  We have a tight slot and are trying to get through things.  We do not want to spend a lot of time rehashing where matters stand.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.640" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018100400002#C00900"><p>Ireland faces a considerable task to achieve its national policy ambition of transition to a climate-resilient, low-carbon society by 2050.  The committee has heard much evidence on the extent to which combating climate change is a significant national challenge.  Climate measures and policies chosen today will have consequences for Ireland for decades to come.  This represents an especially significant challenge for the transport sector in Ireland and elsewhere.  The sector must develop approaches to reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.  Ireland's rising population, our welcome return to economic growth, more people in employment and more goods being transported bring with them an increased number of vehicles on our roads and a rise in the number of kilometres driven.  Ireland's economy and society are busy and on the move, which presents the transport sector with various challenges.  Foremost among these is the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an expanding sector without impeding social progress or economic recovery.</p> <p>  Transport is not an end in itself.  It is a means to access jobs, markets, education, health services, cultural interaction and a range of other services and amenities that contribute to people leading healthy and fulfilling lives.  However, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, inventories show a 6% growth in overall non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions in 2016.  Transport emissions grew by 4%.  The progress made in reducing transport emissions by 25% between 2007 and 2012 is being eroded by significant transport demand growth, which, unfortunately, is not yet all being met in the most efficient ways.  Transport emissions are only 6% below the key 2005 benchmark level.  Furthermore, EPA projections indicate that, without intervention, transport emissions could rise, not fall, between 2020 and 2035 as a result of a growing population, improving economy and increasing employment, along with a traditional settlement pattern that engenders and is now underpinned by private car use.</p> <p>  With responsibility for 20% of Irish emissions and as the third largest emitting sector, transport will have to play its part in the national decarbonisation undertaking, requiring a step-change in how we travel and do business and the types of fuels and technologies we employ.  These transport challenges are not unique to Ireland and are similarly faced by our EU and OECD partners.  The transport decarbonisation pathway must begin with sustained investment in public transport and active travel to improve the quality and capacity of our networks and, where feasible, encourage a shift away from private car use.  In parallel, we must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and secure an early and sustainable transition to zero and low-emission vehicles.  Until these measures can produce meaningful results, Irish vehicle owners and users must have the most efficient vehicles and use them in the most carbon friendly ways.  This requires working with many actors on a series of complementary policy measures requiring a cross-governmental approach.</p> <p>  The national climate change mitigation plan, which the Government agreed in 2017, represents the critical first step in communicating the longer-term national climate vision.  Its role is to set out both the challenges to meeting Ireland's emissions-reduction targets and chart a clear and quantified path towards the long-term objective of transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy by 2050.  The plan sets out 24 transport mitigation measures and 29 associated actions.  These are wide-ranging and focus mainly on three themes, namely, modal shift, particularly to public transport in urban areas, the transition to alternatively fuelled vehicles and targeted behavioural change.  Of course, the mitigation measures outlined in a 2017 plan cannot provide a complete roadmap to achieve full decarbonisation by 2050.  Instead, they represent realistically where Ireland is now and how it can progress towards the ultimate goal of decarbonisation.  The plan is a living document and is continually updated as research, policy and innovation generate additional cost-effective mitigation options.</p> <p>  Over the period to 2050, the national mitigation plan will be supported by a series of complementary Government policies and strategies that will support its decarbonisation objectives.  Project Ireland 2040 is one such initiative and it will play a pivotal role in clearly establishing a national commitment to the right spatial planning and the capital investment needed to support projected population and employment growth in a sustainable manner.  Through Project Ireland 2040, the Government seeks to reconcile mobility needs with climate obligations by committing to integrating land use and spatial planning to encourage fewer and shorter journeys and to support public transport, walking and cycling as real alternatives to the private car.</p> <p>  On investment in public and sustainable transport, settlement patterns strongly influence how people travel.  The provision of sustainable transport options is only realistic when populations are located close to where people work, go to school, shop and socialise.  Continued investment in public and sustainable transport is a cornerstone of the Government's transport sector mitigation response.  Encouraging public transport use is central to national efforts to combat climate change, air pollution and other negative environmental and social impacts.  Public transport must provide a realistic and sustainable alternative, where feasible, to reduce the dominance of the private car.  The Government is committed to meeting increasing travel demand through more public transport capacity and by supporting cycling and walking.  This policy has seen some success.  In Dublin alone, more than two thirds of journeys to the city centre are now made on foot, by bicycle or by public transport, representing an increase of over 10% in the past six years.</p> <p>  In budget 2018, the process of investing wisely to increase capacity and enhance the range of alternatives to the car was stepped up.  Project Ireland 2040 will further build upon this investment under the "Linking People and Places" announcement of investment of &euro;8.6 billion specifically for public transport.  From Metrolink to BusConnects and the Luas expansion to cycle lanes, the groundwork is being laid for an integrated, diverse, transport future.  The aim is to link more people to more places while improving quality of life, easing congestion in our cities and doing our part in delivering a low-carbon society.  Investment in the planned BusConnects project could deliver an increase in services of up to 27% and journey time savings of up to 50%.  This would make capacity available and the switch to bus easier as will the availability if cleaner, lower-emitting buses.   Budget 2018 committed over &euro;100 million over four years to multi-annual cycling and walking programmes.  Further significant investment planned under BusConnects in Dublin, could deliver 200 km plus of cycle tracks and lanes and pedestrian facilities.</p> <p>  The decisive shift away from carbon-intensive transport will be further underpinned by the electrification of more of the rail network and a commitment to stop buying diesel-only urban buses.  By 2023, 500 buses should have been converted to low-emission vehicles.  While public transport accounts for less than 5% of Ireland's overall transport emissions, we recognise that leadership from our public transport sector in improving fuel efficiency and climate impact is important.  The national development plan commits that, from July 2019 onwards, Ireland will no longer buy diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet.  Work is under way to preparing for the implementation of this policy.  A green public transport fund has been established to support the take-up of low-carbon, energy efficient technologies within the public transport sector.  The fund is supporting the piloting and take-up of energy-efficient and alternative fuel technologies for PSO operators within the bus fleet and SPSV sector and will be used to bridge the price differential between such technologies and conventionally-fuelled vehicles.</p><p>We will begin an up-to-date and comprehensive set of vehicle trials later this year to help further inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years.  We will test, on Dublin and Cork bus routes, a range of technologies including full electric, diesel-electric hybrids and compressed natural gas.  The trials will consider CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, air quality impacts, and contribution potential towards renewable energy targets, as well as fuelling and infrastructure costs. <br/><br/>To mention the transition to alternative fuels, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and securing an early transition to zero and low-emission vehicles is integral to our transport mitigation efforts and offers one of the most cost-effective and feasible pathways to meeting our carbon mitigation and air pollution objectives.  This is particularly important outside urban areas where dependence on private cars is strongest and where public transport systems and active travel offer less potential for effectively addressing travel needs.<br/><br/>Fossil fuel use has become deeply embedded into our driving culture and we are almost entirely dependent on imported oil.  Of the total vehicle fleet, over 45% of vehicles use petrol while nearly 54% operate on diesel, meaning less than 1% of vehicles are alternatively fuelled at present.  Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and switching to greener alternatives will be essential if we are to successfully decarbonise the sector but the profile of our current fleet reflects the scale of change required.  <br/><br/>Project Ireland 2040 earmarks investments to support the transition to zero emission capable cars, underpinning a target of half a million electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030.  The groundwork for this ambitious target was laid in Ireland&rsquo;s national policy framework<i></i>on alternative fuels infrastructure for transport<i></i>published in 2017.  It represented an important step in communicating the longer-term national vision for decarbonising transport by 2050 and set out our ambition that, by 2030, all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emissions capable.<br/><br/>Colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment are working to ensure that access to refuelling or recharging infrastructure does not act as a barrier to the take-up of alternatively fuelled vehicles.  The framework sets minimum levels of provision of refuelling infrastructure and common technical standards to permit interoperability.  All this provides a supportive, enabling environment for suppliers and consumers and increased confidence and reassurance in our national commitment to the emerging alternative fuel-technology market. <br/><br/>The task force on low emitting vehicles, established on foot of A Programme for Partnership Government commitment, is considering in a thorough, pragmatic and targeted manner the range of measures and options available to the Government to accelerate the deployment of low-carbon technologies, especially electric vehicles.  The task force is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and its membership includes the key relevant Departments and bodies. <br/><br/>Its work was divided into two phases with the first phase focusing on electric vehicles and its second phase now focusing on other alternative fuels.  We consider that the task force is working effectively to assemble and consider the many factors influencing the scale and rate of transition to low emitting vehicles. <br/><br/>An attractive array of incentives has been put in place to encourage motorists to make the switch to electric and this is supported by an extensive recharging network in which we are again investing in upgrading and expanding.  The pace of take-up is accelerating rapidly with more electric vehicles sold in the first four months of 2018 than in all of 2017.  July and August saw the highest monthly sales of electric vehicles ever recorded in Ireland.  The emissions reduction dividends from the switch to electric vehicles will take time to accrue but the pathway is now being clearly established. <br/><br/>This is the most climate significant transformation in transport, replacing conventionally fossil-fuelled vehicles on the roads.  The initial investment required in alternative technologies and supporting infrastructure is admittedly costly but can help Ireland to adapt more quickly to this inevitable transition away from conventional fuels.  Encouraging alternative fuels and technologies also actively sets Ireland on the right longer-term path towards full decarbonisation and cleaner air.  Furthermore, these challenges also provide us with many opportunities for additional benefits to our overall health and living standards.  New technologies and new fuels offer great potential and reasons to be optimistic. <br/><br/>On making the existing fleet less emitting, we are not ignoring the sizeable existing vehicle fleet and the key role played by efficiencies, eco-driving and increased biofuel use in delivering sustained transport emissions reductions.  We continue to work hard at EU level, pushing strongly for better EU vehicle efficiency standards for cars, vans and heavy duty vehicles.  This regulatory approach has yielded important efficiencies in the cars and vans sector already.  Setting the next phase of targets for cars and vans and setting new targets for heavy duty vehicles will be a key component of Irish success in reducing vehicle emissions in the short to medium term, as our status as technology takers remains unchanged.  <br/><br/>Biofuels have also played a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport.  The biofuels obligation scheme, BOS, comes under the aegis of our colleague Department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  First introduced in 2010, the scheme requires suppliers of road transport fuel to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their national annual fuel sales.  The level of obligation has been increased a number of times since its introduction and it is the declared intention to continue to increase it further on a phased basis to 2020.  This will not only yield significant transport emissions dividends but also will bring us very close to the 2020 target for renewable energy in transport. <br/><br/>In terms of climate adaptation, as well as the measures to reduce transport emissions in line with EU and international obligations, there is also the challenge of building climate resilience within the transport sector.  Even if greenhouse gas emissions were to completely stop from today, global climate change would continue for many decades as a result of past emissions. <br/><br/>This poses two challenges, namely, the task of ensuring continued services and maintaining infrastructure for roads, rail, aviation, ports and buses, and the need to protect new assets by ensuring that today&rsquo;s design specifications will adequately address tomorrow&rsquo;s infrastructure needs.  The first transport sectoral climate change adaptation plan, Developing Resilience to Climate Change in the Irish Transport Sector, was published in December 2016.  The plan outlines climate research and analysis to guide our journey in future-proofing our vital road, rail, aviation, ports and bus services and infrastructure.  Building on this knowledge base, work has started on our statutory adaptation plan for transport.  The next step, in conjunction with other key infrastructure sectors, is the identification of critical national transport infrastructure.  Important work has been under way across the sector, including detailed risk assessments of critical road and rail infrastructure developed by key transport stakeholders.  In particular, I note Transport Infrastructure Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change on Ireland&rsquo;s Light Rail and National Road Network, as well as Irish Rail&rsquo;s ongoing work developing the coastal railway vulnerability index.  The Department continues to support our front-line actors - transport agencies and local authorities &ndash; to identify potential vulnerabilities within their operations and to consider how these can be addressed. <br/><br/>Adaptive capacity to climate change is also being considered as part of ongoing work on the Planning Land Use and Transport &ndash; Outlook 2040,<i></i>PLUTO, assessment, which is updating the existing framework for transport investment published in 2015.  Its work is considering how best adaptation requirements and measures should be reflected in the estimation of steady-state maintenance costs. <br/><br/>The committee has heard much evidence on the extent to which combatting climate change is that significant national challenge I mentioned at the outset.  It is clear that climate measures and policies implemented today will have consequences for Ireland for decades to come.  EPA projections for our 2030 prospects are sobering.  Strong levels of investment for new emissions-efficient public transport capacity have been secured; investment in cycling and walking is being ramped up; efficiency standards in vehicles are improving every year; the range of incentives to encourage the transition to electric vehicles has been convincingly developed and the proportion of biofuels in petrol and diesel is increasing. <br/><br/>All these efforts are currently being cancelled out, however, by rising demand.  Each transport trip now is less emitting than it was before.  Nonetheless emissions are rising.  Every year demand for trips to work, education, shopping, leisure and social interaction rise as population and employment grows and goods transport in support of exports, increased construction activity and higher agricultural output grows.  The development of policy responses for transport needs to continue and go even further. <br/><br/>Decarbonising transport by 2050 will require a transformation, expected mainly to be achieved through the promotion, deployment and uptake of new technologies and alternative fuels.  Alongside technology development, more and better lower carbon public transport, more use of active travel modes, a reduction in the need to travel and shorter journey distances must also play a role.  Every sector needs to identify new measures and intensify those already yielding results and that analysis needs to start right away.  The focus must be on early, co-ordinated action.  Ireland&rsquo;s response must involve a whole-of-Government approach, be comprehensive and be quickly identified. <br/><br/>Collectively, these actions will move us towards achieving the long-term vision of a low-carbon society.  It will not be easy and it will require a fundamental societal transformation but with the substantial investment identified, and through the focus given by Project Ireland 2040, we can expect to see changes in the transport sector as it steps up its efforts to reduce its climate impact. <br/><br/>Achieving the necessary transport emissions mitigation will require individual consciousness and action by us all.</p><p>It also requires continuing close co-operation between my Department and other key Departments across the areas of transport, taxation, fuel policy, investment policy, air quality and spatial planning.  My Department will continue to work closely with all the various actors and their various policy drivers as we seek to secure significant and sustainable national emission savings, and ultimately a largely decarbonised economy and society.</p></speech>

More than 20% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transport and the 4% growth in 2016 alone is alarming.  We need to see a step change in this regard.  We are not within an ass's roar of meeting our targets for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for 2020.  I highlighted in the D&aacute;il Chamber six or seven years ago that we would hit this carbon cliff and now it is in front of us.</p> <p>  Mr. Doyle outlined the changes that are being made regarding electric vehicles.  If one looks at the graphs that have been presented today, however, one will see there were 900 new purchases in 2017, and there were approximately 2,600 such vehicles in the State.  That shows it is moving at a snail's pace.  What is being done at Government level in the Department and across other Departments to accelerate that?  There has been an increase in grants and incentives but the real issue is range anxiety.  Does Mr. Doyle agree?  What is being done to address that?  We are way behind Norway and Holland, which is much smaller than Ireland but has 20 times more charging points than Ireland.  In Norway some 20% of all new vehicles sold are electric vehicles, EVs.  What is being done about those issues?</p> <p>  The issue of charging points is continually being side-stepped.  The ESB erected and installed them, and it is runs the scheme for free, on which I commend it.  The regulator has stated that cannot continue, however.  Why not?  What is the Department doing to address that issue, which is one of the key issues for getting more EVs onto the road?</p> <p>  On biogas, Mr. Doyle should outline the steps that will be taken now to address that huge 19% gap.  We will hit a 1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  What is being done to address the gap of almost 20%, which is the minimum we should meet?  As the paper outlines, the way things are going our greenhouse gas emissions may actually increase for transport.  Not only do we not want it to increase but we also have a big gap to fill and we must try to catch up.  </p> <p>  What is being done to address the issue of alternative sources of fuel for heavy vehicles?  In particular, Mr. Doyle might address one claim the Irish Road Haulage Association is making.  I am not a scientist or engineer but it claims there is a new European hi-tech engine, which is up to the Euro 6 emissions standard.  I understand that almost all the carbon emissions that would come out of the exhaust pipes of those trucks are captured because of the new technology which is installed in them.  I do not know if the Department is aware of that but obviously it would be good if it can be done and we need to hear about it.  Has an assessment done of that at Government level been done?</p> <p>  On the indigenous sources of biogas, what measures are being taken?  We have a huge amount of agricultural waste.  One plant is generating biogas, some of which could be used for compressed natural gas, CNG.  What progress has been made and, more importantly, what steps will be taken to increase the use of CNG?  I brought forward a paper on this last year to highlight CNG's importance and its potential both for the agricultural sector and for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  </p> <p>  Biofuels will require much land.  A perfect storm seems to be coming here, in that we are increasing food production with Food Harvest 2020, increased output and so on but the use of land is almost maxed out and we have seen a fodder crisis.  What is happening in respect of the land to grow this biofuel?  There is much marginal land around where the three peat-fuelled power stations are located.  Are the ESB, the Department and Bord na M&oacute;na in discussions and have they worked out a plan for the use of this land?  Much of it is underused.  There was a scheme for willow but it was not successful.  That is fair enough, but what has been done in the meantime?  Is everyone sitting on his or her hands and hoping it will go away or that it can be dealt with tomorrow?  This issue should have been dealt with six or seven years ago at a minimum.  What is being done about looking at that fairly marginal land in places such as north-west Offaly, Longford, other midland counties and further afield, where we could produce biomass rather than importing it from the United States?  It is good news that the Bord na M&oacute;na project to do that is buried.  It was nuts.  The carbon footprint of hauling that biomass across the Atlantic would far exceed anything that oil or coal, the dirtiest of all fuels, would create.</p> <p>  On public transport, there is a question of integration, which catches the public's attention.  What are we doing about having a system, as exists in other European countries, where one can book into a hotel and be given a ticket which takes one around the city for the next week?  Why can we not have something like that here, or at least have one ticket that brings the ticket holder everywhere on all transport?  I have heard these questions asked as far back as ten and 15 years ago.  People will talk about Leap cards and so on but we still seem unable to get full integration, which a commuter coming in from the country in the morning, perhaps travelling 40 or 50 miles on a train, wants to be able to get.  We need to make the system much simpler.</p> <p>  To have effective public transport hubs and fully integrated transport, we need more parking facilities.  If people are travelling to the capital, to Galway or to wherever they want to go, and we want them to do the last 40 miles by train, what are we doing about putting parking in place?  Portarlington, Portlaoise, Ballybrophy all have chronic parking problems.  It is impossible to get parking anywhere near Portlaoise station in the morning.  There are huge difficulties there, along with an extra cost.  The commuter is charged &euro;100 a week for the train ticket and then there is another charge every day to park the car.  It is penal and we will not get people onto public transport if that is how we go about it.  People will continue to use private cars and choke up the N7, N4, M1 and so on.  I ask Mr. Doyle to address that.</p> <p>  I have written to the NTA about bus shelters, and it responded a couple of years ago.  We need them.  If one goes north of the Border, one will see they do not need to be elaborate or worth &euro;30,000.  They can be simple, basic shelters in rural areas.  If people have to stand at a bus stop in Borris-in-Ossory, Castletown, Mountrath, Ballybrittas, Newtown or Ballylinan in Laois and wait for a bus to come on a wet morning, as trucks pass and spray them with rain and everything else, they will not do it.  We must provide corridors where people can go to a local bus stop and stand there with a level of comfort and protection from rain.</p><p>Take the type of heavy showers that occur now.  We can get a week's rain in five minutes.  That is the way of things at present.  People standing at bus stops are soaked through before they even get to work.  Getting bus stops in place seems to be a big deal.  I suggest that the Department let the local councils do it.  Give them the money and let them get on with it.  That is what happens in every other civilised country.  The councils need to provide the bus shelters on the N7, N77, N78 and other routes throughout the State.  Allow the local authorities to do that and trust them.  Their membership comprises capable people who were elected by the public.  There are also trained officials and, between them, they will work out with the local engineers where these bus stops should go.  They do not need to be massive, just big enough to hold four or five people in rural areas and maybe somebody with a buggy or a walking frame.  We should try to accommodate people with proper bus corridors in rural areas.  They should have some level of comfort and be able to get on to a bus without being soaked through going to work or wherever.</p></speech>

There were some questions at the start on range anxiety.  There were also some questions touching on the work of the EV task force which Ms Behan, who is with me today, co-chairs.  I will ask her to respond to some of those questions.  There were also questions on alternative sources of fuel and we will touch on those as well.  The questions on land and biofuels might be more appropriate for our sister Department, whose representatives were here last week.  I am not sure I can be particularly helpful on those questions.  We have Ms Graham, the chief executive of the National Transport Authority, here and she could respond fully to the last part of the question.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about range anxiety.  It is a significant issue.  We will see what happens with electric vehicle use.  All projections suggest that where this creates the biggest impact is still a distance out.  The year 2035 seems to be the point where the really fundamental and exciting change will happen.  In the meantime, we have got to do everything possible to work with the uptake of the technology that is there and encourage it.  There are a huge range of measures to assist with that.  Range anxiety continues to be an issue but we are seeing improvements all of the time in the technology that is there.  We are going to see some significant additional improvements in the next number of years.  To date, many of the electric vehicles have been in the small car range and not suitable for the executive or somebody who has to work with long distances.  There is no question that one of the biggest challenges in the transport space in Ireland in providing public transport in the context of climate change is our dispersed population.  As a result, range anxiety continues to be a factor but we see improvements coming.  We will see a step forward in the coming years.  I might ask Ms Behan-----</p></speech>

They are provided by the ESB.  This question keeps getting sidestepped anytime I ask it.  I do not know if anybody else here has got an answer.  The charging points were provided by the ESB but it has been told by the regulator that they have to be offloaded.  What is going to happen?  What is the problem?  Is there somebody from the European Commission standing over us with a big stick saying that the ESB cannot provide it?  If it cannot do that, why is that the case?  That is a simple and straightforward question.  Mr. Doyle is Secretary General of the Department.  Has he asked EU officials about this or has he asked the Minister what is the problem?  This is a real problem.  We have met the ESB in respect of this matter on a number of occasions and it has stated that wants it addressed.  The ESB is happy enough to be involved in providing the infrastructure, so what exactly is preventing that from happening?  Why can we not work out a method of funding it and why can the ESB not roll this out across the State?  I want an answer to that question.</p></speech>

The ESB is its agency and the network of chargers is within the remit of that Department.  I understand, however, from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment that the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has this week published a new decision allowing for the transfer of the ownership of the charging network over to the ESB parent body.  That will free up the ESB to invest in the publicly-available charging infrastructure.  That particular logjam has been addressed this week.</p></speech>

Although the ESB will be in a position to invest in it from its own resources, it is also fair to say that it will probably be seeking some assistance from the Government to help with the roll-out of the fast-charging network.  That is much needed to alleviate the range anxiety about long distances that was mentioned.  We hope that the charging of EVs will mostly take place in people's homes and that people will avail of the fast-charging network for helping them with long journeys.  As the range of vehicles increases, all of the need for that infrastructure should lessen over time.  It is, however, the responsibility of the Government to help with the take-up of EVs at this point in their development and also to invest in ensuring that some of that range anxiety can be alleviated.</p></speech>

It was established by the Government between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because it was recognised that EVs are significant for us on the transport side in delivering the decarbonisation of transport.  Many of the policy levers on EVs do not, however, reside with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The LEV task force was an attempt to bring all of the Government Departments with responsibilities in the area of regulation, infrastructure, pricing incentives, etc., around the same table.  It is intended to tackle, in a concerted way, the wrinkles and difficulties that might exist around the system on the deployment of EVs.  On the work the LEV task force has done, the first phase has focused on EVs.  The Deputies are probably aware that an interim report was made by the LEV task force to the Government in advance of the budget last year and that a range of new incentives for the roll-out of EVs was announced then.</p> <p>  Some of them have been introduced by our Department, including the tolling incentive and the grant for taxis and hackneys.  The benefit-in-kind incentive was introduced by the Minister for Finance and further supports have been put in place by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment for infrastructure, including home-charging grants.  We have seen the results of that concerted action this year with the increased take-up of EVs.  That was from a very low base and it had been very disappointing.  We had a generous range of incentives in place to facilitate the take-up of EVs before we even set up the LEV task force.  That did not seem to be enough to trigger a mass take-up because of people's concerns about the vehicles themselves and, most likely, range anxiety.</p><p>However, following the putting in place of a targeted range of incentives, we have seen a very significant response.  In the first four months of this year, we saw more EVs bought in Ireland than in all of 2017.  July and August have been record months for the purchase of EVs.  We have 6,500 EVs on the road now.  That does not sound like a lot but from where we were two or three years ago, it is a significant increase.  That pattern is continuing.  There has been a good response to the incentives that have been put in place.</p></speech>

The Irish Road Haulage Association is correct that the Euro 6 standard for HGVs is an extraordinarily high standard with regard to air pollutants.  It has certainly put in place a lot of technology to trap the most harmful particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, NOx - the nasty air quality pollutants that come from diesel vehicles generally.  In that respect, the standards are a very significant development.  They have been in place for a few years.  However, what is probably most significant in terms of reducing carbon emissions from the HGV sector is the negotiations that are currently ongoing at EU level for the putting in place of a new set of regulations around CO2 in heavy-duty vehicles where the EU is seeking at the manufacturing stage for the first time to put in place a standard, which will require full information to be made available to all purchasers as to the carbon outcome of the truck, that is, however many grammes of carbon per kilometre the truck will emit.  That monitoring is beginning next year.  From then, the EU hopes to be able to secure a reduction every year with the setting of specific targets, for 2025 and 2030, that manufacturers will be required to produce vehicles that are less emitting.  That is by far the most cost-effective way of ensuring that the road freight fleet starts on its decarbonisation journey.</p> <p>  The technologies in the HGV sector are not progressing at the same pace as they have been in the cars and vans sector - the lighter duty vehicles.  The deployment of battery technology, in particular, is not suitable for the most part yet for HGVs although there are some promising pilots.  Hydrogen is slow to develop also in that space.</p> <p>  For us, the Deputy is absolutely correct.  One of the key alternative fuels that we need to start deploying within our freight fleet in the absence of those technologies happening is compressed natural gas, CNG, and using that then as a pathway to the introduction of biogas in the system.  The European Union is supporting Gas Networks Ireland in deploying a range of refuelling infrastructure.  We expect to have 14 CNG publicly-available refuelling stations open by 2020.  Gas Networks Ireland is working with private fleets to allow for refuellers.</p> <p>  Phase 1 of the low emissions vehicle, LEV, task force looked at EVs but phase 2 is turning its attention to the gases - CNG, biogas and hydrogen - in terms of how we might work with our colleagues in the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure that the system examines fully what incentives might be needed, but also what impediments might be in place within the system, to allow us to move forward in the gaseous fuels space, as we have managed successfully to do in terms of EVs.  That is where that is at present.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.664" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018100400002#G00500"><p>I will give a quick response.  There were three particular questions, one of which was on integration of fares.  Leap card provides integration across all public transport.  The only area where one cannot use a Leap card is in intercity rail travel but it is now available on any subsidised bus service, including Bus &Eacute;ireann services.  It is now available on all of those services - all city services, all commuter rail services.</p> <p>  We have put in place a visitor Leap card in Dublin only.  It allows a ticket to be bought by a visitor to Ireland before he or she comes here that allows travel across all modes in Dublin.</p> <p>  In terms of transport hubs, we are looking at additional parking at train stations.  We are working closely with Irish Rail to identify where we can put additional parking where it owns property and move on that as quickly as possible.  Funding has been the constraint in that space.</p> <p>  In terms of payment for parking, one issue is that if one introduces free parking, one may find that the parking is used for activity other than taking train journeys.  There will have to be some charge associated with parking at train stations.</p> <p>  On bus shelters, we are aware there is an under-provision of bus shelters right across the country, particularly in rural areas.  The constraint was funding.  We will be happy with the additional funding that we believe will come forward to increase our provision of bus shelters.  We would be delighted if local authorities take on this activity, work through the planning and identify where the sites are.  It would certainly speed up provision.  We would be happy to work closely with local authorities to deliver more bus shelters.</p></speech>

When one buys a ticket for the train, one should be given a small disk which one would put on the car.  There are ways around the difficulty.  Commuters who are heavily taxed paying &euro;100 plus a week to get into whatever city by means of a 40-mile or 50-mile journey feel this is a significant additional imposition.</p> <p>  I have one point on the bus shelters.  The problem is the process is too slow.  I am aware that the National Transport Authority has supported some of them and has managed to get some in place, but the process is too slow.  They are big and expensive.  Something more basic will do.  There are simpler models in other countries.  North of the Border, there are simpler ones that can be erected.  I am not saying the NTA should put up something shabby looking but small bus shelters can be put up.  One can have a design for them for certain types of towns and villages, and very small ones for rural areas for perhaps four passengers to stand into etc.  Where there is a bigger catchment, such as in Mountrath, one could have slightly bigger ones.  That is all I would say in this regard.</p></speech>

As we look at the elements of meeting the target, there are a couple of components.  There is the modal shift piece, which we have talked about a little bit, technology and standards, about which we have talked a little bit, the alternative fuels piece and the work with biofuels that has made a significant difference and behavioural change in terms of how we travel, how we drive if we drive and, most importantly in that space, whether we can replace the need to drive with other modes of transport.</p> <p>  It is clear that 78% of emissions in the transport sector are in the space of the private car and freight.</p><p>Within that timeframe, we can see the significant technology changes that are scheduled and in that sense I think it is realistic.  The difficulty and challenge we are finding is in meeting the targets in the intervening period.  While we know those technologies are coming and that the longer-term vision is achievable and feasible, we will continue to be obliged to work through the challenges of milestones in the meantime.  In many ways, that will be the hardest part.</p></speech>

That will build up our fleet and capacity on the rail lines in the interim in order that when electrification is in place, the fleet units can operate as electric vehicles.  Our focus is on looking at the type of fleet available and purchasing a hybrid fleet to build up capacity and follow on with the electrification of those lines.</p></speech>

Diesel is widely used around the country, particularly outside urban areas.  For those who do make the transition, there is the matter of charging units.  On long journeys, many people stop off at motorway points.  How will it be managed whereby instead of people stopping for diesel or petrol that they call in to charge their car?  I recently noticed a charging unit.  How will this be managed among companies?  The Department is obviously examining that.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  There are a number of fast chargers, as well as slow chargers, unfortunately, available at motorway service stops.  Clearly, we will have to invest more in the fast-charging network.  ESB indicated last week that it might make an application to the Government's climate fund for assistance to roll out a new fast-charging network.  As the climate fund closed for applications on Monday, we are hopeful that this may be the case.</p></speech>

Our public transport companies - Dublin Bus, Irish Rail or whatever - have undertaken ecodriver training for their drivers and technologies are deployed in the infrastructure to secure the most efficient driving.  We have examined how we might scale this up and are considering behavioural economics around private cars and the potential to use ecodriving by drivers to manage their own fuel consumption.  That is a difficult area.  A study is under way, which we are co-funding with the Environmental Protection Agency, to examine how we might deploy ecodriving in the most efficient and most effective way to reach the target audience.  One can spend a great deal of money on ecodriving programmes while their benefits are dissipated within a short timeframe as the training that people have undergone slips.  It is difficult to get right on a sustained basis.  We hope the study, which is looking at the Irish context specifically and HGV drivers in particular, will provide useful information for a programme of scale that we can deploy nationally.</p></speech>

I will return to Dublin Bus and see how that has fared over time, but it was very impressive to start.</p></speech>

What kind of engagement does the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have with other Departments?  Is it a project-basis engagement or is it consistent?</p></speech>

A great deal of cross-Government work is undertaken on a range of issues.  I seem to spend a great deal of my time attending cross-Government meetings, which is excellent because it gives us the opportunity to directly work with our colleagues where issues cross over.  There is no question but that climate change is now on the top of people's tongues in a way that was not the case some years ago.  We see that co-operation quite regularly.  A good structure is in place.  Bringing climate change directly under a particular Department was a significant change.  There is a Cabinet committee and a senior officials group.  There are climate change units within various Departments.  I can see the work and interaction being more positive than ever.</p></speech>

With electric vehicles for example, it is a fair point.  Perhaps we should look at an overall communications strategy in this space.  It is something we will certainly take away and examine.</p></speech>

With regard to electric vehicles, it was mentioned that 6,500 are being used as a result of concerted action.  I respectfully disagree.  We are really going at a snail's pace compared with some other countries.  What are the Department's ideas for accelerating progress?  In Norway, for example, half of all cars sold last year were electric and over half this year will be electric.  We are way behind what other countries are doing in this area.  Mr. Doyle stated that the real action will happen around 2035, which demonstrates a lack of ambition in trying to accelerate progress.  We need much greater ambition and to try to match leading countries in Europe and elsewhere on this.  Why should we not replicate what Norway has done, for example?</p> <p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy touched on how this can be communicated.  It will happen through certain incentives.  Norway piloted a tolling model, with reduced or free tolling for electric vehicles.  Could we do something in this regard for a short period to try to drive change?  I know there are contracts but we must really accelerate policy actions.  I know the Department is trying to drive policy in the area but it is much too slow.  We need more ideas and perhaps the witnesses can enlighten us on what other European countries are doing.  We have the example of Norway.  What can we do with the tax base to really promote electric vehicles?  As has been mentioned, 20% of greenhouse gas emissions are transport-related and half of that comes from private cars.  If we could replicate what Norway - an oil-producing country - can do in the area of electric vehicles, we could massively reduce our carbon footprint very quickly.  We need innovative solutions in respect of tax in order that people can engage in a behavioural change.  Our actions thus far do not match those of other countries.</p> <p>  The next issue is the replacement of our bus and rail fleet.  Will the witnesses indicate when existing stock will be replaced in order to reduce our carbon footprint?  What capital replacement model is in place and how will it affect carbon emissions?  There was mention of park-and-ride facilities and trying to encourage commuters to use trains.  A new charging system has been implemented at Dunboyne station, for example, and where there used to be many cars parked, there are now none as a result of the prohibitive model being used.  This completely contradicts the climate change approach.  As Deputy Stanley mentioned, there must be a different model.  This may include, for example, integrated ticketing and parking facilities.  The current charging system for parking is reducing the number of people who use commuter trains.  In addition, planning applications such as the example of the new Broombridge Luas station, which is integrated with the trains, were progressed without any parking facilities.  There will be electrification of the line through that station.  There is to be another new train station at Pelletstown, with very little provision for parking and, therefore, a massively negative impact on people who live around those areas.  We are talking about park-and-ride facilities but the desired impact on the ground in suburban Dublin does not follow.  The charging model does not help potential or existing commuters or people who want to live in residential areas where train stations are being developed.  I would like to hear more about actual park-and-ride facilities and what is being done in that regard.  Currently, tenders are being awarded to private clampers who are punishing people who want to commute.  We need a much more positive model of park-and-ride facilities to help commuters.</p> <p>  There have been good changes involving integrated ticketing.  The Netherlands, for example, has a cashless model involving e-cards and many public services should transition to that.  What is being done to bring about a cashless payment system?  BusConnects is dotted throughout this and it is important that the Department and the NTA are cognisant of the democratic decision of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann regarding BusConnects and the rejection of the current proposal, with a request for the reversal of many changes to routes.  There has been much spin, including the claim of a 27% increase in services.  In suburban areas in north and south Dublin, people will see the opposite happening, with many services being very much adversely affected.  These changes are being rejected by people living in those areas.  What were the terms of reference in respect of BusConnects?  What was the advertising spend on BusConnects specifically?  There seems to be a very direct and aggressive campaign to fool people in suburban Dublin about what the people involved want the population to believe.  They can read the maps in order to see the real impact.  What is being done to radically change BusConnects?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the stations at Pelletstown and Broombridge.  They are located very close to the city centre in what would be considered suburban Dublin.  We do not encourage people to drive to stations located quite close to or within the city centre.  We are trying to encourage people to walk, cycle and use other public transport to get to those stations.  As part of trying to encourage more people to use sustainable transport, one action would be to not provide parking at stations located in the city region.  Interchange is brought about by encouraging people to walk, cycle and use other public transport to get to train stations.</p></speech>

This will be account based ticketing, which will move towards cashless, account based payments using a bank card and other means of payment for public transport.  We have started the process and one part of the strategy involves the use of mobile phones to book certain tickets.  We have a procurement process under way in regard to that.  We will put in place validators to enable the use of bank card payment for public transport.  I do not have a timeline for that but we want to move on that as quickly as possible. </p><p> We believe we presented the benefits of BusConnects to the public.  We were not being disingenuous in saying there would be a 20% increase in services across the region.  This figure was very carefully calculated and that was what was presented to the public.  We also commented on the impacts of the network proposal.  It proposed additional interchange and orbital services, as well as additional services.  However, it also proposed changes associated with the current network.  We have asked members of the public whether they are prepared to make changes to the network in order to achieve the type of service improvements we believe would come from the BusConnects network.</p><p> I do not have the full advertising spend for BusConnects but I can certainly make that available to the committee.  In terms of the network and bus corridors, BusConnects will bring improved and more efficient public transport, which will reduce public transport carbon emissions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.706" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018100400002#K00300"><p>If I may, I will first respond to a couple of points made by Deputy Jack Chambers because they led to the questions on electric vehicles which Ms Behan will answer.  I mentioned the year 2035, which is an internationally recognised timeframe and not one that I have set.  I have made clear we are very anxious to do all we can in the intervening period to reach the objective faster.  I want to be clear about that.</p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned tolling in Norway.  We already have such a scheme in place already.  He also made a good point about what could be done to incentivise the use of electric vehicles using the tax base in terms, if we go back to the way motor taxation was calculated some time ago, it resulted in a significant behavioural shift.  These days, we have large numbers of diesel cars and a different problem from CO2  in terms of air quality.  We can see the power of the diesel incentive so the Deputy's point is well made.  Ms Behan will answer the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.707" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Behan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018100400002#K00400"><p>Deputy Chambers is absolutely correct.  We do not in any way pretend that 6,500 electric vehicles on the road is something to celebrate with alacrity.  However, this year demand for electric vehicles in the Irish market shot up in response to the incentives that were put in place in the budget last year.  The constraint on the purchasing of electric vehicles this year has been the lack of availability of stock.  Car dealers cannot get the stock in quickly enough to meet demand for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids this year.  This is a response to a significant step-up in demand, which we find encouraging.  Part of the reason the stock is not available to us has been the success of electric vehicles in Norway, which is taking up a sizeable amount of electric vehicle output in the European Union.  We wish we could emulate the range of incentives that have been put in place in Norway but the cost of those is running at more than &euro;1 billion already.  Despite the range of incredibly generous incentives that have been put in place at a very sizeable cost, only 50% of new vehicles being purchased in Norway are electric vehicles.  To put in context the kinds of incentives we would have to put in place to achieve what Norway has achieved on electric vehicles, Mr. Doyle mentioned that we introduced a tolling incentive on 1 July 2018.  This provides for a 50% reduction at almost every toll in the country for a full battery electric vehicle and a 25% reduction for plug-in hybrids.  A driver with an electric vehicle toll tag will pay half tolls.  We are delighted with that measure and we hope it is contributing in some part to the increase in demand for electric vehicles.</p> <p>  Deputy Chambers also referred to cashless transport in the context of electric vehicles.  It is worthwhile pointing out that all the electricity to fuel electric vehicles from the public recharging network is currently free.  As such, it is totally cashless already.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.708" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018100400002#K00600"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Having listened to the presentations, it is very clear the difficulties the National Transport Authority has, as an independent body, in trying to co-ordinate the issues.  I have considerable understanding of what Ms Behan has to do to try to pull all sides together to get a coherent policy framework in place.  I have raised the same issues with officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment who are not in charge of all the policy elements.  There is no doubt that individual Departments will have their own concerns, issues and responsibilities.  What I would like to hear from Mr. Doyle is what delineation can be made and what movement can be made in terms of responsibility around certain areas.  It seems somewhat bizarre that because the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has responsibility for the generation of electricity, the network or charging points should necessarily reside in that Department.  If that was a function of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. Doyle could possibly deploy some policies that would ensure the charging network was built out more quickly to other areas.</p> <p>  I concur with Deputy Stanley because a number of constituents who have made the shift to electric vehicles have informed me their next vehicle purchase will be a hybrid.  They are moving backwards because fast charging points are not available and they are not being policed or managed to the extent that they should be, which means other people park in them.  Moreover, they have also been broken on occasion.  When I question the ESB and others, their response is that the charging network is adequate for the number of electric vehicles we have and the number anticipated.  If we are trying to overcome the range anxiety issue, we have to front-load charging facilities to the extent that people become sick of seeing them around the place and they become ubiquitous.  This will result in a consciousness among the public that they will not be caught out without access to a power source.</p> <p>  We met representatives of the automotive sector.  They are introducing new electric vehicles with improved range and the car class issue is also being addressed.  At some point, we will reach a tipping point, where there will be a significant demand and I am concerned that the network of charging points will not adequate to meet it.  The incentives are good, but could be better.  Others have outlined what has happened in Norway and we have put forward policy proposals in that regard in the past.</p> <p>  It is imperative that we do something big to give confidence to consumers that we will ensure they have access to a charging network.  Charging it home will not be an issue.  The concern is that people will be caught out somewhere else.</p><p>There is an issue around train stations and Luas stations.  There should be much better parking options at the Red Cow for those of us who travel from the country to the city.  One can spend an hour pumping diesel fumes in traffic for the five or six miles from the N7 to the city.  If parking was available at the Red Cow, it would make a significant contribution towards decluttering the city.  I take the point that different places are owned by different entities.  Mr. Doyle should tell us what kind of places his Department would like control of.  We can act together to reorientate that approach. </p><p> There are issues around the charging and parking policies of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  A sign in the carpark of Limerick railway station warns drivers that they are responsible for their vehicle at night.  It is really saying that people would be better off not parking in the station carpark overnight because there are certain blind spots and there have been break-ins.  I can understand that from the point of view of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The board and CEO of the company have many issues to address, and parking falls well down the line in terms of its contribution to climate change.  One of the Departments must take responsibility, and I do not just mean responsibility for co-ordination.  </p><p> Mr. Doyle said that diesel-only purchases will end in 2019.  I have made the point at other committees about the decision to purchase 110 buses last year.  That has been done and we cannot go back on it.  There is no point in hauling Mr. Doyle over the coals about it, but we should agree that, from today onwards, the bus companies should use what they have until an alternative can be sourced.  They should not purchase anything beyond today.  This is not just about the electricity network.  We should also consider compressed natural gas.  It will be a long time before the industry invests in that.  </p><p> There has been talk about hydrogen in certain areas, particularly its potential use for heavy goods vehicles.  It would be expensive to roll out technology like that, but we should decide to do that in any case.  Perhaps it would not be used for ten or 15 years, and perhaps technology would improve and that approach will be made redundant.  If it helps in the move towards less polluting approaches to transport, we should do it.</p></speech>

In answer to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, I said that co-ordination across Government has improved on all issues.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has a very close working relationship with the NTA.  The low emissions vehicle, LEV, task force was a good example of that.  We were very anxious to try to find a structure that would allow us to work through those co-ordination issues, and we worked with our colleagues to get the task force up and running.  It has made a significant difference and there is very constructive engagement now.  We have spoken about parking at train stations, and I know that the issue of charging for carparking where electric vehicles are charging has come up in the local authorities.  We have started to look at how that can be addressed by bringing the local authorities in under one of the work streams in the LEV task force.  That is significant.</p> <p>  I am interested in the point raised about how some people are moving back to hybrid vehicles from electric vehicles.  Ms Behan might address that issue further.  </p></speech>

The challenge and choice we have had in recent years, as the Chair mentioned, has been whether we want to buy one efficiently fuelled bus and get one busload of people out of their cars, or whether we should buy three buses and get three busloads of people out of their cars.  That has been the challenge to date.  Some of that is now balancing out.  The buses bought recently and now are at the existing Euro-6 standard, which is a major improvement on some of the buses in the fleet.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  Ms Behan will deal with some of the points raised about electric vehicles and Ms Graham will discuss park-and-ride facilities.  There will be a significant investment over the next three years in public transport, amounting to &euro;2.6 billion and rising to &euro;8.6 billion over the course of the national development plan.  Part of the funding that goes through the NTA into public transport will be deployed for park-and-ride facilities.  Ms Graham will address that issue as well.  </p></speech>

A significant amount of work was undertaken within that working group to identify demand and the stretches of road where we feel the deployment of fast-charging infrastructure is most likely to be needed.  We worked closely on that with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  I believe there will be a step-change in the electric vehicle, EV, recharging infrastructure provision in the next year as the climate fund is deployed and ESB investment is freed up.  I hope we will see significant progress on that over the next year.</p></speech>

Perhaps the local authorities will undertake advertising to that end.  Places like Ennis, Ennistymon and Scariff have no fast-charging points and while people in those areas may never need them, they get range anxiety.  In order to attract the early adopters perhaps it is worth overinvesting in some of the infrastructure.  I am not suggesting that money should be spent recklessly.  Safeguards are put in to protect people, and the greater the number of people who adopt electric vehicle technology, the more popular this mode of transport will become.  People will understand that one charge, done at home, will be more than adequate for most of their activity.  There are some who will need more charge, however.  Tesla has rolled out some technology on the M8 and M7, and I am sure it has done the same on other roads.  I am sure the NTA has been involved in that very welcome development.  While charging points can be introduced on the major urban networks, people always look to the final half mile, close to home.</p></speech>

There is a very strong public awareness campaign generated by the SEAI that is now being rolled out, particularly across social media.  There is an app that will show the availability of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and whether it is free.  A great deal of work is happening in that area and the SEAI is looking to enhance that constantly.  We note that it is incredibly important.</p></speech>

What I mean by that are locations on key rail, light rail and bus corridors.  It is generally proposed to locate them around the M50, the kind of area where one encourages people to interchange to public transport in order to get into Dublin city.  The situation in our regional cities is similar.  We would take responsibility for the design and implementation of those.  In some cases, it is about improving existing infrastructure like the Red Cow roundabout and some of the key rail stations.</p> <p>  In terms of bus purchases, Dublin Bus is purchasing nine test vehicles.  It is in the process of purchasing that low-fleet emission fleet from three manufacturers and will run testing early next year.  That will help us develop our procurement strategy for low-emission double-decker buses.  We will start that procurement next year.  As Mr. Doyle said, a deliberate decision was taken to purchase as many Euro 6 vehicles as possible because that provides other benefits for the city centre, particularly lower levels of noxious substances and much lower levels of particulates.  We want to see those improvements as well and to have as young a fleet as possible operating in our city centres.  We need to move forward to address carbon emissions.  Dublin Bus will be starting the trial, which will inform our procurement strategy, next year.</p> <p>  We are also looking at where we can pilot the use of electric buses.  In association with Bus &Eacute;ireann, we are looking at a small electric pilot scheme in one of the regional towns.  The exact location for the project has not yet been identified.  By 2023, we hope to have 500 low-emission vehicles in the operation.  This will comprise approximately one third of the public transport fleet.</p></speech>

I will ramble around a few issues, some of which have been mentioned.  I have a number of questions as well.</p> <p>  Missing from Mr. Doyle's statement were phrases such as "the Minister is determined", "the Minister wants", "the Minister is anxious" and "the Minister is ambitious for".  There is no mention of the Minister, which might be par for the course as regards contributions.  The point I am emphasising relates to the lack of political drive behind some of the things we are doing or need to do, the lack of overall urgency regarding the situation and the need, as mentioned by previous speakers, for a communications strategy.</p> <p>  I made a pretty detailed submission regarding BusConnects so I will not go into that matter now.  One of the key questions that came up, which I mentioned in my submission and at public information meetings I held concerns the nature of the NTA.  It is a pretty significant matter that needs to be addressed because the public does not know what the NTA is.  We can operate in a bubble when it comes to matters such as climate change and assume that many things are happening while the public might be going off in a different direction.  Electric vehicles are an example in this regard.  We are all talking about electric vehicles but there is very little talk about hybrids.  The witnesses have no figures on hybrids.  Perhaps they have them and can circulate them to us.  The public has made the decision that hybrid or a mixture of hybrid is the way it is going until range anxiety and other issues are resolved.  So in a few years' time, we will end up with a situation where people will have hybrids or a mix of hybrid vehicles that they purchased in good faith.  The position for them will be similar to those who purchased diesel cars in good faith until the science changed and who are now stuck with them.  Something might happen in the budget.  There is a need for a sustained national communications strategy.  That would be one of the things for which I would be pushing.  This needs to start and be continuously featured in people's lives.  They know that climate change is here and there is a real appetite for discovering what they can do.</p> <p>  The public's experience of trying to do things by themselves regarding climate change has been mixed.  I remember the first kerbside collections in Dublin, namely, the small green boxes the size of milk crates.  They were not that big.  We discovered after six or seven years of operation that almost all of the material the public had gone to the trouble of segregating ended up in landfill.  It was a real case of brushing something under the carpet.  The material had not gone to recycling plants at all.  There are serious questions to be asked about that.  How much of the material people recycle actually ends up being recycled?  How much of it ends up in landfill?  How much of the organic material we put out in brown bins in Dublin ends up in landfill because people do these things in good faith?  When the science said something in 2008, people made a shift to vehicles with diesel engines in good faith.  We continue to publish figures such as those in the pictorial graph relating to emissions.  I am making the assumption that this is based on us accepting the figures motor manufacturers are giving us but it has been proven that they have been lying through their teeth.  On the figures we are discussing in the context of reduced emissions, it was mentioned that 95.6% of vehicles are in AB emission bands.  Is that according to vehicle handbooks or is it a scientifically proven fact?  If it is based on what the manufacturers are telling us, we cannot trust it at all.  These are small things.  There is a need for a national communications strategy.</p> <p>  This committee must, in the context of the report it eventually compiles, must produce solid, concrete and tangible actions that the public can implement in their homes.  We have heard some fascinating information.</p><p>I have not attended all the meetings but I have read the Official Report of proceedings and watched recordings of the committee's discussions on issues such as housing and insulation and on what is being done in other countries.  They are the kind of things at which we need to look.  The communications issue is the first one.  It must be communicated that this needs to be done and that there is an urgency to it and to outline the things people can do in their personal lives.</p><p> The second issue relates to the political ambition behind all of this.  The Department and the NTA can only do what they are directed to do.  I have not heard of any great urgency propelling them forward in the work they do.</p><p> I will go through some of the issues raised, including the electric vehicles and the ESB.  We should not ultimately leave it exclusively to the ESB.  Perhaps in terms of public infrastructure it is important.  In the United States, the much-maligned Tesla did a deal with Burger King or Dunkin' Donuts so that charging points are located at a number of their outlets.  I think Dundrum town centre has a number of charging points.  I what was said about the hope that people might charge their vehicles at home.  Let us look at it in terms of the countries that are leading on this.  What has their experience been?  Do people predominantly charge at home?  If that is the case then it is good to follow that.  It would be useful to have charging points at hospitals, workplaces, shopping centres and tax offices so people do not have to sit in their cars waiting for them to charge but can actively do something.</p><p> The witnesses mentioned that transport accounts for 20% of our emissions.  Aviation accounts for 20% of that total and the figure for aviation emissions is increasing.  It looks as if the other transport sectors may contract over time, if we are lucky and if we achieve all the targets and introduce electric cars, buses, public transport and, particularly, the infrastructure relating to BusConnects, of which I am a supporter.  It should come first.  This relates to what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy said about the third runway at Dublin Airport.  It looks like aviation, in the Irish context, is just going to grow and grow and there does not seem to be any alternative to aviation fuels.  Aviation has not been mentioned specifically but it looks as if it will be a growing factor.</p></speech>

In writing our statement, we were clear we were invited here as the Department.  I suspect this is the reason we took that approach.  The Minister has spoken on this point at committees in the past.  Last week, he was involved in a significant engagement on climate change along with the Taoiseach.  It is something he raises with us regularly as we work through the public transport issue, which is very much about the really important economic impact that providing the right type of public transport and reducing congestion will have.  That investment affects the climate change and economic performance issues.  The Minister is of a firm mind on that.</p> <p>  I am sure I wrote down all of the questions.  There was a good point made about the charging of electric cars as people go about their business.  That is an important point and it is a matter the task force on electric vehicles has been seeking to address.  I will bring Ms Behan in on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Behan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018100400002#N00400"><p>There were a number of issues regarding electric cars.  The Deputy asked about the ratio between battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.  In Ireland, we have an unusual profile in that regard.  Most of our European counterparts have seen more plug-in hybrid vehicles sold than full-battery electric vehicles.  In Ireland ,our ratio was previously 3:1.  This year, for the first time, it has moved to 2:1.  As Deputy Dooley stated, there has been some slippage to the plug-in hybrid space as opposed to the full-battery electric vehicle.  In Ireland, the range is increasing significantly for full-battery electric vehicles.  Journey distances in Ireland will be conducive to the range that will be available in battery electric vehicles.  It is currently available in some and the range coming on stream over the next year or two will mean that we, unlike our European counterparts, we will probably have a very strong take-up of full-battery electric vehicles here.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the emissions testing regimes that have been put in place in order to give vehicles their certification around climate emissions.  When a vehicle is sold it is sold with a particular certificate indicating its climate performance based on a test.  There were certainly some very well publicised cases on the accuracy or otherwise of those tests.  Those particular cases related to the manipulation of air quality emissions in the testing as opposed to climate emissions.  It is undoubtedly the case, however, that in a laboratory setting, where these types of tests are undertaken, the conditions that are deployed in the tests are not the same as real-world driving emissions.  We assume there is a certain differential between the certificate base of efficiency or carbon output per kilometre in laboratory testing and real world testing.  Across Europe, we have been attempting to deal with that through the introduction of a new testing regime which is a much longer test cycle over a variety of different modes which try to replicate urban driving or long distance driving over a much longer period.  The outcomes from that new series of tests will start to be seen on vehicle certificates from next year.  They will be introduced from 1 January 2019 and will be fully implemented by 1 January 2020 so all new cars coming on stream over the next couple of years will have their emissions testing outcomes based on a much more rigorous testing model.  We expect to see some differences arising from it but we will have a much more accurate representation of the carbon emissions per kilometre.</p> <p>  On the point about the private charging points, which we call destination charging, it is undoubtedly the case that there are a large number of them already.  A large number of businesses, shopping centres, hotels and supermarkets make charge points available to their customers in the same way as they make Wi-Fi available and so on.  It is very welcome.  As the number of electric vehicles in the market increases, we expect that to increase.  There is an accelerated capital allowance available for businesses that wish to invest in the provision of those.</p></speech>

The SEAI is doing that on behalf of the Government in order to draw together all the information on where all electric vehicle charge points are located, not just the public ESB ones.  They will form part of that mapping by the SEAI.  I am not sure when that will come on stream but I can make it available to the committee.</p></speech>

In an international context, the trading system is there and the work on carbon offsetting at the ICAO is particularly relevant to that.  Emissions from aviation are being examined at that level internationally and Ireland is taking part in that process.</p><p>There is a pilot programme from 2021 that we are signed up to, along with the other members of the European Civil Aviation Conference.  In an Irish context, as well as under the national aviation policy, we also have an informal implementation group consisting of ourselves, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the EPA and the Irish Aviation Authority, that is collaborating on the implementation of the pieces that are working through the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO.</p><p> We see technology improving in the aviation space and there is an ongoing programme.  </p></speech>

There are ongoing programmes of fleet replacement in the Irish-registered airlines.

I noticed that the NTA mentioned the mix of hybrids, electric or diesel hybrid vehicles, etc.  On the last occasion the NTA was here, albeit in a different context, it was stated that no electric engine as yet can handle the workload of Dublin Bus whereby the fleet of buses travel to and fro for 15 or 16 hours a day.  How confident is the NTA that we will get to a point whereby the fleet is replaced or replenished for genuine climate change reasons, as opposed to political reasons, that will reap rewards and benefits?</p></speech>

Yes, we spoke about the fleet, particularly the double-decker fleet and whether one can achieve a fully electric double-decker fleet and get the range in terms of battery charging mechanisms.  I am confident that the development of batteries will be such that we will get to have in place fully electric double-decker vehicles at some point but our initial move is to have a hybrid fleet, rather than a fully electric one.  In our tests of a fully electric fleet, it would be a single-decker fleet that we would be looking to test initially with Bus &Eacute;ireann and in smaller towns, I would imagine.  That fleet is already available.</p></speech>

How are we really going to tackle the fact that 20% of greenhouse gas emissions are generated by transport?  We will do so by moving into the public transport space and away from individuals using private cars.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentations and have a number of questions for them.  They did not mention the departmental policy called Smarter Travel - A New Transport Policy for Ireland 2009-2020.  I also did not hear mention of the national cycling policy framework.  Is the Department being guided by its own policies for smarter travel and the national cycling policy framework to achieve emission savings?</p> <p>  The 2009 report was fairly shocking because one could see, in 2009, that we should have been shifting towards sustainable forms of travel for public transport.  We have not moved in that direction and traffic congestion is worse than ever.  I know because I try to travel by train but I travel from Tramore to Leinster House in Dublin.  Unfortunately, a journey that should last just two hours takes four hours due to congestion and road traffic, which is highly frustrating.</p> <p>  Are there policies in place to encourage the use of electric bicycles?  I lived in the Netherlands for years and that country had incredibly efficient transport networks for cyclists.  Is there a move towards facilitating cyclists?  At present in Dublin, the buses use the cycling lanes thus leaving cyclists in a very precarious situation.  I have no seen change in the amount of support for cycling.  </p></speech>

What is the cost per tonne of CO2 emissions abated by using alternative fuels?  As more EVs are deployed, how will the revenue shortfall be recouped?  According to the Department of Finance, it is studying this matter but what is under consideration by the two Departments?</p> <p>  What increase in emissions does the NTA foresee in the greater Dublin area, GDA, to 2035?  Will it revise the GDA transport strategy in line with national targets for CO2 reduction?  Did the Department and the NTA refuse to approve hybrid buses for Dublin in 2014?  Why would they have done so?  What are they doing now to accelerate approval?</p> <p>  I am frustrated.  I listened to Mr. Doyle's presentation but with all due respect, I do not believe we are taking the urgency evident in the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and applying it to policy to mitigate and adapt to climate change as required.</p> <p>  I have a further question.  There are concerns about the effect of sea levels rising on transport infrastructure.  For example, the Waterford-Rosslare rail line is constantly under threat of flooding when there are heavy rains.  What is the Department doing to address adaptation measures in such circumstances?</p></speech>

I am a fellow Waterford person, so I am familiar with the road, the journey from Tramore and so on that she mentioned.  Deputy Butler was also in attendance earlier.</p> <p>  The Senator's first point was right.  If someone ditches a diesel or petrol car for public transport or a bike, the effect from a climate change perspective will be the same as switching to EVs.  We have had many questions about EVs.  More than 50% of emissions come from private cars.  Given that our population is highly dispersed, many people will be reliant on cars where the settlement patterns make it difficult to provide public transport alternatives.</p><p>It is natural that a lot of the discussion tends towards these issues.  I spoke about the levels of investment and the significant increases in public transport investment over the coming years.  We have worked very hard on arguing for this investment and now that the funding is available we have to deliver, and this is a critical point.  I thank the Senator for that observation.</p><p> In terms of smarter travel, the lost period of investment after 2009 is probably the most significant point.  We are now back to investing heavily.  Following last year's budget we were able to announce a more than doubling of our investment in public transport over a short number of years and we were able to invest in cycling.  We have had specific questions on how much is invested in cycling.  Quite often this is very difficult to state because there are various types of vehicles on the road and various programmes.  A quality bus corridor can benefit cyclists.  Some of the investment in the Luas has also done so.  We are now able to say that this year and over the coming three years we have set aside &euro;106 million or &euro;110 million specifically for investment in city-based cycling.  Over the same period we have specified &euro;50 million to &euro;55 million for greenways.  With regard to BusConnects, which Ms Graham touched on in response to an earlier question, it is very difficult to say specifically how much of a more than &euro;2 billion investment is for the cycle lane element but we can see that in the programme more than 200 km of improvements to existing cycling lanes and routes and new routes will be delivered.  This is where the real game is at in terms of cycling for commuting.  We have seen significant improvements, particularly in Dublin-----</p></speech>

I was speaking about improvements in terms of infrastructure.  I probably should not have used the term "improvements".  We have seen significant increases in the numbers.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about incentives for electric bicycles.  The bike to work scheme allows an individual &euro;1,000 of tax relief and my understanding is that electric bikes come under this.  I am pretty sure I am correct in this regard.  A proposal made in 2014 for hybrid buses was also mentioned.  I am not aware of this but I can check it.  I suspect there was an issue with regard to differentials at the time in terms of price.  It comes back to my point on whether it is a question of getting one, two or three busloads of people out of their cars.  This was probably the issue at that time.  We can certainly check whether a proposal was made back then.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Behan to deal with the questions on alternative fuels and adaptation.  A specific question about rail was asked and in my opening statement I mentioned the work Irish Rail has been doing.</p></speech>

We are very willing to undertake it for climate reasons and a variety of other reasons.  However, it is internationally acknowledged that as we progress, transition to the use of alternative fuels will provide the most cost-effective pathway for the transport sector to decarbonise between now and 2050.  As the technologies become mass produced and more widely available, their cost will reduce and it will essentially become just a cost of replacing existing vehicles, which happens anyway.</p> <p>  It is true that in the national mitigation plan the incentivisation of electric vehicles is the most expensive cost on the marginal abatement cost curve.  This is because of the price differential that exists between electric and non-electric vehicles and the significant cost of incentives to try to bridge customer acceptance and cost barriers.  The cost differential is significant.  We expect that over time this cost differential will fall and it is likely that alternative fuel technologies will become cheaper to manufacture than what is required for existing vehicles.  This is important.</p> <p>  This year, the Government published its national adaptation framework within which all Departments and sectors are working to produce their own sectoral adaptation plans.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is tasked with writing the transport sectoral framework and we are working with the other key infrastructure Departments.  With our various stakeholders and agencies we are identifying and mapping the critical infrastructure, mapping the impact of climate on the critical infrastructure and making an estimate of what we call the adaptation cost, which is the investment necessary to ensure we maintain transport infrastructure and services as we see various climate impacts.  This work is well under way.</p> <p>  In the case of the specific rail line mentioned, Irish Rail is well advanced in mapping its infrastructural vulnerabilities and assessing the various programmes that will be necessary to shore up - which is a phrase I hate to use in this context - and maintain infrastructure and services.  This will all feed into our transport adaptation plan as it is written.</p></speech>

All fleet carriages are being used by Irish Rail to deliver services.  Irish Rail has no additional capacity available.  We need to purchase fleet.  There is a lead-in time of three to four years for purchasing fleet and we hope to commence that procurement this year.  That is the lead-in time for delivery.  We are looking at other delivery options in the meantime because we have capacity issues on commuter rail services.  We are looking to see if there are leasing or other options whereby we can introduce fleet sooner.</p> <p>  On Luas services, we took delivery of longer trams earlier this year, which facilitated the extension of the green line.  More trams will be delivered in about two years to assist with capacity on the green line. </p></speech>

That needs to be taken into account in planning timetables.  What is the National Transport Authority doing about congestion in its timetables?  I hear all the time from people that they arrived on the bus arrives to Limerick to find the bus to Waterford had left ten minutes earlier.  Congestion is having an impact on efficient liaison between bus services.</p></speech>

That is why we are developing the BusConnects programmes in our regional cities, starting with Dublin.  That is about trying to get a much higher level of priority for our bus system to regularise journey times so that people know how long their journey will be.  That level of priority will avoid the types of issues Senator Grace O'Sullivan raises whereby one bus may not meet another because of delays.  We are continually looking at automatic vehicle location systems to see where delays are occurring with the operators.  We are building and changing timetables to ensure that buses that need to interchange are interchangeable.  If there is a particular issue in Limerick, I ask the Senator to let me know and we will follow it up.</p></speech>

The witnesses mentioned interdepartmental meetings that take place at a high level between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and other Departments.  Are the minutes of those meetings available?  If so, where can we find them?  Can we find out what is discussed at these meetings?</p> <p>  To give an example of another concern, a new road is being planned in Galway that is costing astronomical figures.  It will cost &euro;80 million or &euro;90 million to build 2 km of road belting through a sensitive environmental area.  Despite this there has been no consideration of how the rail network in Galway could offset road building.  How does all that fit in with what the Department and National Transport Authority are doing on climate change and how transport is supposed to work?</p> <p>  All the discussion today has been about Dublin, which is grand but I am from Donegal.  There has been no mention of anything outside of Dublin and the greater urban areas.  That is fair enough because the biggest change will happen in Dublin.  However, somewhere in the region of half the population lives outside of urban areas.   What efforts have been made to help people who live outside of urban areas to adapt and change?  If I was to come here by train I would not be able to do it in one day.  If I was to come by bus it would take forever.  How are we to adapt and change and how are the witnesses' organisations achieving that? </p> <p>  In that context, I note that a pilot rural transport scheme was financed by LEADER for the past several years.  What has been done about that?  What have the Department and NTA learned from that and what will they roll out for rural communities and the rural population?</p></speech>

We spoke a great deal about electric vehicles today, as Senator O'Sullivan pointed out.  We also spoke extensively about public transport not just in Dublin, in fairness, but in cities generally.  The Department and Ms Graham's organisation have done substantial work on rural transport links and the local link scheme.  The Deputy mentioned the latter, which is very active in County Donegal.</p> <p>  One statistic that is not official but emerges from some work we did several years ago is that traditionally the Department spent about 80% of its overall budget outside the greater Dublin area.  Considerable investment was made in roads and rail over the years.  That figure sometimes surprises people.  It will decrease in the next number of years as we invest in some of the large-scale city-based transport projects.  BusConnects is costed at more than &euro;2 billion and is very much focused on Dublin and regional cities.  We will also pursue projects such as the metro.</p></speech>

One aspect of the approach to the bypass that was probably different in this case was that the NTA, with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, looked at what could be done in terms of an integrated transport plan for Galway city.  This plan, which was developed in association with the plans for the bypass, has been adopted by Galway city and county councils.  There is proposed investment of &euro;200 million for BusConnects Galway to tackle congestion by improving public transport and promoting sustainable transport in Galway city.  The next stage is implementation of the strategic transport plan for Galway.</p> <p>  In terms of Donegal, I am sure some of the bus operators, such as John McGinley Coaches, would be disappointed to hear that the bus takes forever from Donegal.  The service is regular and popular.  Other services are also provided from Donegal.  In addition, local link in Donegal provides a significant number of services right across the Donegal.  We continue to support and try to develop even more links between towns, villages and rural areas to ensure people who may not have a car have a public transport service which will bring them to their local town.  We will continue to develop that for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I concur with other speakers, in particular Deputy Lahart, that charging points need to become normalised and as frequent as bus stops.  They need to be part of every street in every town and village to give motorists a feeling of security.  Having chargers in view would have a psychological effect and give people a sense that they can rely on the charging network and will not be left abandoned somewhere in the middle of the night.</p> <p>  Transport emissions are still increasing, year on year, even though we are trying to encourage electric vehicles.  We do not seem to be making progress.  One of the reasons may be the fibs we were told by car companies about the supposed clean emissions of diesel engines.  It is concerning that emissions keep increasing.</p> <p>  I obviously take a Dublin centric view of transport, for which I apologise to Deputy Pringle and other members.  Some 500 buses in the Dublin Bus fleet are to be converted to lower emission vehicles.  What fuel will they use?</p> <p>  This ties in to the BusConnects proposals put before the people of Dublin for the revamp of their bus services.  It seems the programme will be pushed out to 2020 or 2021 because of the overwhelming number of submissions made on the plan.  More than 20,000 submissions were made by Dublin people.  This could be viewed negatively in that it creates a considerable workload but it is also a promising development.  A number of these submissions raise questions about sustainable bus transport in the city.</p> <p>  As I stated at one of the public consultation meetings on BusConnects, it would be a missed opportunity not to introduce electric vehicles and buses when BusConnects is being rolled out in whatever form eventually emerges.  I hope it provides certainty on bus journey times within Dublin.  Progress on electric vehicles would be positive for the city as it help us keep Dublin at least moderately clean.</p> <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, attended an environmental conference today.  He pointed out that the number of landfills around Dublin had decreased from 127 in 2011 to two large sites now.  We talked about excess waste going into the black bin and that going into landfill.  Landfill sites are set to be eliminated.  I am not sure whether this is the area of expertise of the witnesses.  I visited a recycling plant and I am not convinced that we are recycling all the items we carefully place in our bins.  Is there any possibility of using landfill sites for biofuel production?  Would the NTA buy these fuels?  Maybe that is a question for a different agency.</p> <p>  On park-and-ride facilities, the Red Cow is chock-a-block every day, yet when the proposal for a new national children's hospital was before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, car parking was to be downgraded on the St. James's campus and people were directed to use the Red Cow park-and-ride facility.  Staff and patients, particularly children, were told to park at the Red Cow and use the Luas to access the hospital campus.  The Red Cow facility has exceeded capacity and many people cannot access it.  Most people do not bother trying and park instead on the streets surrounding the hospital, which causes further chaos in residential areas.  Are there plans to increase capacity at the Red Cow park-and-ride facility?  How would the NTA go about doing that?  Obviously, it would have buy a large amount of land to build car parks?</p></speech>

The point was well made.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding all of the efforts and work, whether in modal shift or on the uptake of technology such as biofuels, it is still the case that emissions from transport are rising.  The issue has probably been the most difficult to deal with internationally.  In Ireland, every transport trip is less emitting that it was in the past.  Emissions are not growing at the rate of demand for transport as the economy does well.  We spoke earlier about the types of trips involved.  We must manage to the greatest extent possible the growth in demand for transport, which will continue as our population grows and the economy hopefully continues to grow.  This will be done through the heavy investment we are making in public transport.  The change in technology is tremendously important for the existing scenario.  While I accept the issue cannot be split into two parts in that way, that is one way that we sometimes think about the issue in the first instance.  The Senator outlined the challenge we face.</p> <p>  Ms Behan will be happy to answer the question on alternative fuels.  Ms Graham will answer the questions on BusConnects and park-and-ride facilities.</p></speech>

It is likely to be a mixture of diesel hybrid and a compressed natural gas, CNG, fleet that we are about to test, with both Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, to see what are the emissions associated with that type of fleet.</p><p>That work will inform our procurement strategy which will start at the end of the year.  We hope the delivery of the low-emissions fleet will start late next year.  We also want to test a fully electric fleet and will do so in a small town, rather than in Dublin.  We will test to determine what all of the infrastructure costs are before we look to multiply it into a Dublin system.  Other European cities do not tend to use double-deck fleets the way we do in Ireland and the United Kingdom; therefore, we need to see whether we can have a good battery power system for a double-deck fleet.  We want to engage with manufacturers to see whether it can be delivered for the city at a reasonable price, with the infrastructure.</p><p> We know that we need to improve significantly park and ride facilities in the city region.  Constraining car parking within city centre areas and facilities is one of the ways to try to encourage people to use public transport, but there has to be a balance.  We have to make sure the public transport and park and ride facilities are available to allow people to make the change.  I was not aware of capacity issues at the Red Cow.</p></speech>

In November we expect to begin a significant trial of alternative bus technologies on routes in Dublin and Cork.  We hope to trial retrofitted buses, fully electric buses, hybrid electric buses and buses that use compressed natural gas along specific routes with similar driving patterns.  We will measure the tailpipe emissions to gain a real understanding of the carbon and air quality emissions in the context of all of the various technologies used.  We have been looking at all of the international literature which in parts has been conflicting.  It is probably fair to say we need to have a much better understanding of how the various technologies will work in an Irish context.  I refer to the way real bus routes are operated in Irish cities.  The trial will begin in November and we hope to see outcomes and results from it by the end of the first quarter of next year.  Initially, in the short run there will have to be a hybrid strategy for the urban buses.  We hope the results of the trial and our research will feed into the NTA's longer term procurement strategy as technologies improve and decisions on the necessary investment in supporting infrastructure are made.  If we transition the bus fleet in Dublin, Cork or any other city to natural gas or fully electric, significant infrastructure will be required to go along with it.  We need to gain a fuller understanding of how it will work in a real sense before we make longer term decisions.</p> <p>  I would like to answer the question asked about converting waste to biofuel.  A lot of the biofuel currently in petrol and diesel in Ireland comes from used cooking oil.  A lot of waste is already being deployed in biofuel in the transport sector.  The anaerobic digester in existence is using waste to produce biogas.  It is hoped it will have significant potential as the market for compressed natural gas increases.  Then we can substitute biogas for it in order to make it emit even less carbon over time.</p></speech>

They continually refer to testing.  The renewables section of this business is moving fast.  The landscape is continually changing.  Is there a school of thought or argument in favour of taking the information now available locally, nationally and internationally and making a decision on that basis?  Things are changing very fast.  I do not think Dublin, Cork or anywhere else in Ireland is unique or very different from other cities in Europe.  There is an argument that this costly process could slow the rate of progress as we move towards public transport run on renewables.</p></speech>

We will invest in 500 vehicles in the coming years, which is a massive investment.  We need to learn what we can from where some of these technologies are operated elsewhere.  The Senator is absolutely right when he says the technology has been changing and improving.  We are aware that there are different conditions, depending on how bus fleets operate or are deployed in various cities.  That can have an impact, but we have committed to not buying any more diesel-only urban buses from mid-2019.  As there is a date on it, it is an action point.  Testing is absolutely the right thing to do from a variety of perspectives, particularly climate change.  There is also value for money to achieved in lots of other things.</p></speech>

It has been discovered that key decisions can be made in looking at the networks and types of bus system in hand.  On that basis it is possible to determine what is the best technology to deploy in each context.  In the various cities where various technologies have been deployed it is a case of horses for courses.  We want to be sure we have the right solutions for our cities.</p></speech>

It is important to work out in a short timeframe what we are doing and what questions we need to ask.  The point I was making was that this was one of the most useful facilities we had because it allowed us to access information and opened up the process of drafting the new national energy and climate plan.  It was in that context that I raised the failure to obtain any of the reports we had requested from the Minister.  The Secretary General said he did not even know that we had submitted a request in advance of the meeting for a list of the new actions being considered for inclusion in the national energy and climate plan.  That is the interesting stuff.  I do not know how our request did not get to him.  We would be far better off if we could discuss those measures.  </p> <p>  As I understand this has to be done by Christmas, I would like to ask some questions.  First, what level does Mr. Doyle think transport emissions will have reached in 2030?</p></speech>

As part of the EU energy package, member states are required to prepare and submit integrated plans.  Naturally, that work is being led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the sister Department of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is mapping the various strands of the plan and has told us that it will be issued for public consultation shortly.</p><p>The transport sector will be a key component of it.  The measures in the national mitigation plan, NMP, will be built on and the investment in measures committed to under the national development plan are certainly a core part of that.  The outcomes of the consultation process will form the basis of our input into national energy and climate plan, NECP.  Our understanding is that December is the date in terms of this being an iterative process.  That is where we are on the question the Deputy posed.  If we missed something the Deputy was looking for before today, we  apologise but I was not aware of where he was coming from earlier on.</p><p> Can I ask Ms Behan to address the 2030 question?  It is a tough question so I will leave it to her.</p></speech>

We have a national target to meet by 2030, which is a 30% reduction on 2005 levels of all of our non-ETS emissions.  Every sector will be required to play its part in achieving that 30% reduction.  We have always believed, and it has always been acknowledged, that there needs to be a least-cost approach to reducing non-ETS emissions.  Measures should be deployed in the order and timeframes that are most cost-effective to achieve the transition that we need.</p></speech>

The TRAM people presented to us.  They estimate that to 2030 we have a 50 million tonne shortfall, and that this is something in the iterative process that we have to show and we have to start in 12 weeks' time.  How are we going to close that gap?  How much of that 50 million tonne shortfall does Ms Behan think transport would be responsible for in this iterative process, in this new national energy and climate action plan?  How much of that 50 million is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport going to help us reduce?</p></speech>

We have talked about how that is being co-ordinated across Government.  In the transport space, we are very focused in this area.  We have worked extremely hard to argue very strongly for heavy investment in public transport.  That has been a major focus of our work as a Department and of my personal work over recent years.  We now have a plan.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan made the very important point that it is not just about electric vehicles, EVs.  Even when people are in EVs, there could be a congestion issue, if we are not moving people onto public transport.  We focused on the modal shift piece.  We are technology-takers when it comes to electric vehicles in terms of private car use or other versions.  We are pressing extremely hard, albeit as technology-takers, to see standards improve particularly in the freight space because that is where-----</p></speech>

We have just heard three hours of that.  I want to focus specifically on the issue as to how we draft this new national energy and climate action plan.  The reason we called in the Secretaries General is that we will be asking the same questions to the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and all of the other Secretaries General.  We know there is at least a 50 million tonne shortfall on the modelling projections.  We are trying to get some sense as to what is the plan to address that.  Maybe this has not been done yet.  Has Mr. Doyle not sat down with the different Departments and said we know we have this 50 million tonne shortfall and asked how are we going to address it?</p></speech>

We are trying to focus every effort on trying to deliver those in the first instance.  Yes, we need to look at how much further we can go.  In the first instance, we have got to be very focused on the work that has been laid out.  For the past three hours or whatever, we have talked about matters which, given the Deputy's huge interest in this area, he has heard before.  I respect that.  From our perspective, we are making progress on implementing those key measures.  A huge amount of work has been done around electric and alternatively fuelled vehicles.  There has been good work done around alternative fuels, the biofuels obligation scheme, etc., that are having an impact across those key areas.  We have focused really heavily on trying to get serious investment into the public transport space.</p> <p>  In the past I have heard the Deputy talk about the balance between spending on roads and on public transport.  We are shifting that balance at this point.</p> <p>  In terms of all those really key things, we are looking at a country that has a dispersed population and where we are technology-takers.

That is a very significant increase in the level of service available in the Dublin region.</p> <p>  While we are building up the infrastructure projects, what we are able to do is change networks, improve services and add additional services.

There are projects such as N7 upgrade, which is going ahead now, there are projects to upgrade the N11, N2, N3 and the N4.  There are ten roads, that is, motorways and national roads, under construction now and there is not a single public transport project.  Ms Graham tells me that emissions will fall.

Even at a time when Ireland had difficulty in terms of investment, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport invested in that project, which has now been delivered.</p> <p>  We also have to invest continually in the rail infrastructure to keep it maintained and more than &euro;200 million is invested every year in the rail service.  We must keep our bus fleet within an age profile and must invest in it.  Again, tens of millions of euro are invested in the fleet each year.  We know that we have to radically improve our public infrastructure even more and the plans and the investment profile is there now and we must work on providing that infrastructure.</p></speech>

I personally argued successfully for rebalancing as prior to becoming Secretary General, I was in charge of public transport for a period and over the next five years, we are looking at investment in roads of the order of &euro;1.5 billion to &euro;1.6 billion whereas the investment in public transport over the next five years will be &euro;2.7 billion.  We will change a ratio.  The ratio was probably 2:1 adverse and it is now moved in the other direction.  This is not scientific figure but it is probably 1.5: 1 in the other direction.

The truth is that to date, it is ten roads and no public transport.  There are 55 other roads, between national roads and motorways, planned.  There are only three major public transport projects that I see.</p> <p>  Other than the Royal Canal, and I love the development that is happening there, can anybody name another major investment in cycling at present? </p></speech>

I suppose what we have to recognise is that in the downturn, when there was no capital investment available, we did put in place a strategic cycling plan for the Dublin region and for the regional cities, so that when we were in the phase whereby we now have investment available, we would be able to provide a network of cycle facilities rather than individual facilities that have not been connected up.</p> <p>  The BusConnects programme that will come forward and the bus corridors will see a really significant increase in the number of dedicated, segregated cycling facilities along all our key radial corridors.  That is really highly  significant investment.</p></speech>

The scale of the change we need is so great that the political support needed is also great and we are nowhere near it.  The number of cyclists went up last year but it increased by 2.9%.  That figure should be rising by 10% or 20%, there is a pent-up demand because the traffic is chaotic, and nobody can say how long it takes to get anywhere because one can run into gridlock at any time.  If we made the "safe cycle network", we would be and could be Copenhagen.  We should be doing that.  That is not an increase of 2% per year, but a jump we need to make.  The advantage of that is that the Minister could go into the EU negotiations that will happen in a few weeks' time and have an answer to the 50 million tonnes question, to which we do not have an answer today.</p> <p>  What is the climate emission of the additional measures that were included in the national development plan?

We spent a lot of time working very closely with our colleagues across Departments around this.  I think the outcome from the transport perspective was a very strong one in term of much-needed investment for all kinds of reasons, economic and specifically around climate change.  We have prioritised heavily shifting investment into public transport but we do have a road network of 100,000 km of roads in the country that must be maintained.  It is really important that our economy remains strong in order to pay for the types of investment that the Deputy raises.  That is a critical part.  Our focus to date has been very much on trying to get investment into the key public transport projects that we are trying to deliver.</p></speech>

We have to switch to low carbon.  We have to switch back to the core.  The national development plan abandoned that.  I cite Edgar Morgenroth, who I think was involved in the early stages of the planning framework and just about anyone with any climate, transport or energy expertise to whom I talk will say that we just went back to the old roads model.  It is not going to work, it will not work in easing gridlock, economically, or in lowering emissions.</p> <p>  Could I ask for a written report from the Department in the next week, if possible or within the timeframe we have, asking how much of the 50 million tonne gap the Secretary General thinks the transport sector will be able to provide, because we have to know that when we are questioning the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or other Departments.</p><p>I would love to get that figure from the Department, as well as information on how it will be delivered.</p></speech>

In essence, it is proposing different variables of measures that can impact on fuel consumption on the transport side and on heating consumption and how they affect emissions between 2021 and 2030.  The research is looking at energy use first and then emissions.  It is very difficult to extract the transport piece from that.  It is considered as an overall energy system and the modelling is conducted on that basis.  I am not sure it will be feasible to answer the Deputy's question within that timeframe.  I would hope that we would be able to do so in the context of the development of the NECP.

I am not obsessed with modelling because it is difficult to model the future completely.  I am sorry to become annoyed about a personal matter but I cycle down Leeson Street every day and I am nearly killed on a regular basis.  We have a system that is completely car dominated.  More schoolgirls are driving to school than are cycling to school.  Could we model for changing that?  Could we make it safer for our children to cycle or walk to school so that 30% of our rush-hour traffic is not accounted for by children being driven to school?  This is so important in the context of diabetes and other health problems.  It is not just about modelling but also about a vision for the future, about creating a city and a country that are attractive to live in, that are efficient and that work in every way.</p></speech>

It relates to appointing the day for the establishment of the first technological university in the State.  Under section 36 of the Technological Universities Act 2018, the draft order must be approved by resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  A key element of the national strategy for higher education to 2030 is to consolidate the institute of technology sector and establish technological universities of increased scale and capacity.  Technological universities will have an emphasis on the social and economic development of their regions through the provision of programmes at levels six to eight in the national framework of qualifications.  They will also provide programmes to qualify students at postgraduate levels nine and ten.  They will develop and use new knowledge through industry-focused research.  They will enhance the pivotal regional and national role traditionally played by institutes of technology in facilitating the widest possible access and progression by students of all ages and from all socioeconomic backgrounds through a multiplicity of full-time, part-time, blended and online learning approaches.</p> <p>  It is not overstating matters to say the Technological Universities Act 2018 is seminal legislation for the higher education sector.  Last November I reintroduced the Technological Universities Bill on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  With the committee's informed assistance and support, I took the Bill through the legislative process to its signing into law by the President on 19 March.  Shortly thereafter, in late April, the first application for designation as a technological university under the new Act was made by a consortium, comprising the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown and the Institute of Technology, Tallaght.  On 17 July my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, granted the consortium's application following a comprehensive international expert advisory panel assessment and receipt of the supporting views of the Higher Education Authority.</p> <p>  Under section 36 of the 2018 Act, an appointed day for the establishment of the technological university is required to be made by ministerial order.  The order shall also specify the name by which the new technological university will be known, in both English and Irish.  The order must be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  The draft order which is before the committee provides that 1 January 2019 shall be the appointed day for the establishment of a new technological university.  It also provides that from the appointed day of establishment the new technological university shall be known as Technological University Dublin in the English language and Ollscoil Teicneola&iacute;ochta Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath as Gaeilge.</p> <p>  When established, Technological University Dublin will be Ireland&rsquo;s largest higher education institution, with almost 28,000 students and more than 3,000 staff.  The establishment of Technological University Dublin, the first ever technological university in the history of the State, on 1 January 2019, if the draft order is approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, will be a milestone event in the evolution of the higher education sector.  I hereby commend the draft order to the committee for its consideration and approval.  I thank colleagues for their kind attention.</p></speech>

I particularly welcome what is happening in Dublin.  There is teaching, learning and research ongoing in the Dublin Institute of Technology and the institutes of technology in Tallaght and Blanchardstown which will come together while retaining separate campuses.  We offer an unequivocal welcome, as there was much toing and froing.  It is to the considerable credit of new politics that the legislation has come through and there is a result from it.  There has been much criticism of new politics that nothing can get done, but this could not have been done during the term of the previous Government which had the biggest majority in the history of the State.  The joint committee played a key role in that regard.</p> <p>  Student housing is a major issue.  It is of concern that it seems to be a priority of the new technological university that housing be provided for its incoming president.  It has been suggested in newspapers that a property known as Kirwan House has possibly been acquired to accommodate the president.  It is almost 2,000 sq. ft in size and a rezoning application in Dublin will be required.  It seems we have got things the wrong way around.  No accommodation is provided for the presidents of the institutes of technology, although I know that there is in other universities and that the issue can be controversial.  There is a severe shortage of accommodation in Dublin.  With the positives of this announcement, the establishment of the technological university at Grangegorman will bring with it the negative of a huge number of students looking for accommodation in the area.  I hope the Minister of State can shed some light on what is going on in accommodating the incoming president.</p></speech>

It is heartening to read in the international advisory panel's report how positive the current collaboration between DIT, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown and Institute of Technology Tallaght is.  I congratulate everyone who has worked on this project at all three institutions as well as the TU4Dublin programme lead on their work.  I wish the students and staff members the very best of luck in 2019 in what is an exciting new chapter for higher education in Dublin and Ireland.</p> <p>  I have one comment about some issues raised in the advisory group panel's report, particularly the possibility of unexpected expenditure after the merger, which I believe was raised by the HEA when recommending this report.  Can the Minister of State outline how she intends to ensure that unexpected but necessary funding for TU4Dublin during this phase will not come at the expense of other higher education needs?  This is particularly important in the context of a higher education system that is seriously struggling and needs a huge influx of new investment to meet demographic demand.  </p></speech>

To be fair, much collaboration took place beforehand and the expert panel could recognise that.  In respect of the future funding of higher education and following on from the Cassells report, the Deputy knows that my Department commenced a programme of reform in the higher education sector.  An interdepartmental working group on the future funding of higher education was established to consider this.  My Department is progressing a number of different funding priorities in higher education, including reforming the model by which higher education funding is allocated and ensuring additional funding is being tied into the delivery of important national policies, for example, in educational disadvantage, addressing skills gaps or promoting research and innovation.  These various requirements will be monitored through the systems performance framework 2018 to 2020 and the strategic dialogue and the performance compact processes will be overseen by the HEA.  Last month, we announced a &euro;5 million higher education innovation and transformation fund and ring-fenced that funding for multi-campus institutions.</p></speech>

It is terrific that it will be in time for the final year students in the three institutes of technology and will allow them to graduate as university graduates.  This is very significant.  They will be the first cohort of students to do so in the history of the State so it is a milestone towards which everybody has worked.</p> <p>  I thank all the members of the committee for their work on this Bill to assist the Minister of State with it.  The point regarding the accommodation crisis involving students is well made.  It would be remiss of me if, on behalf of the committee, I did not say that we are very concerned about this.  Deputy Thomas Byrne rightly raised the issue.  There are other costs for those living in or just outside Dublin such as transport.  I spoke yesterday about how when a student in my own town of Newbridge wants to take a train to go to college or university in Dublin, the monthly train ticket costs &euro;186 and it costs another &euro;120 for the Leap card.  All it costs for somebody travelling from Sallins in Naas is the Leap card - &euro;30.  The two towns are only seven miles apart but there is an extra cost of &euro;186.  A parent recently came to see me who has two children in college.  This person is paying that amount of money - almost &euro;400 extra compared to somebody living seven miles away.  This is something we must examine.  </p> <p>  Bearing in mind what Deputy Catherine Martin said regarding the three suggestions made by the Cassells report, as the Minister of State is aware, we have been waiting for an economic assessment report from the Department.  We do not have the resources to do it within the committee and have asked that this be carried out with regard to the economic impact of all of the three options on the State and the individual.  We awaiting that report.  Until we get it, the committee will not be able to make a final recommendation so it is hugely important and while the Minister of State is here, I must take the opportunity to remind her of that.  If she wishes to comment on that, I would be happy to hear it.  </p></speech>

A total of 3,000 spaces are being built at the moment while 7,000 have planning permission and another 7,000 are in the pipeline for pre-planning so it is going ahead.

I have nephews and nieces in some of the colleges and I know it presents difficulties for parents.  The Chairman also asked about the Cassells report.  We have taken that and are getting advice in Europe on it.  However, it is not just about throwing money at a system that is exactly the same as it was in 2016.  We are looking for reforms and at apprenticeships and where there are skills gaps so we will be looking for reforms when there is more money coming through.  I really need to tell the committee that since 2016, an extra &euro;100 million has gone into current spending.  Spending in total for higher education is &euro;1.6 billion so that money is there.  Of course, I will looking to make sure we increase that in the forthcoming budget next Tuesday.</p></speech>

The reason we are waiting is because a commitment was made to give us the economic review of the impact of the three options.  Quite aside from current investment in higher education, which we welcome, we are asking the Minister of State to ensure that we get that economic review as soon as possible.</p></speech>

There is an extra &euro;600 million and after 2020, there will be an extra &euro;1.1 billion.  I have just told the committee that the entire budget is &euro;1.6 billion.  I am very cognisant that we need more investment in education and I want the right kind of investment in the sectors in higher education in which we need to invest.  I understand that the committee has received criticism but if members were sitting in my chair, they would get criticism every day.  We will just have to wait and see before we invest such huge amounts of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

We also want to hear from them on how best to ensure that the EU's development funding after 2020, which is currently subject to negotiation as part of the next multi-annual financial framework, continues to focus on global poverty eradication.

I am the CEO of D&oacute;chas, the Irish platform of international development organisations.  One of the two subjects to be discussed today is the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  I had the privilege of being in New York in July of this year so I want to give the committee a little bit of the flavour of that meeting but we also want to talk about the EU development funding, which is the second subject.</p> <p>  It is worth reminding ourselves that, as we speak, we are receiving more and more reports about the Indonesian tsunami.  Some 14,000 people have died so far but that number is likely to increase.  Some 62,000 people are displaced.  The United Nations is saying about 200,000 people are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.  It is just a reminder of the importance of international aid, bearing in mind that we have at least three Irish agencies on the ground, and also a reminder, I hope, of the vital work of NGOs in international development.</p> <p>  I last appeared before the committees in October last year.  It seems a long time ago.  Then we were all together for the launch of the committee's report in February this year.  That report was very welcome.  Some of the conclusions of the committee in the report comprise a good frame for the discussion today.  In particular, I draw members' attention to the importance of the SDGs underpinning Irish Aid's new aid policy but also Government policy and programmes.</p> <p>  The committee mentioned the importance of the Government increasing funding on overseas development aid, ODA.  With budget day very much to hand, it is important to remind ourselves of that.  ODA is so critical if Ireland wants to continue to be a credible leader on international development and the SDGs in general.</p> <p>  The committee referred in its report to robust structures and oversight mechanisms in regard to policy coherence for development.  That theme will be repeated today.  It is vital to keep our eye on that and continually ask how we have those prompt and good oversight mechanisms.</p> <p>  Articulated very well in the committee's report is the overarching theme of Ireland needing to maintain a strong principle-based aid policy with poverty eradication at its core.  Untied aid very much features.  It is also about strengthening the role of civil society.  These principles will need to be robustly defended, particularly in the ongoing negotiations on the EU budget.</p> <p>  It is worth noting by way of background that, on Tuesday, the T&aacute;naiste echoed many of these themes in his launch of Irish Aid's annual report for 2017.  In commending the excellent work of Irish Aid and the impact it is having, he opened his remarks by saying, "I stand here this year with the responsibility of a rich country."  He also talked about the need for Ireland to play, more than ever, an international leadership role in development.  He said we do not do big military spending or defence but that we do development as a core pillar of foreign policy.  That is an important context to our remarks today.</p> <p>  I will talk briefly about the high-level political forum in July.  Accompanying me today are Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Hinds, senior policy co-ordinator at Oxfam Ireland, and Ms Niamh Garvey, head of policy in Tr&oacute;caire.  They are present to help us with questions members may have and some of the detailed evidence and policy to back up some of our remarks and recommendations.</p> <p>  Let me turn quickly to the SDGs.  As many might know, it was on 17 July that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, presented Ireland's first voluntary national review at the UN high-level political forum.  It really was an important first step in Ireland's journey to implementing the SDGs.  It is important to acknowledge the role of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which in particular supported many civil society actors to be in New York and share that experience of Ireland.</p> <p>  For all the fanfare that comes with these kinds of high-level meetings, however, we need to ask ourselves, three years into the process, why Ireland has only just got into the starting blocks.  Members all know we led the negotiations on this transformative agenda through the role of Mr. David Donoghue, the UN ambassador, in September 2015 but we now find ourselves playing catch-up.  In particular, we draw members' attention to the limited time given for genuine stakeholder engagement as we got ready for New York.  For example, an outline of the voluntary national report was shared at a stakeholder meeting but there was no detail or time for substantial input.  As a result, Coalition 2030, of which D&oacute;chas and many of its members are part, produced its own shadow report, which I am happy to share with members today.  It gives a very different perspective on progress on the SDGs.</p><p> It is also important to note that we were given an opportunity to feed back on this national implementation plan on the sustainable development goals, SDGs, which we now have done, and yet we struggle to see that any of our suggestions were taken on board when it was finally produced in April of this year by the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  We were particularly concerned that the implementation plan is far too general, with very little effort at prioritisation or identifying where the extra funding is going to come from.  Perhaps most relevant for the conversation today, however, is its weak mechanisms for stakeholder engagement and oversight.</p><p> The following are key themes that came out of New York and, in particular, our dealings and conversations with civil society.  First and foremost is that civil society&rsquo;s voice is still not being heard in the voluntary national review, VNR, process.  Indeed, it is very worrying trend that for many countries it is not there at all.  Civil society is being silenced, both globally and in Europe.</p><p> Countries continue to report at the high-level political forum, HLPF, as if it is a tourist profile, a chance to say how fantastic we all are, without a genuine, honest reflection of some of the obstacles to achieving this transformative agenda.  It is important to acknowledge that Ireland in its report was perhaps more honest than most.  I need to point out, however, that we have only got to the stage of how we are aligning with the goals rather than tackling some of the challenges.  In particular, the critical criteria around policy coherence is completely absent in most member states' reports.  The accountability mechanism is consequently too weak to hold these countries to account, especially where there are serious human rights violations.</p><p> We also recognise that the UN is not playing the strong co-ordination role that it needs to play to get all stakeholders into the room, in particular, civil society, nor has it the clout to ensure that greater political accountability and leadership.  Here again it is worth briefly referencing the T&aacute;naiste's recent speech where he went so far as to say that the effectiveness of the United Nations as a platform for negotiation and compromise can no longer be taken for granted.  It is this weakness of multilateralism that has to be of great concern to us all.</p><p> These few reflections from the high-level political forum resonate greatly with our own experience in that it is comforting to know, perhaps, that we are not alone, but we do acknowledge that some progress has been made.  In particular, we commend the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has been genuinely engaging with the SDGs through the White Paper consultation process, which is happening right now.  We are encouraged by their commitment to the &ldquo;leaving no-one behind&rdquo; principles, to understanding and critiquing what this means, and to identifying the most marginalised and how we can reach them.  Similarly, we very much welcome the consultation process around the White Paper, which is a very good example of stakeholder engagement, and we need to see more of it.</p><p> Today is not the time to ponder about what we have done but to think about the SDGs and what we need to do in the future.  In particular, the next 12 months will be critical.  At the high-level political forum in July next year, there will be discussion around the reform process and the accountability mechanisms around the SDGs.</p><p> The following are four key recommendations that we believe are particularly relevant to this committee.  First, Coalition 2030 has consistently called for the Office of the Taoiseach to take the lead.  It has to take this responsibility for the delivery of the SDGs if there is going to be the whole-of-government approach that this delivery demands.</p><p> Second, we need to see a much more credible stakeholder forum established, which includes Members of the Oireachtas.  This forum needs to consider an independent oversight function of progress on the SDGs, as well as allowing a space for critical dialogue.</p><p> We would also ask this committee to consider proposals to ask the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to request Government to SDG-proof, as it were, the budget each year.  Only then will we truly know if we are on track and that we are monitoring these goals as they need to be monitored.</p><p> Underpinning the success of the SDGs for developing countries will be funding through overseas development assistance, ODA.  We support this committee&rsquo;s own report, which asked that the Government to publish a roadmap with sustainable percentage increases to ensure we meet the 0.7% target of gross national income, GNI, on ODA.  Very specifically on budget 2019, we need to see an increase of at least &euro;147 million.  That equates to just 0.05% of GNI*, but it will at least see us back on track to an upward trajectory to meet that 0.7% target.</p><p> It is important to reference the significance of public awareness if this global commitment is going to make it.  Public awareness is very weak across Europe and here in Ireland, and this should be a concern for us all.  In Ireland, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, accepts that there is insufficient effort to raise public awareness both at home and abroad.  There seems to be an expectation that this is what civil society will do, and yet there is no serious funding to do this.</p><p> Let us be clear that unless the Irish citizen is behind this bold vision of the SDGs, it will struggle to gain political traction and the prioritisation that it deserves.  We need to see the Government and all political parties putting greater effort into meaningful public participation around this whole-of-government approach.</p><p> On the future of EU development funding, as the committee knows, the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, will determine the budget of the EU for the next seven years, from 2021 to 2027.  The negotiations are upon us now and over the next six months, so this a real opportunity for Ireland to translate its development and humanitarian aid commitments into reality.  It is also a huge opportunity for us to influence the EU and get it to agree on our vision for development co-operation, as rooted in those European values of global solidarity.  Let us be clear as what is at stake here.  The budget for external action alone under the MFF will equate to roughly &euro;108 billion in real terms.  In addition, there is a peace facility and a humanitarian instrument.</p><p> Discussions on the MFF are taking place against the backdrop of Brexit.  We heard recently from the head of CONCORD, our European national platform, when he talked about the divisiveness in Europe and how it is turning increasingly inward.  Migration and security preoccupations and attracting private sector investment without sufficient safeguards in place have become the new narrative and, perhaps, priorities.</p><p> The European Commission published its overall MFF proposal in May 2018, outlining its main priorities.  The main proposal is to bring the European Development Fund and other external instruments into a single instrument, known as the Neighbourhood, Development and International Co-operation Instrument, NDICI.  This will essentially combine 12 previous external instruments ideally into a more simplified and interlinked way of funding.  The proposal around the NDICI was released in June this year and it is important to say that it does contain some positive elements, including an overall increase in funding for development.  It also re-emphasises the re-commitment of the EU states to devote 0.7% of GNI to ODA.  We also welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal to keep humanitarian aid separate and to increase this budget from &euro;7.1 billion to &euro;11 billion, in recognition of the reality of the global humanitarian needs that have almost doubled.</p><p> However, the overall direction of the negotiations around the NDICI is taking a worrying turn.  In short, the EU self-interest appears to be prevailing over the need to keep the EU&rsquo;s actions focused on poverty eradication, the achievement of the SDGs, and its own consensus on development.  Especially worrying from one of our members, Front Line Defenders, is the talk about the lack of specific support to human rights and civil society space.  It also points out, for example, that poverty eradication, which should be the primary aim of the EU&rsquo;s development co-operation, is not explicitly mentioned in the NDICI.  Financial allocations to the work of human rights defenders and civil society is expected to be reduced, and there is a real concern that funds for sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, will not be sufficiently protected.</p><p> It is important to remind the committee that Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the EU is significant and is a huge part of our ODA, running at about 26% of the annual aid budget, which is about &euro;192 million in 2017.  We recognise very much the importance of this contribution.  The added value of working within the EU in development and humanitarian action is essential and allows us to give economies of scale and efficiency and enable a stronger impact.</p><p>However, we need to acknowledge that, with Brexit, we expect a deficit in both funding and policy influence within the EU, and we are calling on Ireland to step into that vacuum and play that leadership role.</p><p> To do that, we make some specific recommendations.  We need to see significantly more resources to ensure strong oversight around the strategic direction of the new NDICI.  This will need to include resources for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Irish civil society to play a stronger policy role to bring strong evidence to bear on the debates within the European Union.</p><p> We also ask the committee to write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade ahead of the next Foreign Affairs Council on 26 November to share some of civil societies concerns and request regular reports on the committee, particularly over the next six months, to understand Ireland's position around the negotiations on the MFF.  We feel this committee needs to have a stronger oversight role, for example, calling on the Department at least once a year to provide information on whether funds are being used in line with its stated policy.  It is essential that we ensure that Ireland's ODA contribution is used for the intended purposes of poverty eradication, untied aid and supporting civil society.</p><p> We welcome the fact that Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, is part of the development committee of the European Parliament.  There are elections in May, and while we are not sure what the outcome will be, we will be urging very much that an Irish MEP remains on the development committee to ensure strong oversight of funding.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time and I am very much open to questions.</p></speech>

It is nothing personal that members of the committee will have to leave for priority questions in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  I agree with the key recommendations and the need for a whole-of-government approach to deliver the SDGs and for the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to proof the budget each year.</p> <p>  Is Ms Keatinge proposing a model for the stakeholders forum that can better track the Government's record on delivering the SDGs, to spread the message about them, or both, or to push the Government to act on the SDGs?</p> <p>  Ms Keatinge pointed out that public awareness of the SDGs is very weak, weaker even than awareness of the millennium development goals, MDGs.  Why is that?</p> <p>  Ms Keatinge said she struggled to see that any of D&oacute;chas' suggestions were taken on board by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, the voice of civil society is not being heard, and policy coherence is absent.  Is Ms Keatinge saying that we are going through the motions on many of these issues?</p> <p>  I am struck immediately by goal No. 14 and conserving and sustainably using our oceans and seas.  We know about the use plastic.  There is supposedly an island in the Atlantic Ocean the size of Britain and France.  The use of single-use plastics is strangling and destroying the planet.  We all use our seas so there needs to be a global approach.  Five trillion grocery bags are used globally each year.  Ten million plastic bags are produced per minute.  This is a flavour of the challenges.  Microbeads are going into the food chain.  It is something we cannot do on our own, but we have a responsibility to act, as people who are sharing the planet.  Is there a role for D&oacute;chas and others in this?  Is there a role for the Government taking a lead by banning microbeads?  There seems to be a reluctance there.</p> <p>  Part of the difficulty is that we are signing up to this but the follow-up is very slow.  Ms Keatinge said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was better and much more advanced at engaging.  One of my questions relates to the business and human rights implementation group.  It was something that was agreed to be introduced in 2014 but still has not been.  I am concerned that its role would be to guide State-owned companies and the Government in human rights implementation but, at the same time, for instance, the ESB is buying coal from the Cerrejon mine in Colombia.  The lands are like something on the moon, the indigenous people are being forced off their land and the water is being destroyed.  We have signed up to sustainable goals and Irish companies are involved in the likes of that.  There is a contradiction there.</p> <p>  The European Commission admitted that EU development funding is tied aid.  Does that concern Ms Keatinge?  That issue has come up at this committee on a number of occasions.  Would she agree that Irish ODA cannot be fully untied if it is giving significant amounts to EU development funding which may end up as tied aid?  A total of 30% of Ireland's ODA is spent on EU development funding, yet the accountability and transparency around this funding is very low when compared with the rest of our ODA spending.  Does that concern Ms Keatinge?</p> <p>  Is Ms Keatinge concerned that the EU development funding is shifting towards policies aimed at rewarding undemocratic and autocratic governments in the northern half of Africa to encourage them to ensure that those seeking refuge do not make it to Europe?  I am talking about Libya and some of the failed states.</p></speech>

Starting with the stakeholder forum, it is important to acknowledge that we need a forum to start talking about these issues and how to take forward issues like oversight, public engagement and so forth.  There are many good examples.  In Germany, they are calling on independent experts to come in and play that oversight role.  We in Ireland are not even having that conversation yet, and that needs to start now.</p> <p>  I hear what the Deputy says about the Government going through the motions.  The Government did have to start making some progress because it had to report in New York.  That said, we are three years on and there is not the urgency that is needed.  The next 12 months are a real opportunity to keep that momentum going.</p> <p>  I want to pass over to my colleague to talk about SDG 14 in particular and business and human rights.</p></speech>

Within the broader coalition of the 2030 grouping, we collaborate with a number of allies in that broader network who have been working in this area.  There is a high level of concern around the use of single-use plastics and some exciting campaigns by some of our allies in that network to reduce Ireland's dependence on such plastics, microbeads being a fantastic example if that were to progress.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe makes exactly the right connections between business and human rights.  We have mentioned human rights defenders and we are seeing huge attacks on human rights defenders globally and, in particular, environmental and land activists.  The footprint of companies in terms of the loss of indigenous lands for such communities is worrying.  The Deputy is right to name Ireland's national action plan on business and human rights, which was launched just over a year ago and contained some commitments for activities within the first six months of the plan's existence that have not yet materialised.  We urge and would like to see the establishment of the oversight group that was committed to in that and a beginning of the roll-out of the work plan.  There were clear steps in that national action plan that need to be implemented as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The national action plan is about voluntary commitments by Ireland, which are very important.  In addition, internationally there is a process towards developing a binding UN treaty on business and human rights, and we would see this as an opportunity for strengthened regulation around the activities of companies in the context of their human rights abuse footprints.</p><p>We would like Ireland, as part of the European Union, to be more supportive and to champion the need for such a treaty.  A working group meeting is taking place between 15 October and 19 October to discuss it and we would like Ireland to be a proactive voice for it.</p></speech>

From the perspective of civil society, there is transparency around where money goes for grants.  In fact, we have to account for every cent of EU funding that we use.  The question is about transparency around the strategic direction and how decisions are made.  In this new EU instrument there is much more unallocated funding which should allow greater flexibility, but we need to be concerned about how decisions are made in this area.  For this reason, we need not just transparency but oversight.</p></speech>

The big concern for us is the fact that they are collapsing 12 instruments into one broad instrument and foreign policy, home affairs and policy and development objectives are being collapsed into one body.  There is also a concern that short-term European political objectives, particularly around migration, security and trade, will take precedence over development objectives.  I will follow up on this for the committee.  We have particular concerns around tied aid.  The budget has a &euro;10 billion cushion for emerging challenges but very little clarity about what that means and what issues will be covered under the cushion.  We are worried that an increasing focus on the neighbourhood region will mean more focus on migration control and security over the effectiveness of development, which is the core principle of ODI aid.</p></speech>

It is very helpful to have an emphasis on the implementation of the sustainable development goals.  This committee has heard from Mr. David Donoghue and the role Ireland has played but it is important that we focus on it again.  I also thank the witnesses for their kind words about the committee's report.</p> <p>  The witnesses made some strong recommendations and I suggest that the committee endorse them.  One action we are being asked to take on EU funding is to write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade ahead of the next EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 26 November to share the concerns of civil society and to request regular reports to the committee on Ireland's position on the MFF.  That might address the issues raised by Dr. Hinds.  Ms Keatinge reminded us that Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, is part of the development committee of the European Parliament.  I suggest we engage with him and ask him to come before us to talk about what is going on in the development committee of the European Parliament.  It would be a very useful engagement.</p> <p>  I have a couple of specific questions arising out of the presentation in respect of the implementation of the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  How do the witnesses propose that engagement with civil society in the voluntary national review process can be improved?  I was not clear whether they said engagement was poor at international level, following their experience in New York, or whether it was at national level.  What could this committee do to address that?  They also said they wanted the Department of the Taoiseach to take lead responsibility for the delivery of the SDGs.  There is an interdepartmental group of senior officials, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, and an interdepartmental working group chaired by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also playing a central role, but I am not clear why the last of these is essentially the lead Department for this.  If the Department of the Taoiseach is already involved, why is it not taking the lead?</p> <p>  Should we send our report to the Department of Finance again to remind it of our suggestion for a roadmap to meet the 0.7% goal?  It might be worth making the point to the Department, even at this late stage, rather than commenting retrospectively after the budget next week.</p> <p>  The witnesses referred to a number of SDGs in respect of which we are performing well, such as SDG 1 on having no poverty but SDG 5, on gender equality, is not listed as one of the goals in respect of which Ireland is performing well.  I am aware that the Irish Family Planning Association submission to the all-party group and to the White Paper on Irish Aid has proposed that greater emphasis be placed on the goal of gender equality, particularly given our reality after the repeal of the eighth amendment.  This should be reflected in policy and funding for sexual and reproductive health and the rights of women and girls, and it should be done at international level as a support for the efforts of other states to counterbalance and resist the current US Administration's aggressive attacks on sexual and reproductive health and rights.  Ireland has supported a strong resolution at the UN Human Rights Council in recent weeks on preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights and we are doing well in some ways but the witnesses might comment on what we could do better.</p></speech>

We are hoping to reach ours by 2030 and there was a call for the date to be brought forward to 2025.  I believe the UK has reached its target.  What impact will the fact that the US is reducing its overseas development budget have on the shortfall in overseas development aid projects?</p></speech>

Civil society in every country seems to be saying it is not getting a role and there have been lots of different tales.  In one country civil society organisations said the government contacted them three days prior to its report, asking them if they had anything to say about it, and in other countries they were not consulted at all.  The story is slightly better in Ireland but I do not think there has been a genuine dialogue and we did not feel we could shape the report in any way, which is why we produced our shadow report.</p> <p>  I appreciate Senator Bacik's reference to SDG 5 as it is very important.  The beauty of SDGs is that they link what we do at home with what is going on overseas.  We want the White Paper to contain a strong leadership role on gender equality.  I think it is there but we need to keep pushing it.  Maybe there will be an opportunity to bring the two roles together and to make sure what we do at home is coherent with what is happening overseas.  It would be great to have more dialogue on that.</p></speech>

I do not have the exact figure but the Deputy is correct that the UK has reached the target, as have a number of Scandinavian countries.  I will come back to him with the exact number but I believe there are between five and seven countries which have met their commitments.</p><p> On the question from Senator Bacik on the interdepartmental groups, the predecessor to the sustainable development goals, SDGs, had a place in the Rio negotiations and the Department of the Environment, as it was then, had a historical role in representing Ireland in this regard at the international level.  That may explain why this is housed in a particular Department.</p><p> On the connections between policy coherence for development, which has interdepartmental groups, and the SDG process, which has interdepartmental groups, there is a common thread in that.  Regardless of the existence of the groups, the issue is the effectiveness of the groups in meeting the ambition for a more whole-of-Government or more policy coherent approach.  The OECD Development Assistance Committee, DAC, review of Irish Aid has consistently pointed to policy coherence for development being one of the weaker areas of Ireland's development programme.  Regardless of the institutional make-up, what we suggest is most important is the transparency of the meetings and the ability of civil society to know what is on the agenda or to feed into discussions.  Ireland's aid policy, One World, One Future, which is currently under review, would have committed to biannual reports by the interdepartmental committee that would be shared with the Oireachtas for discussion and debate.  It would be very important going forward, whether for the SDGs or the aid programme, for a report on the whole-of-Government approach and how well Ireland feels it is doing on coherence to be shared with the Oireachtas and this committee.</p><p> In regard to the meaningful engagement, while I was not at the high level political forum this year, I attended last year and went to some UN training on voluntary national reviews, given Ireland's voluntary national review was coming up.  The UN had to produce guidance on what meaningful engagement of civil society should look like for countries developing their voluntary national reviews.  What we saw with Ireland's voluntary national review process would not have lived up to the standards outlined in that guidance in terms of the establishment of a steering committee that included civil society to oversee the production of the report, or of the opportunities for civil society to see and meaningfully comment on a draft of such a report.  Ireland showed some good steps in terms of including stakeholder commitments on the website and so on, but we have not lived up to the guideline standards provided by the UN for voluntary national review.</p></speech>

I place the word "coherence" in the context of Tuesday evening's launch of the Irish Aid report, which I attended.  The question I asked there of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, concerned the debate we were having last night on double taxation.  We know Irish aid is effective and is making a difference but, on the other hand, unless we get right the bits that do not fit into the jigsaw of coherence, we will not be able to get to the end point, which is Irish aid and all aid doing itself out of a job.  One of the ways to do that is through developing world countries' ability to raise their own taxes and to sign treaties, like the double taxation treaty with Ghana we were debating last night, in a way that is beneficial to the developing countries.  However, we know from what we have seen, and some NGOs are doing great work on this, that it does not appear to be beneficial to Ghana in the way it should be.  For example, there are particular examples which suggest that what Ireland will get is much better than what Ghana will get in regard to royalties.</p> <p>  This brings in another issue which I believe NGOs could take up, namely, the arms trade.  To take the EU, the figure at the back of the Irish Aid report was for more than &euro;70 billion in EU funding over a wide variety of areas, yet none of the SDGs will be realised unless we have peace.  Therefore, as the money is going out with one hand, those countries that are or were major donors are raking it in from the arms trade.  I do not think we are strong enough in making those points and while President Michael D. Higgins has made the point, this is something the NGOs and civil society have to talk about much more.</p> <p>  On coherence, we are not doing well and, at times, we are doing the easy bit.  That is not to say it is not making a difference - of course, it is.  What is great about Irish Aid is the way in which it works with local communities.  It is not coming in and telling people what to do but working with them.  It is about local empowerment.  However, unless we get the other two bits right, it is not good enough.</p></speech>

This is a problem generally.  I do not think the public are fully aware of the large sums of money being spent, that they are being spent by somebody else and that we do not get a full report as to where they are being spent or by whom, or a report as to the progress that is being made as a result of this money being contributed.  This is a real weakness in the local democratic process.  It is lack of information.  We assume that D&oacute;chas and other groups will get on and do our work for us but that is not the way it should be.  We should be part and parcel of that work.</p> <p>  I have been in the D&aacute;il since 1981 and I can never remember regular, strong debates about the whole issue of how we spend overseas aid, or getting reports back and getting publicity so the public are made aware of how this money is being spent.  I am not suggesting for one minute that these moneys are not being spent properly.  It is all to do with communication.  I have listened to the witnesses talk about the report, so I can learn a lot, but I am one of a privileged few getting this information at first hand, and it will not be reported nationally.  That is a problem we have, as a committee.  While I am not saying we want publicity individually, we want what we discuss to be presented to the public and debated.  As a committee, we should do as the witnesses have suggested.  I would go further and suggest we should get a quarterly or half-year report on all these issues, and that what comes from this committee should be brought onto the floor of the D&aacute;il so that, hopefully, in that way we would create some sort of awareness.  There is plenty of D&aacute;il time available during certain periods of the year when very important issues like this could be debated.  I suggest that we make a recommendation in our report that we get more D&aacute;il time to make people fully aware of where their money is being spent, how it is being spent and by whom it is being spent.  This would give some recognition to bodies like those represented today that are doing very important work because, by and large, nobody knows about it.</p> <p>  From my point of view, this is a communications problem.  We spend too much time talking about minor issues and giving D&aacute;il time and publicity in the newspapers to matters that are far less important than what we are talking about today.  My basic point is that we need to raise the profile of the work these bodies are doing and of how overseas development aid is being spent.  People do not pick up their newspaper and say: "That is very interesting.  I did not realise we were doing X, Y and Z."  The reason is that these matters are never covered.</p><p> I suggest that we make a strong recommendation in our report to increase the PR in respect of what is happening, not for our sake but for that of the public.  Perhaps a six-monthly or annual report from D&oacute;chas, Oxfam and Tr&oacute;caire could be debated in the D&aacute;il.  It would help the profile of the agencies and the causes they are pursuing.  Through this committee, we could give greater information to the public.  That is my suggestion.</p></speech>

Perhaps, with the agreement of members, we could ask that it be built into the year's parliamentary activities and that the Minister reports twice a year to the D&aacute;il on overseas development assistance and the aid programmes.  Perhaps it is a recommendation that we, as a committee, could make to the Government Whip's office or to the Business Committee.</p></speech>

When we met the Minister, Deputy Naughten, in New York, we made the proposal that there needs to be a D&aacute;il debate on the voluntary national review.  It is a countrywide thing that needs to be shared with people.  The Minister was supportive but we need to see progress on it.  Coalition 2030 has in mind to hold an event some time in November to share with the committee some of the findings from New York.  Members of the committee will certainly be getting an invitation and I hope they come along to it.  I fully endorse the idea of better communication.</p> <p>  I will address Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's points on coherence.  She knows what it means and I fully agree with her.  We have been talking about the stakeholder forum.  That is exactly what the forum needs to be about.  It needs to have dialogue where there is incoherence rather than having a dialogue asking how we are doing.  That is the message I would like to get across to the committee.  I fully agree with the Deputy on the arms trade.  This is an important issue.  I began by referring to the importance of Ireland playing a global leadership role.  We have already been seen to show leadership on the issue of small arms and in other areas.  This is our opportunity and we need to grasp it.  I heard what the Deputy said about civil society stepping into that space.</p></speech>

The latter is one of Oxfam's core priorities.  We work in coalition with partners in Ireland, many of which are D&oacute;chas members, through the Tax Justice Network.  In the areas of, in particular, tax and climate, which Tr&oacute;caire is very involved in, policy coherence is essential for alleviating poverty and reducing vulnerability.  Integrity and coherence are also really fundamental to building Ireland's influence in bilateral and multilateral spaces.  There is a huge amount of work we can do on that.  We advocate for a solid policy coherence mechanism which is appropriately resourced to identify conflicts and mandated to deal with them.  We thank the committee for its support on the tax issue.</p></speech>

We see climate change as one of those building blocks.  On the Minister's input at the high-level political forum reporting on the voluntary national review, Ireland's report acknowledged areas where progress is being made.  Two areas the Minister highlighted in which Ireland is not making progress are housing and homelessness and climate action.  They were the two big issues that the Minister identified as major challenges for Ireland.  I reiterate my colleague's points.</p> <p>  I was inspired by President Higgins's comments at the conference hosted by our colleagues in Concern a number of weeks ago on the arms issue.  The last major campaign I remember in terms of the NGOs was on the cluster munitions ban.  As Ms Keatinge mentioned, Ireland has shown leadership on that issue before.  It is something we can take away in our planning.</p></speech>

I support the aid that Ireland is to the fore in providing.  My colleagues have mentioned awareness and how we make the Irish people aware of how important the aid they give is and the great work it is doing.  One of my main concerns is the toxic atmosphere in the United States where the number of asylum seekers will be reduced to a third of 110,000, which was the number a couple of years ago.  It concerns me that such a terrible attitude is gaining traction.  Ireland is one of the few European countries that is still pretty level-headed in the context of politics and the direction in which we are going.  That is not to say it could not happen here.  It is very important and I always ensure when I am speaking to my Irish-American colleagues that they remember from where they came.  We were the first asylum seekers before the term was invented.  It is a really worrying aspect for those of us who are advocates in the United States.  It has been accepted, which is terrible.  We have to make sure the Irish people understand what is going on and that we retain the giving attitude we have in this country.</p></speech>

I hope to be part of the committee in the near future.  The witnesses have spoken about worldwide and national awareness.  There is a role for D&oacute;chas to take a lead on that as it is the umbrella body for all the organisations.  Perhaps D&oacute;chas could access funding to make the people aware of what is going on.  Rather than having seven or eight different bodies, D&oacute;chas could be the lead player in that and could be responsible for informing the public.</p> <p>  Everyone talks about the UN, which is a huge body.  It is becoming more and more ineffective.  I see the EU becoming a much more effective body because it is a smaller grouping.  The near neighbour fund and the accountability for it was mentioned and its focus on migration was mentioned.  Migration comes about because people in certain sub-Saharan countries want to believe they are heading for the promised land.  We should be developing the promised land in their own countries.  Some of that funding could be directed towards that.  Rather than looking at it as a bloc of people coming in, maybe we could direct the funding back to the countries this migration is coming from and work towards that.  I see D&oacute;chas having a role in that.</p> <p>  Accountability has been mentioned.  I keep going back to my little bugbear which is aid effectiveness.  I do not hear much about it now.  It seems to be gone off the agenda.  I would like the opinion of the witnesses on this matter.  That is what we should be going back to.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and I were very much involved in a programme to get parliamentarians in countries where aid money from here was going to make their governments accountable.  That is probably the best way of doing it rather than us, as parliamentarians in Ireland, chasing up where the cents are spent in Ghana, Tanzania or Mozambique.  For example, parliamentarians in Mozambique should make the Government of the country accountable for the aid.  Much of the money is pooled rather than being allocated to specific areas.</p><p> Deputy Barrett has argued there should be a debate in the D&aacute;il.  There should also be a debate in the Seanad.  It is a much freer forum and there are much better opportunities for us to discuss this more openly.  I suggest to Seanad colleagues here that we make a drive to put it on the agenda.  If the D&aacute;il wants to follow the Seanad, so be it.  </p></speech>

The committee should rest assured that the two issues of public awareness and aid effectiveness are very much at the heart of the conversation around this White Paper consultation.  They are not forgotten at all.  Coming back to the issue of awareness, I very much share members' concerns.  We need to move from awareness as a public relations effort outlining what we do and who we are to a much more nuanced conversation about the impact of aid, why we do it and why it is so important to us in Ireland.  That is the bit we are all struggling with.  Everybody who has responsibility around public awareness needs to come together to think that though.  Certainly D&oacute;chas is taking that really seriously and trying to bring forward some ideas to help Irish Aid support us in that endeavour.</p></speech>

It has been identified in the sustainable development goals, SDGs, that safe and orderly migration makes positive contributions to development.  In the proposals the EU Commission has put forward we are particularly concerned about the references to fighting, tackling or mitigating irregular migration.  Aid should play no role in stopping people migrating.  That does not abide by aid effectiveness principles or commitments the EU has made in the European Consensus on Development.  We are looking for strong safeguards to ensure that aid money is not used to stop people migrating to Europe.  As a previous speaker said, efforts should focus on-----</p></speech>

We should twist that approach around so that it looks as if it is going to benefit the people on the ground, rather than those people in transit.</p></speech>

Aid money should be about alleviating poverty and reducing vulnerability.  There are examples of aid money being used to facilitate mobility especially across border regions, where, for instance, pastoralists may need to cross a border to access livelihood options.  That is a positive example of how aid money can be spent to encourage livelihoods through migration if needed.  There are also very negative examples.  For instance the EU trust fund for Africa has funded support to the Libyan coast guard, which is about the detention and reception of people who are in vulnerable situations and are trying to seek safety in Europe.  I completely agree with the Senator - the purpose of aid is to reduce vulnerability and alleviate poverty, and that is where the focus should be.  It should not be on stopping people who are in need of safety from reaching it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.951" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Garvey" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018100400002#G00900"><p>Senators Lawless and Lawlor both made the connection between awareness on the part of the Irish public and Irish people acting as global citizens.  Beyond the support given to the official development assistance, ODA, programme or the SDGs, that means being actively concerned and involved in some of these global issues.  That can be a counterpart to some of the more worrying trends we are seeing in the US and across Europe, the changing attitudes and retreat from human rights norms.  One of D&oacute;chas's central messages to Irish Aid as we develop our new international development policy is about the need to maintain the core principles and values at the heart of the Irish Aid programme.  Irish Aid is consistently ranked the highest in development effectiveness, quality poverty focus, 100% untied grant aid etc.  That really needs to stay at the heart of the programme.</p> <p>  I have had the pleasure of attending a number of public consultations as part of the process.  The Irish public is very proud of that aspect of the Irish aid programme.  That is something to build on.  In the submissions of D&oacute;chas and Tr&oacute;caire to the White Paper consultation we acknowledged that Irish Aid has become a reputable leader in the area of development education.  That concerns engaging the Irish public about these issues at a really meaningful level.  In the context of populism and isolationism, we really encourage Irish Aid to build on that reputation and continue to invest in development education as part of the Irish Aid programme.  We have suggested putting 3% of the ODA spend towards development education.</p></speech>

They have highlighted a huge number of very important issues and their engagement with the committee was very worthwhile.  Many of the issues they raised are issues we have raised through our own paper.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett mentioned education and communication, which we have highlighted in our own paper as well.  We have also outlined the need for innovative ways to communicate with the public and let people know about the good results that come from their money, whether it is given through taxation or on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>  Senator Lawless referred to the toxic atmosphere in the United States.  Unfortunately the atmosphere is not improving in Europe either.  Brexit governs our lives, particularly where I come from.  I represent two counties in southern Ulster.  Brexit is on the hourly agenda for people like myself.  The EU budget will be affected by Britain leaving the European union.  Britain has a good record.  I think it was the government of Mr. Tony Blair and Mr. Gordon Brown which set the 0.7% target.  They put it in legislation as far as I recall.  It is to their credit.  I think it was one of those two Prime Ministers.  The European Union also has a good record of providing funding.  </p> <p>  Several of us went as a committee to the House of Commons and attended various meetings in London.  We met the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee.  We also met the chair and other members of the International Development Committee.  Those we met were very adamant that Britain would continue to be a very significant contributor.  I gather that Britain will be co-operating with the European Union and with other countries through the European Union structures in regard to development aid.  That is what we took from what the committee.</p> <p>  The Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, is a very serious issue.  The new configuration, with one budget covering a number of areas, needs to be watched very carefully.  Attention must be paid to how that money is disbursed and where that expenditure goes.  We can follow up the witnesses' recommendations, to which Senator Bacik also referred.  There is agreement from the committee in that respect.  We will write to the Minister in advance of the November meeting of the Council of the European Union.  We will also have the T&aacute;naiste here.  His next meeting with us will be on 13 December.  He reports to us on all the issues discussed at the recent Foreign Affairs Councils and we will raise those issues with him.  We will engage with Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, to see if he can make a presentation to the committee.  We will also write to the Minister for Finance again in regard to the forthcoming budget and the need to work towards achieving the target of 0.7% of gross national income, GNI.</p> <p>  I thank our witnesses again for their ongoing engagement.  It is disappointing to hear from New York of the lack of regard for the Stakeholder Forum.  That is disappointing because we see the great coverage UN meetings get in our broadcast and print media.  It is unfortunate if key stakeholders are not given the respect they deserve when those meetings take place at a very important forum.</p><p>I propose that we suspend for a few minutes and have a photograph taken with our visitors in view of Deputy Barrett's suggestion that we are not making the public sufficiently aware of the good work of these bodies.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Ms Derville Rowland, the director general for financial conduct, and Mr. Ed Sibley, the deputy governor for prudential regulation.</p> <p>  As the Chairman has indicated, I will divide my introductory statement into two parts.  In the first part, I will provide an update on the tracker mortgage examination and the outcome of our recent culture report.  In the second part, I will turn to the broad macro-financial outlook and outline the main issues and risks we see on the horizon, including non-performing loans, NPLs, and Brexit.</p><p>First, I wish to focus on the culture report, which builds on our conviction that consumers are best protected if firms not only comply with our regulatory requirements but also invest in organisational cultures that reward consumer-focused behaviour and penalise harmful behaviour that seeks to skirt around the duty to treat customers fairly.  By way of wider context, I note that in the past decade we have seen many financial misconduct scandals around the world.  At home, the mistreatment by banks of so many tracker mortgage customers has shown that financial misconduct is a substantial risk to households and firms that rely on the domestic system for the provision of financial services.  Our tracker mortgage examination - the largest, most complex and most significant customer protection review we have undertaken to date - was undertaken to ensure lenders identified those customers harmed by this mistreatment and paid appropriate redress and compensation.  The latest data show that by the end of August lenders had identified around 38,400 affected customers, including cases resolved before the examination was launched, and had paid &euro;580 million in redress and compensation.</p><p> Some 93% of affected customer accounts identified and verified had received offers of redress and compensation by 31 August.  Four of the five main lenders are close to completing their redress and compensation phases and we are exerting significant pressure on the remaining lender to finish its process.  Our bank-by-bank supervisory review of the conduct of the examination is also significantly advanced but will not conclude until the process is completed.  We will continue to challenge them where necessary to confirm that all groups of affected customers have been identified and included for redress and compensation.  On a separate track, enforcement investigations are in train in respect of six lenders.  In the past couple of minutes, I have focused on numbers at the macro level, such as the thousands of people involved.  However, we all fully acknowledge that the statistics do not give the full picture.  When we think about the individuals who have been harmed, especially those who have lost a home or a property, we fully recognise that this has had a devastating effect on them which numbers cannot capture. </p><p> This examination has exposed further evidence of a clear lack of consumer-centred culture in lenders.  Even in how the examination itself was conducted, let alone the original tracker problems, we found some banks adopted a narrowly legalistic approach, offering initial compensation proposals that fell well short of our guided expectations.  The examination raised serious questions about the current, not just historic, culture in the banks.  This is why we were pleased to work on the culture report requested by the Minister and published in July.</p><p> Why are regulators focused on the concept of culture?  The report is the latest step in the strengthening of our supervisory approach in recent years to focus on conduct and cultural issues.  This is a process of evolution.  In the wake of the financial crisis, our immediate focus was on strengthening the solvency and stability of the system and enhancing protections for consumers.  A lot was done at that level and I emphasise that banks and other institutions have more and better-quality capital, more sustainable funding structures, are better governed and are more strongly equipped to deal with any difficulties in the future.  I refer also to macro-prudential measures.  For example, through stress-testing we focus on banks' ability to withstand adverse shocks.  In response to the misconduct we have seen, there is much more extensive conduct regulation in order to protect consumers and investors.</p><p> That said, all of these rules and regulations should be reinforced by an additional focus on the organisational cultures of these firms.  The boards and senior managers of regulated firms are responsible for ensuring that organisational cultures are focused on enhancing consumer protection and ensuring that risks are well understood and managed.  Accordingly, how best to achieve this has become an increasing area of focus for regulators.</p><p> From a supervisory perspective, the importance of focusing not only on risks that materialise but on advance risk management has led to our introduction of the consumer protection risk assessment model.  This is designed to help supervisors assess how risks to consumers are identified and managed within firms.  Another important dimension of this is to improve the levels of diversity at senior levels in financial services firms.  Diversity can improve decision-making, reduce the risk of groupthink, improve risk management and, in doing so, ensure organisations give sufficient priority to the experience and treatment of their customers.</p><p> I will now outline the report's findings.  Our work underlines the fact that organisational culture is built on a shared purpose and vision as well as standards such as professionalism, honesty, integrity and accountability to deliver fair outcomes for consumers.  This is what we expect in all the firms we regulate.  The culture report is built on focused studies of the five main retail banks.  We have found they have not yet built a truly consumer-focused culture.</p><p> We went about this work with our counterparts in the Dutch central bank, a recognised leader in the assessment of bank cultures.  The review team was diverse in composition, comprising conduct and prudential supervisors, governance risk experts and organisational psychologists.  The reviews involved both on-site and off-site assessments to ensure the necessary analytical breadth and depth.  This included 1,400 hours of desk-based review of materials, more than 500 surveys and 75 interviews, in addition to observing meetings and assessing decisions in each bank.  Our assessment focused on the executive committee of each bank, since the senior leadership is responsible for driving the behaviour and culture in an organisation under the direction of the board.</p><p> An effective consumer-focused organisational culture is one in which consumer needs are adequately identified, discussed and taken into account.  We found that all of these banks have taken some steps to reinforce the consideration of consumer interest in strategy, decision-making and procedures.  Clearly, however, some are more advanced than others.  We also examined behavioural patterns in leadership, how strategic decisions are made and the general outlook of these firms which could put at risk the successful transition to a consumer-focused culture.  These cultures remain under-developed and some obstructive patterns of behaviour form a barrier to successful implementation.</p><p> For example, in some cases we saw executives continuing to operate in a "fire-fighting" mode.  This may have been suitable during the crisis, but may no longer be appropriate as we return to more normal conditions.  We saw too much focus on short-term and legacy issues, with insufficient attention paid to consumer interests.  We discovered some reversion to "command and control" in leadership styles.  We determined that the banks have much more work to do to ensure their organisations are sufficiently diverse and inclusive, particularly at senior level.  As I have indicated, this would be helpful in preventing groupthink, guarding against complacency and overconfidence and promoting internal challenge.</p><p> Will this report sit on a shelf?  What are we going to do with it?  Action points have emerged.  The board of each bank is required to make a number of steps.  Boards are required to investigate and assess potential drivers of these behaviours; consider what their executive committees need to do to address these problems; and create an action plan to address the identified concerns and mitigate the associated risks.  We expect banks to be proactive in promoting an effective risk culture and to have fully embedded conduct risk frameworks in place.  Additionally, there will be further enhancement of our supervisory approach, including more intrusive, targeted supervision of the conduct of the firms that pose the greatest risk of potential harm to consumers.</p><p>We think that is also in the long-term interest of the banks.  There are incentives for the banks to embrace the agenda also, given all that we have seen in terms of the costs of dealing with misconduct after the fact.</p><p> We think it is important in this entire procedure that banks understand the difference between seeking people's trust and establishing trustworthiness in their culture.  If banks wish to restore trust in their organisations, it must be earned by building a track record of consumer-focused behaviour.  We give guidance but it is the executive responsibility of each bank to build that culture.  It is not the case that one single culture can deliver.  Part of being a skilled manager of a bank is to build the culture that makes sense for the bank, but we require it to have a consumer orientation to make sure that those firms will deliver fair outcomes for consumers while maintaining financial resilience and appropriate prudential standards.</p><p> Another action point from the culture report is to reinforce our advocacy of a new individual accountability framework, to apply not just to banks but to other regulated financial services providers.  Such a framework would go significantly beyond the current requirements for staff to be fit and proper, it would set conduct standards for staff, and it would ensure clearer lines of accountability within firms.</p><p> The goal of the proposals is to act as a structured driver for positive behaviours and the recognition of individual responsibility.  Many regulated firms and their leaders behave ethically and honestly, and seek to drive effective cultures.  However, in order to guard against scenarios where that is not the case, the reforms will constrain the ability of senior executives to escape accountability for wrongdoing.  The reforms will require Oireachtas consideration and approval, and we would welcome any questions members may have on our recommendations.</p><p> I will stop there in terms of the part A review of the culture report, and the tracker mortgage examination.  We can turn to part B later.</p></speech>

The sanctions are in place and will remain in place and they are used by the Central Bank.  More than 122 enforcement cases have been concluded to date, with &euro;61 million of fines being incurred, and more than 12 individuals have been disqualified.  The fitness and probity regime challenges the competence, capability and integrity of persons who are entering into senior roles and those who are in place.  People have been disqualified there too and as we challenge we find more and more that a lot of senior people withdraw rather than face the challenge of the Central Bank.  To date, there are more than 50 cases of people withdrawing.  We have been to the High Court and the Court of Appeal to vindicate our right to use our enforcement powers.  The sanctions are in place and they are working.</p> <p>  The new legislative proposal will require the Oireachtas to approve it and to put it in place.  We aim to streamline the enforcement powers to make one uniform process, make some amendment to the current process, which would break the link between participation of an individual's conduct and that of a firm.  We think it would strengthen the ability to take enforcement cases in the future.</p> <p>  In respect of the individual accountability proposals, we are making a proposal in a comprehensive way that mirrors the leading edge of approaches in other countries for a set of standards and an individual accountability regime that would require legislative action on the part of the Oireachtas to bring that into force.  That is one of the parts in the report on which we are making a proposal but it is separate to the culture report, which will require action from the firms to improve their own culture.  We see that as a complement to strengthening the approach that we are adopting.</p></speech>

A total of 7,100 customers received redress before the examination and that is where the aggregate number of 38,400 comes from.  The information I am giving the committee is that, to date, 28,100 of the 31,300 customers are in receipt of compensation and redress.  I just want to be clear.  The high-level number is subject to change because it has not been entirely verified by the banks.  What that means is, as they go through their verification process, they find there is duplication of accounts, for example, and the number can change slightly.  We require them to be thorough in the final analysis and it has been our experience that the number can vary as people are checked.  In the round, the answer to Deputy McGrath's question is that there remains approximately 3,000 customers who have yet to receive payment who have been identified in the tracker mortgage examination.</p> <p>  It is important to say that about 99% of the customers who were identified, as of the end of last year, have received their payments.  The reasons people have not been paid are because they cannot be found or because the banks are engaged in complex discussions with them.  Where people cannot be found the money is ring-fenced in an account so it will be there for them.  Also, in the main, customers who were identified and verified before March of this year also have received their redress and compensation payments.  We closely scrutinise and monitor the payments that are being made by each of the lenders on a month-by-month basis and challenge them to get on with it.  It is our expectation that, in the main, most customers will have received their payments by the end of this year.  There may be some few that go into early quarter 1 of next year, but we continue to challenge that timeline.</p> <p>  Members will have seen from the Governor's opening statement that four out of the five lenders are making reasonable progress with respect to concluding this matter, and one is somewhat behind the others but we are putting significant scrutiny on them to keep up with the timelines to the maximum extent they are capable of doing.  It is also important to say that our own independent verification of the numbers continues because it is incumbent on us to make sure that the decisions that have been made about including and excluding customers is adequately and thoroughly tested through on-site and off-site supervision as well as data analytics.</p><p>We are doing that before we close out and give them the green light to say that is done.  </p></speech>

About 2,000 of those are verified and about 1,000 who are not verified and are going through the process.  All of those are timelined.  The identity of those customers has been established by the bank and there is a timeline for the banks to get on with their payment.  Each institution is being challenged and scrutinised closely by us to get on with that.  We expect most of those customers to be paid in the coming months.  Progress will be evident month by month.  I appreciate that it should not have taken this long in the first place but most of the customers in question surfaced in the examination more recently this year.</p></speech>

It goes back to the culture report where the delay, by and large, was foot dragging by some banks.  As we know, towards the end of last year, the banks more fully embraced their responsibilities in this report.  As Ms Rowland indicated, what has happened is that those who were accepted at the end of last year have, by and large, been paid except for some technical issues.  However, more cases came within the scope of this and the banks accepted that more of them needed to be included in the spring of this year.  These are the remaining ones to be paid out.  It goes back to the Central Bank not wanting to place an absolute deadline on this for fear of leaving someone behind.  Numbers have grown partly because we did not close out the review at any point.</p></speech>

Looking to the future, the good news is we have a concrete example from next door because it was introduced in the UK two or three years ago.  There was a question of whether it was necessary or a good idea and what consequences it might have.  We think we can see concrete changes in how UK firms behave and how their executives accept this elevated degree of responsibility.  This was also part of our submission to the Law Reform Commission earlier this year.  I will ask Ms Rowland to speak about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.989" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#F01500"><p>The origins of our proposal on the senior executive accountability framework are in our looking at the leading edge practices in other jurisdictions.  We made a submission to the Law Reform Commission last year encouraging this course of action.  If we take a step back and look at misconduct in financial services, a key driver for misconduct delivering poor outcomes for consumers can be a lack of accountability at senior levels in firms.  A heightened focus on accountability and responsibility strengthens the outcomes for consumers.  That is as it should be in properly run firms.  Our proposal in this regard has a number of elements, all of which complement each other.  The first is a very basic set of universal conduct standards which will apply to every body in all financial services firms.  One might say these are no more than one would expect of a right-minded individual in a well-run firm but these principles are very important.  Everyone who works in financial services, no matter what role they have from the top to the bottom, will be required to act ethically, with honesty, integrity, due skill care and diligence and, importantly, to be open and co-operative with the regulator and act in the best interests of the customer and treat them fairly and professionally.  However, is important to overlay that with an additional set of responsibilities on those who run the firms at more senior levels.  That is far more important because they hold positions of influence and it is very important to call that out clearly.</p> <p>  We wish to see the senior executive team, up to the board and the most senior people, have a higher set of standards and responsibilities in running the organisation.  We proposed that they should be obliged to ensure that the business is run responsibly and controlled effectively, that they can be held to account when that is not the case, that they must take steps to ensure they are in compliance with the regulatory frameworks and that they oversee that work effectively.  Complementing that, it is important that the business itself has a set of standards with which is must also comply.  The next set of complementary standards should be on the business so that it is very clear that it, too, has an obligation to act professionally, honestly, with integrity and in conformity with ethics.  Management and controls, financial prudence, client assets would all be part of that, as would managing conflicts of interest in the way that they communicate with their customers.</p> <p>  Under the senior executive accountability framework, which would be on top of that, the very senior people in the organisation would have a list of responsibilities that would be ascribed to them.  These would be unavoidable and it would be very clear what they are responsible for.  On top of that, the firm would ascribe responsibilities.  That would be complemented by a responsibilities map that the organisation would have to put in place.  There would be no more confusion or lack of clarity about accountability and responsibility.  We see that as going towards good governance.</p></speech>

Is there sufficient focus on the long-term goals and performance of the institution, rather than an excessive focus on short-term performance, share price, dividend expectations, profitability and so on?</p></speech>

The kind of debate about short-termism versus long-termism is not settled.  However, in finance, there is a deep conflict where an entity can make profits today by taking excessive risk or mistreating customers and the losses are down the line when an individual has retired and living at the seaside or something.  I will ask Mr. Sibley to explain the clawback principle in compensation schemes.</p></speech>

There is tension between the short-term incentives and longer-term incentives.  The Central Bank always endeavours to take a long-term view to ensure firms' business models are sustainable and they have sufficient resources over the long term, including plausible stress scenarios.</p> <p>  From a remuneration perspective, as Professor Lane has outlined, there are clawbacks in place for the banks for a number of years as to any variable pay they receive.  That is less relevant to the likes of AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB because, under Irish legislation, they do not get variable pay but it is part of the regulatory system now.</p></speech>

The Central Bank would never stop them making payments.  The opposite is true.  The Central Bank has been on to the banks to get on with these payments as quickly as they can.  The Central Bank separately goes back to check the compensation and redress payments to ensure they are in accordance with what they should be, as well as other dimensions to the banks' work.  The Central Bank has been very strict with the banks to get on with it to the best of their ability.  Some of the banks are limited but I can tell the Deputy that four of the five banks are making substantial progress with that.  We have them all timelined to put as much pressure on them to get the job done because we accept it is important they do that.</p></speech>

I can come back to the Deputy on that.  In order to make payment, there is a verification process because the approach is to identify groups of customers who have a common set of circumstances.  They should then be eligible for compensation and redress but it must turn into an actual review to ensure the customer can be specifically identified with the right account and getting the right number of people in that group, which must be done on a file-by-file basis.</p></speech>

The Central Bank is bringing challenge because it is on-site and off-site and looking at how the groups are constructed.  There has been less checking as the work has developed.  The Central Bank may uncover extra people who are entitled to compensation or, for example, challenge the banks' interpretation of the customer journey and the transparency requirements and impact.  There are no outstanding issues between the Central Bank and any of the lenders but the Central Bank has not finished all of its checking work.  The Central Bank is doing exclusion testing and reconstruction of the groups of customers and matching that with the information it has about the customer journeys to see are there any anomalies or exceptions.  It is possible that issues arise, and they have arisen and we are dealing with those.</p></speech>

A number of appeals are going through the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, and court cases are being taken against the institutions to ensure customers are adequately compensated and redressed.  Does the Central Bank have an indication of the numbers of people who have made appeals to the FSO, having exhausted the internal and independent mechanisms, and the numbers who have taken cases?  If the Financial Services Ombudsman or the courts find in favour of the customer and decides they were entitled to additional compensation, will the Central Bank ensure that the banks review the entire cohort, those individuals with a similar experience, to look at the appropriate compensation?</p></speech>

There are appeals systems within the banks before one gets to the ombudsman or the courts.  It is interesting that while the number of people taking appeals has been limited so far, a fair number have been accepted.  That is why the Central Bank is happy this appeals system was set up.  Typically, when an appeal is successful, it is because of something specific to the family in question.  There is some particular reason the family has suffered extra harm because of its individual circumstances.  The independent appeals mechanism within each bank is delivering for those individuals who have particular circumstances.  That does not rule out an individual or family wanting to go to the ombudsman or the courts.  I will ask Ms Rowland to respond on that.</p></speech>

The appeals steps are independent processes, in the main, for serious cases.  This is an additional step and an extra option that people have.  They could have chosen to go to the courts or ombudsman if they wished.  It would appear to be a reasonable option to see what the appeals mechanism will deliver and people are making appeals through the system.  They will have 12 months from the date of receipt of their offer to make the decision to go to the courts or the ombudsman.  That will, therefore, continue for some time.</p> <p>  The Central Banks expect the banks to be responsible and look at any decision of a court or the financial services ombudsman and consider the reasons for those decisions.  If there is something that affects a broader group, the banks have to take that into account because the Central Bank has demanded they look at the outcomes of appeals to see if there are systemic trends.  In any case, it may be there were circumstances particular to a family or individual that have no general application.  That is the reason the appeals step is such an important one because nobody can give compensation proposals in the general sense, when they may have to understand what is happening in a family circumstance.</p></speech>

The first part is whether the Central Bank is aware of the numbers that are currently before the FSPO or the courts.  The second, follow-on question is: if favourable opinions or decisions are given, either by the ombudsman or the courts, that would have a broader implication not just for the individual but a cohort of individuals who were not deemed as in-scope by the Central Bank or the banks themselves, or where the level of compensation was inadequate, will the Central Bank, as opposed to the banks themselves, review those decisions, instead of hoping the banks do the right thing when we know they have not done the right thing for the past five years or more on this issue?</p></speech>

We have information that is not in the public domain about the number of cases that are tracker-related and on hold before the ombudsman.  We have been in contact with him to be very clear that where cases wish to go and be heard with the ombudsman, that is the correct thing to occur.  We are monitoring the outcomes at that system level to see if we can spot trends in that conduct but, at the end of the day, it will be for the businesses to right the wrongs they have done to their customers, and they must be held to account for their conduct.  Where issues arise and there is commonality of cause from ombudsman decisions or otherwise, all roads will lead to the banks.  If they are responsible, they must fix it.  We will certainly be having regard to that but the effectiveness of that system must hold the banks to account for their conduct.  We are keeping an eye on this.</p></speech>

Professor Lane mentioned that the cost in redress and compensation has been &euro;580 million to date.  We know the cost to the banks has been in excess of that and it was said before by the Central Bank that it could be up to &euro;1 billion.  Are we now past the &euro;1 billion cost in terms of the tracker scandal?</p></speech>

While we needed the investigation - and we have seen the methodology and the volume of work and hours that were put into it - the key recommendations were made before it, as Professor Lane mentioned in regard to LRC review.  I was hoping there would be something more substantial.  If any of the four key recommendations were implemented, what would that mean in terms of individual accountability for the fact in excess of &euro;500 million was wrongly taken from 38,000 customers?  If the Central Bank had those powers, would any individual within the banks be held accountable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1021" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#H00900"><p>Let me emphasise that, within the culture report, while the recommendation on the accountability regime turns to the Oireachtas regarding additional legal powers, there is much else there with regard to other elements.  It is a step forward in terms of our expectations of the banks and how we engage with the banks.  I emphasise that all of the banks have remediation programmes issued to them.  We have learned through this culture report of particular issues in particular banks and part of our normal supervisory work is to follow through on that.  We cannot discuss those bank-by-bank individual issues here.  We have, therefore, focused on and highlighted this legal change.  The committee will have seen various officials come before it or before other fora to say, "Mistakes were made", in the passive voice, as if they were unaware of it and so on.  The whole point here is to flip the burden of expectation.  Under this new accountability framework, just as we are seeing now in the UK, a senior executive cannot say, "I did not see that email", or, "I was not involved in that decision."  If a person is responsible for building the organisational culture, that is a heavy responsibility and it means that even if the person is not directly involved in some key decisions, he or she can still be held to account.  There is the difficulty of establishing the chain of causation under the current legislation versus that-----</p></speech>

I have beaten the drum for years regarding individual accountability from bankers, which we need.  However, individual accountability from bankers where people see that nothing went wrong means nothing.  There is no accountability if the Central Bank cannot say something went wrong.  If the Central Bank had that individual accountability regime, which makes it clear a person can delegate tasks but cannot delegate responsibly, for which I have been arguing for many years, would it be in a position to hold individuals within the banks accountable in respect of the tracker mortgage scandal?</p> <p>  I acknowledge that the Central Bank did not make this initial recommendation here; it was done by the LRC.  However, this was done in Britain two and a half years ago.  There was a lead-in period to all of this and I believe the Central Bank is behind the curve.  It was slow in arguing for this to happen and, now, we are just following what is in place for a number of years in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  In Britain, the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, has said not only does it need individual accountability and the senior management regime to apply to senior management in the banks, it needs to hold the regulators themselves to the highest standard and it has applied the same regime to the Bank of England.  Is it proposed there will be individual accountability within the Central Bank in regard to the failures that may present in overseeing financial institutions, consumer protection or prudential regulation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1023" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#H01100"><p>Let me emphasise that we have a parallel project in the bank to develop our own senior responsibilities frameworks.  The Deputy will see on our website, when it is completed, phrases such as, "Here is what the governor is responsible for", "Here is what the deputy governor and the director general are responsible for", and so on.  In mimicking that framework and being clear about who is responsible for what, we have had a big internal governance project in the past couple of years to reform all of our committees and to be super-clear about the accountability lines within the Central Bank.  We hold ourselves to account regarding our performance as the regulator.  That is perhaps slightly different from the way the Deputy phrased it.  If we have failed, we will look at that.  However, if there is a failure by the management of a bank, the bank is responsible.  We cannot guarantee that every bank is going to conduct itself properly at all times.  Our accountability relates to doing the best job we can as the regulator; it does not relate to taking responsibility where the banks should be responsible.  I reiterate that we have this parallel internal project.</p> <p>  One interesting thing with the UK experience is that it reinforces the point that we waited.  I am not disputing that maybe we should be quicker and all of that.  However, when the Oireachtas moves to look at this, if it gets to it, it now has an evidence base and it is not just a hypothetical debate about whether this helps.  The Oireachtas can perhaps take testimony from the UK about how this has been implemented in the past year or two.  There were concerns in advance about whether this would scare people away and whether anyone would sign up to be the director of a bank, with this heavy responsibility on him or her.  With regard to the facts of life about how it is operating, the Oireachtas will have hard facts from the UK to deal with.  In general, I fully agree with the FCA.  We are onto it in terms of saying, "Listen, if this is what we expect of the firms, we have to have something like that for ourselves."</p></speech>

Professor Lane's last point was telling in that it was a question of, "Will this scare away bankers?", as opposed to, "They stole &euro;500 million from their customers and they have not returned it four years later".  Reckless lending is still not illegal in Ireland, although it is illegal in Britain.  Britain brought in these rules three years ago whereas we are still just talking about bringing in the rules.  I believe the Central Bank needs to take the lead in this regard.</p><p>The banking crash was ten years ago, when the Central Bank failed to act appropriately.  On the issue of accountability, I am not clear that if there was another crash, there would be a new inquiry which would give people the chance to blame the institution again.  Can we hold a Central Bank employee to account for turning a blind eye to the fact that the concentration of assets in certain sectors was way beyond what was required?  That is what we are looking at in terms of the FCA.  It is not just about knowing that certain people are in charge of certain areas, but that if that person fails, he or she can be held to account individually, or he or she should hold himself or herself to account.  I am not talking about systems failure, but the failure of individuals.</p></speech>

However, customers who have been involved in this process since it began three years ago are at their wit's end.  They cannot get answers to the most basic of questions.  I will give one example.  A person was on a tracker for months in 2007, then moved to a fixed rate.  The bank says that the person involved decided to go onto a fixed rate mortgage and, therefore, it is nothing to do with the bank.  These are basic scenarios which should have established answers.  There should be no ambiguity about these cases.  There were other questions about interests rates at a particular time.  A letter said that the tracker mortgage averaged 7.9%; that interest rate clearly is not correct.  The witnesses should know that the banks are telling consumers that a lack of decision-making at the Central Bank is holding things up.</p></speech>

They are fully aware of our view on all areas of this work, and have been clearly told by the Central Bank to get on with communicating the precise situation to all customers.  We have been very clear with the FSPO.  It has an agreement with us that in any cases to be progressed, there should be no impediment to effective communication to tell people whether they fall within or outside the scope of the inquiry, what their options are and how their cases are being progressed.  We went to great lengths to ensure the system of options for people was working and to ensure there was nothing in the way to prevent it from working.  We have been clear in communicating our expectations to each lender.  If that is not translating into actions for customers, it is important that we have specific information, because that is entirely contrary to our expectation.  Our communications have been unambiguously clear.</p></speech>

Inspectors go into the banks to follow up on all kinds of issues.  We check that banks are following through on what we require of them through a range of interventions.  We have a large staff of supervisors who are there to engage with individual banks.  An inspector might go into a bank and find something by conducting a check.  On other occasions, the inspector might have some information which has come via an Oireachtas Member or some other channel.  I want to emphasise that when a customer communicates with the Central Bank with something specific, we follow up and make inquiries.  For that reason, I would take a dim view of any bank which essentially misleads customers in its communications.</p></speech>

In terms of banking supervision, from a prudential perspective, there are approximately 45 inspectors today.  Other inspectors work in the area of consumer protection.  We have also dedicated additional resources to going into the banks because of the nature of the tracker mortgage examination and the need to go to the institutions to make sure they are delivering as we expect.  That has been supplemented by third-party checks commissioned by the banks under the instruction of the Central Bank and third-party checks we carry out ourselves.  It is hard to give a precise number of investigators.  There are scores of full-time equivalents that are inspecting banks on a regular basis.</p></speech>

It is looking at the conduct of the business and any persons who may participate in that - that is the legal framework through which they look - at the time that the tracker mortgage issues arose to acquire evidence to see if any rules were broken and what is the evidence supporting that.  They are looking at the conduct of the institution and the context of the senior persons who were in place at the time taking those decisions.</p> <p>  They also are scrutinising the conduct of the tracker mortgage examination as the examination played out in the business.  The committee heard about that earlier.  I refer to the behaviour with respect to how they behaved in the examination, redress and compensation behaviours, behaviours with respect causation and other matters.  All of the different regulatory frameworks are being considered and the evidence is being acquired and scrutinised from emails, minutes of meetings, interviews with employees and staff.</p></speech>

Then the options that would be available to them range from fine to disqualifications of individuals where the rules have been deemed to be broken that individuals participated in wrong conduct.</p></speech>

Whether one is in the system, the Central Bank in enforcement cases can pursue persons who were involved in the management.  That point was fought about in the courts and the Central Bank's view was favoured, which is that we can pursue persons in enforcement cases who were involved in businesses but who no longer are.</p> <p>  The power for fitness and probity is limited to applying to persons who want to work in the system or who are in the system, and we are seeking an extension of that.  We keep a record of all of that.  We keep flags on information, as is right that we do, about all of that.  If somebody wants to withdraw from an application, of course, he or she can do so but if the person ever came back, we have a record of that information and that would be ready to meet the challenge on a successive application.</p></speech>

The banks themselves have many places to hide because we do not get the information about individual banks.</p> <p>  The report on the culture is quite shocking.  I would ask the Central Bank representatives whether they themselves thought it was shocking.  It is shocking to think that there are executives within the banking system who are paid hundreds of thousands of euro, and there are banks making billions of euro, and up to all of this - this is why it is connected with the tracker mortgage - reckless business behaviour.  They do not even have clear lines of responsibility.  We are talking about clear lines of responsibility; we are not talking about a cr&egrave;che, a na&iacute;onra or a voluntary organisation.  We are talking about significant organisations.  It speaks of a toxic culture where nobody knew who was doing what or who was responsible for anything.  It is bizarre to read a report such as this of the culture in them.</p> <p>  The language used in the report does a disservice to those who have been most impacted by the toxic behaviour and the lack of any type of management skills, even the most basic aspects such as knowing who is responsible for what within an organisation.</p></speech>

The language in it feeds into the culture of protecting the institution.  I understand that the Central Bank does not have a direct line of responsibility for changing the culture within the banking system but I would have liked to have seen much plainer language in this.  The report almost smacks to me of when one reads an academic book on change management and cultural behaviour within any organisation.  I ask the Governor how many customer interviews were conducted in doing this report?</p></speech>

The Senator may have a different writing style to our writing style but the bottom line is we are saying this is not acceptable.  We are saying that this culture has to change and we are saying, through a combination of supervisory interventions that we are making and will continue to make and enhance, that we think it would be reinforced by the legislative change we are recommending.  It goes back to that phrase, "insufficient attention to a consumer focused culture".  In the minds of some bankers, this was seen as a kind of secondary obligation as opposed to being at the heart of how they do business.  This is the cultural shift that has to happen.  Our conduct mandate and the expectations of the public are that the banks take their consumer protection obligations seriously.  We all share that view.  How we phrase it is not the core issue.  It is underlined by the actions we are taking, and as I say, that could be reinforced by this legislative change.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Rowland to answer in terms of how the customer perspective fed into the review.</p></speech>

The focus of the reviews, because we saw the red flags in the tracker mortgage examination, the way that the compensation offers negotiated with the Central Bank were not what we expected and that we had to do more than 200 turns of challenge to get those up to any kind of a level at all, was precisely conduct in the wrong place.  The culture review was undertaken.  It was not a focus on the views of customers in the public, let me be clear, because we had a view on what that was, which was the lightning rod for undertaking these five cultural investigations.</p><p>The investigations were very detailed, forensic and careful pieces of work, with behavioural psychologists, prudential supervisors and conduct supervisors who focused on the senior leadership teams of the banks because these are so significant in delivering, from the inside out, the mindset and value the businesses place on customers and how they put customers, as they espouse to do, at the centre of their business, as well as the divergence from that.  The language in the report represents an overview of the specific lender reports, which each bank got, but it has very important and significant findings.</p><p> We are meeting the banks' boards and being very clear about our expectations.  However, the culture is for them to drive and it is for them to lead the tone from the top.  The focus definitely was on the senior executive team and how it will ensure it is clear about what that risk culture and consumer focus culture looks like, and how it will embed it into its structures and processes.  Precisely because we take this seriously, we will be in at firm level supervision measuring how the banks deliver that.  We will assess whether they look at the complaints people are making and find the patterns; how they train their staff; whether they are making sure their staff are trained to give outcomes that are to the benefit of the customer, not to sell 20 products to them that generate more profit; and whether they check to see what they espouse as the culture for consumer-centricity is in fact being lived.  The proof of the pudding will be in the work that they do and this will take time because clearly their behaviour has not been in the right place. </p></speech>

The Central Bank, in producing its report, did 1,400 hours of desktop review, 500 surveys and 75 interviews.  Ten years have elapsed since the bailout and the committee is discussing this report.  Is it not absolutely horrific that the banks are behaving in almost the same way they behaved leading up to the bust?  They are displaying the same arrogance, using the same methods of operation and there has been no change to their structures.</p> <p>  In terms of customer focus, the banks have numerous glossy advertisements that use catchphrases such as "the bank of you" and that sort of nonsense.  The first figure used in connection with the tracker mortgage issue was in the region of 8,700.  That figure has since increased to 38,400.  The people who are still experiencing difficulties in finding a resolution to the tracker issue with their banks, even though the number of cases has narrowed, will tell us they still encounter the aggression, bad manners, poor management and a determination to protect the bank at all costs, even if the sum involved is small money.  That is the experience ten years since the bust and it is what we have experienced through the tracker review and scandal.</p> <p>  The report is timely and tells us in reasonable language what many of us know.  However, if one were to describe the position in layman's language, one would say the banks are still getting away with it and still treating customers badly.  Is it not amazing that banks need to be reminded that the people with whom they are doing business are their customers?  Is it not incredible that the Central Bank must introduce certain protocols, sanctions and so on to make them view people as customers?  Consumers will be utterly shocked to learn that this report is now being presented and further work must be done on sanctions.</p> <p>  I will reflect on a few more issues.  The culture in the vulture funds and banking sector in Ireland is truly terrible.  As I repeatedly say, their behaviour should not be tolerated in any civilised society.</p> <p>  The tracker mortgage issue is the big example of banks ripping off their customers and then telling them, more or less, to get lost because they will not deal with them.</p> <p>  We also have the proof presented in respect of the EBS agents who followed the advice given by the Central Bank.  They did what was required of them in terms of looking after their customers and so on.  I have seen emails in which these agents were told by EBS to do whatever it took to sell X number of products each week.  All of that still exists.  The EBS agents have not been dealt with.  Tracker mortgage holders are still fighting their cases.  While &euro;580 million has been paid out, a significant number of them are in the appeals system or have gone to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  These people are still waiting for their cases to be dealt with.</p> <p>  The witnesses said that some of the recommendations the Central Bank will make have already been made in the report compiled by the Law Reform Commission.  I do not see much change in the banks.  I see some determination on the part of the Central Bank to deal with the issue.  However, I would love the Central Bank to suggest to the Government that it introduce legislation setting a standard that the banks would find it extraordinarily difficult to meet and that the Central Bank would penalise them and make them individually responsible should they fail to meet that standard.  The Central Bank is doing that to some extent but it should be far more forceful with the banks because they do not give a damn.  They do not care, are open for business and do what they want.  Matters are not being resolved.  </p> <p>  The global restructuring group, GRG, is another scandal that has yet to be dealt with.  Deputy Pearse Doherty raised a significant question which I will ask in a different way.  If there is a disagreement between the banks and the Central Bank on, for example, a case such as margin issues, which relates to PTSB, and a settlement is reached in one case, will that outcome be applied to similar accounts?  I believe that is the question Deputy Doherty asked.  How will the Central Bank establish that?   What degree of accuracy will there be in the context of the approach taken by the Central Bank?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1073" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#L00500"><p>I will make one general point in response to the Chairman and Mr. Sibley and Ms Rowland will comment on some of the other issues.  One way to think about the gear shift in regulation, not just here but globally, is that these cultural issues are not new but they were overlaid by an instability issue.  We had the reckless lending of 15 years ago and the facts that these banks basically collapsed, needed extra capital and needed to change their liquidity funding.</p><p>There has been much work to ensure these banks at the macro level of aggregate lending have enough capital to stand behind their businesses and are not overly reliant on short-term funding.  We should remember we have the mortgage rules now.  Those kinds of macro matters are being dealt with and there has been much progress.  With the stabilisation of those indicators, there is now more visibility of more hidden issues, such as how the banks treat customers.  The good news is the processes go hand in hand.  The fact that banks are in better shape in a prudential sense allows us to change our supervisory priority towards looking at a higher level of ambition and to ask not only whether banks are safe but whether they are adhering to the standards we expect them to adhere to in terms of customer focus.  This is a new reality and it is the next phase of supervisory focus.  There are permanent challenges to maintaining stability but if the banks are now in better shape, we can do more in focusing on customer treatment issues.</p><p> Mr. Sibley will deal with the Chairman's comments.</p></speech>

There has been a fundamental shift in the approach to regulation and supervision of the banks and other financial institutions.  That is both from a prudential - or safety and soundness - perspective and that of consumer protection with regard to rules and supervision of those rules.  There is a global issue because as well as addressing the rule book, there is a driving need for the culture to change within these institutions, as the Chairman noted.  We have been focused on that for a number of years.  The lightning rod of the tracker mortgage issue means it has come into very sharp focus how important it is that firms not only comply with the rules but think about the risk and their customers to a much greater extent than they have in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1076" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#M00300"><p>The global phenomenon of misconduct scandals has been clear in this jurisdiction, as in others.  The culture report gets underneath the matter in a way that is different to the enforcement action through being backward-looking and looking at breach of rules.  The culture report gets inside the mindset of what is really going on.  It is insightful because these are the words and the thinking of the executives themselves, as well as the teams reporting to them.  For the first time, there is insight into what is going on with the thinking used to motivate the outcomes seen for customers, which the committee might view as unacceptable.  It explains a little why we are in this place.  For change to happen, the businesses need to accept that they must be in a different place and know what the problem is.  They also need to come up with a very detailed set of approaches that are meaningful and deliver that changed outcome.  We are getting deeper and closer in our intrusiveness in conduct regulation.  That is the phenomenon that is occurring.</p> <p>   We will make evaluations of risk mitigation programmes and meet the boards.  We will do that with colleagues to ensure they are comprehensive and deep enough.  This will require the businesses to apply and deliver those programmes.  The jury is out on whether we can expect that to occur.  The evidence before our eyes is different from the espoused ethos of consumer focus that we hear of.  As we can see it, we are practising sceptical and intrusive supervision.  The consumer protection risk assessment approach that we know must be put in place means we expect those firms to have a comprehensive conduct risk framework in place so they know that when they take decisions at a board level about new markets, strategies or profit versus consumer interest, that consumer interest would be properly considered and put in the centre.  When designing products, they should not look at the product that they have and wish to sell to customers in order to generate profit.  Rather, part of the thinking should be to ask what the benefit is to the customer, who the target group is and whether they are selling to the target group. </p> <p>  It is only through breaking this down into the component parts of how the businesses are governed, the way the products are designed and sold, as well as training and incentives to staff can we see the real change being effected.  We recognise we will have to get granular and do very detailed work but the obligation is on the businesses to change.  The culture report is a different kind of intervention from the enforcement cases.  In order to effect the change we wish to see, the companies will have to embrace it.  We know where the key transmission points to customers are in the sales process and we know where the deficit of thinking might be in the board level process.  We will have to check that to ensure the businesses are doing what they should to develop consumer culture.</p></speech>

The agents have presented the case to the Central Bank of Ireland.  There have been no sanctions.  That tells us something about the Central Bank.  In a case similar to EBS agents, GRG personnel have gone halfway around the world to try to get their case heard and something done.  Lives and families have been destroyed.  It is the same with the banks but it appears there is a softly-softly approach to the banks.  There are voices out there shouting about particular cases of wrongdoing but they are not being heard.</p></speech>

EBS and AIB tell us that.  Therefore, we cannot get to the end of it and the bank will not get to the end of it.  The bank hopes that, over time, those who are making the complaints will simply fall away.  It is the same approach taken with the customers.  Let us put this straight.  The original figure for the tracker issue was 8,700 and if it was not for the people who came forward and gave evidence before this committee, as well as the work of this committee, we would not be where we are today.  The banks would have ridden roughshod over every single one of them and not given them a leg to stand on.</p><p>That is the disgraceful nature of banking in this country.  If properly supervised, vulture funds and banks would not get away with it, but we cannot supervise them because we have locked ourselves into a legal or regulatory straitjacket.  The Central Bank can properly supervise the banking system.  If it cannot, it should go to the Minister to state that its powers must be improved to enable it to knock these institutions into shape before they do further damage to families and communities.</p></speech>

We cannot overemphasise that our role is to serve the public interest.  We are public servants.  We are clear that our only agenda is to serve the public.  Our objective is no different from that of the members of the committee and I urge them to bear that in mind.  We operate under certain legal and supervisory constraints.  I appreciate it is sometimes frustrating when we cannot disclose all that we do, but that is due to the intrinsic nature of supervision.  However, our underlying objectives are the same.</p> <p>  On how the tracker examination unfolded, we have acknowledged that the committee repeatedly calling before it representatives of the banks has been very helpful in terms of shining a spotlight on what happened.  On the number the Chair cited from our original reporting, we adopted a conservative reporting approach and presented the numbers completed.  It would be a mischaracterisation to assert that the move from 8,700 completed to where we are now was the journey we were always on.  Essentially, we were always determined to see this through, and that has been borne out.  We are very grateful that the Oireachtas supported that through the committee and that the Government did so through its interactions with the banks.  I agree that it should never have been necessary.   Part of the enforcement actions we are considering is why the banks did not comply with our requirements under the examination without obstruction.</p> <p>  It is very important for the public listening to these proceedings to appreciate that our only agenda is to serve the public interest and that we do that within our mandates.  Most of the matters with which we deal and the interventions we make never become public because that is not the nature of supervision.  I acknowledge that, like some others, the Central Bank must demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of the outcomes that are achieved to gain more trust.  I ask the committee to accept that we have the same objective.  We have no reason to go easy on the banks.  Our job is to solve any problems we identify.  In so doing, not everything is made public but we have the same objective as the committee.</p></speech>

The tracker mortgage scandal and other banking issues would have been dealt differently if the committee had not exposed them.  When the Central Bank investigates and identifies a wrongdoing, the culpable bank should be named and shamed.  I refer to the case of EBS and the 2008 email which clearly states to the agents what they should sell, the numbers they should sell, that they can make money and to do what it takes to make the money, regardless of what they were selling.  To gain public confidence, the Central Bank should tell the public what it has done in regard to such cases.  If there is no legislation under which to do so, Professor Lane should suggest to the Minister how the legislation could be improved because ordinary punters, a category in which I include myself, believe that the banks are getting away with blue murder in this country and that no one is prepared to take them on.  They look to the Central Bank to do so.  If more legislation is needed, Professor Lane should tell us that.  He spoke about building trust between banks and customers, but there is much to be done in building trust between the Central Bank, the ECB and the public.</p></speech>

Ms Rowland highlighted all we are doing and the number of enforcement actions we have concluded in public.  Some of our work must be conducted in private.  We cannot make public that a particular person attempted to join the board of a firm and withdrew or was not approved by the Central Bank, but such situations happen all the time.  We disclose the numbers of such cases in aggregate, but for various privacy reasons we cannot identify the persons involved.</p> <p>  There will always be a certain amount of our work which we can announce publicly.  In recent years, when an individual may face a prohibition and that process may legally be pursued either publicly or privately, we usually pursue it in public.  There are periodic announcements that certain persons have received a prohibition, and we want to make our work public when that is possible. We have that commitment to what we do.</p></speech>

Our policy is and always has been to make outcomes public where possible.  The importance of transparency is a key driver in our approach.  In some cases, we cannot give out information.  Professional secrecy and European confidentiality regimes apply to us as they do to central banks all in European countries such that we cannot put certain information into the public domain or are unable to comment on aspects of disputes, some of which may be in the public domain.  Mr. Sibley may address this issue momentarily.   Where it is possible to make enforcement outcomes or other details public, it is very important to us that we do so because the more aware the public is of the outcomes of cases, the more confidence it will have in the Central Bank.  We have released a significant amount of detail about what happened, the resultant penalties and what drives the penalties and the behaviour that is described.  We do not just detail the outcomes.  We also address the story preceding the outcome because we know that is an investment in building trust and informing the public of the approaches we take.  When we cannot release information regarding a particular case, we try to release aggregate information.  It is a key part of how we approach regulation because we acknowledge that it is very important that our approach is understood and trusted as much as possible.  We recognise that is not particularly easy for aspects of our role or actions to be understood, but we are driven by our aim to deliver on our mandate in the public interest, which is core to how we do our work and what we regard as important and serious.</p></speech>

The researchers undertook 1,400 hours of desktop reviews, ran more than 500 surveys and conducted 75 interviews.  If none of those was with consumers, I as a public representative have to ask the question.  Before we came in here today, I got a phone call from a customer of one of the banks who knew the witnesses would be appearing before the committee and asked that I put one question to them.  This is a consumer who has been dealing with various banks and wanted me to ask if the witnesses conducted interviews with consumers and if they considered that the banks were engaging in a form of moral hazard themselves.  If they felt their loans were going to be bought by funds now known as vulture funds, they effectively did non-engagement with customers by stealth because they knew the loans were going to go to the vulture fund, a bit like the bank guarantee being a backstop when it happened.  There was a view taken by many that the banks knew the State would bail them out.  They engaged in reckless lending, as everyone now agrees.  I am disappointed and I believe the report is lacking because customers are not in it.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses address that point about moral hazard within the banks themselves?  If they were of the view that their loans were going to be sold to vulture funds, the banks deliberately engaged in constructive non-engagement with consumers.  On the tracker issue, do the witnesses believe that the banks allowed it to continue because it was adding to their bottom line in terms of profits at a time when their balance sheets were very vulnerable?  They decided to ride on and rip off the tracker mortgage and, if they were caught, they would pay up.  They decided to do first and explain later rather than explaining first.  Will Professor Lane deal with those points?</p> <p>  Ultimately, ours is a questioning role.  I acknowledge the work the Central Bank does but we have to provide probity.  Will Professor Lane address the issue of my disappointment and concern around the lack of direct engagement with customers of banks regarding a cultural issue?  How can he form an impression?  If the researchers are doing 1,400 hours of desktop reviews, 600 surveys and 75 interviews and none of them is with bank customers, how is there not a gap in the due diligence and veracity of the report?</p></speech>

Any report surely has to have primary research.  There is plenty of it in terms of the banks themselves but not in terms of how they interact with the customer.

The purpose of the report was to identify the cultures that were in existence inside each of the lenders.  There was a particular focus on the senior executive team precisely because what the Senator has said is correct, that they are so important in leading the culture, attitudes and tone from the top that the rest of the employees will follow.  To understand their motivations, value set and mindset was the focus of the culture report.  As Mr. Sibley and the Governor have said, we were aware that there was a significant cultural and behavioural deficit in the way they behaved towards their customers.</p><p>The report was to focus on how, at senior levels, the bank values the trade-offs in decisions between, for example, income from a particular initiative regarding a variety of things such as new products or market share and how the customer is valued within that.  A team of leading world experts in cultural evaluation from our colleagues in the Dutch central bank came here to work with our team.  We took a blended approach to their established model to examine the mindset, behaviours and the group behaviours in the organisation.  We blended it with our own behaviours-----</p></speech>

I am a practical person.  If I wanted to know what was going on in a company, and I previously operated as an auditor, I went to the relevant person and asked him or her what was happening.  I did not go to top management for everything.  I would ask the customers.  Ms Rowland stated that she is aware of customers.  For the completeness of the report, where were a range of customers of the banks not interviewed as to how they felt the banks were dealing with them?  Ms Rowland would get the information at first hand.  In many cases, information can be sanitised up along the line but one could get a person into a room and ask him or her about his or her experience with bank A, bank B or bank C.  There is no substitute for interviewing the customer.</p></speech>

The insights we got were from questionnaires and witness interviews with people who work for them and below that.  We got a view of how a decision was made and what was valued in that decision.  The outcomes in this report call out what the Deputy is talking about, which is a journey to travel in terms of being the consumer focused organisations they need to be and a deficit to be filled in their structures and embedding that.  That is the insight and outcome gleaned through this process and approach.  It has effectively given us the insight that while it may be something one thought was the case, it is confirmed on an evidence basis that it is the case.  That is due to the rigour of looking not just at those on the executive level but interviewing others below them.  The staff perceptions of what the executive team valued and the insight were part of this.</p></speech>

First, to return to the issue of customers, if we were starting at point zero or coming to this cold, of course one would have to do customer interviews.  However, we have a great deal of information from customers already.  It was not a stand-alone project.  It is integral to all that has come before.  Second, within that we believe it is important for these banks to embed the information to be gathered from customer surveys and focus groups.  They would need to have mechanisms at board level to absorb what they learn from customers.  That is part of this cultural shift.</p> <p>  On the Senator's points, under the CCMA and the code of conduct the banks have a responsibility to be proactive with any customer in arrears in engaging and trying to resolve them.  If the Senator has evidence that any bank neglected that in any case-----</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator about the moral hazard of the bailout, not just here but elsewhere.  That was part of the mindset going into the crisis.  However, in that situation they were counting on the taxpayer to step in, which happened.  In this situation there is no taxpayer step-in.  If they have left a customer-----</p></speech>

It suited the banks to allow the tracker overcharging to continue because it allowed them to boost their balance sheets at a time when they were extremely vulnerable.

The problem is that customers got ripped off in the context of tracker mortgages.  They are watching this and saying that the banks, as far as they are concerned, have not changed and sanctions have yet to be imposed.  There is a need for closure on this matter.  For the people we deal with, those on tracker mortgages and small and medium-sized enterprises going over to the funds, this is an issue in respect of which they are entitled to closure.  This matter has been ongoing for ten years.  We are now celebrating the tenth anniversary of the bank guarantee.  Those to whom I refer are entitled to closure.</p></speech>

We cannot have a situation where we impose a deadline which leads to a worse outcome for those affected.  Over 30,000 customers have received their redress and compensation, so a great deal has happened.  It is important to say that a lot has been delivered, but we are committed to it being complete and comprehensive and to not leaving any stone unturned in including all of those who should be repaid and compensated from the tracker.</p> <p>  On the broader issue, we had an earlier discussion about it being ten years since the crisis.  A huge amount has been done.  The regulation is vastly different from ten years ago.  One of the by-products of the fact the banks are now stabilised is that we are able to do more in terms of holding them to a higher standard.  It is not enough for them to be prudentially safe; it is also necessary for them to demonstrate their commitment to good consumer outcomes.</p></speech>

I have some brief questions which follow on from what Senator Kieran O'Donnell said.  He said there was constructive non-engagement by banks with the customers whose loans the banks believed would be sold to vulture funds.  Professor Lane has told us on numerous occasions to tell the customers to become proactive and work with their banks.  If they were in difficulty, they were to go to the banks.</p><p>Professor Lane says the report has been concluded and that he is looking at it.

It is not a straightforward exercise; it requires engagement on both sides and there is judgment associated with, it but we have not seen evidence that banks have been stonewalling their customers because they think the loans may be sold in the future.

Members have asked about the approach taken to the culture review.  We undertook a piece of work on the culture within the institutions.  Using that methodology which is supported by the world experts, we undertook a review of the culture and behaviour within the banks.  Separately, we undertake a huge amount of work on the ongoing engagement between banks and their customers, be it on specific tracker mortgage issues or non-performing loans.  What we see and require is that they engage with borrowers who engage with them.  There is a big issue surrounding engagement which requires continued diligence and focus on the part of both the lender and the borrower.</p></speech>

It is a clear risk factor that we monitor.  Our consumer protection risk assessment model looks at sales channels and the ultimate responsibility is on the bank, regardless of whether it is selling directly or through an agent.  We hold the bank to account to make sure that sales channel is safe for customers.  As Ms Rowland said, the sales process is often the key point of vulnerability in ensuring consumer protection.  It is a high priority for us, but perhaps Ms Rowland might speak about the issue.</p></speech>

It goes on to articulate how clear we are that in order for them to be effective and deliver the outcomes we all expect for customers, they need to have a full and comprehensive understanding of the risks their business poses to their customers and that they need to have a plan to address and mitigate these risks.  Part of it will be the way they design their products, the way they incentivise their staff and/or agents to sell those products, the training people receive and the expectations set.  We are clear that as the risks to consumers are understood more fully, the banks have to look closely at the approaches employed and adopted by businesses when selling to customers.  That is one of the parts of the risk framework which will be scrutinised more closely, but they will be expected to know their own business model and put appropriate risk mitigation measures in place to do so.  However, we will check that they do.</p></speech>

Each bank had presented to it its own report which was specific to it.  It does not look in particular at the AIB and EBS agent issue, which is another issue.  Mr. Sibley has said there are a lot of issues in the banking system that have to be dealt with and not all of them fall within the scope of the culture report.  The culture report, effectively, looks at the trade-offs the senior executive team weighs up when it looks at income versus risk and consumer focus.  It is with that lens that the report draws its conclusions.</p></speech>

The issue before us is not much different from moneylending because of the exorbitant interest rates being charged.  Recently, the committee heard that if post offices could get into the mortgage lending, the cost of mortgages could decrease.  An interest rate of 25% is exorbitant.

The evidence globally is that the way those credit card contracts are designed is a source of risk for consumers.  In general, the credit card system is something we have to monitor.  We must remember the way credit cards work.  Many people pay off their debt within the month.  There is no charge for that, but then there is this high interest rate system.  Those high interest rates are an international phenomenon.  I do not believe we have any information for the Senator today about whether we are receiving complaints about them, but we can revert to him on that.</p></speech>

In terms of our daily supervision and work, we are dealing with all sorts of issues all the time.  It is just one perspective.  In addition to enforcing our rules and regulations, we are saying it would be better if these firms did not create the problems in the first instance.  If they had an organisational culture, there would be more consumer focus and fewer headaches, so to speak, arising for us.  The intent of the report is not to have a check list of all the problems we are facing and outline the solution.  It is stating that, in addition to our daily work of checking that they are obeying the rules, we want to go beyond that by saying if they adopt these cultures, the risk to consumers would decrease because these problems would not emerge with the same frequency.</p></speech>

We have touched on parts of it but there is much more of it we have not got to yet.  Even though we have been questioning the witnesses for two hours, there is quite a lot of it we have not been able to reach as yet.  It is important, however, that I touch on the question of tracker mortgages.  It may not be for the culture report to do but there is a body of work to be done to work out, at some point, how every bank managed to make almost identical mistakes with tracker mortgages independently of each other.  It is difficult for an ordinary person with any level of common sense not to wonder how there was not some level of semi-collusion or semi-discussion about it.  Ireland is a small place and people talk to each other.  Perhaps one bank said it was tightening the rules and putting on a bit of pressure and then everybody started doing it in the same way that everybody started running after Anglo Irish Bank when it started performing in a particular way.  They all seemed to say that it is working for it, so let us all copy the model history says should not have worked.  There is a body of work to be done on that.  I am not saying it should have been done via the culture report, but the report has been compiled as a result of the tracker problem.</p></speech>

They were in huge trouble in terms of their profitability.  Massive losses were being created.  They were looking at any way to claw back some level of profitability or reduce losses.  Were they talking to each other?  It is amazing that all of them did more or less the same things independently of each other at the same time.</p></speech>

If they had not been caught, effectively, it would have been extra profits they should never have earned.  In the context of the idea that there was a huge cost, there is a compliance cost and an element of compensation, which is an additional cost, and an element of administrative burden, which in some cases is quite significant.  However, a significant proportion of that &euro;1 billion relates to returning to customers money that should never have been taken from them.  Professor Lane might clarify the position in that regard.</p></speech>

That is blatantly obvious.  Ten years after the guarantee and almost eight years since the bailout, it should be.  However, the tendency towards firefighting and going back to the old ways remains.  I saw a reference to a board meeting being taken up with a great deal of regulation and headline items in respect of which it had to be informed.  I know that happens in other organisations.  They are dealing with so much compliance, they do not get any time to deal with long-term strategy, and Professor Lane mentioned that.  Is there a genuine issue in the five main banks with planning and looking at their long-term futures, and that of the country?  Regardless of whether we like it, the country needs banks as much as they need it.  If we do not have banks, we need something else.  I am not convinced by Professor Lane's report in terms of their being sufficient long-term strategic thinking happening at board level.  It is very easy not to do it, but it is essential.</p></speech>

In the past decade, much of the work was on resurrecting the capital positions of the banks and other measures, but that is done.  There are some elements to do in terms of their balance sheets.</p> <p>  The next conversation is about the long-term strategy.  There are two dimensions to that, one of which is the balance between long-term strategic decisions about, say, the role of IT or the business lines to be in.  What we are saying in this report is that, in addition to what I have just said, there is a need for a long-term strategy regarding how one is going to do right by the consumer.  There is not enough attention paid to consumers in those strategic discussions.  Mr. Sibley might want to add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#R01900"><p>It is a very good question in terms of how banks are considering strategy and the long-term future.  As the Deputy indicated, part of the issue that comes out of the culture report is them being able to move away from the kind of circle-the-wagons mindset to thinking about the longer term.  We are very focused on ensuring that they are thinking about the longer term and that they are not just thinking about the next six months or the next year. Typically, a strategy will be set for a three to five-year period.</p><p> There are some real challenges in doing so in light of the level of change in the system, financial innovation, changing technology, new competition and so on.  It is very difficult to look forward three or five years with any degree of confidence, but we are absolutely driving to make sure they are thinking about it, both from a strategy perspective and, most importantly, a financial resources perspective in making sure their funding is much more secure than it was in order that they can sustain their businesses in the long term; that they will have sufficient capital to deal with a plausible downside if they get into difficulty; and, if they do get into difficulty, that they will have their own thoughts on how to recover.  We are very active in resolution planning.  It runs alongside the work about which we think from the perspective of how the banks are interacting with their customers and whether they are treating them in a sustainable way.  Clearly, there is more work to be done in that regard.  It is absolutely a focus of our work.  They are getting better, although certainly I would not claim that they are completely where they need to be.  There are also the other incentives of analyst reports and quarterly earnings which bring a short-term focus to what needs to be a long-term vision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#S00200"><p>On will happen in the long term and the short term, it is fair to say that in the past a lot of performance bonuses, incentives and rewards were based on the amounts of money lent, rather than on the amounts the banks got back.  Banks lent money all over the place to enable people to buy fields in counties Wicklow, Meath and Kildare in the hope they would be rezoned and that all kinds of thing would happen.  I know of anecdotal stories where people were given &euro;35 million or &euro;40 million who did not even have to give any security on the loan.  It was a question of if the bank did not know what security was needed by the borrower, neither did the borrower.  That was happening.  People were being rewarded for lending money recklessly.  Is that still possible?  Could it still happen or is it now the case that the reward is based on the long-term performance of a loan as it is repaid?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#S00300"><p>There are three aspects to cover in answering that question.  First, in respect of the banks where there is a degree of State ownership, that is, Bank of Ireland, AlB and Permanent TSB, there are very firm restrictions on the variable pay rates that can be paid within them.  It is very tight, but I will come back to that matter.  Second, on the overarching rules at European and international level, a lot of work has been done to make sure there is a potential clawback on any variable pay element for up to ten years.  In the circumstances described by the Senator, if someone is incentivised to do something that is profitable for the bank or institution in the short term but results in costs in the longer term, the variable element can be clawed back.  That is part of the regulation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#S00400"><p>If the person has retired, can it be clawed back from his or her pension?  How does it work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1206" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#S00500"><p>He or she would have to pay back whatever was the variable element.  </p> <p>  The third point is that incentivisation goes beyond simple bonuses.  We have seen an instance in which there was a table on a wall which showed things such as who was top of the charts in lending through to who was going to be promoted.  There are lots of non-pay incentives.  We are trying to understand how people are incentivised to behave in a particular way within their institutions and make sure it is aligned with both the long-term success of the institutions and the sustainable treatment of their customers.  That is one of the reasons we are very interested in the behaviour and culture of firms because how culture is driven affects how people are incentivised.  It is very much at the forefront of our minds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#S00600"><p>There is a reference in the report to over-optimism and banks stating: "Look at where we came from, are we not fantastic?"  I get the impression from the representatives of various banks who come before the committee that there is a certain lack of humility.  Okay, some of the management teams are different and there are new people there who I suppose have to try to sell themselves as best they can, but I do not get the impression that they realise just how badly hit people individually were.  We have many people coming to us and various members have heard really traumatic stories not just of people losing their homes but taking their own lives because of what happened during the crash.  Some of it was at least partly the result of the pressure exerted by the banks and receiving telephone calls six, seven or eight times a day.  I do not get the impression, even with all of the culture reports and so on, that the banks have the humility they should have based on how much they cost us.  We have not had representatives of Anglo Irish Bank here, but every bank was culpable to a greater or lesser extent.  I would be very concerned if there was over-optimism.  Will Professor Lane expand a little more on that issue?</p></speech>

There is also a very important role for the board in that regard.  The non-executive members of a board, in particular, have that duty to hold the executives to account.  In addition to what we can do as a regulator, the first line in managing the risk of over-optimism is having independent directors who are prepared to be independent.  That is part of how we review people when we conduct fitness and probity checks for those going on bank boards.  It is now an arduous process.  It is a significant process and a component of the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, for the banks.  On the internal dynamics on bank committees and so on, having the ability to speak out against any overarching culture is very important.</p></speech>

One of the things I do not want to be lost completely is that not all of the banks are at the same stage.  This is an aggregate report, as is mentioned in it.  I know that the committee might have a degree of scepticism in that regard, but there are banks that accepted the need for change earlier and which are further along in that change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#S00900"><p>That is referenced in the report.</p></speech>

The Senator is right.  The representatives of the banks that the committee has had before it look very similar to the people it had before it in the past and they have very similar backgrounds.  Aspects of the issues of over-optimism and resistance to challenge relate to the lack of diversity in the institutions at very senior levels, particularly at the levels and in the roles responsible for driving the business forward.  We have been pushing for greater diversity across financial services in the past two or three years.  Again, we are starting to see some element of change coming through, but, again, it is at a relatively early stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#S01100"><p>That was actually my next point.  I had written it down.  I was going to ask about the level of diversity and inclusion because we have been here for more than two hours and, although it is quite a big chapter in the report, nobody has mentioned it.  One would expect to have quite a number of bankers and accountants in a bank.  I declare that I happen to be an accountant.  Obviously, gender balance is an issue.  Some of the figures for female participation make Leinster House look good.  Even in respect of applicants, at one stage the figure was down to 10% or 12%.  It has been got up to 29% over five or six years, but that does not necessarily indicate that the women concerned were successful, only that they were applicants.  Obviously, a gender balance is required, but about what other diversity measures are the delegates talking?</p></speech>

This is a small country.  The observation, not only from our own experience but also from the crises in Iceland and some of the smaller countries in Eastern Europe, is that the insularity of a small country and the fact that executives and board members are drawn from a fairly small pool create a risk of groupthink and people being afraid to confront one another.  A basic element which it is quite possible for small countries to achieve is having outside voices, people who are not connected to the Irish system and have no reason to be particularly bashful in speaking out.  That is an obvious element, which is happening to a degree on the boards of banks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#S01300"><p>To support Professor Lane's point, when we talk and think about diversity, we think about it in its broadest form in terms of what can and cannot be seen.  We also think in terms of experience and capability.  We are focused very much on thinking about it in a constructive way.  We think about how the board and the executive team work as a whole, rather than just being individual capabilities within.  Gender diversity is easier to measure than most other aspects.  There is an acute gender diversity issue.</p><p>That can be seen in the report and statistics we published in the last couple of years for the numbers of applicants for the most senior positions.  It is even more acute when one looks at the roles people are taking up.  At entry and middle management levels, it is 50:50 and 60:40; therefore, it is relatively balanced, but as one proceeds further up the organisations, one finds very acute gender diversity imbalances.  If we look at the roles that are driving businesses forward such as the chief executives, chief finance officers, chief operating officers and the heads of retail and the like, approximately 94% are male and they often come from similar backgrounds and experiences.  We then get into real risks of groupthink, over-optimism, lack of challenge and resistance to external challenge or circling the wagons.  This is on top of all that we do in the areas of the regulation and supervision.  To my mind, where we see lack of diversity, it is a leading indicator of cultural issues and poor potential outcomes both from a prudential and consumer perspective.</p></speech>

Most people argue &euro;500,000 is a lot of money, but obviously the people in question think it is not enough and that they are losing staff by mid-teen percentages, as was referenced by AIB.  What are Mr. Sibley's thoughts on that matter?  He mentioned that he was going to refer back to the banks that were State owned or partially State-owned versus those that were not.  What are his thoughts on caps on salaries and bonus payments generally?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#T00300"><p>First and foremost, that is a matter for the Oireachtas to determine.  It is part of the legislative framework, but within it there are certain choices to be made.  The banks in State ownership are run as commercial enterprises.  That is what the country decided was best to deliver the best outcome for the taxpayer.  Obviously, it is perhaps subject to some discussion.  It is true that in some of the senior level roles I have described people can earn more money in performing similar roles in institutions elsewhere, be they banks or non-banks.  If it is purely a pay dynamic when people choose to stay in or enter into a role, that having lower pay thresholds will reduce the pool that can be either kept or recruited.  The impact this has on the ultimate return the taxpayer receives is a choice for the Oireachtas.  What we are most focused on is making sure the incentivisation lines up with ensuring the institution is run in a safe and sound way and a way that treats the customer with respect.</p></speech>

All I am saying is it is a fact that somebody who is a chief executive, a chief finance officer, a chief operating officer or a head of retail can earn more than the cap and, in some cases, a significant multiple of it.  I am not making any judgment on whether that is right or wrong.  It is just a matter of factual reality.  On what we and the rules are focused is making sure the incentivisation attempts to line up with the long-term good of the institution and the customer.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#Z00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  In the second part of the meeting, I will cover three topics, namely, the macroeconomic cycle, non-performing loans and Brexit.  To give a one-line summary of where we are now, during economic upswings, as we are currently experiencing, it is vital to build up financial and fiscal buffers.  If we want to have easing policies during downturns, that requires corresponding restraint during expansion phases.</p> <p>  In terms of the macroeconomic cycle, we are currently in a phase of strong performance, where we are seeing a broad based expansion in employment and an increase in earnings.  The momentum in the labour market is moving towards full employment, although, as always, extra employment is possible if policies can lead to broader participation in the labour market.  I emphasise that what we are seeing now is not being fuelled by imbalances in domestic credit or external imbalances.  The unsustainability of the economy that we saw a dozen years ago is not in evidence at present.  Having said that, there is strong momentum in the economy.</p> <p>  The Central Bank clearly sees, as can everybody else, clear downside risks, one of which is a generic vulnerability.  We we have an accumulated stock of high public and private debt and we must recognise, as a small open economy, that we are especially vulnerable to international shocks.  What might be those international shocks?  One is an unexpected tightening in international financial conditions, which would be in contrast to the easy monetary conditions we have seen for a long number of years.  If this happened, we could see a shift in the world economy in terms of a slowdown in world demand for investment and consumption.  Two external shocks or risks which are especially relevant for Ireland are any change in the international trade or tax regimes, which might be particularly relevant for us, while a disorderly Brexit would pose immediate challenges for the Irish economy and financial system.  As I indicated in my pre-budget letter to the Minister for Finance, the fact that we have these clear downside risks calls for the accumulation of financial and fiscal buffers now.  That would help to limit the damage if any of those risks materialised.</p> <p>  On the financial sector, the Central Bank of Ireland has recently taken steps to further reinforce the capital positions of the banks.  In particular, we announced the activation of the countercyclical capital buffer, which will require banks to maintain an extra buffer in respect of Irish exposures.  If we exercise restraint now in terms of extra capital accumulated by the banks, in a future downturn this buffer can be released.  This would help to avoid a damaging credit squeeze in the future.  That is an important new policy which we turned on this summer.  In parallel, in respect of fiscal matters, running of budget surpluses during strong economic periods is a precondition if the Government wants the flexibility to implement a stabilising countercyclical fiscal expansion in the event of a further downturn, in other words, to avoid austerity being piled on top of a downturn in the future.</p> <p>  In regard to the housing market, we share the consensus that a substantial expansion in supply is required if the high demand to own and rent homes is to be satisfied.  The limited supply of housing has contributed to the increase in rents and house prices, in addition to positive demand factors such as rising employment, increasing earnings and supportive monetary conditions.</p> <p>  Our mortgage rules, which place ceilings on loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios, have helped to limit the amplification of pricing pressures by limiting the credit dynamics.  In terms of preparing for a future downturn, if we avoid overlending by banks and overborrowing by households at present, it will make the next downturn easier to absorb.  We are committed to an annual cycle of review of mortgage measures and this year's review will be announced in late November in line with the normal schedule.</p> <p>  Ten years on from the crisis and five years since its peak, it remains the case that non-performing loans are a cause of considerable distress to the borrowers affected and are also a source of vulnerability in the banking system.  Remaining on the general theme of preparing for the next downturn, it is a risk to both the lender and to debtor if these loans are not dealt with.  It is a priority for us to reduce non-performing loans, albeit in a sustainable way that provides strong protections for borrowers.</p> <p>  A great deal of progress has been made, both in terms of what we and other parts of the State infrastructure have done in managing this problem, while maintaining consumer protection.</p><p>The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, has played a critical role.  By the end of June this year, more than 116,000 principal dwelling house, PDH, mortgage accounts had been restructured, with 87% meeting the terms of the restructured arrangement.  Overall, the number of arrears cases has declined for 19 consecutive quarters, while the number of long-term arrears cases has fallen for the past three years.</p><p> The long-term arrears, however, remain a source of concern.  Of the 66,479 PDH accounts remaining in arrears, 28,237 or 42% have very deep arrears, with arrears balances of more than two years past due.  It is important to stress, in this regard, that engagement by borrowers is critical in order to avail of the safeguards available through the CCMA and the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.</p><p> To have a functioning secured lending market in Ireland, repossession must be a possible option.  Notwithstanding the extensive use of forbearance and restructuring, there will continue to be cases where the lender will need to make alternative choices.  The sale of NPL portfolios is an option that has been employed by banks to this effect.  The reduction in the size of bank balance sheets, particularly through holding a lower stock of NPLs, reduces financial stability risks in the event of a future downturn.  In terms of national risk management, the transfer of credit risk and funding risk to investment funds that buy loan portfolios constitutes a national reduction in macrofinancial risk, given that investors in these funds are primarily overseas.  There are ongoing concerns about loan sales but there is a potential gain in terms of national risk exposure.  The sale of such portfolios does not affect statutory consumer safeguards and the Central Bank applies itself equally to its dual mission of safeguarding stability and protecting consumers.  Accordingly, the Central Bank is committed to ensuring that the consumer protection framework continues to cover loans that are sold.  As a result of legislation passed by the Oireachtas, loan owners must use a regulated credit servicing firm to manage the loans and these firms are subject to the same codes of conduct as banks and retail credit firms, including the CCMA.  In other words, the protections for the borrower travel with the loan.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements are appropriate and sustainable for borrowers based on a full assessment of individual circumstances.  Regulated entities must make every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an arrangement and repossession can be used only as a last resort.  As requested by the Minister for Finance, we are undertaking a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains appropriate, specifically in the context of loan sales.  We expect to provide that report to the Minister later this year.  Finally, it is important to note that the Central Bank represents one part of the wider State consumer protection and debt resolution framework.  In addition to the CCMA and MARP, there are other services and supports available to assist borrowers in mortgage arrears.  These include the national mortgage arrears resolution service, Abhaile, the Insolvency Service of Ireland, and schemes such as the mortgage-to-rent scheme.</p><p> Brexit will be negative for the Irish economy and financial system, as compared with a scenario in which the UK remained in the EU.  Financial stability risks are being closely monitored and addressed to the extent that it is possible.  A hard Brexit with no deal and no transition period would be disruptive, notwithstanding the work the Central Bank is undertaking at a national and European level both to mitigate such risks and to ensure Irish resident financial firms are suitably prepared.  We are preparing for plausible worst-case scenarios in order to safeguard stability in the event of a disorderly Brexit.</p><p> Supervisors across the EU continue to prepare for these challenges through a co-ordinated and consistent approach.  The Central Bank is working as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the eurosystem and the European supervisory authorities to ensure consistent, shared approaches to mitigate Brexit-related risks.  Supervisory expectations have been developed and communicated to firms in a number of areas.  These include booking models, internal governance, risk management and the design of internal risk models.</p><p> Preparedness and contingency planning on the part of firms are imperative as theirs is the lead responsibility.  This holds for firms that are already present in the EU 27 as well as those that intend to move to the EU 27 as a result of Brexit.  The transition period is not guaranteed and would only become a certainty if it were reflected in a signed withdrawal agreement, so firms cannot rely on it.  We at the Central Bank, in line with other EU supervisors, are urging all firms to prepare for all plausible worst-case scenarios.  While we recognise the challenges that firms face when making preparations for Brexit, the only way to minimise disruption is for firms and regulatory authorities to work together to consider and take all necessary mitigating actions in a timely fashion.</p><p> Even under the softest Brexit scenarios, the UK and EU 27 will constitute separate financial systems.  This is a major change to what we have now.  A manifestation of this is the fact that we have received more than 100 Brexit-related applications for authorisation, across a number of sectors.  These include applications both for new legal entities and from existing entities seeking to extend their current authorisation.  The applicants intend to sell directly to Irish customers or sell from Ireland into the European Union.  The potential activities range from banks, investment firms and trading venues to electronic money institutions, commercial insurance and retail insurance.  Our approach in assessing the plans of existing firms and new authorisations is focused on ensuring we deliver our important gatekeeper and supervisory role in a proactive, predictable, transparent and consistent way.  While there has been some focus on the potential attractiveness of Ireland for firms choosing to relocate and on the number of firms coming to Ireland, the Central Bank&rsquo;s clear objective is to deliver financial stability through assertive risk-based supervision.  We have engaged effectively with our colleagues across the European regulatory ecosystem to ensure that we are operating to, and influencing, the European norms of authorisation and supervision.  In doing so, we are mitigating the risks of regulatory arbitrage being a basis for firms&rsquo; relocation decisions.</p><p> In summary, the Central Bank has a number of key objectives as we look towards 2019 and beyond.  We will continue to focus on strengthening the resilience of the financial system, so that it is better able to withstand external shocks and future crises.  We will seek to mitigate the risks posed to the economy, financial system and consumers by Brexit.  We will also seek to further strengthen our approach to financial conduct regulation in order to protect consumers and investors from a systemic perspective.</p></speech>

The use of an average is not very helpful, particularly as there are very low numbers and quite high numbers.  There is not a push or a target.  It is a reference point to discuss.  Actually, we should be striving to reduce non-performing loans because they cause distress for borrowers, are problematic from a resilience perspective and give rise to issues in the context of the functioning of the system.  There is not a 5% target.</p></speech>

We have had much engagement with our colleagues in the ECB and across the SSM on being very clear as to what is required because similar approaches to restructuring are used in other parts of the eurozone.  While this is slightly simplistic, the key requirement is that the warehoused part is fully provided for.  That has been the practice in some banks operating in Ireland but not in others.

As part of our engagement with all firms, we are ensuring that they are addressing the levels of non-performing loans they have in a way that is sustainable and respects the need to address the problem but also protects their consumers.  We have raised this previously.  Regardless of the ownership of the loan, it is really important that customers remain protected under the CCMA.  We are ensuring that any decision taken in respect of loans factors in very sharp consideration of the end consumer.</p></speech>

I ask him to clarify the rules that apply.  Do the capital requirements lenders need to put in place act as a deterrent from such lenders coming here?  The risk weighting for a mortgage by way of capital must be put aside.  For a bank coming here and offering mortgages, what level of capital needs to be put aside?</p></speech>

The core point is that the risk weights, the amount of capital a bank needs to hold here relative to its mortgage book, reflects the risk.  That is the core principal.  Some of the banks operate on the basis of what is called a standardised approach, which involves a defined risk weighting for everyone.  Therefore, everyone uses that approach regardless of the jurisdiction they are in.  For residential mortgage lending, that is the standardised approach they use.</p> <p>  The larger institutions would typically use their own internal models.  That is based on the performance of the book over a period of time.  Typically, in most instances in most jurisdictions, those risk rates - through using the internal models - would be lower than the standardised approach.  However, because of the history in Ireland with the level of loan losses experienced, the level of non-performing loans that remain in the system and the losses associated with those non-performing loans, there is not that much difference between the standardised and the internal models.</p> <p>  To expand on the Governor's point, we would expect exactly the same as would be expected across the entire eurozone.  There has been a big programme of work, which is called a targeted review of internal models, to ensure banks across the eurozone are following similar approaches, similar methodology and similar outcomes in terms of calculating the amount of risk weight relative to the loan book.  However, it is absolutely the case that risk weights in Ireland are higher than many, but not all, other jurisdictions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#BB01500"><p>This runs across much of the debate.  Why is it that ten or 12 years later, these risks are deemed to be so high?  One element is that time needs to pass in order for Ireland to demonstrate it will maintain the stability to avoid the boom-bust cycle we saw previously.  We think it will not be like it was previously.  There are many policies now to avoid what we saw in 2006-07, but in terms of the legacy of history, that is there.</p> <p>  The second element is what is called loss given default - if a bank has a default, how much can it recover?  Banks consider the ability to repossess homes and so on.  A perfectly legitimate choice has been made here to allow considerable forbearance and avoidance of repossession, but an external bank looking at Ireland would identify the difficulty to recover collateral in this situation as a clear factor.</p></speech>

It shows Ireland at 42.5%.  Sweden would be at the other end at 4.2% and the UK is at 10.5%.  Is it appropriate to levy those very high risk weightings on mortgages that are being issued now in an entirely different environment and under new macro-prudential rules, including those relating to 80% loans and a loan-to-income ratio of 3.5?  Is such a high risk weighting shaped by history and our experience during the crisis and the fallout from the crisis?  Is this a deterrent for foreign lenders coming into the market when they look at the risk weighting they are required-----</p></speech>

This is the assessment of the analytics if one looks, with a cold analyst's eye, at the risks in the market.  I agree with the Deputy.  We think the system is structurally different now.  The issue about the recovery in a default situation, the long delays and so on in restructuring a mortgage, that remains an issue.  However, let me turn to Mr. Sibley-----</p></speech>

While it is now fundamentally different, we are still attaching a very high risk weighting to new mortgages under entirely different rules.</p><p>It seems to me to be a real issue as we are trying to get more competition into the Irish market.</p></speech>

It is absolutely our desire to have a functioning financial services system that serves the needs of the economy.  That includes a functioning secured lending market.  Part of that is to continue to address some of the dysfunction that we see.  We might get into that if the members so desire.</p> <p>  In terms of what the banks themselves are calculating under the rules of the capital requirements directive and capital requirements regulations, from an internal audit perspective, the number the Deputy quoted is still based on their entire book.  It would reflect elements of the new lending but still, because new lending has been relatively muted relative to the whole books that banks have here, it will also reflect the risk profile of the entire book.  I have not got the precise graph in front of me and may have picked the Deputy up wrong.  Certainly, the risk weights that banks are being required to hold reflect the risk profile of the entire book, both new and back.</p></speech>

A new entrant would have the opportunity to look at the risk profile of the lending it was doing and, if it was at the more advanced or sizeable end, it would have to model that itself based on the profile of the mortgage lending it was doing and on comparative history, because it will not have its own experience, and come up with an appropriate risk weight using the methodologies that are standard across Europe.  In making those calculations, it would be looking at the dynamics and functioning of the Irish mortgage market.  Given the levels of default that were here historically, recognising that was the past, and given the level of risk within the country, I imagine it would form the view that that risk profile of lending into Ireland today is different from lending into the likes of Germany.  Whether the difference would be by the factor that is in the current risk weight calculations is another discussion.</p></speech>

In the event of a cliff-edge Brexit with no transition period and no deal, how prepared will we be in respect of financial services and products being sold into Ireland on the basis of the passporting provisions and branch operations?  The question goes the other way as well in respect of companies that have their prudential regulation here and are selling into the UK market.

We have been very focused on Brexit for a number of years, thinking about the macro risks and also the particular risks the Deputy has identified in respect of the continuation of the provision of services to customers and consumers in Ireland.  To use the Deputy's example of insurance, there are many providers of insurance into Ireland from the UK and, to a lesser extent but still of relevance, from Gibraltar.  We have made sure that we understand to the greatest extent possible the volume of those contracts and policies and that we have as good an understanding as possible of the contingency plans that are being put in place and invoked to address the issue of the provision of service after Brexit.  For the big firms that are passported in and are providing ongoing service in Ireland, we would be very confident that they have contingency plans that they are implementing and that they are addressing the issues.  The volume is such that at the very tail, there is a possibility that we will not get to 100%.  We may get to 99%, in which case there is some risk there around a hard Brexit.</p></speech>

He made some comments the last time he was before this committee, as well.  What is his assessment of the housing market and house prices?  Is supply coming on stream at the pace he expected and does the Central Bank see further moderation or perhaps an end to growth in prices?  What is the Governor looking at over the period ahead?</p></speech>

We see the pipeline between now and next year and between 2019 and 2020 as quite significant.  Definitely, regardless of whether we are looking at completions of new homes, in addition to which are other elements such as home renovations, which are another part of residential investment in terms of improving homes and so on, all of that is showing strong growth year by year.  There is a supply response happening, but given the many years of underinvestment, it is not closing the gap completely.  This remains a multi-year challenge.</p> <p>  It also remains the case that there are many public policy issues about affordability, social housing and all of these things, which are in the hands of the Oireachtas.  As the members know, we have a budget next week, and under public investment programmes and so on there are choices to be made.  According to our current projections, it is the case that there is a significant pick-up this year compared with last year, and we see it continuing to expand year on year.  It is definitely moving and the situation is different now from what it was two years ago, but it is not enough to close the gap.  That is true.</p></speech>

On one level, the economy is growing.  There are more people in employment and wages are starting to pick up.  In some sectors, they are picking up quite a bit.  That probably affects some districts more than others but there is momentum there.  We do think our rules are biting and, at least in Dublin, there is a clear effect.  I emphasise that there are still plenty of non-mortgage transactions going on, especially in lower price segments.  The price growth is disproportionately out of Dublin because there is more room for expansion in some of the lower-priced regions.  There is one experience in Dublin, which is hitting the limits, but that is the experience throughout the whole country.</p></speech>

We were in Frankfurt recently as a committee and met the current chair.  We wish the deputy governor all the best in that application.  The Governor has confirmed publicly that he is interested in the chief economist position in the ECB, which will become available next year.  From the point of view of corporate memory and top jobs within our own Central Bank, there is the possibility of two of the top three people moving on within a period of months.  We may not get both, looking at it from an Ireland Inc. point of view, but has the Governor any comments or observations to make about the need for continuity, retention of experience and knowledge and so on?</p></speech>

Whether it is me, Ms Donnery or the people beside me, we have to operate on the basis that everyone is replaceable.  What we need is a pipeline of people who can step forward.  A lot of the effort we go to in the bank is to cultivate and build the next wave.  Regardless of any individual, it is the case that there is a remarkable set of talented people in the bank.  The committee gets to see the most visible layer at its meetings, but in terms of the talent in the bank, we are operating as a team and as a machine, so the individuals should not be so important.</p></speech>

That could mean no transition period and that all bets are off in about six months.</p><p> Could I clarify Mr. Sibley's comments in terms of preparedness?  Do those figures relate to that context or to a scenario whereby we would be prepared, 99% of institutions would have contingency arrangements and there would not be disruption for either insurance holders or any others availing of financial institutions that are located or have headquarters in Britain?</p></speech>

There is a high degree of interconnectedness between the Irish economy and the UK economy.  From an economic perspective it would be very challenging.  I am sure Deputy Doherty is very well aware of that.</p> <p>  From a financial services perspective there is also a high level of interconnectedness in a number of ways, and in addition to the interconnectedness the UK, and London in particular, is such a provider of financial services capability and flow into the rest of the EU that, in the event of a hard or chaotic Brexit, it would be disruptive.  It would be disruptive economically and from a financial services perspective.</p> <p>  We are very focused in terms of our work between now and the end of March on making sure that we have a very good handle on those cliff-edge risks.  We are driving the firms to mitigate the risks as much as we can and we are mitigating them ourselves as much as we can, but it is plausible that there will be something of a gap between where we can get to and where we would like to be in terms of fully mitigating the risks.</p> <p>  I used the example of insurance.  From a freedom of services perspective, the example I have used elsewhere concerns insurance protection for car rentals.  They are one-off policies that are not necessarily part of an ongoing relationship with a policyholder.  There may be potential issues there.  We are very focused on closing them down as much as we can, but given the nature of the scenario described by Deputy Doherty I do not think we could give 100% assurance that there will not be some rockiness.</p></speech>

We are probably going to see swings in the exchange rate between sterling and the euro, and possibly swings in UK interest rates, and changes in equity markets, among other changes.  If the probability of a hard Brexit goes up in the coming weeks, the financial volatility could in itself be damaging, even if the situation ends up being okay at the end of March.  Unless there is very rapid and very clear progress between now and the end of November, we will witness volatility until the final answer is there.</p></speech>

On what we can control or manage in that scenario, going back to insurance, for example, if the Central Bank has sight of companies located in Britain that are using freedom of service rules and can sell products into Ireland and the bank has a feeling it will not meet the end of March deadline or there is a risk that the service could be disrupted, is there an onus on the Central Bank in its consumer protection role to notify individuals about that?  It is not a liquidation process but, for example, a person taking out a product in February thinks it might be one of the 99 companies that will be okay but it could be among the 1% that does not have the necessary contingency plan in place at that time.  I understand the difficulty for the Central Bank in that regard but how do we deal with such a scenario?</p></speech>

We are very heavily engaged with our colleagues in the UK and through the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, in the case of insurance companies to make sure that there is a very clear handle on who is writing business where.  Deputy Michael McGrath also referred to the outward question as well on which we are also working.  We are making sure to the best of our ability that we close out this issue.  Similar to other non-financial areas, it may result in a reduction in the levels of supply in certain areas.  It is very difficult for us to say to policyholders today what we would require them to do in the circumstance that their contingency plans are being implemented, but we will keep that very much under review.  The focus we have had to date is very much driving the firms to address it and to communicate with the brokers that are selling the products to make sure that they can fulfil the policy for its duration, but there is some tail risk, which is basically what I am talking about, which we are keeping very much under review and how we are engaging on that with the firms as well as in our engagement with consumers.</p></speech>

It is not quite finalised yet, but in general terms this goes back to the financial market turmoil issue.  The way the models work is that it is clearly negative for the UK and for us for two reasons, one is that if the UK slows down we will lose export customers and, second, on top of that all of the models say sterling is going to depreciate quite a bit, so there is double hit here from the reduced export customer base and sterling moving.  There is no doubt it is a negative, but my view is that the models understate the negativity because they have not taken into account the financial speculation.  We must ask whether there will be a plunge in the stock markets or increasing risk premia in the bond markets, among other things.  We will be reporting what the models say, and it is negative, but I think they understate.</p></speech>

We have been inundated with people phoning and emailing us to tell us that although they are not in arrears, the bank has turned its back on them and their family.  Other mortgage accounts which had a small amount of arrears have also been sold.  When we queried that with Permanent TSB, for example, the bank told us in broad terms that the definition of an NPL, while complex, is that if a person was in arrears at any point, even if he or she was making full payments, as was agreed in the original application with no arrears, that loan is defined as a non-performing loan.</p><p>The committee has teased this out with banks previously, and maybe I missed something, but I have never understood an NPL to be defined in that way.  For example, if Professor Lane, anyone else or I missed a number of mortgage payments ten years ago and had arrears of &euro;1,000 that were cleared nine years ago, that mortgage would still be deemed as non-performing.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

In complete isolation of anything else, if a borrower was in arrears, cleared those arrears and was repaying the loan as originally taken out, he or she would have to demonstrate an ability to repay sustainably over a period.  Typically, that is a year.</p></speech>

That loan would then return to performing.  However, that is if the example was in complete isolation.  There are other circumstances where the loan might not return to performing, for instance, if the borrower has another loan with the institution, that is, there is a connection with another loan, that is in arrears or is non-performing for some reason.  In complete isolation, the circumstances that the Deputy described of one loan and one borrower should queue out to performing, but there may be other reasons for it to remain non-performing, for example, another loan.</p></speech>

There could be a loan that is not in arrears but is still classified as non-performing.  It could be a question of timing.  The loan could be returned to performing for nine months and going through a probationary period or it could be connected to another loan.  I have seen instances of people with loans that were meeting their terms but who also had connected loans with associated pulling factors.</p></speech>

For many people, including me, this sums up the banks' culture.  People who made genuine efforts to catch up on their arrears six months ago may now be caught in this loophole and have had their loans deemed non-performing, and their banks have just tossed them over to a vulture.  Do the witnesses not see the question of fairness in this?  According to the Central Bank's report, the banks need to consider what the customer wants and needs instead of considering their own objectives first before conducting a customer impact analysis.  Surely to God what is happening at the minute is the best proof that the culture of the banks is as bad as it was.  While I disagree with the sale of any of these loans to vultures, in this context I am specifically focusing on those individuals who are no longer in arrears and whose loans are being sold to Start Mortgages or other firms.</p></speech>

The number involved in that is quite small, but there is a larger group comprising restructured loans.  They have come to some arrangement with the banks.

This goes to the issue.  It is not unique to Ireland but, in general, banks may choose to sell loans, be they wholly performing or non-performing, and there are many reasons for doing so.  I appreciate the concerns that arise when people get letters saying that their mortgages are now owned by X, Y or Z, but let me revert to the consumer protection framework.  The framework applies regardless of who owns the loans.  That is not the only perspective of how these loans will proceed, but the consumer protection element remains regardless of whether a bank or investment fund owns the loan.</p></speech>

That is why the CCMA and consumer protection code exist.

There is a difference, which we discussed somewhat the last time we appeared before the committee, between the restructures that are in place in the banks and those that are in place in the non-banks.  For example, there is typically less use of split mortgages in non-banks.  There is some evidence of a greater willingness to agree debt write-offs through the non-banks than there is through the banks, but that is more anecdotal evidence than hard evidence.  The fundamental point is that, regardless of who owns the loans, there are protections through the CCMA and the consumer protection code, which Ms Rowland can discuss.</p></speech>

The funds have bought the loans at a discount and do not face the capital charges that banks do.  In other words, the running costs of holding these mortgages is less for the investment funds than it is for the banks.  That creates room.  It is not obvious which way the situation will go.  I respect the Deputy's point but, on the other hand, that these mortgages have a lower cost for the funds creates more room for bargaining.</p></speech>

It is Professor Lane's comment that it is not obvious which way it is going to go that is the problem.  There is a huge risk.  I have represented people who have had debt write-down.</p></speech>

If these loans are left on the books of the banks and if we experience a negative event in terms of a severe downturn, a sharp change in funding costs or in the macro-environment, it is a risk to everyone.  There is a social reason for doing it.  The move from only banks owning mortgages to diversification of ownership is a global movement.  There is a reason for it and it has to be set against these other factors.  There is a review of the CCMA under way.  The investment funds have purchased restructured loans which have agreements and they are respecting them.  The question is what might happen next.  I will ask my colleague to comment on the CCMA.</p></speech>

We have done on-site inspections in the credit servicing firms and we are reviewing their general compliance with the provisions of the CCMA.  We have met a number of stakeholders in the process to get their insights into what is working well, where the blockages are and the changes or improvements that need to be made.  An important part of the work we are doing is analytical.  We are gathering data on the loans that have been sold, the alternative arrangements and what is happening to them, the range of options the banks have in place and what options are being agreed with customers.  We are comparing this data with the same scenario in the non-banks, which gets to the issue being discussed of which way might this go.  We are analysing this data and it will be reported on.  Some of the data will assist us in having an evidenced-based discussion around the outcomes that we may see occurring.  There is a backdrop to this that we will have to factor into our thinking.  Some of the loans and people affected by them - those in deeper arrears - may be in the non-bank scenarios such that the range of options that they offer could be influenced by the circumstances of the individuals they are dealing with.  This work will give us some insights into precisely this point.  We have done a very deep exercise in gathering that data in order to assist us.</p> <p>  It is true that the protections of the CCMA have helped many families.  The approaches of the Central Bank helped restructure their loans.  It is important that the broad message goes out to people that where they are in difficulties it is important that they engage with their lenders.  Their lender is obliged to treat them sensitively with a view to seeking to resolve the arrears constructively, where possible.  This is an outcome that is possible through the use of the CCMA.  It is important that people engage with the process if they find themselves in this awful circumstance.</p></speech>

Professor Lane made no reference in his presentation to an overheating in the economy or any risk of same.  I am aware that none of the agencies, internally or externally, has said the economy is overheating but they have referenced a risk of this happening.  When the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council appeared before the committee, it provided us with a report and a heat map, which I am sure the witnesses had sight of.  Its analysis is that the largest risk to an overheating of the economy is commercial property.  In terms of what happened in the past in terms with property and what led us into the crash, commercial property was at the heart of that crisis.  Does Professor Lane share the view of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council that it is commercial property that is overheating or at risk of overheating and, if so, has he proposed any measures to prevent that happening?  Stamp duty was increased in the previous budget but the commercial property sector is still booming.  I have raised my concerns in regard to the emergence of a bubble in this sector, which I accept is not being bank financed.  We will never have an exact mirror image of the crash but this creates other risks.</p></speech>

An imbalance in a particular sector is a separate issue.  In terms of the overall economy, we are not seeing overheating yet.  In terms of unemployment, there is still a way to go before we get into the red zone in terms of the labour market.  We should not be too early in declaring any overheating of the economy.  As long as unemployment remains above where it should be, we should not do that.  When it comes to an individual sector and assessment of what is going on therein, there are few issues arising.  What one sees in terms of the number of cranes around town is the completion of a lot of buildings.  Construction on these buildings was initiated several years ago when sites were bought at a bargain price and the companies now want to complete and sell them.  It is not my understanding that there is a new wave of construction under way.  In other words, a bubble is created when construction is amplified even when the market grows closer to completion.  I do not think that is in the pipeline.  We gather information from the commercial brokers in this regard.</p> <p>  Pricing was very strong for a while but in recent times it has become much flatter.  It is not the case that there is onward acceleration in commercial real estate prices.  What is true - the IMF has highlighted this - is that there has been an international synchronisation.  In other words, there are a number of funds in the world which are active in a number of cities, including Dublin.  If funding conditions change or they experience a shock somewhere, it may lead to a synchronised reversal everywhere.  Much of the financial risk is in those investment firms, not in the Irish banks.  There are spillovers because the Irish banks rely on that pricing to price the collateral of what they hold.</p> <p>  The Deputy raises a valid concern.  We will release more work in this area.  We have been working away on this issue, prompted a little by the Deputy's communication to me in regard to one of these firms.  We have been working on understanding the role of investment firms and how they are funded.  We have some interesting work that we will publish.  The international message is that commercial real estate has been de-linked from local circumstances.  It is part of an international financial play which may go into reverse at some point.  It is an interesting sector but I would not call what is happening in it a bubble.  There is no local element to the bubble.  There may be a global element to it but it is not the case that there is some mania going on in the Irish market.</p></speech>

My concern is in regard to the sharp increase in prices in commercial property.  I note Professor Lane's point that they are not increasing at the same rate.</p> <p>  I would like to discuss the issue of interest rates and mortgage interest rates.  While I acknowledge that a number of lenders have been reducing their interest rates over the past 12 to 18 months they are still double the European average.  We expect that ECB interest rates will start to increase in 2019.  This is likely to happen sooner rather than later.  We have never had the benefit of European average interest rates.</p><p>Does Professor Lane see a day when interest rates in Ireland will be in line with the average?  If he does, when will it be?  Consumers are being ripped off and they find it very difficult to understand how we can talk about NPLs, the drag on banks and so on and then see AIB and Bank of Ireland making profits of &euro;1 billion at a time when they are not paying any tax in the State and are charging twice the interest rates of the European competitors.</p></speech>

We think the policy swerve has helped a little with that by making switching easier.  Information campaigns and so on have assisted in this regard.  We see some evidence that people are waking up.  Many could save money by moving to cheaper rates, even within their own banks.  The wider point is that, as we indicated, while there is no doubt that there are some factors such as NPLs, the history of the crisis, etc., there is also an issue of competition.  There are no barriers to entry here and we are not in a different bloc.  We have a single banking union and there is no longer a concern about whether a national regulator will do something odd or surprising.  People can rely on a single European regulatory framework.  The answer is that, as time goes by, the more we have a track record of the economy growing and of credit not going crazy, of mortgages being relatively low risk, of low LTV ratios, of reasonable loan-to-income ratios and so on, the more the fundamentals will appeal.</p> <p>  Internationally, there was a period when everyone was so busy fixing their own problems that there was no appetite to enter new markets.  There are many discussions on cross-border banking.  We need to have consolidation and to allow the strong, good banks to expand.  I am hopeful that there will be new entrants or that even the threat of this will force the incumbents to reduce their rates.  There is room on the margins for those to come down but the only way to really deliver in this regard is by not erecting new barriers to entry and not creating unstable conditions here.  The reality is that commercial banking relies heavily on private funding.  People take a risk in funding these banks and until they are confident they can make a return here, this may persist.  It is all going in the right direction.  More stability, a lower risk credit environment, etc.,will help to create conditions for new entrants but I cannot tell the Deputy when that will happen.</p></speech>

Of course, Bank of Ireland has always breached the latter threshold.  Has the Central Bank fed into that review?  If he is in a position to do so, will Professor Lane outline his opinion in that regard?  This was probably instigated by the scheme going before the AIB board, which was looking at a bonus.  What are Professor Lane's views on that, on the culture of the banks and on how remuneration can or cannot affect it?</p></speech>

There are firms in Dublin and even more in London which pay more than that.  Some individuals will decline to work for banks here in which there is significant State ownership because of the pay on offer.  It is for the Oireachtas to decide the trade-off.  Does it want the market forces to dictate that if the banks decide it is good value to hire people at higher salaries, they should be allowed to do so?  In the context of public acceptability regarding a State-owned bank, is it prepared to wait to see what happens, maintain the cap and fill positions despite the fact that the bank may not get all the individuals it wants?  I read that someone has been allocated a contract to evaluate the position in that regard.  There is a need to consider the pros and cons of that.  There is a genuine trade-off.  We have always recognised that there is a good case for performance-related pay that is aligned with socially desirable incentives, especially in a volatile industry such as banking.  When the economy slows down, their pay is cut and that provides a degree of stability.  One also needs clawback mechanisms whereby any bonuses can be clawed back in the future over a long period if necessary.  Have I missed anything?</p></speech>

From a regulation perspective, we addressed this earlier.  The governor refers to clawbacks and ensuring that incentivisation is consistent with looking to the longer term.  That is enshrined in the regulations.  That is a different matter to the specific point with regard to the legislation.  We would be very keen to have the cultural change espoused by the banks, which we want to see, being properly incentivised.  That is not necessarily always monetary.  We talked a little about this matter earlier in the context of who is getting promoted and about how people are being recognised for good performance.  That should be aligned with the cultural changes required within these institutions.</p></speech>

I prefer the answer that was given by the representatives from the European Central Bank when they came before the committee recently to discuss the SSM.  Dani&egrave;le Nouy said it is not yet the right time to consider changing the current salary or bonus rules in place for Irish banks.  That is pretty clear.  I certainly agree with the message and think the Irish public would like to hear from the Central Bank about it.  The banks and the Government operate in a manner where they say they will look at something and compile a report.  Such a report will come up with the same reply the witnesses have given, namely, that it is one thing, on the one hand, and something else, on the other.  In my opinion, the reply is that they have enough.  Banks being profitable to the tune of &euro;1 billion a year while stripping people of their dignity is just not acceptable.</p> <p>  I return to the NPLs and the 5%.  Let us consider a situation where a main bank provides a loan.  There may be difficulty with repayments, as was the case with the banks themselves.  That loan is then restructured and the customer lives within the new terms.  Despite this, the bank sells the loan to a vulture fund.  Professor Lane indicated how one can perhaps do a deal with a vulture fund because it bought the loan for less.  Once one gets to that point of having a loan owned by the vulture fund, one's credit rating with the Irish Credit Bureau, ICB, is affected, so one has no hope of getting a loan from anyone except the same vulture fund at a rate of 10%, 15% or 18%.  As a result, one can never buy oneself out of the loan.  That is an issue, especially for business people who find themselves in this situation and are attempting to rebuild.  It is also the same for homeowners.  The option of a credit union, which was there for generations, where one could get a loan from it if one got into debt, is not there because one is listed by the ICB, which is a difficulty.</p><p> In addition, the Central Bank continues to say that the protection travels with the loan.  Mr. Sibley indicated that there is not a great deal of evidence of the opposite happening.  I keep repeating myself by stating that there is ample evidence of people being crucified by vulture funds as they attempt to rebuild portfolios, homes, businesses or whatever.  I have dealt directly with them, a point I have repeated to Professor Lane at previous meetings.  For me, the experience as been hugely negative.  I pity the people who must deal with the vulture funds.  I ask Professor Lane to address the following situation.  A bank states that it is required by regulators to reduce the percentage of loans which are classified as non-performing.  That is probably accurate.  It is selecting its words quite well and blaming the regulators.  In a second paragraph, the homeowner - or the loan owner - will read that for regulatory purposes, the bank generally describes a loan that is or has been in arrears as one that is in default or can be sold.  I would like the Central Bank to comment on what I have just said and what I have cited from this letter and to tell me why the banks cannot be instructed to drill down into their bad loan books and bring about individual resolutions.  Yes, there will be those who will not pay and, therefore, their loans can be sold.  However, why can the Central Bank not force the banks to do as I have outlined and make it an option for them to drill down and solve the loan crisis?  They are flogging off the loans in any event and at massive discounts, the profits are going out of the country because the vulture funds take them and we have outlined here before the damage done to society.  Why can the Central Bank not emphasise this other option to them?</p></speech>

We have always emphasised exactly what the Chairman said.  There are choices here.  It is not the case that we instruct any bank to engage in loan sales.  I emphasise that many mortgages have been restructured by banks over the years, so it is not the case that they have not gone down that road to some degree.  Ultimately, however, the commercial decision as to whether to do more direct restructuring or whether to put provisions aside in order that an otherwise non-performing loan can be put on the road to performing versus the decision to sell is not our decision but the decision of the banks.  Mr. Sibley may be able to say more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-04a.1311" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018100400002#HH00300"><p>To respond to the Chairman's final point, what he articulated is what genuinely has been happening for the past eight years or more.  We pushed the banks really hard from 2010 onwards to restructure loans sustainably in to address borrowers' individual circumstances.  Behind every number - and I will talk about the number presently - there are individuals, and I genuinely appreciate that.  To give a sense of the matter, one in eight owner-occupier mortgages was in default at the peak of the problems with non-performing loans.  That is down to about one in 16.  That is still obviously too many, but that number has been achieved through the splits to the arrears caps, the term extensions and the forbearance.  At an individual level, the individual circumstances of these borrowers have been understood, assessed and restructured on that basis, and this has required sacrifices on the part of the borrowers.  It has also required engagement with the banks.  Underneath that, through the waterfall, there are protections in place, via both the private sector and the public sector, in the form of organisations that are there to try to assist borrowers in distress.  I refer here to the Insolvency Service of Ireland and, ultimately, the courts.  The process the Chairman describes has been happening.  Now, however, five years on from the peak of the level of difficulties with non-performing loans, we still have a big chunk of borrowers who are not just two years but five years past due.  If we are going to have the functioning market we talked about that serves the country, that does require those to be addressed.  Whether those loans are with a bank or not with a bank, the bank is required to engage and consider the individual person's circumstances and try to address them.</p> <p>  One point of detail the Chairman raised relates to portfolios.  The CCMA's protections are focused on owner-occupier mortgages - that is, those relating to the family home.  If a borrower has invested in a portfolio of loans, that is a different matter and the protections are somewhat different.</p></speech>

I do not know whether they are clued into this at all.  Let me explain.  I understand what the banks have been doing.  On a macro level, they have their big customers.  They have worked hard going down to the very smallest of loans so they are almost down to that level now where they have a huge number of loans that are in difficulty.  They are not applying the same degree of effort in finding a solution for those loans as they did with the bigger loans further up along the chain.  As a result, individuals find themselves in court.  They are lay litigants defending against solicitors, barristers and so on, and, until now, the banks have pushed these loans to the courts.  There is a huge number of cases before the courts and no effort is being made by the banks once they do this to unravel matters and try to find solutions.  These are the clients who come to me and, I am sure, other members of the committee.  They are fighting for their homes and trying to make some effort.  I do not know whether our guests know how difficult it is to get information from the banks.  It is absolutely impossible, and I have seen this myself by dealing with individual cases.  One individual asked a particular vulture fund for information last Christmas.  That information has still not been provided.  In the meantime, the client is just left there wondering about his or her business, home or loan or whatever.  It is impossible to deal with the banks.  I know I am repeating myself because I have said this before at various meetings, but it is the same story I come up against all the time.  It can be seen in the language used in that letter from a bank to a customer.  One cannot say what is written is a lie, but it verges on being so.  It is a play on words to make the customer feel that the banks are not that bad but that those regulators have them under fierce pressure and they have to sell the borrowers' loans on.  That is basically what they are saying.  Earlier, we dealt with the culture in the bank.  That letter speaks loud and clear to a culture that does not give a damn who is regulating or what is being said.  That is a view I have and it is one that I know is shared by people across the country.</p> <p>  I then come to the ICB, now that I have gone through the situation of a loan being sold on to a vulture fund, a client trying to buy it back and the bureau flagging the individual's history.  The Central Bank controls the ICB now.  Is that correct or is it working within the bank?</p></speech>

It is an alternative to the traditional credit bureau which was owned by the banks.  It is an important new source of information which will allow banks to see the whole profile of an individual's debts, and not just <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>one bank but with other banks, as well as any history of difficulties.  That is starting now and it is a new piece of information.  There will soon be a second register called AnaCredit, a European-wide credit register for bigger businesses.  There will, therefore, be a similar database of debt for these businesses.  This is intended to improve the information available to lenders to assess credit risk more accurately.</p></speech>

The central credit register is only in the start-up phase and, therefore, I do not think there has been any decision yet about the future of the ICB.  The central credit register is an important new source of information.  The AnaCredit register will be important when it is on stream.  The amount of information available to lenders will increase.</p> <p>  On the basic point about whether somebody in this situation is totally stuck because some historical default or non-payment means there is a flag on his or her record, we must make a distinction between households where the consumer protection framework is strongest and treatment of small and medium enterprises and bigger firms where the way in which a loan contract is managed will be different.  The level of protection for consumers will naturally be much higher than for business enterprises because of the basic differences in those two types of loan and activity.  I am sure the experience is tough for many small business owners, and the question there is how a bank or a non-bank should treat those loans.</p></speech>

There are two limits in place for lending of more than five years and more than ten years.  I appreciate there are a smaller number of credit unions that are already close to these limits, but they are lending approximately one third of what in aggregate they could lend relative to those limits.  There are a handful of credit unions that are bumping up against those limits.  Credit unions can lend from a mortgage perspective today, as many are doing, but we are looking at the approach to how those limits are calculated.  The limits are currently based on the lender's total loan book.  As the committee will be well aware, the number of loans in credit unions has been flat to falling.  A better answer to that is to focus on the reserves they have and to put the limits in place around the reserves on the credit unions' capacity to lend, but we will consult on that shortly.</p></speech>

We do not hear enough from the Central Bank or the Governor on that issue.  When he was pushed, Professor Lane indicated there was scope for further reductions in the margins.  In effect, he is signalling that he expects reductions to be of a modest variety.  I have repeated the point a number of times about what I would regard as anomalies that the Central Bank is standing over.  In the case of Permanent TSB, a bank with significant challenges, nobody is questioning that.  It announced a cut in fixed rates for new customers but its existing customers will not benefit from those rate cuts, which is completely unfair.  As the consumer protection watchdog, the Central Bank should say it is not acceptable.</p> <p>  Professor Lane has nothing really to say about the whole cashback incentive, which I regard as a gimmick in which a number of banks continue to engage to confuse and dazzle customers by giving them a few thousand euro to camouflage higher rates.  </p> <p>  Professor Lane does not want any powers to deal with high interest rates.  As Deputy Doherty said, the most recent retail interest rate statistics from July showed they averaged 3.21% on a new mortgage in Ireland compared with 1.77% on average in the eurozone.  We have the highest rates in the eurozone.  The only other country with interest rates above 3% is Greece, so we are well and truly the highest.  Professor Lane does not want any powers, however, even if they are to be non-discretionary powers or if it means putting methodology or a reference rate into legislation, which a number of countries have done, as he well knows.  He does not want to have that stick in place, even as a threat.  </p> <p>  While we have the issue of trackers in Ireland and a significant portion of loans on the book are on a tracker rate, these mortgages are no longer loss-making.  Let us be honest, tracker mortgages are profitable for banks today.  Ulster Bank came out with a two-year fixed rate of 2.3% in June, albeit only for two years, which I thought was a game-changer.  It was a significant cut below the rates offered by anybody else, and I thought the others would have to respond.  Four months on, however, there has been no real response from the other lenders.  They all strike me as being comfortable with what they have and there is no real competitive dynamic in the market on actual rates.  All we have are cashback and other dazzling offers of lump sums, the payment of legal fees and so on.  While the Central Bank might regard its core priority as being prudential supervision and protecting the stability of the financial system, it is, for now at least, the consumer watchdog as well, but I do not hear it dealing with those issues of interest rates.</p></speech>

To come back to the reality here, what we are seeing is a mix of risk premia and a lack of competition.  When reference is made to other countries, which have ceilings and caps, it is not the case that it is at the fine-tuning element of 100 or 150 basis points.</p><p>It is through really high interest rates, way above what we are seeing here.  It is not the case that we or anyone else can draw the line between saying this is what is reasonable on a risk premium basis and no more than that.  By their nature, laws are hard to undo.  If there is a law which pitches it at the wrong level, there is a serious barrier to entry.  That is the problem in trying to find a legislative solution.  The other approach about which we have talked is promoting entry, keeping barriers to it low, keeping the system stable to reduce risk premia and then watching as entry or the threat of it does its work.  That is the way I see it going.  We do a lot of work on some of the particular issues related to switching, front book, back book, cashback and so on.  Ms Rowland can elaborate on the matter.</p></speech>

There is a place for such offers, but it is important only to know that they are appropriate for some customers but not all, about which we have been very clear with lenders.  For people to get the best value they can for themselves, we have tried to be very public and clear that there is a lot of benefit for many mortgage holders in shopping around and buying different mortgage products.  They could save themselves a lot of money over the lifetime of a mortgage.  Because of this, already in the consumer protection code we require lenders to communicate with their customers regularly on what other offers they have available that could save them money.  We see some evidence that switching is increasing.  Because we know that even more work needs to be done to help people who already have mortgages to get better value for themselves, we consulted last year and into this year on strengthening the code in the future in order that people who came off a fixed mortgage rate would have 60 days.  I know that the Deputy responded in advance of that consultation on the options they would have when they came off a fixed rate in order that they could make sure they would look around to see what the best deal was.  If they have a variable rate mortgage now, lenders will have to communicate with customers if it is available at a cheaper rate in a new loan to value statement.  We are inserting a lot of requirements into the regulatory framework in order that the information will be delivered to the customers' door to make sure they will have the information to help them to look around to see if they can get a cheaper and better product.  They are some of the improvements we think will help people.  There is some evidence that they are increasingly taking to switching.</p></speech>

I am saying it is a question of the right product being sold in the correct way to the right customer to meet his or her needs.  It would be no good if cashback, as happened in the bad old days, pre-crisis, was putting cars outside the front door, but there may be an argument that people understand it is for essential necessities such as a washing machine or some of the very basic items.  The cost of that credit must be clear and it should not be mis-sold.  Sometimes it is not a question of the product being sold but making sure it is sold properly to confer a benefit on the right customer, which is just as important.  Eradicating that product may not necessarily result in cheaper mortgages across the board for all.</p></speech>

Many people are running the models for it.  When I was responding a while ago to Deputy Pearse Doherty on it, I said it delivered an answer; it was negative.  Ireland will be affected, not only if the United Kingdom goes into recession but if any of these severe scenarios leads to significant depreciation in sterling which will hit Irish exporters.  I am emphasising the fact that the models will typically understate because on top of them there will be the turmoil.  The financial markets will be rocky; there will possibly be movements in stock markets, exchange rates and so on.  I would not take excessive comfort from quantitative numbers we may put out in the next couple of weeks because on top of them there could be turmoil in the financial sector which could have its own dynamics.  No matter how hard Brexit is, it remains the case that rich countries have different trading arrangements.  It is negative and will lead to lower living standards here and in the United Kingdom, but it is not the case that the United Kingdom will suddenly fall off the map or become a zero trading partner.  It is regrettable and negative, but we should be contained in the amount-----</p></speech>

When we defined a sustainable mortgage, we found that the ECB in Frankfurt had taken severe umbrage that all and sundry were blaming it for the need to sell non-performing loans to funds and deleverage at a rapid rate.  It took it quite personally and was forthright in saying so.  For the first time ever, it gave us what I would regard as a common-sense, definitive version of what was a sustainable loan.  It stated a sustainable loan was one that the customer could afford.  The rest should be warehoused.  There is senior debt which the customer can afford to repay, like any normal mortgage.  Someone with a mortgage of &euro;200,000 could technically afford to pay &euro;150,000 of that amount.  As far as the person is concerned, the sustainable part is within their age profile.  If it could be restructured as a 20 year mortgage, he or she could repay the &euro;150,000 and the balance would be warehoused.  The ECB did not regard it as a non-performing loan.  What is the Central Bank's perspective because we had a lengthy discussion on it and the ECB was quite forthright about it?  That was the first time I had heard a definition of what was a sustainable loan.  At the same time it meets the criteria not to be regarded as and deemed to be a non-performing loan.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked two questions, one of which was about pressure from the regulator to drive down the number of non-performing loans.  It is undoubtedly there, but what has never come from us or the ECB is a specific target, methodology or approach to drive banks towards selling loans.</p><p>That has never been the case.  We have never instructed that, nor has the ECB, but there is significant pressure and, for the reason we discussed, pressure will remain on the banks to bring down-----</p></speech>

I have had many conversations with the chairs, chief executive officers, CEOs, other board members and other members of the banks about this issue and I am very clear about it.  There is not a target.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  We expect the loans to be addressed through various mechanisms, including restructuring, which was the second point on which the Deputy touched.  We have been very clear throughout on what we have described as sustainable.  We put out sustainability guidelines in 2013 when we issued targets in terms of mortgage arrears reduction.  That drove change in terms of the banks' approach to dealing with mortgage arrears at that point, which had been very much short-term forbearance rather than dealing with the underlining issues.  That has resulted in a very high number of restructures being used to address the issue.  There is a specific point around split mortgages, which I think was the germination of the discussion the Senator had in Frankfurt.</p></speech>

We engaged with our ECB colleagues to add further clarity because this product or a variant of it is used in other eurozone countries.  These loans can be treated as performing and would no longer be non-performing.  What it requires in this or in any other jurisdiction is that the warehouse element is fully provisioned.  In the example the Deputy gave, he took a provision of &euro;50,000 for the loan he cited, and if the bank does that, and subject to the borrower repaying &euro;150,000 of that loan in respect of the new term, over a period of probation of about a year that loan could return to a performing status and no longer be non-performing.</p></speech>

It is very important that the minimum schedule was very minimum.  It was small numbers, far less than what we are actually doing.  The way to think about this is that if what happened in the world had turned out worse than was experienced, if the recovery here had been weaker and if the interest rate environment in Europe was higher, the scale of the disposals could have been done at a super slow pace, which is the minimum schedule.  The fact that what happened in the world has not turned out like that, that the interest rate environment in Europe is quite low, that the Irish economy is growing quickly and that the fiscal position of Ireland has improved means that, in line with the second part of that agreement, we would sell as soon as possible, subject to financial stability considerations.  That was the minimum schedule and the expectation is that we would sell more quickly, which is something that was always agreed to, subject to maintaining the financial stability.  That is why we are selling at the pace we are selling but that minimum remains.  If there were a severe change in circumstances, the minimum would become more relevant, but under current conditions the NTMA can borrow quite cheaply, and this is why we are selling at a pace.</p></speech>

The ECB told us that as Ireland refinanced its debt in terms of the IMF programme or any of the other bailout programmes, it would put pressure on the Irish Central Bank to, for want of a better term, tear up the promissory notes.

The minimum schedule at that time was very important insurance, as in early 2013 it was not obvious how the Irish economy would recover.  The fact that at that point an assurance was given that there would be no inevitable acceleration or graph of disposal was very important in terms of providing a fail-safe for the situation.  The fact that it turns out that the recovery has been better and the financial conditions are easier has allowed a more normal speed of disposal to take place.  That is what we are doing.</p> <p>  We still bear in mind that we do not want to overburden the sovereign debt market, so it is not instantaneous.  That is a path we are treading.  We want to respect the temporary nature of this funding but we do not want to go too quickly where that would overburden the sovereign debt market and cause financial instability.  From the Oireachtas point of view and a fiscal point of view, it is very important to recognise that this was always going to be refunded or refinanced at some point, and given the low interest rates available now, maybe that would not be true in the future.</p></speech>

My question is not on the Sparkasse model but on the public banking model.</p><p>Does Mr. Sibley believe there is a need for an expanded public banking model in Ireland as an additional pillar to the mainstream banks?  An Post and the credit unions have recently stated that they are considering providing low interest rate mortgages, as mentioned by the Chair.  The An Post proposal is very similar to the low-rate Sparkasse model, while the credit unions state they would offer a competitive rate.  Is there a fit for a public banking model involving both institutions whereby the Central Bank would bring in further regulation to allow them to lend to the SME sector in a structured manner, outlawing any form of speculative lending?  The credit union movement in particular has a phenomenal network, as does An Post.  Their levels of SME and home loan lending would be limited.  There may be need for consideration of a central bureau in terms of assessment of SME loans.</p><p> I have often stated that if credit unions were not operating in the 1990s, many SMEs would have gone under.  Mainstream banks were not extending credit.  I was in practice at the time and many of my smaller clients would get a bank draft from their credit union on a Monday morning to lodge to their mainstream bank 100 yards up the road.  The credit unions were providing an overdraft facility.  I have great affection for the credit union movement, as Mr. Sibley is aware.  I am also pragmatic, however, and wish to see if there are areas which could be improved because my biggest fear is that there will be a lack of structured competition in the market when the banks fully recover.  What is Mr. Sibley&rsquo;s perspective on the issue?</p></speech>

We are entirely open-minded about such a proposal.  It would bring some benefits because an issue for credit unions is the scale and cost of undertaking mortgage lending or large-scale lending to SMEs on an individual level.  I would have a lot of sympathy for their having a degree of shared services, whether in the form of a public bank or through a third party that allows them to do that.</p></speech>

We do much work directly with the credit unions and in other forums in terms of supporting them in business model development.</p> <p>  As I discussed with the Chair, we are looking at their current approach and expect to consult on it.  The current approach to limits, whereby they are a factor of the rest of the loan book is less preferable than a limit focused on reserves because that gets to the capability and capacity to lend.  We will consult on that issue and will welcome views from all stakeholders on how that will look into the future.</p> <p>  We have engaged with the Sparkassen on a couple of occasions.  I acknowledge the Deputy did not ask about them directly.  There is no restriction on their coming here.  The issue they have raised is how they will fund themselves and whether they have sufficient capital to come here.  If they can address those issues, then that is absolutely fine, but it is not a matter for the Central Bank to provide them with that funding.</p></speech>

When banks are asked about loans, they must have regard only to an ICB rating as there is no regulation stating that a person may not be granted a loan if he or she has a poor ICB credit rating.  For how long do banks refuse to lend to a person who had a poor ICB rating?  I have been told it lasts for two to three years.</p></speech>

In the crisis, many people went into arrears because of bad loans.  It was not a sign of their future potential as a business or individual.  Banks may maintain an open mind on lending and there is nothing to stop them looking into a person's credit history.  In some circumstances they may decide not to go beyond checking the central credit register.  As a regulator, I point out that there may be good business opportunities in lending to people who have a record of distress but who may be a good risk into the future.  That is a commercial opportunity for banks who decide they can take that on.</p></speech>

The same should apply to business people or individuals who went through difficulty.  They should not always have to pay for that by being listed as a credit risk for three years even after they are out of the clutches of the banks.  I ask that the committee be given a note on that and relating to the earlier question about credit unions, how they operate vis-&agrave;-vis the ICB and the views of the Central Bank in that regard.</p> <p>  The new regulation brought in to regulate communities collecting money in a club or piggy bank which is then lodged under one name to a credit union is having a great deal of negative effect on people who want to save small sums of money each week and need the credit union to so do.  It was working perfectly for them but now they cannot do it.  I ask for a note on the reasoning behind that regulation.</p> <p>  Is the Central Bank conducting an inquiry into GRG?  I ask because the committee today received substantial information in that regard which it has not yet gone through.</p></speech>

There was an investigation, but it was found not to be the case.  However, there were concerns about the levelling of complex fees on businesses that were going through difficult times and a process was established to deal with the matter.  An identical process was put in place here.  We have been involved in regulatory engagement to make sure the process is delivering in accordance with what it ought to deliver.  We have been to the United Kingdom to speak to regulators about the common issues which arise.  We have also been on site in Ulster Bank to deal with it.  We have had external oversight.  There is also an external complaints process on top of the normal complaints channels and we require Ulster Bank to write to the affected customers.  The process is open and ongoing and available to customers.</p></speech>

I understand they have also provided them for the fraud squad and Ulster Bank and perhaps others outside the jurisdiction.  They are ramping up their attempt to get justice as they see it.  I am alerting the Central Bank to that fact.  We will probably forward the correspondence to it to get some action on it.</p></speech>

We sent the Central Bank a transcript on 18 July.  A submission was made to the committee by the group which outlined specific issues related to its campaign and understanding of the promissory note bonds and their destruction.  Will the Central Bank review for members of the committee the reply, dated 3 August 2018, in which it provided information and break it down a little more relative to what was said at that meeting?</p></speech>

My reading of the case of Ballyhea Says No is that it disputes this and states the circumstances are so specific and special in this scenario that an exception should be made to the Central Bank's philosophy that the loans need to be unwound.  That is fundamentally it.  I can understand the point of view, but it runs against the foundations of how the Central Bank works and especially the 19-country monetary union.  Imagine a situation where other countries stated they had specific problems and specific reasons they also needed special central bank funding.  One of the foundations of the euro is there not be monetary financing of governments and that when there are emergency loans, like those made to Anglo Irish Bank, with the promissory notes as collateral, eventually they are reversed.  What is happening is that the loans are reversing but not at a very quick pace.  It is a very gradual reversal process.</p></speech>

It has nothing to do with how any individual is treated by any bank or investment fund; it is purely a data gathering exercise.  The Central Bank has a statistical function and gathers information from all of the entities.  It was simply a case of some investment funds having their own calculations which were at odds with how the banks, under regulation, decided these things.  It does not change the picture on how anyone is treated.</p></speech>

I was also on the trip to the Sparkassen.  Is it correct to say many of the credit union deposits were actually with Anglo Irish Bank at the time of the guarantee?  Are there figures for the percentages of credit union deposits that were with Anglo Irish Bank?  At the time, I remember hearing that a substantial proportion were with it and that if it had gone - many people would have liked it to go - many credit unions could possibly have gone with it.</p></speech>

Under the new system, there is a presumption that different bond holders would lose money if a bank were to shut down.  There are two parts.  There is the narrow issue of bond holdings and how credit unions were exposed by their bond holdings, as well as the larger issue of imagining what would have happened if large depositors had also received a haircut, as happened in Cyprus.</p></speech>

Their deposits remain highly concentrated in the Irish banks.  The change we made recently to investment regulations enables and seeks to encourage more diversification in where they invest.</p></speech>

It is important that people realise that while the credit unions were relatively okay in the end, had the bank guarantee not been put in place, they would have had a much greater problem.</p> <p>  I do not think the Central Bank in its statement referred to matters such as our significant dependence on a very small number of companies for such a large percentage of corporation tax receipts, the common corporate tax base, digital taxation and all of the European ideas that might jeopardise some of that income.</p></speech>

I think there was a line in it about international tax arrangements.</p><p>It is obvious to everyone that it is hard to assess the future of our corporation tax revenue.  We think it is wiser to assume that some of it might not be in place forever.  We might want to save it for a rainy day, or consider it in the context of a build-up of public investment.  As we frame the debate about the public finances, it is important to make a distinction between uncertain revenues and revenues on which we can rely.  Before we doubled down, we had a construction-driven economy and a reliance on construction-related tax revenue.  That link is broken with the global corporations.  The economy is growing.  The profits of the global corporations more or less depend on their global activity.  They could reverse, even if the economy was doing okay.  It is a different risk.  It is definitely a big risk management issue for everyone to think about.  How much of it is potentially at risk?  On how much can we rely?  Given that we are living in an uncertain world, we do not really know how to balance these risks.  It is an obvious challenge for us all.</p></speech>
