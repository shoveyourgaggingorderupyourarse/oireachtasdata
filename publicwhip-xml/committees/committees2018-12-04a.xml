    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018120400002#B00300"><p>Food Drink Ireland is part of IBEC and the main trade association for the food and drink industry in Ireland.  It represents the interests of over 150 food, drink and non-food grocery manufacturers and suppliers.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee and acknowledge the committee's ongoing focus on Brexit as it impacts on agrifood.  Our submission to the committee on Brexit should be read in conjunction with the submissions from fellow IBEC associations such as the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, which is present today, Dairy Industry Ireland and Meat Industry Ireland.<br/><br/>Looking first at trade flows, there has been a very strong food and drink performance in 2017 that saw overall exports increase by 11% to just over &euro;12 billion.  Within these numbers, the UK is our largest single export market.  The export exposure of the various sectors within agrifood to the UK is thus high and includes beef at 51%, dairy at 24% - within that, half of all cheese exports go to the UK - and prepared consumer foods at 62%.  In addition to absolute exposure, there are several other factors of note.  While the UK as a percentage of our overall exports has dropped in recent years and now stands at 35%, in value terms it continues to increase and now stands at &euro;4.5 billion, which is a 32% increase since 2010.  This demonstrates the importance in the medium to long term of maintaining our market position in this high-value, high-quality market that currently has a substantial food deficit.  In value terms, Irish exposure is like that of other large exporters to the UK and it is not surprising that they are geographically close by as well.  I refer to countries like France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Italy.  However, in percentage terms it is four to five times higher.  Typically, for those other countries, less than 10% of their agrifood exports are to UK.  This clearly highlights the unique circumstances faced by Irish agrifood and the need for exceptional mitigation measures.  It also is worth noting that total agrifood trade flows between the EU 27 and the UK are &euro;46 billion, with approximately &euro;35 billion into the UK and the balance coming out of the UK.  While a no-deal scenario next March will result in extensive disruption and product displacement, a future trading relationship that contains non-tariff barriers also may impact negatively on supply chains.  Therefore, the objective must be a trading environment that is as frictionless as possible. <br/><br/>Looking initially at a no-deal scenario, in the event of such an outcome, WTO most-favoured nation, MFN, tariffs could increase Irish and other EU food and drink export prices to the UK significantly after 29 March 2019.  Higher trade prices will therefore cause export volumes from the EU to the UK to drop significantly.  The disruptive impact of this possibility, combined with further currency turbulence and likely gridlock at ports, must be avoided for the sake of Irish agrifood.  Even if this scenario is avoided, there will still be many important issues to consider in the future trading relationship. <br/><br/><b></b>Turning to trade and customs challenges, the UK is a member of the Single Market and the customs union at present and it applies the EU common external tariff and trade policy  If any or all of these things change, there will be an impact on trade and customs.  No third country has a customs-free border with the EU.  We acknowledge the relatively low level of customs checks currently, which results from pre-authorisation of traders, advance lodgement of declarations and an extensive system of post-clearance checks.  However, a key objective in negotiating the future trading relationship with the UK must be to minimise even further the trade cost impact of custom checks by ensuring a customs relationship with as little friction as possible.  The alternative is embedding additional trade costs into the business model of Irish agrifood exporters.  There would be a large question mark over our ability to recover those costs in the marketplace.<br/><br/>The other big issue for us is regulatory divergence.  Food products, particularly those of animal origin, face additional veterinary checks as well as customs controls.  There are over 2,000 EU laws affecting agrifood and this body of law is highly dynamic.  This dynamism is not just related to new legislation but also to reviews and recasts of existing regulations and directives such as, for example, the recast of the renewable energy directive, RED II, which can see substantial changes to the law.  In addition, in agrifood, food safety incidents such as the recent fipronil residues in eggs issue can often result in a policy or regulatory response or both.  Finding the right approach to managing regulatory divergence of food standards between the EU and UK will be essential for maintaining future trade as frictionlessly as possible.  This will require establishing a mechanism that will allow EU and UK food standards under the scope of veterinary legislation, as well as under food law in general to remain as closely aligned as possible; a mutually acceptable food inspection system regarding imports from third countries; and a continued close relationship between the UK and the European Food Safety Agency, EFSA, which is key to continued future alignment of food standards.</p><p>The objective must be to continue joint risk assessments with a common database to minimise divergence in standards and avoid trade impediments, and to reach an agreement on common rules on key drinks-related regulations which my colleagues will touch on in detail later.  Our submission also refers to a number of technical issues, rules of origin, inward and outward processing relief and the land bridge.  These are all critical and key issues which will need to be considered from an Irish agrifood perspective as they will have a major bearing on the future trading relationship.</p><p> The measures required by industry to respond to Brexit can be summarised as follows: a transition period of sufficient duration; a comprehensive and frictionless future trading relationship; regulatory convergence, not regulatory divergence; and additional support measures for agrifood, particularly in the areas of exceptional state aid supports, market diversification and market access.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear today and would welcome any questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Callan" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018120400002#C00200"><p>The Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland is also part of IBEC and we represent drinks manufacturers and distributors within the State.  Unusually within IBEC, we are an all-Ireland trade body and we also represent member companies in the North of Ireland, with a total of 48 companies.  The ABFI comprises five category trade associations looking after category-specific issues, including the Irish Brewers Association and associations for cider, spirits, whiskey and wine.</p> <p>  The Irish drinks industry operates on an integrated all-island basis with a particularly entwined sector in terms of production processes and supply chains.  We have three cross-Border geographic indications, which means Irish whiskey, Irish Cream and poteen are protected by the EU in a similar manner to champagne in that they can only be made on the island of Ireland.  We had four distilleries in 2014 but, following much investment, we now have 21 operational distilleries with another becoming operational in the coming weeks and a further 26 in planning.  That global protection means the investment is much stronger.</p> <p>  We are seeing a rise in fake products being sold in third markets along with the rise of Irish whiskey as the fastest growing spirits category in the world.  It was welcome to see in the withdrawal agreement that this protection will be replicated by the UK because we will rely on both jurisdictions to help us enforce that.  Members will have received our position paper with the title, Brexit and the Irish drinks industry, in which we focus on future priorities and the future relationship.  It is premised on the presumption that we will end up with an agreement rather than a no-deal scenario.</p> <p>  Some &euro;1.6 billion of drinks products were exported from the island of Ireland in 2017, with &euro;1.2 billion coming from this State.  According to the Central Statistics Office, the aggregate value of trade in drinks products between the UK and Ireland in 2017 was &euro;364 million, one third of which, &euro;121 million, was the aggregate value of North-South trade.  The spirits sector is a very big part of the economy of the North of Ireland.</p> <p>  The integrity of glass is essential for our products from a food safety perspective and more than 130 million glass bottles are imported into the State from the UK every year.  In the event of no deal, tariffs would apply to these imports.  Businesses are stockpiling, which means there are already shortages in core products.  We physically cross the Border with more than 23,000 truck movements annually, over 5,000 of which are alcohol tanker movements with products made in one jurisdiction and bottled in another.  The growth brought about by investment in the industry means we are using bottling sites across the country.</p> <p>  We are watching the vote in the House of Commons very closely and we have been liaising directly with the British Government and representatives of our Northern Irish members.  While not perfect, the withdrawal agreement represents the best possible approach to Brexit and we are strongly of the view that no deal would be seriously damaging to the Irish and UK economies, including the all-island drinks industry.  The potential consequences include the lack of continuity in legal protection for Irish cross-Border geographic indicators in the UK; immediate tariffs on cream, barley, malt, glass bottles, apples, finished cider and other supply chain inputs; and regulatory and custom checks at the Irish Border leading to additional delays and costs, with each one-hour delay for a truck costing &euro;100.  There will also be a requirement for upfront VAT payments at point of entry on cross-Border trade, which would have massive cashflow implications for business.  We currently have a very sophisticated excise control movement around the EU and if the UK does not replicate that, it poses very serious challenges as we are required to pay excise as we cross borders and face physical checks.  We would also see regulatory divergence across a range of standards, from labelling to bottle sizes.  The benefit of being in the EU Single Market is that those costs are reduced for businesses.</p> <p>  The adoption of the withdrawal agreement, therefore, represents the surest way to avoid these impacts.  The Government and State agencies have done a great job and members in the North have had nowhere near the amount of supports, education, awareness and proactivity that members here have received from the likes of Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and InterTrade Ireland.  With historical listings in the European Investment Bank, distilleries and spirit producers have so far not been able to access the Brexit loan schemes the Government introduced.  The application last year was completely prohibited because European investment funding was involved and the spirits category is blacklisted for this purpose.  We understand the Government is working very hard to ensure its future growth loan schemes and the scheme announced in this year's budget will be available to members.  We look forward to a satisfactory resolution of this issue.</p> <p>  Ireland has benefited greatly from access to EU-backed free trade agreements globally.  Scotch whisky is a key element of these agreements because so much is exported and it is very important for putting the drinks sector at the heart of its many agreements.  Once outside the agreements, however, Irish whiskey and Irish cream will be the second and third biggest exports in this sector.  We need to work very hard to ensure the EU continues to prioritise us in free trade agreements.  The recent EU agreement with Canada abolished outstanding tariffs on Irish cream liqueur and Irish gin.  All alcohol is bought by the state in Canada and specific tenders have been issued, meaning many of our smaller members, such as in the Irish gin sector, are being listed.  It is a fantastic boost to them and it is working really well for us.  We are positive about global trade agreements and have been inputting with European colleagues into potential free trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and the Mercosur bloc, all of which is very positive.  We are in 140 markets globally but we want to expand that number.</p> <p>  Free trade agreements, on their own, do not increase exports.  We also need to upskill our companies.  In our industry, cider has the greatest exposure to the UK, with 85% of all cider exports going to the UK in 2017 according to CSO export volume figures, compared to 71% for beer.  They are the two areas on which we need to focus for product diversification into new markets and this needs to be done with direct supports, such as participation in trade shows, and the provision of sales and marketing staff in international markets.  Having feet on the ground and having global brand ambassadors are essential for growing brands and we would like to see more investment by the Government in these areas.</p> <p>  We would also like more effective and robust market intelligence, not only in the area of the demographics of countries but into what our competitors are doing and where opportunities may lie.  The State can certainly assist us with this.  Category promotion, in the form of trade missions, is absolutely vital and a drinks element needs to be built into every trade mission on which a Minister goes.  </p> <p>  While free trade is often primarily viewed as a matter of tariffs, the issue of technical barriers to trade is equally important.  One of the key areas in the EU where there has been harmonisation is around labelling but, recently, the Government has sought to introduce a barrier to trade and has, indeed, created regulatory divergence on this island, North and South, with country only labels for Ireland under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  This measure will deter small beer, cider, wine and spirits producers from exporting to Ireland, including the Northern Irish gin producers for whom Ireland is one of their major markets.</p><p>The costs will be substantial.  It is important to look at that and implement it in as practical a way as possible.  We have asked the Minister for Health to establish an implementation group and would welcome the committee's support in that regard.  I thank the members for the opportunity to make the submission.  We look forward to answering any questions members have.</p></speech>

The witnesses commended Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners, the Government and InterTradeIreland for being prepared and for the work they have done.  Are they prepared for a "no deal" Brexit?  That is my question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018120400002#D00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentations.  At this stage, all one can do about Brexit is talk about it unless one is in the House of Commons over the next seven days.  We can talk about it until the cows come home.  My questions follow the question from Senator Conway-Walsh who asked about State bodies.  What contingency plans are being put in place by the individual companies the witnesses represent?  What action is being taken with a view to addressing all possible outcomes of next week's proceedings in the UK and further down the line?  What insulation have companies got for a mad fluctuation in sterling?  Irrespective of the outcome, it is a matter of how markets read the outcome on a trading basis.  While there might be no barriers and no divergence, sterling might fluctuate wildly.  How are the companies insulated or how will they be affected?  How do companies working cross-Border in two separate currency jurisdictions work so well from an export point of view?  The drinks industry seems to operate on an all-Ireland basis but it is an island with two distinct currencies.  How is that working now and how could it affect trading post-Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018120400002#D00400"><p>We do not know what is going to happen and that is the reality of the situation.  We can talk away about a "no deal" Brexit.  We can take the view that everything is great with the deal that is on next week but it could suddenly be gone.  We are speaking in a vacuum.  The witnesses represent the same body.  It is no reflection on them if I note to the committee that one presentation from a body would do.  In fairness to the witnesses, they have said they do not know what will happen.  We are engaging in guess work at the moment.  It looks like the deal will fall so it is a question of the implications and whether one can plan for that.  One does not know because another deal could be put in place with the result that all of the planning goes haywire.</p></speech>

From our perspective, we need to address both.  I take the point that there is a huge level of uncertainty and that things are changing on a daily basis, in particular in Westminster.  What was agreed in Brussels recently was twofold.  There was a withdrawal deal and a political declaration on the future trading relationship.  They are going to get to that and it will hopefully be relatively soon but it is only a political declaration at this stage.  It will become a free-trade agreement of some kind between the EU 27 and the UK.  That is why, when we look at the medium to long-term aspects of this, we consider it to be hugely important to think about, talk about and be focused on these issues.  Over the longer term, the outcome of that process will lock in our trading relationship with what will most likely remain our most important agrifood trading partner.  If we do not get things right around customs and the regulatory relationship, costs will be embedded into our business model in the long term.  As such, it is hugely important to look at those.  There is a degree of certainty in the sense that it is going to happen at some stage or other.  As such, it is important for us to focus on that.<br/><br/>From the immediate perspective, there is a great deal of uncertainty and it is very difficult from an investment perspective.  From a business perspective and contingency planning, which is also a matter for the State agencies, there is a certain amount that can be done regarding a &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit.  In some respects, companies have gone past the point of no return and one can probably say the same about State agencies given the additional veterinary and customs inspectors that are needed.  One cannot simply recruit someone and put him or her <i>in situ</i>.  Training is required and physical infrastructure has to be put in place.  It is clear that the agencies are working towards December 2020 as the time by which they must be fully up to speed on that but I imagine emergency measures will be needed in the event that there is no deal on 29 March.<br/><br/>As Ms Callan said, companies have outlined the various scenarios and done all the plans.  The major issue for most companies is that the level of uncertainty means the sort of investment required to ensure one is done and dusted by 29 March does not make business sense.  They will do what they can where there is little or no cost.  However, if substantial investment is required, most companies are not in a position to make it, in particular in low-margin businesses like food and drink.</p></speech>

They have been very clear that they are planning for the central case scenario of having that transition.  Even in my last engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I challenged that because it is bad.  Our Revenue Commissioners have no plan for customs on this island.  All the focus has been on east-west customs with the basic presumption being that it will not happen as there is political agreement that it will all be sorted.  We think it would only be responsible to have done some sort of analysis, but the official position is that they have done nothing.  That is what they have told us.  That means we will be at the cliff's edge on 29 March and no one can plan for that.  People have to focus on where to put resources.  Logically, one is listening to all the mood messages and taking the view that it could not possibly happen.  If it does, however, really dramatic decisions will be required.  One cannot have everything in place across all sectors and regulatory areas.  One would have to have some way to keep things going for a while by doing fewer inspections and so on.</p> <p>  As to contingency planning by our members, everyone is taking this very seriously.  The larger companies have spent a great deal of money and carried out very detailed case studies around supply chains and the like with a view to ensuring everything is seamless and that there is as little impact as possible on the consumer.</p><p>We cannot just think negatively.  UK-based businesses are also reviewing from where they will supply.  There might be some upsides such as, for example, in joint shipments to third countries.  Irish whiskey is packaged in Scotland and sent from there.  It might make more sense to turn it around and do it from here.</p><p> In a real practical sense, we brought members by one by one into the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to work through their specific issues.  The questions are about ports.  People want to know if Dublin Port is going to work.  They want to understand what will the tracking systems be, the lanes and who will be given priority.  They are the questions companies are asking.  It is granular stuff.  It has been an interesting process and the companies have found it helpful to obtain that level of detail.</p><p> We have also been to Task Force 50 twice in the past five weeks to work through detailed excise stuff and how it will all work.  It must be borne in mind that the UK Government has also come late to this process.  Our very first meeting on excise issues with the UK authorities was about six weeks ago.  There is no level of planning, although we certainly found good engagement and people had a good understanding of our issues.</p><p> My concern is that if we keep on going with the unknown, businesses will have to make decisions.  They cannot just adopt the wait and see approach.  People are already stockpiling and warehouses are full across the retail sector, as well as in our industry.  Owing to that advance buying, one will see knock-on implications for both the Irish and UK economies when it all rolls out.  One then has practical issues in terms of physical movements and planning for them.  One might hear people saying they have had enough of this and they will hedge their bets one way or another in either jurisdiction, in the North or the South in our case.  The Government needs to up its communications on the detail.  We hear about how many jobs are being created in Departments and agencies, but we do not hear how it is going to help us as businesses.  We know that is essential, as well as how protection of the food supply chain is critical.</p></speech>

We have brought in companies one by one, meaning that we have seen officials in the Department regularly in the past while.  We felt that was a better approach because businesses cannot share confidential information with each other.  To deal with the nitty-gritty and get practical insights, one has to have one to one meetings.  The Department was willing to do this, which was helpful.</p> <p>  On currencies, most of our companies deal in 140 markets.  Even our smaller companies are much better prepared to deal with such matters than the food sector in which there are much narrower margins.  We have sophisticated modelling, as well as hedging instruments and such like.  Obviously, if it is a free-for-all chaotic Brexit, no one can plan for it and one will certainly see a hit.  Again, however, we are in relatively good stead.</p> <p>  On the differences between our organisations, we have some members in common, but all of our smaller companies are not in IBEC; they are in the Small Firms Association which is also part of IBEC.  Our Northern members are only with our association.  Accordingly, we are bringing that broader perspective.</p> <p>  We have seen significant investment in the drinks sector in Ireland purely because people believe in the product and our capacity to have the fastest growing spirits sector in the world.  Building a distillery can cost between &euro;15 million and &euro;25 million.  It was &euro;50 million in the case of one of the more recent announcements.  Another &euro;5 million is needed to mature the stock and as much again for marketing and sales.  There are geographic indications, as well as the belief we have top-notch product which is making traction in global markets.  That is why we are continuing to see money invested in the sector.</p> <p>  From our perspective, the threat greater than Brexit is something like the Public Health (Alcohol) Act.  There is also the US trade war.  In the space of two and a half weeks we went from having steel tariffs to tariffs on bourbon and whiskey.  There is still a 25% tariff on an imported product here, with the threat that the United States will retaliate against us at any time.  Up to 50% of Irish cream and whiskey goes to the United States.  If it hits us with a 25% tariff, the impact will be much more dramatic for us than Brexit.</p> <p>  We are clear on the issues.  We need people to work with us at that granular level.  High politics is all well and good, but we now need to get into the detail.</p></speech>

In the past ten years the growth of craft breweries, distilleries and so forth has been a good news story.  Ms Callan has referred to three more coming on stream in the next few weeks.  Has the industry had to review its targets?</p></speech>

However, the position is different in the case of cider and beer, even in the production process.  Up to 85% of cider finished product goes to the United Kingdom.  The majority of apples used in the process are grown north of the Border.  If one was to have a tariff on apples coming in and a tariff on one&rsquo;s final product going out, one would have some serious difficulties.  That is the type of product with which one needs to diversify and, if necessary, move manufacturing accordingly.</p></speech>

It has serious decisions to make.  For many food companies, it depends on where one one's market is and if one can diversify.  Most businesses, however, do not approach it from that viewpoint.  The United Kingdom is a profitable market in which they are ingrained.  They ask us how they can protect what they have and grow that market.  The question is from where one would supply it.  The difference in the case of spirits and geographical indications is that there is no option, one has to make it on the island of Ireland.  There is unique protection, which is why the laws on it are most important.</p></speech>

The craft beer sector has had great success in more recent years.  Again, however, it is always going to be more costly.  Our concern is the ports and the competition for space.  The Government is more concerned with imports, rather than exports, because that is its duty.  It is business-minded and states it is because it must ensure the ports will not be clogged up for our exports.  Fundamentally, its responsibility is managing imports and its responsibilities include customs, veterinary checks and so forth.  At that point, we will need to get product off this small island because we are an exporting nation.  How do we up our subventions for new routes and ferries?  Initially, the Government might have to subsidise it as an emergency measure as there might not be enough freight.  One will need to carve out new routes and the infrastructure to go with them.</p></speech>

We represent 35 companies in the North and the South.  Obviously, we have historic distilleries across country such as Midleton and Kilbeggan in this jurisdiction and Bushmills in the North.  We also have a number of smaller distilleries coming on stream in Northern Ireland.  A different approach will have to be taken in the North and the South in representing the interests of these companies.  At present, all Irish whiskey producers are in the European Union.  They all benefit equally from access to EU free trade agreements which have been significant in opening up new market opportunities around the world.  If there is no deal, possibly in a later post-transition stage, producers in Northern Ireland may not have access to the same free trade options.  We will have a dual trade policy function in engaging on behalf of our members in this jurisdiction through the European Commission, while engaging with the Department for International Trade in London on Northern Ireland trade.  One of the biggest challenges Brexit presents for our members in Northern Ireland is the loss of access to EU free trade agreements.  They were significant in opening up exports and turning the Northern Irish economy around from being a closed regional economy to an open and globalised one.  That is one of the biggest threats we face.</p><p>As a North-South body, we will have to take up that dual function to represent members in Brussels and London on trade policy.  That is one of the most significant implications we face.</p></speech>

Going forward, there is a question mark over that.  If one looks at the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, products in Northern Ireland will be required to be labelled "product of UK, Northern Ireland".  From an Irish whiskey point of view, we have a concern about that.  We would far prefer to use "product of Northern Ireland" and our producers in the North feel that way too.  The word "Irish" is protected in the term "Irish whiskey".  Irish whiskey is a defined category and the fastest growing spirit category in the world.  We want to protect the Irish identity of the product but that is very much an issue which can be dealt with in the negotiations on the future relationship.  It is just one issue within the withdrawal agreement which is, overall, the best approach to Brexit.  There are many issues here and the backstop may never come into play.  An agreement might be put in place before an extended transition.  The focus now in representing our businesses in Northern Ireland is to express support for the withdrawal agreement.  A "no deal" is something we want to avoid.  We hope that early in the new year, we will be in a position to move on from the withdrawal agreement to look at that future relationship.  That is why the ABFI position paper published in October is very much about priorities for the future relationship.  We want to get into those discussions and ensure companies in this jurisdiction and the North can get the best possible deal, not from this agreement, but from the next agreement.</p></speech>

The geographic indications for the three cross-Border spirits are unique within the EU.  They will be the only three geographic indications of approximately 3,000, if one takes everything from Italian cheese and Parma ham to champagne, which cross a border.  As such, there is a definite need for close co-operation.  That co-operation already exists.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the competent authority in this jurisdiction while HMRC and Defra are the competent authorities in the UK.  There is already very close co-operation on the application and enforcement of the geographic indications and we want to ensure it continues.  We hope that as part of an agreement under which there is a whole architecture and infrastructure of joint committees, there is a specific joint committee on geographic indications given their unique cross-Border status.</p></speech>

Specifically, this technical Supplementary Estimate will transfer &euro;15 million of savings in certain areas of the Vote to the World Food Programme, WFP, to support its humanitarian work across the world.  I am also requesting the committee's approval for funding of a further &euro;23 million for the agri-environmental schemes to ensure that there is sufficient funding available to pay a higher advance payment of 85% funding to all farmers who establish their eligibility under these schemes.  Finally, a provision for a further &euro;7 million is requested for provision of payment under the various fodder schemes implemented to assist farmers during the fodder difficulties.</p> <p>  The &euro;15 million current funds required for the WFP would be transferred from various subheads where due to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the administrative budget pay subhead, control and other support scheme costs, research, quality and certification, development and promotion of agriculture and food, other services and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  There is a total figure of &euro;3.6 million under the payroll underspend.  The saving arises from a lower than estimated pay bill due to recruitment of additional and replacement staff not proceeding as quickly as planned.  Also as a result of a large turnover of staff due mainly to career opportunities for staff across the civil and public services, short-term gaps can arise that in turn give rise to savings in the payroll budget.  </p> <p>  There is a saving of &euro;2.3 million under the subheading control and other support scheme costs.  This has been identified as a result of non-requirement to draw down funds that are set aside as a prudent reserve in case of financial sanctions in our clearance of accounts procedures.  There is a saving of &euro;1.4 million under the subheading of other services.  This has arisen due to savings in our legal expenses in 2018.  There is a saving of &euro;1.7 million under the subheading of research, quality and certification.  </p> <p>  The 2018 provision was primarily required to meet funding commitments arising from expenditure incurred on previously awarded projects and for new commitments and advances on Call 2017.  Expenditure in 2018 is likely to be some &euro;2 million below the original estimate of &euro;18.6 million.  It is hoped, however, that will be a greater response to future calls for further research projects as existing projects come to fruition and are replaced and in order to maintain the constant level of research activity needed to underpin the sector.  </p> <p>  There is a saving of &euro;3.6 million under the subheading of development and promotion of agriculture and food - non-farm.  The savings are arising as there has been a lower than projected spend on lean reviews by food companies as a result of a lower than expected project completion rate in 2018 from what was initially forecast.  It is understood that companies are re-examining projects in light of Brexit.  In addition, the artisan food and small producer schemes have a lower than expected number of approvals that require payment in arrears.  It is expected that these commitments will be drawn down in 2019.  </p> <p>  There has been a saving of &euro;2.4 million under the subheading of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  BIM has been assisting seafood industry members to get Brexit ready.  Industry demand for Brexit assistance via grant schemes is difficult to apportion as the services provided are available in a number of individual sector schemes.  These are demand-led schemes that have resulted in a lower than expected outturn compared to what was forecast in 2018, which has resulted in a savings of &euro;2.4 million.</p> <p>  Overall, these current expenditure savings amount to some &euro;15 million.  With the committee's approval, this will be transferred to fund the WFP.  This additional &euro;15 million provided for WFP in this Supplementary Estimate represents an advance payment of next year's commitment under Ireland's strategic partnership agreement with the WFP.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the WFP's executive director who has written to inform me that this funding will significantly contribute to enhancing the WFP's capability to plan its interventions and better address the several growing humanitarian crises around the world.</p><p> The 2018 budgetary allocations for current expenditure under the agri-environmental schemes is &euro;232.8 million.  The expenditure projections were based on paying schemes at the 75% advance rate set out in the EU regulatory framework.  However, due to the difficult circumstances farmers were finding themselves in, in particular the fodder shortage and the unprecedented weather, I made a request to the European Commission for approval for Ireland to pay higher advance payments of 85% for Pillar II rural development schemes, which is allowed under EU regulations in exceptional circumstances.  The additional &euro;23 million sought in this Supplementary Estimate will facilitate this higher payment to farmers, in particular GLAS and the organic farming scheme, and will bring the total spend under agri-environmental schemes to &euro;256 million in 2018.  I urge all participants in receipt of correspondence from the Department to submit required documentation to enable issuing of their advance payment in 2018.</p><p> In early 2018, I introduced the fodder transport scheme and a fodder import measure.  In response to the deteriorating weather conditions and fodder shortages experienced in the sector in recent months, the Department put in place a range of support measures to address the situation.  The fodder incentive production scheme was introduced in autumn 2018 with an allocation &euro;2.75 million.  This measure provided an incentive of &euro;155 per hectare for tillage growers to grow a temporary crop of short rotation grasses for fodder production over the winter months and &euro;100 per hectare for those growing catch crops.  It is expected that somewhere between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;1.8 million will be paid before year end.  The fodder import scheme, which was also introduced in autumn 2018 has an original allocation &euro;4.25 million.  This measure was introduced to contribute to the transport costs of imported forage, including hay, silage, haylage and alfalfa, from outside the island of Ireland.  The closing date of the scheme is 31 December 2018.  Importers are currently submitting their applications to allow payment to issue.  At this stage, as it is a demand-led scheme, it is difficult to estimate the level of expenditure in this scheme for 2018.  It is not expected that the full &euro;4.25 million will be drawn down in 2018.  The additional &euro;7 million sought in this Supplementary Estimate will facilitate these payments.</p><p> The original allocation in 2018 to the Brexit response loan scheme of &euro;25 million was current funding, as was the allocation for earlier loan schemes.  However, due to a technical decision by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the allocation now needs to be reclassified and paid as capital expenditure.  No extra expenditure above what was originally provided for in 2018 is involved.</p><p> The Department's appropriations-in-aid have been substantially greater in 2018 than provided for in the 2018 Revised Estimates.  We seek to offset our additional requests against these receipts.  These payments are from the European Commission and are the EU funding component for our co-funded rural development programme schemes, including areas of natural constraints scheme, GLAS, TAMS and the beef data and genomics programme.  These are paid in arrears by the Commission, usually on a quarterly basis.  The additional receipts reflect the late arrival of a payment in respect of the third quarter of 2017, which was expected to be received by the Department in December 2017 but was not received until early January 2018.</p><p> This is a technical Supplementary Estimate.  The savings I have outlined will be used to fund the World Food Programme and agri-environmental schemes, in particular GLAS and the fodder schemes.  I earnestly recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee for support.  I am happy to respond to any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

I might as well get on with it and ask it now.  There was a serious article in the agriculture media this week about trim in factories and this is something that farmers have felt aggrieved about for a number of years.  It now seems concrete evidence is available that what farmers have suspected for a long time is actually the case and that factories have been found guilty of excessive trim before the carcass gets to the weighing scales.  It is imperative that we know the names of the factories, the dates on which they were caught at the offences and how many carcasses were involved.  How regular are the checks in the various factories?  Are there repeat offenders?  What detailed scrutiny do the factories have on trim?  What percentage of inspections have found an overzealous trim?  A &euro;200 fine was imposed.  That seems to be a very light slap on the knuckles for something farmers feel has cost them a lot of money over a significant period of time.</p></speech>

My recollection of the figures I have seen are that in 2017 there were approximately 56,000 carcass examinations; there were no penalties in 2015;  in 2016, 28 penalties were incurred; in 2017 there were none; and, to date, in 2018, 20 or 21 penalties have been incurred.  There were no penalties in two years and fewer than 30 in the other two years.  As I understand it, the options available are either administrative sanctions or prosecutions and to date there have been administrative sanctions.  This means there has been no day out in court on the issue.</p></speech>

According to the document, carbon dioxide levels are well below the 1990 and 2005 baselines.  It also suggests agricultural ammonia or NH3 emissions are increasing significantly but figures for 2016 are not yet available.  They were supposed to available by early 2018, however.  They should have been available for this meeting.</p> <p>  Where are reductions in carbon emissions being achieved and where are they targeted?  They are increasing every year and the outlook is not favourable.  I know there is a dilemma in how to manage this in the context of the projected growth in agriculture under Food Wise 2025 and so on.  Surely the Department needs to target this area now.  It should decide how we can start to reduce the carbon emissions or at least maintain current levels, which would not be adequate, as is recognised across Government.</p></speech>

Under the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, we have funding available.  Deputy Pringle mentioned ammonia.  That is one area where we are significantly challenged because our ammonia emissions are virtually at the ceiling.  We are grant-aiding low emissions slurry spreading as a technology in contrast to splash-plate spreading of slurry.  The former reduces ammonia emissions by in the region of 30%.  That is one area where there is a significant gain.</p> <p>  There is a host of other initiatives and the agrifood industry generally needs to take these on board.  These include investment in the beef data genomics programme.  We are enhancing that through the additional allocation in the 2019 budget for the beef environmental efficiency scheme to reduce the carbon footprint of the beef sector.  There are those who will say that, relatively speaking, our emissions profile in the beef sector competitive, but we need to do more.</p> <p>  Along with New Zealand, we are considered to be one of the most carbon efficient producers of dairy per unit of output.  However, we need to reduce emissions intensity in the dairy sector as well.  Measures such as the beef data genomics programme and the beef environmental efficiency scheme will enable us to accelerate the journey to a more carbon efficient beef sector by having a small suckler cow, a bigger weanling, a more fertile suckler cow and a cow that is easy-calving.  All these collectively contribute to a lower carbon footprint on the slaughtered animal.  That is important, not only because of the climate change responsibility but also increasingly important for the market, which is asking questions about the environmental sustainability of the industry.</p> <p>  We have measures such as milk recording on the dairy side.  There has been increased output in the dairy sector since quotas were abolished.  I have seen figures suggesting that 70% of the increased output has come from increased cattle numbers and 30% from increased use of genetics.  We need to turn the tables substantially and get more from improved genetics in the dairy herd.  Up to a point, it is understandable that there may have been a headlong rush to avail of the opportunities post quota.  However, we now need to concentrate on catching up with efficiencies.  We need to ensure data are available from milk recording.  Currently, milk recording is used in only 40% of dairy herds.  Increasing the number of herds where milk recording is used and using the data from milk recording to improve the genetic merit of the dairy herd further would have been considered to have been a leader in terms of the economic breeding index.  We need to do more in that area.  That will allow us to get more production from fewer cow numbers.  That improves the carbon efficiency of the industry.</p> <p>  Grassland management is a particularly important area, as is improving soil fertility.  It is a staggering figure, but in the beef sector fewer than 1% of beef farmers are involved in grassland management.  Grassland management involves measuring grass growth using pasture base or other technologies that are available to ensure production is from a sustainable food source.  We can grow grass better than anyone else.  Promoting use of grass measurement is important.  Teagasc runs the Grass10 programme.  Yesterday, we had the announcement of the grassland farms of the year across the dairy, sheep and beef sectors.  We need to mainstream grassland management.  Again, there is higher participation on the dairy side but we need to ensure that these practices are brought into the mainstream across all sectors.</p> <p>  We need to improve soil fertility to its optimum level and reduce in some instances the amount of chemical fertiliser that we need to apply.  When applying fertiliser we should use the most environmentally friendly options, for example, protected urea as opposed to using calcium ammonium nitrate as a nitrogen source.  That significantly improves the effect of the release of nitrous oxide, which is another one of the greenhouse gases.  Soil fertility is important.</p> <p>  Another side of this is greenhouse gas production.  If we are producing food, we will have greenhouse gas production.  We need to look at how we can sequester the maximum amount of carbon possible.  We spend in excess of &euro;100 million on the Department's afforestation and forestry road programme.  It is important that farmers take up the opportunity this presents.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, recently concluded a review of the forestry programme and has tweaked it significantly, with new options such as low-density agri-forestry to try to address the mix of deciduous and hardwood trees.  We are increasing the payments marginally to improve take-up to sequester carbon production.</p> <p>  There is no one initiative that will address this problem on its own.  It will involve a combination of a series of initiatives, some of which I have mentioned.</p></speech>

This is a global challenge.  The Paris Agreement, which our sector must reflect, calls for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions without compromising food production.  We face a fundamental question.  There are those who advocate dismantling the national herd and in many respects dismantling the rural economy based on food production, cattle rearing etc.  That is one school of thought.

Because of the increased opportunities in the post-dairy quota era, emissions that were either flatlining or on a downward trajectory have begun to rise again.  We have to factor in the fact that while they are rising, we are still the most carbon efficient.  There is demand.  Is it better for people who want dairy products to buy them from producers who are efficient and committed to being more so, or from producers who have a much higher carbon footprint?  We have an advantage in this regard.  We should build on that, but we must do so in the most climate-friendly way.</p></speech>

Overall, it is welcome that the World Food Programme, GLAS, and fodder schemes will benefit from this.  I support the Supplementary Estimate.  I have a question concerning the Vote overall.  What will happen to this funding in 2019 if, say, there are adverse weather events or a terrible impact is caused by Brexit or CAP changes?  What kind of contingency has the Department?</p> <p>  Is the Minister concerned by payroll and the delays in recruitment?  Is that inevitable because of movement within the Civil Service? </p> <p>  I would also like to ask about the status of the Brexit loan scheme.  Farmers are concerned about the delay in accessing funding.  Is the Minister happy with how accessible it is to those who require it? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018120400002#E03800"><p>On the latter question, the legislation enabling us to proceed with the capital investment fund in early 2019 has completed its journey through the Seanad.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is piloting that legislation.  It is minor and technical legislation.  As I understand it, primary legislation must underpin the loan initiative because of the involvement of the European Investment Bank.  I imagine that will be concluded in the D&aacute;il before Christmas and, therefore, all the legislative hurdles associated with the launch of the loan scheme in early 2019 will be cleared.  As I said previously, we identified a gap in the market for funding for capital investment in the area of longer-term finance.  There is sufficient competition in the market for shorter-term money.  We identified a gap in the market for finance over eight to ten years.  We propose to fill that gap with this product.  There will be a minium borrowing requirement of &euro;50,000.  Unsecured borrowing at an interest rate of less than 5% will be offered.  Those are the main characteristics of the loan product we will introduce.</p> <p>  On weather, this Supplementary Estimate was required for a couple of reasons.  One reason was the fodder initiative we introduced.  I do not make this point to denigrate in any way those still facing significant challenges, but our initial audit showed a fodder deficit of almost 30%.  The most recent audit showed that we were at a 1% deficit.  This shows the value of working collaboratively.  We have reached this point through work led by my own Department and Teagasc, in collaboration with all stakeholders, including farm organisations, financial institutions and the agrifood industry.</p><p>There are many who would have had us do much more at a much earlier stage at much more expense.  All of the steps we took, however, were prudent and appropriate.  They have got us to a situation now where the deficit is manageable.  I urge farmers who still face a challenge with their holdings to engage with the advisory service and, in particular, to get involved in fodder budgeting.  The Department will keep the situation under review.  One of the initiatives on tillage side where we have had a response was the planting of 20,000 hectares.  That is important and we should be appreciative of the tillage sector for that response.</p><p> There is also the import aspect.  I am aware some approved importers now have a situation where the products they have imported are warehoused rather than distributed.  They are those - including some who may be in this room and if the cap fits, wear it - who would have had us importing in July.  We would be left with stockpiles of fodder now.  The benefit of having worked collaboratively was that the steps taken were appropriate and taken at the appropriate time.  We will, however, keep the situation under review.  If there is a need to intervene in 2019, we will review it then.</p></speech>

We all have to be realistic.  The weather does what the weather does and we cannot control that.  Having said that, every effort has to be made to mitigate against it, as far as possible.  We have these discussions many times.  The fodder crisis can be solved by most farmers on their own farms and that is the best place to solve it.  Every assistance should be given to farmers to maximise the fodder they produce themselves.  The way farmers manage their own grasslands is the best way of ensuring we can resolve these problems in future.</p> <p>  Some of the measures in place in that regard such as the knowledge transfer scheme have helped with that.  It is, ultimately, however, down to the area of the country a farmer is in.  Someone farming in County Wexford this year would talk about a need for irrigation.  Farmers in Donegal, however, still have a problem with wet soil.  It depends on where a person is and what the problems are.  That being said, we have been fortunate that the fodder crisis people expected and feared did not materialise.  Thank God it did not.  We will move on from there as best we can.</p> <p>  A number of other issues were mentioned.  Pay was mentioned, as were administration and savings.  Most of that is the result perhaps, as the Minister has said, of people retiring and not being replaced as quickly as anticipated.  I am conscious farmers in many areas are waiting to get payments and there have been delays.  Is the shortage of staff having an impact and is that something that needs to be considered?  There is a broader issue in the context of Brexit.  I notice there was some shortfall in funding, particularly through An Bord Bia and other agencies.  Deputy Pringle mentioned climate change during the discussion earlier and all of that is part of this.  We need to look at alternatives and where we are going in the future.  </p> <p>  We all know we are the most energy and carbon efficient producers of milk, which is fine.  The growth in the volume of milk produced has created a problem as well.  That is because of the open market.  There is a similar scenario in beef production but that has been decreasing because the market has led to that situation.  How much effort has been put into, and how much more effort could be put into, opening up alternative sectors that will mitigate against our carbon emissions?  I refer to those not there at present where farmers could do more to help the climate situation while also make a profit for themselves.  I refer to a profit they will have today rather one that will be a retirement fund like forestry.  That type of profit is long term and far into the future.  This is one of the key areas that needs to be looked at.  </p> <p>  We are looking at a Vote here today but I am more interested in where we plan to be in ten, 15 or 20 years.  That is what we need to consider for the agricultural sector.  We can all state what is good now and call for us do more of it.  We need, however, to look much further ahead than that because today's bubble might burst.  There is great merit in long-term planning in this area.  Where is the space in this budget for that long-term planning?  I refer to examining the opening up of new sectors and possibilities or taking niche markets and developing them into something that will be progressive and good for new sectors into the future.</p></speech>

In that context, building resilience on farms is important.  Returning to the point I made to Deputy Pringle on grassland management, this is an area where we can do much more.  Previous advice on carrying surplus silage from one season into another regarded it as a charge on the balance sheet and not good farming.  We need to move away from that.  We need to build up reserves in a prudent way to take account of events outside of our control.  That message is swinging back into vogue.</p> <p>  The difference in grassland management is staggering between those who use the science and technology available and those who do not.  At an awards ceremony yesterday, I made the point that we need to make things as simple as possible in this regard.  We talk about apps and pasture base, etc.  Sometimes that is challenging for farmers who may not be technologically savvy.  It is simple, however.  We are referring to soil fertility that reduces the volume of fertiliser that needs to be spread.  We need to make that knowledge available to all farmers because the difference in the yields of tonnes of grass and dry matter between the best farmers and those at the other extreme is staggering in regard to the additional costs.  We can make much progress there.  </p> <p>  I am advised that there are no undue delays with farm payments.  There are always individual cases for one reason or another.  There are, however, no staffing issues in the critical areas processing payments.  Notwithstanding an underspend in the staff area, we have recruited additional staff to address shortfalls across the range of activities in which the Department is involved.</p> <p>  The Deputy's observation on beef production is incorrect regarding the reason for the decrease.  He may be mistaken because there is a marginal reduction in the number of suckler cows, which is accepted, but the beef kill is at almost record high levels.  In recent weeks, it has been at 40,000 or more.  Suckler cows and the expanding dairy herd have given rise to a larger population of calf to beef in dairy herd enterprises.  Overall, then, there is not a decline in beef production.</p></speech>

Some of the points I am making are on how to drive efficiency by using things such as genetic merit, grassland technology and reducing costs.  They will all help.  The market, however, is the market.  There is not much I can do about that.  What I can do is encourage farmers to avail of the range of initiatives in which the Department is involved.  The Deputy makes an interesting point about new enterprises.  One of the areas where there are opportunities is organic farming.  There is market demand for certified organic produce and we have reopened the organic scheme, albeit with modest funding.  There are major opportunities in the organic sphere in the dairy and tillage areas, although not exclusively in those areas.  For example, we import organic oats.</p><p>We are approaching a stage where a successor to the Food Wise 2025 document will be needed.  That will need to examine the challenges that lie ahead.  Such challenges include climate change so how to draft a vision for the industry for the next decade is a challenge we will consider in the very near future.  New opportunities must be part of that consideration as well.</p></speech>

The market dictates and demands.  However, I would put it to him that a significant amount of taxpayers' money goes into marketing Irish food produce around the world through Bord Bia.  When taxpayers' money is being used to market food, very often the people who make the most money from that food are not the primary producers but the people in the middle such as the processors and the supermarkets.  Is there not a responsibility to ensure that the primary producer gets a fair price?  We all know the interests of the consumer must be looked after but the interests of the primary producer must also be looked after.  A significant amount of public money is going into this industry.  It is going directly to farmers but it also goes into the industry through marketing all this food and ensuring that there is an adequate price but that the latter does not go back to the primary producer and certainly not to the farmer from Drumshanbo who sends them the weanling.  Such a farmer does not see it, which is the problem.  I put it to the Minister that there must be a level of responsibility in terms of State funding for all of this, but the primary producer is not getting a return.</p></speech>

We promote Ireland as the food island and do a lot of work in terms of market access, etc., which is as it should be.  In terms of legislation, there is an initiative at EU level that is not insignificant and has been broadly welcomed by the industry in terms of taxing unfair trading practices because I share the view that primary producers and at the other end, consumers invariably end up in the weakest positions on that supply chain.  Anything we can do in that space to create a fairer playing pitch is important.</p> <p>  The other thing we have done is make funding available to farmers through producer organisations.  This is part of the infrastructure and architecture in other countries but is something whose possibilities we are only beginning to explore.  We have approved a number of people to facilitate the establishment of producer organisations, which would not just enable negotiations in respect of specifications, etc., and engagement with meat plants but would also enable those producer organisations to address their cost base through group purchasing and so on.  That is important and something on which we could make progress.</p></speech>

For many farmers, they do not go from start to finish.  Where I am from in the west, farmers generally produce weanlings but they have neither the land nor the capacity to finish animals.  They must sell their animals on to other farmers who can do that, so there is a break in the chain.  One of the flaws that exists is that farmers cannot produce the finished product.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018120400002#G00900"><p>How producer organisations might assist that cohort of farmers is a matter that could be usefully explored.  One thing that bedevils the beef industry is the amount of movement.  The number of people trying to carve a slice out of the end product is probably too high.  A group that would assist the sellers of weanlings to finishers could work as a producer organisation.  A farmer does not necessarily always have to engage with the end buyer.  This is an area where we are significantly behind the curve.  We have identified funding for it and we should make progress on it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

There has been an increase in dairy numbers in recent years.  In particular, a significant number of Friesian cows were culled this year and I suggest that this has had a negative effect on the beef market.  Next spring, we will see a lot of Friesian calves coming into the market.  Are we developing extra markets for these because the word is that, come next spring, Friesian calves will be hard to dispose of and the price for them will be very poor?  Are we looking at other markets for these calves?  I was talking to another factory this morning.  Its normal breakdown would be 30% culled cows and 70% beef.  It is telling me that this is now 50:50.  This must be reversed in order to change the difficult differences in price at the moment.  Are extra markets being developed for calves that will be difficult to sell next spring and beyond?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018120400002#G01100"><p>My recollection of the figures is that there have been approximately 215,000 live exports to date in 2018.  That is up by in the region of 30% on the figure for 2017.  Of those, approximately 150,000 were exported calves.  That is subject to correction but that is my recall of the detail so we are growing it significantly.  Can we keep ahead of the growth in the national herd on the dairy side?  That is a challenge but we are looking for as many opportunities as possible.  The most significant issue for the export of cattle is compliance with the regulations.  Anything less is a disservice to the industry, to say the least.  We must be extremely vigilant because it is an area where there is a lot of vigilance around our activities.</p> <p>  In the broader context of live exports, obviously, the Turkish market took a hit.  It was one of those issues we could not control.  It was the perfect geopolitical issue - a spat between the US and Turkey - and the collapse in the value of the lira made it uneconomical for us.  They have begun to source other opportunities.  We are extremely active in a host of areas.  The market access unit has renegotiated the veterinary certification for the Libyan market.  This will give rise to increased numbers heading in the direction of live exports.  Spain has become a significant market for live exports.  Ultimately, many of those probably migrate to north Africa.  We are also looking at other opportunities across north Africa, such as in Morocco, Algeria and, to an extent, Egypt.  I am not sure but there may be opportunities in Egypt.  I recently met the ambassador of Kazakhstan to explore opportunities there.  We are vigilant across a range of market opportunities and obviously keep an eye on Turkey and what might happen there in the future.  Live exports are a really important part of the competitive mix, as are new markets for processed meat.  In 2018, market access to China opened up.  This is a major development and it is hoped that it could give rise to significant trade.</p></speech>

We have probably gone way off our format.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2018120400002#G01300"><p>What I am going to say may not be received too well but I will say it in any event.  In the context of the fodder scheme, I make no apologies for putting forward proposals regarding the fodder crisis.  In mid-July, we were facing a famine in the winter.  Thankfully, the weather intervened and we got an extremely good back end of the year.  However, schemes proposed by us, such as the extension of fertiliser and slurry spreading and the catch crops with the tillage farmers, have played a significant part in redressing the imbalance that was there.</p><p>If we get a late spring, whatever surplus of imported fodder we have in store will not take long to disappear.  In the southern half of the country, where fodder was non-existent in mid-August, the situation has improved very dramatically.  Cattle were out grazing up to three or four days ago.  If it is favourable in the springtime, we will have fodder left over, which is a far better situation in which to be.  We raised the matter in the D&aacute;il and, thankfully, the Minister and the Department took initiatives.  Those initiatives with the help of good weather have changed what was a disastrous situation into one where we can come out the far side without the disastrous financial implication of a serious shortage of fodder.  Farmers have incurred enormous expense - it was probably the most expensive year farmers have endured for a long period.  There were eight to ten weeks in the summer during which stock were fed at winter levels.  That has also left a major merchant debt level which will need to be addressed and which will be a serious issue for the future.<br/><br/>The Minister is not in touch with what is happening in the beef industry.  I have never seen farmers as despondent about the industry.  I finish a few cattle myself.  Everyone in the chain, from the man producing the calf to the man finishing the animal, is absolutely despondent about the future of the beef industry.  Costs for finishing cattle have risen by approximately 25% to 30% while the price has gone in the other direction.  We can talk all we like about getting increased live exports, getting extra calves away next spring and the hope that various markets will open up.  The reality is that we have had 40,000 killed and we are not able to sell 40,000 cattle efficiently.  That is the bottom line.  Our factories are not able to do it and if they are doing it, they are making a lot of money because they are not paying a viable return to the producer.<br/><br/>Cattle prices are disastrous, as are store prices.  The Chairman stated that farmers dread the thought of what they will get for calves next spring.  There is despondency throughout the beef industry.  Farmers have taken enough.  If one asks a suckler farmer, he will say the show is over.  The man who bought animals and took them from calves to beef will say the same thing.  There is complete lack of confidence in the grading system.  We see animals being given O grades but there is no quality assurance.  When that beef appears on a supermarket shelf in Dunnes Stores or in a Lidl in London or wherever, the customer will not see there was an O-grade carcass and yet the factory will pay the farmer 12 cent per kilo less for it.<br/><br/>The 30-month restriction was introduced for good reason because of the BSE crisis 20 or 25 years ago.  At this stage, it is archaic and, especially with late-maturing breeds, it adds considerable extra cost for farmers and puts the factories in a position of dominance whereby they know the farmers will have to kill the cattle by a certain date and will adjust their price accordingly.<br/><br/>In the Estimate before us, it is proposed to spend an extra &euro;15 million on world aid.  I do not suggest that this money will not be well spent.  However, we have farmers who are going broke.  Certain farmers in areas of natural constraint, especially those who own land on which hen harriers roost, have had their land completely devalued by regulations issued from Brussels.  We did not put a scheme in place to restore the value of that land for them.  A scheme was put in place, but that land which was worth &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 per acre for forestry cannot now be sold.  The capital value of that land has been completely decimated.  Until we put a scheme back in place to restore the capital value of that land, we are not being fair to those people.  The owners of that hen harrier land are being extremely quiet.  With a stroke of a pen the entire capital value of their land was eroded.<br/><br/>Our beef industry is in crisis.  The kill is at record levels.  Our targets for 2020 and for Food Wise 2025 are all lovely, but the primary producer of the cattle is getting decimated and they will leave in droves.  They cannot keep taking the losses being incurred.  This winter feed costs will be significantly higher.  A number of people will say they are not feeding cattle anymore.  This summer many of the traditional beef men put aside their land and sold fodder down to the south rather than buying cattle.<br/><br/>The beef industry is in crisis.  We can talk about various markets.  Representatives from Bord Bia appeared before the committee two weeks ago.  I do not ridicule Bord Bia's work; it is an extremely efficient organisation and works very hard.  We always said that we could efficiently kill and sell 30,000 cattle.  It might have been possible to get to 32,000 or 33,000.  However, there is no way that we have markets for the current kill level.  Turkey has disappeared as an outlet.  Reality must come into it.  Men just cannot continue with the returns they are currently getting from the beef industry.<br/><br/>The word I would use to describe the mood among beef farmers is &quot;despondent&quot;.  Men are making career changes and have said enough is enough and they cannot take anymore.  I will not be unfair on the Minister.  I will not claim he can dictate the price factories are paying for cattle.  However, there must be a realisation that what is happening is not sustainable.  We can talk about targets and everything else, but unless there is an economic return for rearing and finishing cattle, men will not stay there.  At present, that economic return is not there.<br/><br/>In the early part of the year, the Chairman took us to an <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>lunch.  At the table, I was ridiculed when talking about Friesian cattle and the returns from finishing feeding cattle.  The men who were ridiculing me should see if the cap fits.  There are farmers in my area who traditionally finished cattle; it will not happen anymore.  They will not do it and it is over as far as they are concerned.  They have been walked on too often and the price being paid at the back end is the straw that has broken the camel's back.  Men just cannot keep going back to it.<br/><br/>I presume the decision has been made in respect of this &euro;15 million, but there are definitely farmers on hen harrier land who need support.  People would like to see this spent on trying to secure live export markets.  If live exports are to have a significant effect, cattle would have to move in significant numbers.  A couple of hundred per week will not make any difference.  We need a significant number of live cattle moving from the country if we are put any competition into the trade because it is just not there.<br/><br/>I know a man who had a lot of cows to kill last week.  He asked the factory when it would take the cull cow.  The cull cow is now in extremely good condition, extremely well fed.  He was told the factory could not take them until the third or fourth week of January because its stores were full of beef.  We just cannot viably sell the cattle we are killing at the moment.  Men have just had enough.</p></speech>

Deputy Cahill made reference to 30-month BSE restrictions.  We have to export and find a home for nine out of every ten cattle that we produce and we try to negotiate the best possible deal that we can.  It involves constant engagement with veterinary authorities in other states.  We have, most recently, improved the veterinary certification requirement with Libya and that will enable us to export cattle in greater numbers there.  Some of this is part of the legacy of BSE.  Some of it, in terms of our retail partners, is a consumer preference issue.  We are constantly trying, and work with the sector, to get the best possible market access terms but we must work with the other member states.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also made reference to a period of 30 months in the context of late-maturing breeds.  In a way, if one takes 30 months to finish a beef animal, one is losing money anyway, with the exception of cow beef, as 30-month beef production is not efficient.  We need to drive efficiency in the sector and part of that pertains to the &euro;250 million we are providing under the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, for example, as well as the additional &euro;20 million that is forthcoming for the weanling scheme.  We are doing a lot in the area.  It is not an easy space.  I accept it is a challenge in terms of the returns but I tend to be somebody who operates on the basis of the glass half-full rather than the glass half-empty.  In respect of the issues that confront us, I have worked on how we can target resources to those who are most in need.  As for credentials, to have put &euro;8 million into areas of natural constraints, to have introduced a new scheme on beef and to have introduced the hen harrier scheme within two years is not bad.</p></speech>

The Minister stated it is because there has not been an uptake in grant schemes.  If, for example, there is an increased uptake and there is a shortage of funding, will they be able to fund that anyway?  It seems to be the only grant-aiding scheme for producers that has been targeted for a cut through the Department's cuts to make up this extra &euro;15 million the Minister talks about.  The Minister stated in his explanation that it was because they have not been getting ready for Brexit but it is not clear to fishermen what the impact of Brexit will be and how they will be to deal with it.  It is different than a supplier.  They are looking at catching fish.  I was wondering, if they step up to the mark or if there is an increased demand, whether funding will be an issue at the end of the year.</p> <p>  In the EU receipts for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, there is a reduction of &euro;8.7 million for next year.  There is also a reduction of &euro;0.5 million in the European Fisheries Fund, EFF.  I wonder what these are for.</p></speech>

We had this out previously and I missed that meeting.  I have had representations since, particularly in regard to finfish licences for the aquaculture sector where there is serious pressure.  Some of them have been waiting between eight and ten years.  Whatever additional requirements are needed in the Department to get that moving need to be put in there as quickly as possible because it is a serious problem.  All of them have been in the other shellfish sector and none of them have been done for the finfish sector.  Some grip needs to be got on it.  If additional resources need to be put in there, they must be put in there quickly.</p></speech>

We have made substantial progress on clearing the backlog on the shellfish licences.  We are initiating communication on the finfish applications.  Only last week, I attended a BIM event for seafood awards and met a number of the beneficiaries of the accelerated licence approval process who were quite thankful for the endeavours of the Department and the officials in that section.  The finfish will be more difficult but we are beginning the process, and we have allocated additional staff for that purpose.</p> <p>  On Deputy Pringle's question on the underspend in BIM, these are substantially demand-led grant schemes.  The schemes will continue.  It is a provision that we made in 2019 that has not been drawn down.  The grant schemes are funded substantially under the European Maritime Fisheries Fund, which is &euro;239 million, of which &euro;93 million is Exchequer funding and the balance is EU funding.  Those schemes will continue to be available in 2019.</p></speech>

Ultimately, the same level of funding will be approved.  It is a bit like the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, grant scheme.  The scheme is still open.  It is available for applications.  There will be applications that probably have been approved but have not the paperwork in.  It is merely that the provision we had in 2018 is not drawn down.  It will move across into 2019.  All the funding will be available.  There will be no moving of funds from that grant scheme.</p></speech>

The Deputy will recall in my opening remarks I stated the Supplementary Estimate is a technical amendment, in fact, for an amount of &euro;1,000.  Although we are bringing forward a liability in 2019 of &euro;15 million for the World Food Programme and approval for &euro;23 million for the agri-environmental schemes and &euro;7 million on the fodder side, all of that is in a way dwarfed by what is coming in by appropriations from the EU, some of which is 2017 funding.  We do not control the dates on which this arrives.  Some of it was expected in late 2017 and it did not arrive in until January 2018.  I will get the Deputy the detail of the total of appropriations-in-aid.  These are the EU co-funding aspects of some of the schemes that we administer.  The EU funding arrives in at times that we do not control.  Some of it does not happen neatly in financial years.</p></speech>

The unions that comprise our energy and natural resources sector group represent tens of thousands of workers in the energy production and distribution sector, all of whom are directly affected by climate change.  I understand the committee has been tasked with considering the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on this issue and how we can make Ireland a leader in climate action.  The committee's deliberations also take place in the context of the development of the integrated energy and climate action plan for consideration by the European Commission, a process into which the committee's final report will feed.</p> <p>  Our delegation wishes to focus in particular on recommendation 7 of the Citizens' Assembly report, namely, that "the State should end all subsidies for peat extraction and instead spend that money on peat bog restoration and making proper provision for the protection of the rights of the workers impacted", with the majority of the members of the assembly, 61%, recommending that the State should end all subsidies on a phased basis over five years.  Clearly, workers in this sector and in other carbon heavy sectors will face significant challenges in the coming years.  Congress made a submission to the Citizens' Assembly which acknowledged this fact and also made the case for a just transition to a low-carbon economy.  Unions have been campaigning in this area for a number of years now under the campaign slogan of "There are no jobs on a dead planet".</p> <p>  The concept of a just transition originates in the international labour movement and, over time, has become the benchmark in terms of how we should respond globally and nationally to this challenge.  In essence, it means that workers and their communities must not shoulder the burden.  The International Labour Organization recommends that transition policies must therefore "pay special attention to the industries, regions, communities and workers whose livelihoods might experience the hardest impacts of the transition".  In practical terms, this requires governments to "formulate accompanying policies through social protection, including unemployment insurance and benefits, skills training and upgrading, workforce redeployment and other appropriate measures".  Critically, repeated studies of this process and examples of best practice from Spain, Germany and Australia demonstrate the necessity to ensure the process is based on social dialogue, with close co-ordination between the government, state agencies, employers and trade unions.  For example, Spanish unions only last month agreed an historic just transition deal with Government and employers in respect of the country's coal mining industry.  The deal will see &euro;250 million invested in the mining communities and supports for the affected workers.  It has been hailed by the European Trade Union Confederation as a model of just transition.  The ETUC noted: "We don&rsquo;t need to choose between a job and protecting the environment.  It is possible to have both."</p> <p>  In the Australian town of Port Augusta, unions worked with local businesses and citizens to develop their own just transition plan in advance of the 2016 closure of the town's coal-fired power station.  Their research found that a solar thermal plant was the best option to enable a smooth skills transfer and ensure a long-term clean energy solution.  The new solar plant will create 1,800 jobs and save 5 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.  It will also help the wider community reap the benefits of a zero-carbon future.  In addition, Australian unions, facing the closure of all coal-fired power stations in the near future, recently published a study that highlighted the example of the Ruhr in Germany, a region long synonymous with fossil-based enterprises and now home to new green industry.  The secret was planning, social dialogue and co-ordination with all those affected.  The study contrasted the success of the Ruhr with the disaster that has befallen the people and communities of Appalachia, where no just transition measures were put in place to deal with the closure of mines in the region.</p> <p>  The issue has been brought to the fore here with the recent announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na of a plan that will see the loss of 150 jobs before Easter 2019 and up to 850 redundancies in the peat harvesting business by 2025.  It is a devastating blow for the midlands and illustrates the immediacy of the challenges posed by climate change to the workers, their families and the wider communities.  Congress responded by calling for the establishment of a just transition forum and we have also initiated work with the Nevin Economic Research Institute and unions in the energy and natural resources sector to develop concrete propositions on how we might achieve a just transition for the region and to identify the supports that will be required to do so, along with the many opportunities that this will present.</p> <p>  As the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, notes: "Transitions to low-carbon, environmentally and socially sustainable economies can become a strong driver of job creation, job upgrading, social justice and poverty eradication."  This call was echoed by the former President, Mary Robinson, in a recent keynote address to a climate action conference here in Dublin where she stressed the importance of just transition and the need to ensure that the rights of communities in the midlands are protected in this process.  This is why congress has also recently written to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, seeking his support for the Silesia just transition declaration at the COP24 meeting in Poland this week and to return with a commitment to develop and implement such a transition here at home.  It is our hope that the integrated energy and climate action plan will include concrete proposals on establishing a just transition forum for the midlands and the wider economy.  There is no shortage of guidelines and examples of best practice in this area, including those cited here and those agreed by the world's governments, employers and unions at the ILO.  A just transition represents our best chance of tackling climate change in a manner that ensures nobody, including workers and communities in the midlands, is left behind.</p></speech>

Has it carried out a review of the skills base of the current workforce?  If so, has it looked at how many skilled workers have extensive knowledge of peatlands, for example, through rewetting bogs and maintaining wetlands or in tree planting or afforestation?  Looking to 2030, Accenture states that 85% of the types of jobs available in 2030 have not yet been invented or created.

We are trying to source resources for the training.  We hope to get that from the globalisation fund.  Also, we want Bord na M&oacute;na to get the stakeholder to ensure the resources are put in for the retraining commitment.  However, the current skill set for the people on the bogs will not be required into the future.  It is as simple as that.  Some portions of it may be required but the majority of the skill set will not be required into the future if they are not cutting peat.</p></speech>

It is welcome to see the trade unions involved because it is the workers we have to convince to make the change.  How difficult was it in the case of Bord na M&oacute;na, which has been an iconic part of our history for so long, to engage workers in terms of telling them that changes have to be made to make progress?  The witnesses might give a brief background on that and how they engaged workers to get to the table and make an agreement on shutting down the first of the plants.  What negotiations are ongoing in terms of retraining or whatever?</p> <p>  We talk about rust belts.  This is about the midlands and not bringing about desolation in towns and communities or for the families who live in them.  It is about not depleting them of that population when such a significant industry is on its way out and the idea of getting public support for what will take place instead of what is currently in place.</p> <p>  This sector is one of the sectors the witnesses represent.  How many men and women are in the sector?  I imagine there are more men working in it and therefore the package offered will be weighted towards the men in the company.  I refer to the socioeconomic effects of that, as well as the psychological effect, on the smaller communities around them.</p> <p>  In terms of an alternative use for the peatlands that will become free and reclaiming the wet agriculture for forestry, Russia has reclaimed extensive areas of peatland.  I accept it may not be a country to compare and contrast with Ireland but it has done that successfully.  I refer to common reed for construction material, paper, solid fuel, fish farming and water buffalo for cheese.  I cannot think we will have that here but Russia came up with imaginative uses for the reclaimed peatland and reinvestment in terms of some of the workers.  On the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na, what is the age profile of those who will be directly affected by this development?</p> <p>  In Russia, there have been health benefits from reclaiming the land in that the peat smog has disappeared.  Russia is a very large country but the 20 million people who live in proximity to those lands are no longer exposed to that smog and there has been a decrease in respiratory diseases such as asthma and so.  There has been an increase in respiratory diseases from air pollution exposure.  According to the World Health Organization, 7 million people die from respiratory disease per year as a result of air pollution exposure.  The reclaiming of the land has resulted in a significant health benefit for that area in Russia.  It impacts on cardiovascular problems also.</p> <p>  As for the reconfiguration, this is the first time Bord na M&oacute;na has afforded this country an opportunity to implement the just transition framework.  That could be the template for the thousands of workers who work in a carbon-heavy industry.  We need to get this as right as possible to bring in public opinion and support for a move to a more sustainable environment.</p> <p>  This affects everything else, and transport is a major aspect.  The number of people using transport to get to work has greatly increased and it is having a major impact.  We talk about electric cars but people still will be reliant on using their own transport to get to work.  Is there a way within the just transition framework to protect the environment and villages, small towns and even villages within cities, whereby we could have local hubs to which people can go to work?  More people will be working from home, which will decrease the level of carbon emissions.  Is that being taken into consideration or will all of us have to travel miles to get to work in the future?</p> <p>  What are the other carbon-heavy sectors that the witnesses believe will be impacted upon next?  The Bord na M&oacute;na workers will be affected in this case but what is the next industry that will be impacted?  The witnesses might outline, in chronological order, their size and impact in terms of emissions.  I would be grateful if the witnesses could answer those questions.</p></speech>

Mr. Healy might respond as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Noone" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120400002#C01400"><p>I will answer the ones that are specific to Bord na M&oacute;na.  On the workforce and how its members have taken to what is occurring, the reaction has been fairly pragmatic.  The people in Bord na M&oacute;na knew this was coming.  They knew there was a plan to get out of peat production in the next decade and they had resigned themselves to that fact.  The problem is that has now been fast-tracked.  People thought they would have another decade in peat production but it has been fast-tracked and that has put people under a great deal of pressure.</p> <p>  Regarding the age profile, the median age of the people on the bogs is 56, which is fairly high.  However, many jobs have been earmarked to be got rid of, for want of a better term, in Newbridge, and the majority of those are not bog-related.  Many women work in office jobs.  It has been lost on the public that many of the jobs due to end are not just those on the bogs.</p> <p>  On reclaiming the sites and using them for forestry, the problem is that trees do not grow on bogs.  Some trees do but the majority of those of any value do not.  That is a red herring.</p> <p>  With regard to the way the people in Bord na M&oacute;na have been treated, they have been treated abysmally, and people should know that.  Some politicians have come out in the media and announced they were doing a great service to the members in Bord na M&oacute;na by getting the stakeholder to provide a voluntary severance package.  What they did not say was that the voluntary severance package does not give many of these people one cent more than they would get if they were working in non-unionised employment.</p><p>People over 62 are only getting statutory redundancy.  There are people in Bord na M&oacute;na who, under this new voluntary severance package, will be told they are in a location with no job.  The package only offers such people half of what they would otherwise earn and there is no job for them.  They are not getting one extra red cent from this new redundancy package.  In fact they are worse off but the politicians who raced to the media did not tell them that.  This package denies these people their pension entitlements.  Their current pension states, quite clearly, that if they retire before 60 years of age, they can draw their pension if they go voluntarily but there will be an actuarial reduction.  That has been taken away.  I got confirmation from the company no more than an hour ago, before I came in here, that it will be worse than ever before.  That is scandalous.  It is scandalous of people from the Government parties to say they are doing a great service to these Bord na M&oacute;na people.  Deputies from the midlands have said this in their own constituency.  They have not said these employees are going to be worse off, however.  It is abysmal.</p><p> That said, jobs in the midlands will be very hard to get.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a landbank of big acreage but it will be confined in what it can do on that.  Trees do not grow on bogs.  There is a lot of opposition to wind farms and people have objected.  There is a lot of not in my backyard, NIMBYism, going on.  The company has come forward with some good ideas on alternative employment but many of those projects will take time to get up and running because they are startup businesses.  The age profile of current staff members at Bord na M&oacute;na means the vast majority of them will not be able to redeploy to new jobs.</p><p> We are anxious that whatever would come up for new employment ideas would specifically target the midlands.  It is the people in the towns and villages of the midlands who are going to suffer.  I am from the midlands myself so I know all about it.  They are really going to suffer because of this process.</p><p> The next industry to be affected is the ESB in respect of the coal being burned in ESB stations.  I am concerned about it because Mr. Jim Dullaghan and I both have members in the sector.  ESB is possibly next in line to be caught in this decarbonisation process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.207" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Healy" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120400002#D00200"><p>The pain involved in the just transition is clearly manifest in communities in the midlands that are affected by these job losses and it is a daunting prospect for people to face Christmas knowing there will be no job there towards the latter end of next year.  There are many thousands of jobs beyond that at risk, not just in the sectors we are specifically talking about this evening but also in other areas such as, for example, those connected to the agrifood sector which, as we know, is making a significant contribution to emissions.<br/><br/>There are two points here.  One is to deal with the crisis, and it is a jobs crisis and has an effect on the communities involved.  There must be a plan to deal with that crisis at a local level with innovative and imaginative alternatives in investment and employment and I can develop some of those points later if the committee wishes.  There is a long-term issue where we need to look at the bigger picture.  As a country, we have a very high rate of greenhouse gas emissions.  That is related to a number of things, one of which is the agriculture sector.  It is not just agriculture, <i>per se</i>, but the way we do agriculture.<br/><br/>The second important element to bear in mind is spatial planning and the way in which we do construction and planning in the cities, towns and countryside.  There is limited value in increasing the cost of diesel or home heating if, at the same time, we do not invest heavily in both retrofitting and an efficient public transport system.  It is not just about getting people in and out of Dublin from the midlands or elsewhere.  It is about connecting places like Mullingar, Athlone, Tullamore and Newbridge in order that people do not necessarily have to use cars to get to work or to get from one place to another.  That is a very important point on transport.  The national development plan is heavily reliant on motorway construction.  The underlying assumption is that private car ownership will continue to expand, albeit with a transition to electric vehicles.  That is not sustainable.  We need to think much more in terms of an efficient and green public transport system fit for the 21st century.<br/><br/>This is the bigger picture.  It is a difficult and painful transition.  When we use the term just transition, we also mean painful transition and it has distributional and regional implications where some regions are disproportionately affected in the short term.  This calls for very difficult decisions and choices and people need to be faced with the evidence and difficulties which will inevitably arise as we need to change our consumption behaviour and patterns of production.  Ireland will not solve the global climate crisis but it does need to show moral leadership.  What we are discussing here this evening is an example that we are going to see repeated again and again when jobs are lost and communities are impacted.  </p></speech>

Does the Irish Congress of Trade Unions see its role as an influencer, given that it represents up to 800,000 workers?  Does it see itself as an influencer in getting the message of climate action out, as well as dealing with the more practical aspects of the transition in terms of job losses and job creation and all of that?  The nub of it is whether ICTU has accepted that the climate is changing.  Has it accepted the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report?</p> <p>  I am from the midlands and I reject Senator Devine dubbing the area as a rust belt.  It is disgraceful and inappropriate to use that kind of language.  The entrepreneurs and the hard-working people who live in the midlands deserve better than that kind of language.  </p> <p>  The midlands action plan for jobs had a target of 14,000 to be created up until the end of this year and more than 15,500 have been created thus far.  I do not think we need be concerned about it.  There are, in fact, jobs being created.  The key, of course, is to make sure that people are upskilled.  While I appreciate there are people who are in their 50s who may have spent a lifetime doing a particular job, they still are well capable of being upskilled and they deserve that opportunity.  What do the witnesses see as being a role for the just transition forum?  It seems they are saying that it is just on a regional basis.  Have the witnesses examined whether that is sufficient, considering we are a small island?  I noticed that, in Australia, the example was of a town that put this plan in place in advance of the closure of the power station there.  As it is a continent, one would accept they would be obliged to have regional fora there.  As we are a small country, should we have a national transition forum?  Have the witnesses examined whether the national dialogue on climate action would fulfil that role or whether the regional action plan for jobs implementation committees would fulfil that role?  Is there a role for them?</p> <p>  Who would lead the proposed just transition forum?  Would it be the unions?  I know in other countries, the unions take the lead.</p><p>There is a great opportunity for new work with the retrofitting that we know is required, particularly on public buildings, local authority houses and so on.  There are skills shortages in that field - the Construction Federation of Ireland says it is bringing in workers from abroad - but surely there are highly-skilled people who could be further upskilled who could be part of that and it might be a great opportunity for them.</p><p> Have the unions had any further thoughts on the brown to green policy to replace peat with biomass energy?  Are there other opportunities for workers in this regard?  </p><p> Did the unions engage in the public consultation on the national mitigation plan produced last year?  It will clearly have a great impact on people across other sectors as well as energy generation and production, with the decarbonisation of everything in addition to electricity, such as the built environment and so on.  The unions represent a large number of workers and are a key influencer on this area.</p></speech>

I might take the easier ones first.  On whether we have accepted the science, we did not put the science in our opening statement because we are gone beyond a discussion on whether or not this is happening, so I will not spend any more time on that.</p> <p>  On the matter of what kind of structure would be used, we have used the word "forum", but I have seen transition commission and other descriptions.  The Deputy is correct.  The light is currently shining in the midlands but it is clearly a national question.  We have no objection to a national just transition commission.  It would not be led by us but we would participate in it.  A key point in our opening statement is that this is about involving the relevant stakeholders in a commission which, frankly, should be led by Government which is responsible.</p></speech>

It is not a forum for negotiating a way forward.  While it has its merits and we have no difficulty with it, it is not the type of social dialogue that we are discussing in this particular instance.</p></speech>

We have two specific projects at the moment, one a shorter interim report relating to the situation in Bord na M&oacute;na and how we might achieve a just transition there, and what measures are required.  We expect to publish that soon.  There is also a longer term project that looks at the just transition on a national basis, which we hope to complete in the new year.  It involves learning from the example of Australia and, more recently Spain, where they achieved a just transition after four or five years of disputes, arguments and rows.  The deal on its coal mining sector was only announced in October.  The examples are there and there is plenty to learn from, so we do not have to reinvent the wheel.</p></speech>

Both ICTU and SIPTU wholeheartedly engaged in that process and our submissions can be found on its website.  On the national dialogue on climate action and regional meetings, our local shop stewards and workers from these industries and others, because we should be clear that climate action is an issue for all workers, are engaging in that process.  SIPTU submitted a document of almost 15 pages to the Citizens' Assembly and was shortlisted for discussion by assembly members.</p> <p>  It was the union movement at international level that put the just transition into the Paris Agreement.  The unions pushed hard at the United Nations climate change conference, COP24, this week, and prior to that, to have a just transition statement.  What this week's declaration means for workers is that they have a seat at the negotiation table, which is crucial.  What we do not have now is social dialogue around these issues.  Senator Devine asked about this in regard to the midlands.  For the past two years, we asked for the Department, under the Ministers, Deputies Naughten and subsequently Bruton, to undertake research on the impact on the midlands but this has not happened.  When the Department was before the committee six weeks ago, officials stated clearly that that research would be ready in January but, in response to parliamentary questions in recent months, they answered that terms of reference for that project were yet to be agreed.  While we have campaigned for two years for the research, the Department has not been forthcoming in undertaking it.  That research would have been very important for people in the midlands, whether they work in Bord na M&oacute;na, ESB or otherwise.</p> <p>  We alluded to a few examples regarding the just transition.  An example of somewhere as small as ourselves and also an island is New Zealand, where the government has developed a just transition and economic diversification plan based on social dialogue with the unions and broad stakeholder consultation.  In September, the government in Scotland established a national just transition commission with unions and stakeholders.  It is important that the declaration which came out of the Poland conference this week bases the just transition on social dialogue.  That is what is needed from Government.</p></speech>

While I am new in the energy sector, from my short time working in it, I understand that they would burn half of Sweden to try to keep the power stations going if they were running them on biomass.  It is a red herring because they cannot get enough ships to get the timber in sufficiently quickly to get them in the power station.  There is a lot of information coming out about biomass but it is something that people need to read up on and educate themselves about what is involved.</p></speech>

It is a complete red herring to put out that biomass will replace peat; it is as simple as that.  There are also anomalies here relating to biomass.  I have highlighted at several forums how waste product is going into plants in the Republic, which is being transformed into wood chip and dispatched in lorries, which are burning significant volumes of diesel, to power stations in Derry, for example, yet that same product cannot be brought to Edenderry to be burned because the EPA will object that it is a waste product.</p></speech>

There are currently anomalies in the legislation which do not make sense.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the matter of a just transition.</p><p>A just transition in all those formats suggests it should be just and fair.  At the moment the shareholder has put out a redundancy package, and I believe the Deputy was on the media stating it was great to get this package out there.  What it means in reality is that people in middle management and supervisory staff on a salary of approximately &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000 are able to get up to two years salary plus statutory payments in a redundancy package, whereas the people on the ground, who are on basic pay of &euro;350 to &euro;450 a week, cannot do so.  That is not fair or just.</p><p> That is the reality.  It is grand talking about a pan-national just transition, and the Deputy raised the question of whether it should be done on a national or a regional basis.  I am a Roscommon man.  There are people in my area who have worked at Mount Dillon over generations.  However, it does not come under the midlands because Roscommon is not in the midlands, and to have this done on a regional basis and thereby exclude them is not a just transition.  They are people working in these jobs for generations.  Somebody has to look at this and decide what is fair to the people in the midlands.  Is it fair to come up with a plan that will help people in Donegal or Tralee who are not affected by Bord na Mona closing?  There are people losing jobs at this time.  Can we come up with something specifically tailored for the midlands that will come into effect in the next three or four years?  If not, there is no point trying to cod the people in the midlands by saying we are going to do something for the people in Bord na Mona because, in reality, we are not, and we are just having a talking shop about it.</p><p> I face hundreds of workers daily who are asking, "What is it going to mean for me in three to four years?"  I do not have the answers.  I am looking for people in those constituencies, like the Deputy, to get down and meet those workers, to come up with real plans.  I want them to tell these people, who may be 61 or 62 years of age, that they are going to get the very same as if they were working in a corner shop down the road, and that they are not going to get one cent extra in their redundancy package.  There is nothing specific for this area.  That is not a just transition.  What we are looking for is something that can be tailored and that can be done.</p><p> Who will lead it?  From an ICTU perspective, we are not hung up on who leads it as long as it is done.  We do not care what political party badge anyone wears.  Those workers do not care who delivers as long as it is done.</p></speech>

I think we should increase carbon taxes but we should do that in a very careful way that does not damage low income households and that takes cognisance of the fact that, in many cases, such as in rural communities, it is not an option to switch to alternatives to diesel or solid fuel heating, for example.  It is something that needs to seen as part of a strategic investment plan.</p> <p>  The role of carbon taxes is twofold.  One is to raise money for investment in renewables and in green energy, and the other is to help people to change their behaviour.  However, one cannot help people to change their behaviour if there are not other options in terms of, for example, heating or transport.  It needs to be a joined-up effort.  To that extent, there are good examples in other countries of where carbon taxes can be ring-fenced and part of the benefits of a fund can be paid back to households by way of a dividend, which could be used for better insulation and retrofitting.  There is a connection to what we were just talking about in regard to the midlands because a high proportion of the housing stock, particularly in the midlands, is of a low insulation standard.  There is a challenge to bring a significant proportion of the housing stock up to A or B building energy rating, and that requires a certain mix of skills and it probably involves a new range of enterprise activity.  It also means that households could benefit through a system of dividends paid back from a transition fund which is partly funded from carbon taxes.  However, I emphasise the lessons from other countries, for example, France, of how not to do this and of how to create a strong public reaction that sees this as an attack on people's living standards, with regional implications.  It is important to get that balance right.</p> <p>  The key point alongside carbon taxes, and even more important than them, is that the State should lead investment through an entrepreneurial effort.  ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, in particular, have the opportunity to launch new activities through the development of, for example, solar and wind power.  We do not realise how much access we have to solar power in this country, although this might seem surprising, but the east and south east, in particular, have the possibility of developing new energies.  This can be done across the bogs by installing giant solar panels.  There are also examples in the area of wind power from Denmark, where community co-operatives are linked into the electricity grid.  They have made a transition over three decades and, through wind power, have weaned themselves off much of their dependence on fossil fuels and imported energy.  The key issue in Denmark, I understand, is that communities were given a stake in these community co-operatives.  This is a crucial point.  In places like Offaly, Roscommon and Longford, for example, understandably in come cases, there is a strong reaction against some new forms of activity, including wind turbines.  One way to get people into owning the problem is to give them an ownership stake.  That may also be a possibility for workers who are made redundant.  Perhaps there are possibilities of worker co-operatives developing new services and activities.</p></speech>

I reassure him that I am very much engaged with the workers on the ground.  It is as a result of the workers contacting me directly and asking me for this information that I sought it and received it.  That was the only reason I had it.  I want to clarify that.  I would be happy to meet Mr. Noone at any time.  I have not heard from him in a long time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120400002#F00700"><p>I thank ICTU for the presentation.  What was always going to be one of weaknesses of the Citizens' Assembly is dealing with the politics of climate change.  It very clearly stated what it stated, and it is up to this committee to deal with the reality on the ground.  The ICTU witnesses are the first witnesses to have come before the committee to outline exactly what that involves and I thank Mr. Noone, in particular, for outlining what the reality is for people, many of whom may have spent a lifetime working for a company with a particular skillset.  Because of the age cohort of some of them, they simply will not work again after this.  As he said, the mean age is 56, so the average remaining working life for that group in the company is 12 years.  I am 54 and I hope the next 12 years are among the most productive in my life.</p> <p>  I want to focus on one word in the opening statement - "impact".  It is a small word and easy to overlook.</p><p>I do not like the approach which states that people can upskill or train.  It is not as easy as that.  The word &quot;impact&quot; captures the necessity of that.  Someone could have been working for a company for 30 years and it is all he or she knows, which is what Senator Devine was talking about.  In the United States, people relied utterly on specific industries and, almost overnight, they disappeared, hence the name &quot;rust belt&quot;.  It is not a criticism and it does not assign a label to a particular part of this country.  It borrows from the experiences of another country where communities were left devastated.  That point has to be made.  It is too easy for us to say that people can upskill and do this or that.  I am focusing on the word &quot;impact&quot; and on the human element of what people are facing .  That involves a range of things.  While it can be a significant opportunity for some, it can be frightening for others.  That is why I welcome our guests' contributions.  The idea that they could easily transition to other jobs gives rise to fear and is intimidating for people.  This was my introduction to this transition forum idea and I thank the witnesses for bringing it to us.  Preparation has to be done.  People have multiple needs aside from income and work.  There is an issue with confidence.  Some people do not have the confidence and have to be mentored to move from a phase of employment life into another, which is especially challenging.  That is not lost on me but I do not want to labour the point.<br/><br/>Mr. Healy's contribution was particularly thought-provoking in the context of the opportunities that may lie ahead.  ICTU has to persuade people.  Some members of the committee visited Tipperary last week.  As the clerk to the committee stated , we saw many of the things we had been talking about here in theory.  We were grounded by a number of the things we saw happening with the Tipperary Energy Agency.  We also heard about communities.  What Mr. Noone said about wind energy is interesting, namely, that there has been a loss of appetite for it and that it is controversial.  One group we met indicated that a contributory reason for this is that communities were promised a direct benefit from wind energy.  They were promised there would be local community fora and buy-in, and that there would be a community dividend when wind energy came to their town.  That has not transpired.  Corporate bodies have received the dividends.  We need to go back and look at wind energy.  If it is true that solar panels could be laid across the bog, with all the economic and employment benefits that would derive from doing so, that simply cannot happen without the community having ownership of it.  The latter could be ownership in having some energy dividend personally or being involved in the construction.  That involves training, etc.  We cannot have a situation where a multinational or big corporate company comes in, takes ownership of the bog and does what it wants.  Solar or other energy alternatives must come from the community.  If there is one lesson we learned from last week, it is that communities lost interest in wind energy because promises about things from which they would have benefited directly were never followed through on.  I ask our guests to provide feedback on that.<br/><br/>Reference was made to the ESB and coal.  Last week, someone mentioned the book <i>Who Moved My Cheese?</i>during our visit to Tipperary.  The only criticism I have of Mr. Noone is that the timeline has been brought from 2030 to 2025.  I am not a Minister.  I am talking as a layman and citizen.  That could be brought back to 2020.  Mr. Noone must have seen this coming.  Other industries must have seen it coming.  They must act as persuaders and informers, even sitting down with companies and saying it is coming even if companies say it is not, and not to be surprised when it happens.  One can see from David Attenborough's contribution in Poland during the week that it is becoming more urgent.  We have been appallingly poor at addressing this climate change and timelines will probably have to be pulled back in.</p></speech>

We were not surprised.  The workers at Bord na M&oacute;na were not surprised that they were going to stop working with peat or that the timeframe for this was brought forward.  They could feel what was happening in the recent years on the wind.  They are surprised that there has been a lot of talk by politicians and the trade unions, and by all commentators, whether ex-Presidents or the Citizens' Assembly, that the people involved should be treated fairly.  This is the third time I will say this: it has surprised them that people are now being told that their jobs are gone and they are not getting one red cent extra.  There are people in their 60s who have been told that their jobs are gone and that the package that has been offered to them is inferior to what has been offered to other semi-State workers in the recent past who are not going through a decarbonisation policy.  They feel they should come under the umbrella of a just transition.  They are surprised that there are people who should be putting their shoulder to the wheel to ensure they are treated fairly who are not doing so.  They are not looking for anything beyond what they think their entitlements are.  It is very unfair that there are people who are very capable of getting jobs and who have good skill sets, specifically in senior and middle management, who will get a golden handshake and probably walk into jobs fairly shortly afterwards.  As the Deputy stated, there are people in the age group who cannot do that and they are being treated unfairly.</p> <p>  Deputy Lahart mentioned a dividend for the wind farms.  I agree that if wind farms are coming in, there has to be a direct connection to the community so they can get a dividend from that.  The Deputy mentioned solar panels.  I do not know if a suggestion of mine will get traction.  It is currently Government policy to give a 40% grant for people who put solar panels on their houses.  I suggest that the grant be increased and targeted at the midlands.  They can be put on local authority houses, including in such places as Banagher, Birr, Tullamore and Mullingar.  That will attract work to the midlands and benefit the people in the midlands.  It should be easily possible if the political will is present.  There is a mountain of ideas if one talks to people in the midlands about what could come about.  It is all energy-related and targeted directly at the midlands.  The Deputy mentioned solar panels.  I think they are the answer on Government buildings and on private houses.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work they have been doing.  It is important to take stock of the measures they have already taken.  SIPTU has prepared a research booklet for members and commissioned Mary Robinson to write an article for <i>Liberty</i>in order to educate its members on actions they can take.  I know Ms Yvonne O'Callaghan and Mr. Adrian Kane are involved in this work on climate change dialogue.  I acknowledge that and the work of IMPACT under the leadership of Joe O'Connor and Kevin Callinan.</p><p>I acknowledge that and the work of IMPACT.  Under the leadership of Joe O'Connor and Kevin Callinan, it commissioned an Institute for International and European Affairs, IIEA, just transition report on the implications of climate for the workforce.  It is not that ICTU is not doing anything, and that is important.  ICTU has set up an energy and natural resources committee and it held a conference on this issue.  Does ICTU feel supported by the Government with regard to just transition?  Do its members feel supported?  It is not as if climate change has come about in the last few days or weeks.  We have been talking about it for nearly 30 years, since we started to acknowledge it.  David Attenborough stated yesterday that the threat facing humanity and all species is looming.  He said it is on the horizon.  Does ICTU feel its workers and communities feel supported by the Government at this time?</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for her acknowledgement of some of the work.  We have been beavering away to try to promote the concept of a just transition, with limited success.  There are references to just transition in the national mitigation plan and so forth and it is in the common parlance when discussing climate change but, as Mr. Noone outlined, very little has happened on it.  We have all acknowledged that change has been coming for some time and it is becoming increasingly urgent.  The science keeps getting worse in terms of what we need to do.  No, we do not feel particularly supported.  We hope that as a result of our work and our discussions with the committee this evening, and we appreciate the opportunity to come here to talk and the level of engagement we are experiencing, that in the recommendations emerging from this committee we can finally start to put some meat on the bones of what a just transition would look like in Ireland.</p></speech>

The Irish Government is a member of the governing body of the ILO at present and the ILO has a very strong position on the just transition.  It has issued through the workers' group within the ILO very strong guidance on what the just transition looks like in a practical sense.  In the work we have been doing over the last number of years we have been trying to get our members to understand the concept of climate change, what is happening and how they fit into that, in terms of not being afraid of it.  A just transition is the answer to moving all of our workers, be they in the private or public sector - and not just those in the peat industry or transport sector, which are the immediate ones - into that low-carbon economy.</p> <p>  In fact, at international level trade unions have set up a just transition centre which is looking at best practice in how we engage with workers and also at how governments are putting forward such things as just transition forums across different countries to deal with these issues.  I alluded to some examples earlier because those examples are not specific to an industry.  They look at how we move our entire country and all our workers into a low carbon economy, starting with the workers in the high-carbon industries and moving onwards.  For example, some forums are examining how we counterbalance this by investing in low carbon industries such as care work, where many women are working, the arts or education and how we invest our money there.  Those sectors are growing, which is important as well.  It is an all-encompassing approach.</p> <p>  Our energy sector committees and other committees deal with the workers who will be impacted upon first.  In any union there are shop stewards and committees and we are engaging with them constantly, but what is missing is that social dialogue decision making forum in which we move from the concept and having the just transition on paper to the practicalities of how we do that, discuss it around the table and make a decision on how we move forward.  At present, we do not have that.  There has to be some leadership from the Government in that regard.</p></speech>

David Joyce alluded to what happened in Australia and Spain and all of those are filtered through there so we all know what is going on through the centre.  It was newly established in recent years and it is important.</p></speech>

Given the scale of the climate crisis, one issue the committee has discussed at length is the importance of everyone being engaged, that is, all Departments, sectors, unions and so forth.  Is ICTU collaborating or discussing with Departments to ensure we are all moving together on this?  Again, that relates to whether the Government is supporting ICTU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Dullaghan" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120400002#H01000"><p>The Senator referred to the conference that was held in May 2017.  There were some specific proposals in that conference which go some way towards addressing some of her questions.  One was the establishment of a tri-party body comprising the trade unions, employers and the Government to ensure the transition.  That was one type of body for action at central level.  There was also the question of establishing the just transition fund, which is happening at European level as well, and what that means at national level.  Importantly, there is the study of the impact that meeting our goals in the Paris Agreement will have on communities and industry, and legislation backing that up in terms of the principles of the just transition.  The committee has been liaising with the Department in terms of research and trying to do research studies but it has not advanced.  That is part of the problem.  We all recognise that it is a big problem and it has a huge impact.  The things we will have to roll out are not going to happen in a piecemeal way.  A programmed approach is required for this.  This is similar to rural electrification in the past.  It must be led by the State and its agencies.  That is the point.</p></speech>

When we get to four minutes I will intervene to be fair to the speakers and the people replying.  Deputy Munster is not present.</p><p>I will take that slot.  I thank the trade union delegation for coming in.   As a former employee of Bord na M&oacute;na and from a constituency point of view, I have a particular interest in what happens.  We have been highlighting the transition.  There is an opportunity in changing from what could be termed the brown revolution to a sustainable revolution and in terms of new industries.  Many of the workers are concerned that there will not be the same number of jobs.  Mr. Noone is best placed to give a view on this as he is on the ground.  What is the best way to find an alternative that can provide substantial employment?  The board is looking at a number of options around energy, horticulture and aquaculture.  All of us who have been Bord na M&oacute;na employees know that neither horticulture nor fuel will create the same level of work as there was in peat extraction.  That is a great concern.  Has the ICTU looked at other industries?  The board has outlined its big three areas.  All of us desperately want to see employment.  It is very important that it is maintained.  We are talking about communities where there was very little until the 1950s.  Older people who remember how it was before then will tell us how difficult it was in those areas.  We need to ensure that we do not go back to that post peat extraction. </p><p> On the climate action fund, there was &euro;77 million announced the other day, all for very good projects, which is welcome.  However, the midlands and Bord na M&oacute;na did not figure.  Do the witnesses feel that some of this money should have gone towards recalibrating Bord na M&oacute;na and getting it into a different space in terms of moving along with new industries?</p></speech>

We hope to have specific proposals around that in the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Noone" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120400002#J00300"><p>The Acting Chairman asked about retaining the same number of jobs.  Bord na M&oacute;na has come forward with plans.  Our view is that it has made some bad decisions in the recent past.  However, we have been told that it has had these plans robustly audited and checked for risk regarding the industries it has proposed.  We can only accept its bona fides.  Bord na M&oacute;na believes the quantum of jobs will be equal to the number of jobs that are being lost.  The problem we have is with the age profile in the company.  These jobs may not come on-stream quick enough to aid the people who are currently losing their jobs.  That is also tied in with the redundancy package, which I keep bringing up.  The quantum of the redundancy package is not the issue, in case anyone might think it is.  The issue is the fairness of how it is being distributed.  The company is telling us it will select people for redundancy on financial criteria.  That means it will make whatever selection is most financially advantageous to the company.  It will intend to let people with 25 years' service go and keep people who may be in their 60s.  As far the company is concerned, it is more financially advantageous to get rid of those who may be in their 30s or 40s.  Our view is that it should exit those who are in their 60s and who at this stage are not going to be re-employed in a job that may come on-stream in five or six years because they will be too old.  The company needs to let those older people out and re-skill and retrain those who are in their 30s and 40s and who will be able to benefit.  That is the issue.</p></speech>

Perhaps someone from the Nevin Institute or the ICTU could answer that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Healy" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120400002#J00500"><p>Yes, I think there is an opportunity to bring together expertise and funds to co-ordinate and lead.  The challenge is that the State needs to step up to play a role of co-ordination and leadership even though many other actors are involved.  We need to realise as well that a blueprint is not possible but a broad plan is.  We do not know what way technology is going to evolve.  Even in the past five years, the technology for solar power has been transformed.  The costs have come down.  It is a different situation now from when we went into recession.  This is where we need imaginative and creative thinking.  It could come, perhaps, from some of those workers in Newbridge who are in an administrative or support role.  I do not know the details; Mr. Noone may know more.  Why are we laying off workers?  Why are we not considering creating new lines of activity and new possibilities?  In the main, new enterprises, particularly in the midlands, will probably come from new areas, some of which we are not even thinking about.  We need to be ahead of the curve.  We have a lot to learn from Denmark about how it made that transition I mentioned earlier in respect of wind generation.</p> <p>  In the 1940s we had a national emergency.  Fuel was running out.  Imports of coal and oil were very low and people were put to shovel-ready work.  That was the spirit behind Bord na M&oacute;na.  Subsequently, the flourishing of many semi-State enterprises really filled a gap.  That is what we need to think about again.  It is a different context but the challenge is still there.  Just waiting for other people to do it for us, whether they are multinationals or science experts, is not enough.  There is a need now to develop some of these new lines of activity.  I strongly suspect the urgency is not there is public policy.  This is a real crisis internationally as well as nationally.  We need to redouble efforts and investment.  That needs to be appreciated.</p></speech>

One of the presentations referred to the deal struck by Spanish unions in October 2018 as being a just transition deal with the Government in respect of the coal miners, and that there would be a fund of &euro;250 million invested in those communities.  Perhaps we could hear where that money has come from and what the process was for getting there.</p> <p>  We had Bord na M&oacute;na here a few weeks ago making a presentation.  I am a bit confused listening to Mr. Noone because Bord na M&oacute;na indicated to us that the redundancies were being made on a voluntary basis and therefore it was for workers who wished to seek to be made redundant, at least at this juncture.  Will Mr. Noone clarify whether that is the case?  I would agree with Mr. Healy, as would everybody, I suppose.  We have to be innovative in respect of new jobs.  When Bord na M&oacute;na was here, it cited, for example, a tyre recycling plant that was being established with 50 new jobs in the area.  This was an example of the sustainable type of industry that is required.</p><p>I wonder whether an application has been sought.  Has Bord na M&oacute;na made an application under the climate action fund?  Has it been suggested to it that it should do so?  Are ideas forthcoming in relation to what alternatives there might be?  We constantly hear that we are not hitting targets and that we are behind.  In my view, we are often short on detail on what the alternatives might be.  We have all established that there is a problem here that needs to be addressed.  We need lots of ideas now, especially because we are drawing up a report.  Solar farms and wind farms on bogs have been mentioned as alternatives.  I assume that when those farms are operational, there will be an operational fund that will be paid for community benefit or gain.  Is that what is envisaged when such alternatives are mentioned?  Would the funding pool be used for entrepreneurship and for the development of alternative sustainable energies in this area?</p><p> I would like to make a point on a more macro level.  The workers we are talking about are those in the energy and natural resources sector.  When we talk about transition, we must focus on the people who have the most potential.  I know the main focus has been on Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  We do not need a crystal ball as we try to look at how this will affect them.  The closure of Bellacorick power station in my home county of Mayo caused devastation from which the community is still recovering.  The tower came down in 2010.  The jobs were lost before that.  We already have evidence of what happens in rural communities.  I am just getting to my point.  It seems possible that the just transition will hit people in rural areas hardest.  The national organisations represent workers right across the board.  I imagine that those who will have the fewest options are people in rural areas.  We are feeding into policies like Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan.  We will have regional plans to implement those policies.  To what extent is worker migration being considered?  We are all about sustainability.  The ideal is that we take workers, the imbalance is addressed and we see more sustainable growth in these rural areas.  Do the witnesses feed into national policy in this area?  Do they have their own policies on it?  Would they agree with my assertion that workers in rural Ireland are going to fare worse than their counterparts who are represented by the unions that are here today?  A worker in the fossil fuel industry in Dublin will have way more options.</p></speech>

The Senator is right when she says that representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na were before this committee not so long ago.  I am sure they forgot to tell the committee that when they went off to the stakeholder to get a redundancy package, they did not consult the trade unions.  We do not know what they actually looked for.  When the Government gave them approval for their package, we do not know for what the Government gave them approval.  We are only taking their word for it that-----</p></speech>

However, if she says that it was voluntary to the workers who were let go when the briquette factory in Littleton closed and there were no jobs within a 50-mile radius, to the people in the coal depots who are losing their jobs as we speak and there are no jobs in their vicinity, or to a 62 year old worker whose bog is closing down and the nearest job is 30 miles away, they will give her an answer.  She is right when she says that people in rural areas, like the area I come from, are suffering.

The electricity sector has been in transition for a long time, with renewables coming in and displacing fossil fuel plants.  That has been going on for quite a long time.  Obviously, it is accelerating more and more.  The big obvious plant is Moneypoint, which is a coal plant.  What is the economic input of Moneypoint to the local community, for example in terms of county council rates?  How will that be dealt with?  There is a timeline for that.  It has been well flagged.  Again, what is the plan?</p></speech>

It is an important point for us to examine.  The just transition works in a good few areas because it keeps people in existing jobs, or reskills and retrains them, and because it looks at how to reinvest in those areas to plan jobs for future workers.  This is about making sure there are jobs for future workers and future generations.  It is clear from some of the migration figures - I do not have them in front of me - that many young people are leaving these areas because they need to go elsewhere for work.  I know that reinvestment is happening in those regions now.  As Mr. Noone and others have pointed out, these industries have generations of workers.  We want to make sure new generations of workers with new skills for new types of clean energy are coming into these industries.  It is important to emphasise that the just transition involves keeping everybody in those areas.  It is important for us to keep the worker migration point in mind.</p></speech>

I have two questions, the first of which is for ICTU.  I thank Mr. Joyce for the interesting presentation.  I want to tease out some of the detail of what he has said about the just transition in so far as it relates to the Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  Three examples of countries where transition deals for workers were done - Australia, Spain and Germany - have been cited as a kind of template, but no detail has been given.  Does Mr. Joyce have detail of the deal?  He gave a small bit of detail of the &euro;250 million deal that has been agreed by Government employers in respect of the coal-mining industry in Spain.  Given that the Spanish coal-mining industry is massive, &euro;250 million does not sound like a massive figure.  Could such examples be applied to the sort of thing about which Mr. Noone was talking?  What sort of redundancy payments will be made?  Will the workers who have been transitioning over to other types of work retain their pay, conditions and pensions etc.?  That sort of detail is being demanded by workers in Roscommon, Dublin and Clare who want to know whether they will have security in their pay, terms, hours and pensions.  If they are to be made redundant, they need to know they will be looked after properly.  If we do not get this right, we are in for a pile of trouble.  If we do not bring people with us and treat them fairly, we are in for a pile of trouble because we do not have a lot of time.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the carbon tax itself.  Several references have been made to it.</p><p>What has happened in France with the yellow vests, the <i>gilets jaunes</i>, has really changed the narrative on this.  For example, the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said in the D&aacute;il today that we have to be careful about how we introduce the measure.  This is the first time this was said.  The yellow-vest protests and the climb-back of Macron's Government have had a real impact.  There is probably a lesson in this for the Bord na M&oacute;na workers in that if they want just transition, they will probably have to fight for it rather than expect it to be delivered.<br/><br/>On the carbon tax, is it not now time to say the carbon tax has to be delivered as a tax on profit and wealth rather than a tax on ordinary people, who are not benefitting from just transition and did not create the climate change problem?</p></speech>

We hope to have a speaker over to brief us on it.  Initially, the plan in 2012 under Rajoy's Government was to shut down everything immediately .  The unions fought that.  They successfully turned it around.  I refer to the plan announced last month.  The number involved in coal-mining in Spain has diminished significantly in recent years.  There is not a great number involved and the industry is confined to three regions in the north of Spain, including Asturias and Castilla y Le&oacute;n.   It is a &euro;250 million arrangement but this is coming entirely from the state, as far as I am aware.  It is for retraining and early retirement for those who are of a certain age.</p></speech>

There is a role for corporations to contribute.  It is a matter of how that is done.  A carbon tax, by its nature, is a tax on the consumption of certain products, such as oil and gas.  The important point is that households also have a contribution to make, but the way this is achieved is crucial.</p> <p>  Corporate contributions comprise a much bigger challenge.  It is a European challenge and that is one reason the European Union has an important role to play here.  It could be that some form of consolidated common tax base, which I know is controversial, would have a role.  There is a link here.  Some of that could be linked to a Europe-wide investment programme in decarbonisation.

Many of my questions have been answered so I do not have much to add.  I thank the delegates for the information on Bord na M&oacute;na.  It was certainly presented to the committee that Bord na M&oacute;na was fantastic and doing everything for the workers to have a very just transition.  It is useful to hear the other side.  That will be important to the committee in its deliberations.</p> <p>  There was a notice on the ICTU website about a conference in May on just transition.  It outlined four points, including the establishment of a tripartite body comprising unions, employers and the Government, the establishment of a just transition fund, and a study of the impact of meeting our goals under the Paris Agreement on fossil fuel-dependent communities in Ireland.  With regard to all of these, what response has been received from the Government?  The Minister addressed the conference, which is interesting. </p> <p>  The delegates have more to say about climate change and just transition than any of the departmental representatives who appeared before this committee.  That is a sad reflection on the Government and how it is responding.  I am not saying the delegates have had a great deal to say but they have had more to say than the Government.  Something needs to happen in this regard.  We need to operate beyond the Government.  Maybe the D&aacute;il, the delegates' bodies and civil society could form a body to address this because the Government is certainly way behind everything we are doing.  There does not seem to be any will to catch up or to come on board.  What response, if any, has been received from the Government on this matter?</p> <p>  Mr. Healy said wind is the solution.  In my neck of the woods, wind is not regarded as the solution.  Public acceptance is gone and I do not believe any argument will restore it.  Therefore, we have to examine alternatives.  Perhaps this is an issue the delegates should consider also.</p> <p>  I would like answers to those questions, after which I might have time to ask more.</p></speech>

We took the approach of "suck it and see".  As I stated, the dialogue has a role but it is not the kind of forum we were looking for.  It has a completely different structure.  In that regard, we are still awaiting a response.</p> <p>  I understand there are discussions at European level on a just transition fund and on whether it will be a separate fund or part of a broader adjustment fund.  Nationally, the climate action fund has been referred to.  Perhaps it is a potential source in supporting some of this work.  I do not know.</p> <p>  There were four topics, one being on the goals.  A recent parliamentary question revealed to us that the terms of reference for the study have not been agreed.  That is a source of much disappointment.  </p></speech>

The Oireachtas, the delegates and civil society may be able to do this.  I am worried about the statement that it is entirely up to the Government to respond.  It is to a certain extent but it has gone beyond that at this stage.  The Government response will not happen.  Maybe we have also to respond.  The manner in which we do so is important.  We have to come on board also.</p></speech>

Tomorrow there is to be a mass lobby involving the committee members and colleagues from Stop Climate Chaos, who include as part of their agenda the concept of just transition.

We are really happy that they have taken on the idea also.</p></speech>

I want to extrapolate a little from the Bord na M&oacute;na scenario.  For us, it was to be the exemplar for the just transition.  It was to be the example to which we could all refer as the big glorious project in which the workers transitioned and were treated fairly.  We are getting a very strong sense today, however, that the workers are not getting packages that are commensurate with their years of service.  This committee has to take that very seriously.  When the Bord na M&oacute;na representatives were before us, they spoke about the 11 town hall meetings they had.  I hope no gloss or spin was put on that.  They spoke about renewable energy projects at a number of wind farms and aerobic digestion facilities.</p><p>They spoke about aquaculture and afforestation of 20,000 to 30,000 acres to develop the biomass biochain.  Mr. Noone has expressed some views on that.  They spoke about recycling and tourism.  My question is simple.  There was mention of town hall engagement with workers but do workers who are not seeking to subscribe to the voluntary redundancy scheme have a legitimate expectation within Bord na M&oacute;na currently to transition to other areas in the company?  From the perspective of the congress or SIPTU, is there an expectation among workers that they will be redeployed into one of these areas of activity and there is a legitimate expectation to retain a job or employment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.347" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Noone" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120400002#M00200"><p>I will answer that as simply as I can.  The 11 town hall meetings mentioned by the Deputy were generated by the company and they took place following the announcement of the redundancy package.  It was a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The kernel of the issue is the make-up of the package and the selection process.  The age profile is very high, as I stated earlier, and I have absolutely no doubt sufficient people will fill it.  I hope that will happen.  If a sufficient number take the package, it will be easier to exit people etc.  The fairness of the package is causing much disgruntlement with people.  We believe the scheme will be oversubscribed and the company will then select the people who will leave, and that will be done unfairly.  I know there are people in the company with 42 or 43 years of service and although they expect to retire, they will be told they are not allowed to go and will have to stay until they are 65.  There are people in their late 50s who will look to get their pension and although they can leave, they will not get any pension.  It is a change from what was in place three months ago.  If those people had gone three months ago, before the package was developed, they could have received their pension but they are now being told they cannot get it.  It is crazy stuff.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Noone" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120400002#M00400"><p>That is correct.  We need a conversation with representatives of the company before it goes to the Department to sanction the package.  We knew the age profile and expectation of workers but we were only consulted after the fact.  We gave our views in the consultation but they were not taken on board.  At our last meeting with company representatives, we told them clearly that we do not believe the stakeholder understood the packages outlined for staff.  No politician who is in any way fair-minded at all would allow the package to go out in the way that it has.</p> <p>  The expectation of workers is that they should get out but many people will be disappointed.  The company is clearly saying it will make the decision on who is going to get out and who will not.  We are probably singing off the same hymn sheet with perhaps 75% to 80% of the people who want to go and should be allowed to go but approximately 20% of people should get out but the company will look to allow a different 20% of people to leave.  It will cause major problems.  It has been mentioned that this will happen outside the Government.  At this moment, we may have to go to the streets on this and have public protests.  It is not fair that people in their 60s in Bord na M&oacute;na, a semi-State company, are being told their job is gone, although in theory the process is voluntary.  In reality, people will be told there is no other choice.</p></speech>

It will be a different cohort of people.  They may be Bord na M&oacute;na employees but it will not be these workers.</p></speech>

It is important for us to acknowledge as a committee that recommendation No. 7 speaks of making proper provision for the protection of the rights of the workers impacted.  There was an overwhelming mandate.  Today's interaction has been very useful and we are now beginning to develop the language of the just transition and tease it out.  Does the witness agree with the language of the just transition, what it means and how it would be populated in terms of funding, specifically the types of structures set up?  It is very much an iterative process but there must be some formal process and the Government must be a key stakeholder in that.  It will take pounds, shillings and pence.  If we are talking about the social protection element of the just transition, the State and the Government will have to fund that activity.  Taking the Spanish example of transition, &euro;250 million was spent, which is not an insignificant amount of money.  We are talking about a serious funding pot that will have to be made available by the Government if we are talking about decarbonising the economy.  Does the witness agree with the proposition?</p></speech>

It is a pity Senator Mulherin has left as she was trying to make the point that this is purely voluntary.  When we scrape through the surface of what has gone to the public, it means people could be moved and not facilitated with voluntary severance.  They could be earning &euro;42,000 per year.  They will get a job but the company is saying when they get a job, there is no commitment that the earnings will be retained.  They may be given a job 25 miles away on &euro;15,000 per year less.  The package is purely voluntary but people do not want to go 20 miles away or earn &euro;15,000 per year less.  It is the reality and when people scrape the surface, they must see that detail.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Mr. Noone, has said, that may involve a new cohort of people.  A just transition is also about retaining the terms and conditions in Bord na M&oacute;na for new employees coming on stream.  It is not about creating new terms and conditions for new employees.  That part of the just transition is very important.</p> <p>  There are social protection elements and Deputy Pringle alluded to an all-government approach.  We need the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection and others to work together.  It is not just down to a particular Department trying to achieve this just transition.  It is why we come back to having a national forum, as there will then be an all-Government approach.  Otherwise, it is siloed into a particular sector, group of workers or Department.  It is important to consider in this regard.</p></speech>

Mr. Healy has mentioned deep retrofitting schemes and the housing stock in an area that might have potential.  Has congress engaged with the company on the retraining and upskilling potential?  Is it something that must be elevated beyond current talks or dialogue with the company on terms and conditions, voluntary redundancies and so on?  How do we as a committee take the language of the just transition and deal with a very bespoke example like the peat industry?  Rather than speaking rhetorically about what we need to do, what action is required?  Is there any activity from agencies in the engagement, or even from academic institutions like Athlone Institute of Technology who could help in figuring out how to transition workers?  Is there any experience of that?</p></speech>

I have had engagement with the company and a member of the European Parliament about accessing some of the globalisation fund.  There must be a certain quantum of employees involved.  At this time we do not know how many people will exit the company and from what locations.  The moneys that may become available from that fund are purely for training and upskilling.</p><p>Two types of Bord na M&oacute;na worker will be involved.  There will be the Bord na M&oacute;na worker who will stay working in Bord na M&oacute;na for the foreseeable future and he or she will have a certain training requirement and there will be the Bord na M&oacute;na worker who will exit Bord na M&oacute;na and he or she will have a certain training requirement.  We have discussed whether people exiting Bord na M&oacute;na who want to avail of a course and travel to Athlone Institute of Technology, for example, will be afforded expenses for travel.  We believe such expenses are attainable.  We have also discussed in some detail the possibility of getting experts in to upskill the remaining workforce but first we must carry out a skills audit to assess what we have, what will be required into the future and match that with training.  That work is being done as we speak in this current round of talks. </p></speech>

I mean green is the new red and red is the new green.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan has commended some of the work that has been done.  Likewise, I thank Mr. David Joyce for the work that he did, and that we did together, at the climate gathering in terms of a series of sessions where we considered this issue over recent years.  He brought over the head of the International Trade Unions Movement who said that it is the absolute truth that there are no jobs on a dead planet and we must work together on this.</p> <p>  I appreciate the commentary by the witnesses on our just transition commission.  Do they agree that the main structure we seek is a mediation service?  I mean an independently fully resourced and skilled team who can be brought in and used when areas are designated to be in need of a specific just transition plan.  I do not have a long tradition in the negotiating process.  However, I know that the mediation process is not binding.  I know that it is fully State resourced and has all of the expertise that we can marshal to provide a mediation service between workers, employers and communities in the just transition process.  Do the witnesses think that structure is the right approach in terms of establishing a just transition commission to assist in this process?</p> <p>  I will ask all my three questions and the witnesses can answer them together.  I agree very much with Mr. Dullaghan when he said that the State will have to lead a lot of this work.  We are going to back to our future in terms of State leadership unlike the electrification of our country.  I was very disappointed that Bord na M&oacute;na, in its new strategy, did not see the opportunity I see that the company must have in the &euro;50 billion project to retrofit buildings, which we need to do in the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  I see Bord na M&oacute;na having a role in that.  Rather than laying off people in Newbridge, Bord na M&oacute;na will have to employ hundreds of additional people in Newbridge to set up apprenticeships for 1,000 carpenters, 1,000 heating engineers, 1,000 plumbers and 1,000 glaziers to manage its biggest and most important project.  If we can go back to Bord na M&oacute;na and say, "rather than excluding that from your option of menus and just going with the options that you have set out, go big in terms of the State showing that we can be brilliant at creating an apprenticeship system that gives the youth of the midlands a future."  Do the witnesses agree with such a strategy option?  </p> <p>  Engagement on this should be a continuation of the record that we also have in partnership.  To me, the partnership process has served this country well.  The governance structure of this initiative will see it centred around the Taoiseach's office.  In other words, Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach and the Secretary General for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment would set the sights of the Action Plan for Jobs at the core of the State.  The unions have a good connection with the Department of the Taoiseach through the partnership process.  Does such a governance structure make sense to the witnesses?  I refer to where the central co-ordination of this exercise takes place.</p></speech>

I thank the select committee for giving me the opportunity to attend to assist in its consideration of the Supplementary Estimate which has been requested for my Department.  The requirement is for an additional amount of nearly &euro;182 million which comprises two major elements.  On the expenditure side, there is provision for &euro;147 million in additional expenditure to meet superannuation costs.  There is also a contingency provision in the order of &euro;35 million for European Social Fund receipts.  I will oultine briefly the reasons for both elements of the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware that my Department has sought Supplementary Estimates to meet superannuation costs a number of times in recent years.  They resulted from the gap between the allocation made to meet pension costs and actual expenditure to meet ongoing pension costs and pension gratuity payments.  This issue has also affected other parts of the public sector.  There has been an upward trend in the overall number of pensioners in the education sector.  In 2014 pensioner numbers in the sector were estimated as being in the order of 42,500.  Next year, we expect the figure to be closer to 49,000.  As the committee is aware, it can be difficult to predict with absolute certainty the number of retirements in any particular year.  This is primarily because teachers account for the vast majority of retirements in the education sector, but only a very small percentage of teachers retire on compulsory age grounds.  The specific number of teachers who will retire in any given year will vary, but the trend has been broadly constant for a number a years.</p> <p>  I will outline the position in 2018.  The amount we were allocated in budget 2018 would have provided for pension gratuities and pension costs for some 773 retirees in schools and 76 retirees in the institute of technology sector.  The Supplementary Estimate will provide for the cost of an additional 1,319 retirements in the school sector, bringing the overall number to 2,092, and 143 in the institute of technology sector, bringing the overall number to 219.  The Supplementary Estimate will provide for ongoing pension costs, where there is also an under-provision.  I am pleased to say that, following significant engagement between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;147 million in additional funding is to be provided in 2019 to meet superannuation costs in the education sector.  This figure has been calculated with reference to actuarial forecasts and will mitigate the need for a Supplementary Estimate to meet pension costs in 2019.</p> <p>  The second major element of the Supplementary Estimate is a contingency provision for European Social Fund receipts.  My Department's original Estimate for 2018 included a conservative forecast that some &euro;34.7 million would be received in receipts related to a European Social Fund claim due to be paid in 2018.  The Department made this claim to the relevant European authorities in November and our expectation is that it will result in receipts of &euro;109 million which will be brought to account by the Department of Education and Skills by the end of the year.  When dealing with amounts of this scale, it is obviously necessary to take a highly prudent approach.  Given that at the time the Supplementary Estimate was being considered by the Government, we had not yet received this funding in the Department's accounts, it was considered appropriate to provide for a contingency in the unlikely event that the money was not received until next year.  I want to make it clear that it is purely a technical exercise related to the timing of claims and recoupments and necessary to avoid any risk of an excess Vote.  My Department is confident that we will receive the &euro;109 million in this year of account and that it will be remitted to the Exchequer.  In the highly unlikely event that we do not receive the funds until next year, it is important to stress that it is merely a timing issue and that there will be no loss of funds to the State.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee for its consideration of the Supplementary Estimate.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

It is difficult to predict at the start of the year how many teachers will retire.  In the context of the shortage of teachers, particularly of certain subjects in post-primary schools, are efforts being made to hold on to teachers and encourage them not to retire?  The Department cannot force them to remain, but not having enough qualified teachers of certain subjects is an issue.</p> <p>  Although it is off topic, we are all aware of the situation at Grafton College.

Unfortunately, they are not all related to the subject matter of the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  The pension issue arises year in, year out.  It is no joke - it is a significant amount of money.  We receive assurances every year that it will be sorted by the following year, but that has not come to pass.  The Department does not seem to be able to deal with the issue which has to do with forecasting.</p><p>The forecasting of teacher supply is constantly underestimated.  I wonder sometimes if it is an accounting trick.  A grant to a school or a programme can always be cancelled but the pensions must be paid.  Is this simply an accounting trick played every year to ensure the Department can get an extra &euro;100 million and then go back for the Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year because the Oireachtas cannot refuse funding for pensions?  What has happened in the Department to change this?</p><p> The issue about the European Social Fund is very strange.  Why was the application only made in November if the Department is expecting funding to be in place this year?  Is there a reason for that?  It seems to be the case of "the money was only resting in the account" from the Department's perspective, because it is claiming a Supplementary Estimate that it hopes will not be needed.  In that eventuality, it will be passed back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If it does not it will go into the account.  I am not sure this is a good way to deal with hundreds of millions of euro, and it causes me some concern in the context of the fact that the share of voted expenditure allocated to education has been decreasing over the last number of years.  Education is not getting its fair share.  It had been allocated 16.6% of overall voted expenditure but in 2018, it has decreased to 16.3%.  I do not know how this couple of hundred million euro, thrown in at the end and for which we will see no educational benefit, will affect those percentages.  It is disappointing, and it shows a significant lack of prioritisation by the Government.  It is highly unfair.  These figures have been provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  They have not been noted by anyone; very few of us have spoken out about this.  It is really worrying.  The fact that it has been getting a smaller share of the pie each year for the last number of years speaks loudly to the Government's commitment to education.  I would not like to see the figures massaged by money that will rest temporarily in the account or a temporary extraordinary figure for pensions where students would not actually see a benefit.  The Minister should comment on that and tell us what he will do to ensure that education will become more of a priority for the Government when it comes to budgets.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2018120400002#C00200"><p>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised the issue of teacher supply.  She will be aware that there is a working group on teacher supply, which is chaired by the Secretary General at the Department.  We are working on a number of measures, including some we can take straight away such as, for example, changing the rules on teachers returning from career breaks.  We are also looking at outreach opportunities focusing on teachers young and not so young working in the south east of England and in the United Arab Emirates.  We are launching a promotional and marketing drive over Christmas, and intend to roll out several such campaigns.  Teacher supply is a big issue.  On the specific issue of retirees, the combined figure for retired teachers working in primary schools and secondary schools in the year 2017-18 was 1,342.  That figure highlights the nature and the scale of the demand and the pressures on the system.  There are constraints and challenges in the capital city and different constraints and challenges in rural areas but overall, there is a big demand for teachers, as the Deputy pointed out, and we want to keep the focus on this issue.  I certainly want to keep the focus on it.  I am also engaged with the Teaching Council.  Deputies, Senators and different school groups can sense a frustration when we are trying to register teachers.  While there are reasons for that as well, it is an area on which I am working very closely with my officials to ensure there are ways in which we can speed up the response to that major issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy has knowledge of the superannuation issue from her previous role.  We had Supplementary Estimates, and they are contained in the information pack provided.  Totals of &euro;40 million, &euro;30 million, &euro;37 million and &euro;71 million were provided on the teacher side in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.  Those figures do not include the institute of technology sector.  To dovetail into Deputy Thomas Byrne's questions around this type of practice, I am reliably informed that it is not an accounting trick.  Having researched this matter myself and having asked the question as to why we end up in this situation - which does not only affect this Department - I have found there are legacy issues, given where we were and the constraints on resources in recent years.  I have been assured that this figure will mitigate against having to provide a Supplementary Estimate.  I am on public record on that now.  Although nobody knows where we will be this time next year, I am convinced that the work being done by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will ensure that this issue does not arise every year.  In fairness to the Department, there was no miscalculation of numbers.  Those figures are too wide, given where we were a couple of months ago and where we are now.  I accept the fact that we are coming from a position where there were great challenges on our resources and choices had to be made in 2011, 2012 and 2013.  It also highlights the enormous challenge we face in terms of pensions, not just in the Department of Education and Skills but throughout the public service and Civil Service.  We will have to find extra resources, and decisions will have to be made in that regard.  </p> <p>  As for the issue of the Department's spending and whether there has been an increase or decrease, if one looks back over the figures it is clear that they fluctuate over the years.  My personal commitment, the commitment of the Government and the commitment of the Oireachtas to education is front and centre stage at all times.  It is the third biggest departmental spend and &euro;10.8 billion will be spent in 2019.  There is always an issue with extra resources, but as an economy grows and improves and as demographics in counties such as Dublin, Wicklow, Louth, Meath and Kildare change, the pressures change.  I have asked for figures on the growth in those places where populations are growing.  We have to respond to that.  We are not, however, just looking at what is happening next year or in 2020.  This must fit into the ten-year capital plan and how we gauge population growth in those areas.  The officials in the Department and I are committed to ensuring that we continue to fight for our fair share of the distribution of funding at budget time.  That will continue to be the focus.  Cross-collaboration between Departments must also be pointed out.  Each Department must look after its own funding but much work is taking place on a cross-collaborative basis as well.  Education does not work in a silo and never has.  It has always worked with industry.  Even in the projects I have visited in my capacity as Minister in recent months, including the IBM project at Larkin community college or the work being done with Microsoft at Dublin City University, there is much cross-cutting work going on in the education sector.  It is a creative space.  I certainly will be focusing on keeping up with technological advancement as well, but that is a discussion for another day.   </p></speech>

The Minister mentioned that the figures have increased from 42,500 in 2014 to 49,000 at present.  Does he have projected figures for the coming years?  He has said that it is difficult to predict with absolute certainty the number of teachers retiring in any particular year but perhaps he could give us some indication.</p></speech>

The fact the number of retirees was 63% more than what was estimated is incredible.  The figure was underestimated by over two thirds.  The bigger issue, which touches on what Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said, is whether we have a significant number of teachers retiring early.  If it is the case, we need to try to understand why they are doing so.  Is the job so onerous that people feel they have to retire early?  I completely understand it in the case of teaching principals.  I attended their conference last Saturday week.  Quite a significant number - I think one third - of teaching principals are retiring early.  If there is a problem, we need to be able to try to get to the root of it.  There has been an additional Supplementary Estimate every year since 2014.  It seems it is being continually underfunded which does not make sense.  The Department of Defence has put a measure in place to make sure it does not happen with Army pensions.  It could possibly be looked at.  The Minister is saying it will not happen again.  How confident is the Department on its projected figures for next year?</p></speech>

He asked about the numbers of projected pensioners and additional retirees.  There is an actuarial estimation of 703 in the primary sector and 450 in the secondary, community and comprehensive sector.  The figure will increase over time.  There will be resource challenges in the future and decisions will have to be made in that regard.  </p> <p>  With regard to the Chairman's question about why teachers retire and why some retire young, some do not.  Some do a specific number of years and then decide to stay on for one reason or another.  There is a question around - let us call a spade a spade - the pressures of the job and the stresses that go with it.  The committee has done a lot of work in terms of well-being and anxiety focused on pupils and students but it has also focused on the teachers.  It is an all-school well-being model.  There are extra pressures and demands.  On the creative side, there is more flexibility, even within the junior certificate curriculum, to allow more bottom-up, locally-led projects empowering teachers and students to have more control over the curriculum.  It is an addition.  It is a changed world.  It has changed since when I taught in 1993, 1994 and 1995.  The classroom is not just a room of instruction any more.  There are many aspects to it in terms of looking after and caring for students, motivation and dealing with wider issues, including family issues.</p> <p>  The Chairman also asked what we have done about pensions and she compared it with the Army.  The Department has carried out a similar exercise as that carried out with the Army pensions.  Conversations have gone on within the Department and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There have also been conversations at a cross-departmental level.  The Chairman asked how confident we are that we will not be in the same position again next year looking for another Supplementary Estimate.  I see the former Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, smiling.  Perhaps she has been in the same position as me.  The commitment I have been given is that because of the intense work that took place with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department wants to get into a position where it is not under-calculating it.</p> <p>  I have just been handed a note that says &euro;147 million in additional funding has been provided for superannuation costs in the education sector in 2019.  It has been calculated with reference to actuarial forecasts and it will mitigate the need for Supplementary Estimates on pension costs in 2019.  We are all working together in terms of the information we are being provided with.  I am confident the information I have been provided with will ensure we are not back in this position in 2019.  </p></speech>

The number has almost increased threefold.  For university and IT staff, it was estimated at 76 but it is expected to be 219.  That is nearly three times the estimated number.  The Minister cannot tell me it is a coincidence that somehow the Department only estimated one third of the people who would retire.  I do not buy it.  Every year we come in here and it is a huge amount of money.  It has real implications in the classroom.  That is the problem.  The school does not know if the geography teacher or maths teacher is retiring.  Kids around the country are left without teachers because the Department does not know who will retire or how many will retire.  It is a real worry.  It is a financial concern.  It is much more of a concern to the child in the classroom who is losing out in their education because the Department is not able to predict what teachers will be in the classroom.</p></speech>

The Department cannot guess exactly how many retirees there will be at the end of June.  They cannot make that estimate.  The fact it has bounced to three times the projected figure tells me there was a question of trying to ensure the Department worked within an overall figure.  This is where they fit in.  I have asked my officials to ensure that whatever the figure is when we arrive at it pre-budget that it is evidence-based.  There is confidence amongst my officials that they will know exactly and will have narrowed it down in order that we do not come back here every year.  I am not making excuses for the accounting practices within which the Department of Education and Skills must work because it is an annual thing.  It is the same as other Departments.  We are constitutionally bound and so on but we are looking at the budget from year to year for the school year from September to June, that is, in the middle of that cycle.  The information and advice I have been given on this is we will not be back in this situation again next year.</p></speech>

I worked in a Youthreach centre a good while ago.  These programmes are ongoing.  Youthreach programmes that are funded under the ESF need to have receipts of expenditure.  Many of these programmes involve programme expenditure.  They are not necessarily about paying regular items from week to week.  Obviously, there are items and budgets that need to be spent towards the end of the year.  My consideration of this is the same as that of the committee.  It will be good to get it in as early as possible.  There is confidence here that the money will be paid.  It is a question of timing.  If there is a way of making that easier next year, for example, by trying to get the receipts in at as early a stage as possible, we can consider it.  It is difficult to do that because of the <i>ad hoc</i>nature of many of these programmes.  Many involve one-off events and many programme costs require receipts.  Obviously, that has to be factored in.  My officials would prefer to be in a position in which this could be done earlier than November, but there are constraints around that.</p></speech>

Is there a risk that the commitment will not be met?  In such circumstances, the Department would have paid out money that is not going to be recouped.  Are there opportunities to claim ESF moneys on a quarterly basis?</p></speech>

The Chair also asked about risk.  There are no risks because this involves programme work that has happened.  Obviously, there is buy-in.  The nature of the funding mechanism that is done through Europe means that we have to ensure everything is in line and is done properly.  I believe there is no risk.  It will be paid before the end of the year.</p></speech>

Would the upskilling of people in the workplace come in under the ESF funding?  I think programmes within the workplace are partially funded from ESF funding.  When I met representatives of the National Adult Literacy Agency recently, they told me they are concerned that as we reach so-called full employment, many people with literacy and numeracy issues who are in the workplace need upskilling to make progress with their incomes, etc.  It is probably not appropriate for us to have a lengthy debate on this issue because we are simply dealing with finances here.  I am bringing this issue to the Minister's attention in the hope that there will be a concentration on ensuring this particular sector of the workforce has an opportunity to upskill.  As far as I know, these programmes are largely funded under the ESF.</p></speech>

I believe that if we are looking at the progression and professional development of the workforce and the labour force, adult literacy has to be an important component of that.  When 3,000 workers in my own county lost their jobs as a result of the closure of Fruit of the Loom, and when Unifi in Letterkenny closed a few years after that, we faced the massive challenge of getting the local workforce reskilled and reinvented.  Adult literacy was a big part of our approach to personal development.  Our adult education sector took a hand-in-glove approach to that.  In this specific example, people in a particular sector were able to retrain and regroup.  There was an emphasis on adult literacy as part of that regrouping and redirection.</p></speech>

It related to the need for the agreement to be stronger, for example, in the context of environmental protection and human rights.  The question I asked at the time was what structures were in place to monitor the human rights and due diligence of companies that would be beneficiaries of this fund.  That is still not known to us.  Also, focus needs to be put on the issue of renewable energy technologies to help address the issues in terms of climate change and the particular specific needs of African countries.  While this amendment has been ruled out of order and I am not challenging that, it tried to capture some of those issues, which I will seek to consider on Report Stage.  I would appreciate a response to those issues regarding environmental protection, human rights and climate change.</p></speech>

On joining, as is the case with all development banks, our engagement with the African Development Bank Fund will be guided and informed.  Ireland's overall approach to development, including in the areas emphasised by our international development policy, One World, One Future, provides focus for our engagement in all multilateral forums and processes.</p> <p>  As members of the committee may be aware, this policy is under review to ensure that our development ambition takes note of development challenges and initiatives such as the sustainable development goals.  The new policy will have been shaped by a significant consultative process, ensuring that its vision of this world is both relevant to modern challenges and anchored in our foreign policy values working towards a world that is more equal, peaceful and sustainable.  I believe that embedding and prescribing the nature of Ireland's engagement with the bank and the fund within legislation, as proposed by the amendment, would restrict and limit Ireland's capacity for similar development policy evolution and coherence.</p> <p>  Regarding the suggestion in the amendment, which has been ruled out of order, on reporting arrangements to the Oireachtas, I am sure the Minister will give full consideration to the views in the amendment, and while not accepting it, they will be considered.</p></speech>

That is the cornerstone of the bank's strategy to promote growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable.  Additionally, as highlighted by the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network conducted in 2016, safeguards and standards are an area where the bank is particularly strong, which facilitates the delivery of social and environmental standards and the screening of projects, for example, against gender and climate change criteria.  It is not a question of us saying, "There you go, operate as you see fit."  This is pretty standard now for all the multilateral development banks.</p> <p>  In terms of One World, One Future regarding the achievement of gender equality, this is also an open issue upon which the bank and the fund place a special emphasis and actively seek to address the issue across all operations.</p></speech>

This section amends 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 851A provides the basis for confidentiality of taxpayer information.  It also provides the basis for the circumstances in which such information can be disclosed by the Revenue Commissioners, including the limited circumstances in which such information can be disclosed to the Department of Finance.  The proposed amendment will address a conflict between the legislative provisions of section 851A and those of the Freedom of Information Act, which currently prevents the Department of Finance from providing records to the Office of the Information Commissioner even when it is statutorily required to do so in the context of the operation of the freedom of information legislation.</p> <p>  This change in law is necessitated by a specific issue which has arisen.  This issue arose during the course of a review of the freedom of information decision by the Information Commissioner which, in part, involved records which are taxpayer confidential.  Under the current provisions of section 851A, officials in the Department of Finance are precluded from providing these records to the Information Commissioner as to do so would constitute a criminal offence.  However, on the other hand, under the Freedom of Information Act, there is a statutory requirement to furnish this information to the Information Commissioner and failure to comply may constitute a criminal offence.  This results in a highly unsatisfactory legal position with conflicting legislative provisions and this prevents the Department from providing the records to the Information Commissioner as it wishes to do so.</p><p>The proposed amendment to section 851A should address this legislative conflict and remove the anomaly.  It will ensure that the requisite records can be provided to the Information Commissioner so that the commissioner can conduct a review and fulfil his statutory function without further delay.</p><p> Department of Finance officials had initially explored the possibility of including this amendment in this year's Finance Bill.  However, the Department was advised that the proposed amendment was inappropriate for inclusion in a money Bill given that it did not have money Bill status.  Therefore, it is necessary to use an alternative, such as this Bill, to bring forward the amendment.  Under the measure, the Department of Finance can receive confidential taxpayer information from the Revenue Commissioners solely for specific limited purposes, namely, in the context of policy formulation and in connection with state aid matters.  It is important to note that any Revenue officer or any person, including Department of Finance officials, to whom taxpayer information is disclosed and who knowingly provides to any person any taxpayer information or uses any taxpayer information otherwise than in the course of administering or enforcing the tax Acts shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to criminal sanction.</p></speech>

It would amount to accessing information using a different mechanism.  It is not a freedom of information mechanism but it could be used frequently.</p></speech>

I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018120400002#G00400"><p>I thank the committee for the time afforded to my officials and me to provide the additional detail on the papal visit, as requested last week.</p> <p>  My attendance at this committee as Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works and flood relief is to propose a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;20 million.  This is to cover costs incurred by the OPW for the papal visit and an estimated additional spend of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions for a number of projects including emergency work, ancillary works on energy retrofit projects, lift replacement programme, work on Leinster House and the Department of Justice and Equality rationalisation programme.</p> <p>  The main part of this Supplementary Estimate, at &euro;18 million, relates to costs of the work undertaken by the OPW on the visit of Pope Francis to Ireland.  On request from the Taoiseach's office earlier this year, the OPW fully committed to providing its resources to plan and assist in organising this event.  However, it should be noted that there were no funds allocated to the OPW within its 2018 Estimate for an event of this magnitude.  There was an understanding that additional funds would be provided on completion of the work by the OPW and I am here to request that the committee approves this Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  A number of queries arose at the last meeting regarding the procurement of goods and services for this event.  The first aspect that needs to be acknowledged is the extremely short timeframe from the date the Department of the Taoiseach requested the OPW to plan for this event to the actual date of the papal visit.  Hence, the OPW used a combination of tendering competitions where possible and existing multi-year frameworks for a number of contracts that had been put in place, together with the Office of Government Procurement for the decade of centenaries.  All suppliers on the existing framework had successfully been through the rigours of a public request for tender process and have to date fulfilled all obligations as laid out in their respective contracts.</p> <p>  At the last committee meeting, Deputies were very considerate and complimentary of the excellent work carried out by the OPW on this event.  I would like to reiterate my thanks for the hard work the OPW put into ensuring that this event was carried out in a highly professional and effective manner.  To put into perspective the magnitude of the event, it was viewed by 1.1 million viewers from 159 countries, with 1,200 journalists from 31 countries accredited for the event.  We, as Deputies, and our colleagues in government can be proud of how Ireland was portrayed nationally and internationally by this event.  Hence, it is my opinion that we should support </p> <p>  Before I conclude, I remind members that the OPW is consistently available to Government to respond to these large-scale infrastructural projects and will do everything in its power to obtain value for money in carrying out its function, which is a very wide remit spanning from flood risk to estate and heritage management.  I am happy to recommend this Supplementary Estimate for approval by the committee and to answer any questions that may arise.  We circulated answers to the questions put to us last week.  I have also circulated the figures required by the committee.  I am happy to take questions relating to that.</p></speech>

We got the more detailed information requested after last week's meeting only a couple of hours ago.  Can I confirm that the &euro;16.7 million we are talking about now plus another &euro;800,000 that was mentioned last week, which brings the figure to &euro;17.5 million, is not for items that would be usual for a State visit by a Head of State in terms of garda&iacute; deployed in front and behind the car and so on and that they relate, overwhelmingly, to the mass in Phoenix Park, event management and logistics relating to stewarding?  Is that the case?</p></speech>

Would the State pay for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018120400002#G00800"><p>No.  However, I would point out that the money in the Supplementary Estimate for the areas the Deputy mentioned is not just for the event in Phoenix Park.  It is to do with the events at Knock, Phoenix Park, Croke Park and what took place on the streets in Dublin during the papal visit.  With regard to concerts etc., I believe all concert programmes involve ticketing and the costs in respect of ticketing is put onto the people attending.  The people literally pay for the event, and the stewarding company.</p></speech>

However, the event in Phoenix Park was a private event.  It was open ticketing - there was no charge for the tickets - but it was a private event organised by the Catholic Church.  Why is it appropriate for the State to spend close to &euro;18 million of public money on a private church event in any case, not to mention the very substantial moneys that are owed by the church to the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018120400002#G01000"><p>I totally disagree with the Deputy.  In 1979, when a previous Pope came here, the State got very much involved in delivering that for the people of Ireland.  In regard to the Pope's visit for the Gathering of Families, we worked closely, as we have done in the past and continue to do so, to make sure that everything was properly in place in terms of security, safety and all the works involved in that for the people who came to this event.  The people looked for the Pope to visit Ireland.  We stepped up to the mark as requested by the Taoiseach to ensure there was a whole-of-Government approach to making this visit worthwhile and to showcase Ireland abroad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018120400002#G01100"><p>The Minister of State believes it is a good use of public money that, for example, the public spent &euro;1 million on stewarding alone for what was a private Catholic Church event?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018120400002#G01200"><p>When the tickets went online, half a million people applied for them.  Once that number of people applied for the tickets, the OPW took on the task of running the event.  A management plan was put in place.  We then set out how we would run the event.  In terms of that event or any event we host, security is of vital importance to the people.  There are two different types of stewarding involved in that - one outside and one inside.  The people inside took care of what was going on.  The people on the outside took care of what took place on the street but the most important point to make is that we looked after the safety of the people attending the papal visit.</p></speech>

The State will not look for the Catholic Church, as the organiser, to pay for any of the costs of event management, infrastructure, camera platforms, closed circuit television, temporary toilets, stewarding, etc.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018120400002#H00200"><p>The way in which we run these types of events is set out in the estate management plan.  We are obliged to work with those plans.  This is not something that just happens.  It involves a great deal of organisation.  A management plan running to 1,200 pages was put in place to cover this event.  We have to adhere to that.  We work with the Garda, fire service, local authorities, the HSE and various other agencies as part of the plan.  While people were talking about the Pope coming at the end of last year, we only got official notice of that in February.  A considerable amount of work needed to be done and we needed to do it perfectly.  No unforeseen events, injuries or anything like that occurred in the Phoenix Park that we could not control.  It was a very well run event.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018120400002#H00300"><p>I am not questioning the quality of the work done by the OPW on the event management.  However, I will not support the Vote and we will see how the division on that goes.  Members of the public are being asked to pay event management costs of &euro;100 for each person who attended these events around the country.  The public would not do that for a similar private event by a political organisation, social movement or the organisers of a concert or football match.  In the cases of all those major events, the costs would be covered by the private organisation in question.  This raises a fundamental question about the relationship of church and State.  The public is made up of Catholics and non-Catholics, and everybody has their absolute right to practise their religion.  However, the public is being asked <i>en masse</i>to pay for a private religious event of one private religion, in this case the Catholic Church.  It seems to be completely at odds with any notion of a secular society and of the separation of church and State.</p></speech>

It was estimated that 500,000 people would attend.  The OPW put in place a management plan for the event.  I will not be drawn into a discussion on church versus State or anything like that.  My job, as Minister of State, was to fulfil the request of the Taoiseach and that is what I did.</p></speech>

We decided that 13 of the 15 areas of activity were procured under existing framework contracts, meaning the suppliers had already gone through the checks and balances of public procurement.  In two cases, an additional procurement competition was run - very tightly in the time involved.  These were for CCTV and security.  In the case of Actavo, for the camera platforms, media risers, trackway and much of the fencing on both sites, we already had a framework contract in place and we contracted the work out under the terms of that framework contract.</p></speech>

Many such suppliers worked as subcontractors for the bigger companies.  We checked that the concessions in the Phoenix Park took on an appropriate amount of work through the various contract arrangements.  Many of them were small companies which were only capable of taking on a certain amount of work.</p></speech>

There are a number of steps to consider, the first of which is procurement in advance to make sure the agreed rates are correct and acceptable, and meet procurement guidelines.  Then, when the invoice is lodged we check the invoice against the work done.  Some of this is quite complicated because there is so much detail involved, as the members can see from figures such as 2,916 stewards.  There are many queries, checks and cross-checks until we are satisfied that the invoices can be paid.  In some cases we are dealing with multiple small suppliers and the main contractor cannot invoice the Office of Public Works until it in turn is invoiced by multiple smaller suppliers, some of which are voluntary organisations.  It can take a bit of time.  This is why there are quite a few outstanding invoices.  The visit was on 26 August, and even though it is now early December we will get quite a significant number of invoices over the next week or two</p></speech>

It is a moving feast.  As every week goes by we are honing the figure.  The overall total of &euro;18 million is correct and the costs will not exceed &euro;18 million for the total visit, against an initial estimate of &euro;20 million.</p></speech>

Three figures were mentioned.  There is one figure in the Estimates, which the Minister of State has explained to Deputy O'Brien, of &euro;244,000.  This was for taking down gates and putting up temporary gates.  What are the other figures with regard to these gates?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.640" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018120400002#K01700"><p>There is another estimated cost of &euro;700,000.  First, we had to go out to tender for the gates.  This does not come about by just sending out a tender; there were different people involved in heritage issues from other Departments to look at how we would go about this.  The gates are a protected structure and are part of the Phoenix Park.  In order to get the gates properly in place for the event and afterwards, and for money to be spent on them, it is not just a case of repainting the gates and putting them back up.  I shall outline what goes along with that.  In taking the gates down originally, some stonework and pillars had to be removed.  They had to be rebuilt and put in place.  Steelwork had to be in place.  We also had to incur costs on tarmacadam and archaeologists because to put these gates back into place we were interfering with the road works.  Included in those costs are the collective costs in putting the gates back where they belong.  As members are aware, the park has won awards and gold medals recently and is vital to the people of Ireland.  It is hugely important to the people and we had an opportunity, when doing those gates and bringing them back, to put them into use again that will do for centuries to come.</p></speech>

We have a list of the spending to date that shows a figure of &euro;1,005,270 for Pulse Security for steward services.  This was a tender, as far as I am aware.  The contract procurement information is for Pulse Security, with a contract reference number and a total of &euro;1,005,270.  I believe there is a 21 cent difference between the two documents.  It shows a zero figure in the breakdown for the Phoenix Park event.  When I asked the question the Minister of State said it was for services outside the park but then said it was for security services inside the park.  I am just trying to get a breakdown of exactly how much was spent by Pulse Security on the Phoenix Park event.  I have the figures for every other location it was working.</p></speech>

Volunteers provided by the church and others were stewarding on the day.  They would have been largely untrained in certain skills such as crowd control and possibly health and safety aspects.

The rationalisation of the accommodation of the Department was required as a result of a lease expiring on 94 St. Stephen's Green and the Department being compelled to move.  The project involved the relocation of staff across three properties while maintaining business as usual.  The project required multiple staff moves as a result of the complexity of phasing of works.  In addition, out-of-hours work added to the project cost.  The provision of a high-security secure file storage area was not included in the original brief and was subsequently included.  A fire integrity upgrade was also required in one of the properties.  To sum it up, it involved the costs incurred in moving the Department from a property where a lease was being surrendered to other property.</p></speech>

One of the companies, Eventsec, costing &euro;655,000, dealt with security within the Phoenix Park only.  Pulse Security, which received the larger amount of just over &euro;1 million, dealt with Knock and the events on the Saturday at Dublin Castle and other events around Dublin city.  On the Sunday of the papal mass in the Phoenix Park, it dealt with security outside of the Phoenix Park, in other words, crowd management around the city with regard to traffic.</p></speech>

It gives us a breakdown of where all the money was spent at the different events, except for combined services and security.  I am trying to find out what those figures relate to.

We went through this in detail today and on the previous occasion.  The Minister of State will see from the engagement with members that a significant amount of information was not provided in a way that was clearly understood at the first meeting.  To go back to Deputy O'Brien's query, we have to accept that the witnesses will write in to us and explain the &euro;400,000, even though that should have been dealt with as part of the Estimate.  I am saying that to the Minister of State's colleagues as much as I am saying it to him.  On another occasion, if that were to happen, we might ask that we would not deal with the Estimate on the day we have it, and that we would come back again.  I believe in having all of the figures here but, on this occasion, we have spent two meetings at it and I certainly would not be satisfied that all of the information was here.  I ask the OPW to reply to the committee on that as soon as possible and to note that, in future, we expect all information to be provided early and previous to the meeting itself.</p> <p>  I raised the issue of Durrow Abbey with the Minister of State last week.  I want to put on record that I had a casual meeting with the Minister of State where we spoke about it, and I spoke to Mr. Buckley.  I will not go into the matter now because I am going to leave it for another day and ask members for their views as to how it should be handled.  In the meantime, I am asking again for all of the information relative to that issue, including dates, times, facts and figures, dating back to the time when this was first discussed with the Arts for Peace project.  I intend to suggest to members, when I get that information, that we have a special meeting with the OPW, and to include the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, who was then Minister of State in the Department with Deputy Moran.  I want to put on record that I attended meetings with the OPW and officials and it was my understanding that we were discussing the surrender of the lease of Durrow Abbey back to the State for a figure.  At one stage, at a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and officials, a figure of &euro;600,000 was mentioned.</p><p>There are a number of issues that need to be sorted out but they can only be addressed by the provision of the full documentation to this committee.  Then we can examine exactly what is happening and understand the position from both sides of the argument.</p></speech>

It would be wrong for me or anybody to start investigating this matter when legal action is being pursued.  It would be unfair for me to make any more statements on this matter until the outcome of those legal proceedings is known.  That is only right and fair.</p></speech>

As I explained to Mr. Maurice Buckley, the proceedings in court are a step beyond common sense for both parties.  Mediation was suggested.  There have been a number of issues during the course of this matter and I do not accept that hiding behind the threat of a High Court action is sufficient.  The Department needs to give itself time to examine the existing documents and to reach its conclusion.  Based on the fact that a commitment was given and discussions entered into by the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Canney, I give an assurance that I will come back to this at a future date.  I am asking the Minister of State, again, for the history of this matter to be provided to the members so they can make up their own minds as to what should be done.</p></speech>

He has been well briefed since our last meeting and knows damn well that he is wrong.  I have every intention of pursuing this matter to the very end because I believe the person in question, or project in question, was misled.  All I have asked for is clarification on all of those issues.  The Minister of State can hide behind his legal advice and state he is going to court etc.  That is fine.  It will now be for the other party to decide where best to go with this.  I am simply saying that the Minister of State can get legal advice but he can judge for himself as to whether it is correct and in the interests of the taxpayer.

Our intention is to ensure there is an obligation on the judicial system to sanction in some way persons who do not co-operate with the system.  While I accept the Minister's argument that it would interfere with the independence of the Judiciary, I would like to hear why she cannot accept the amendment.  </p><p>We are trying to send a message that people must be more co-operative with the system itself, which was set up to ensure there would be a seamless, less adversarial and less costly system in place.  As I said, there should be some sanction for people who do no contribute in a co-operative way to the system when they assess damages or make their case.  We made the point in the D&aacute;il earlier during parliamentary questions that there seems to be no sanction for people who engage in a process to scam people, fraudulently secure money by false means, present false evidence to courts, lie under oath or view the system as an opportunity for scams.  In my role as spokesperson in this area, I will seek to ensure measures are put forward that oblige the Judiciary, the prosecution services and the investigative services to be as hard as possible on persons who are non-co-operative or who use the system in an abusive way to secure funds through fraudulent means or the pretence of being injured.  That is the purpose of the amendment but if the Minister can convince me otherwise, I will revisit it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.807" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120400002#B00300"><p>I understand what the Deputy seeks to achieve.  The effect of the amendment is to remove the discretion of the court as to what order it may make on what costs, if any, it will allow a claimant or respondent, taking into account the failure by the claimant or respondent to comply or submit in the manner specified in subsection (1).  It raises constitutional concerns because it would cut across the constitutional principle of the separation of powers and the discretion of the courts to make an order for costs.</p> <p>  Section 8(1) lists the circumstances under which the court can consider an adverse costs order: where the assessors have requested the claimant under section 23(1) to furnish additional information or documents relating to his or her claim for special damages and the claimant has not complied with the request; where the assessors have requested the respondent or respondents under section 23(2) to furnish additional information or documents and the respondent or respondents have not complied with the request; where the assessors have requested the claimant or respondent or respondents under section 23(4) to assist or co-operate with retained experts, and the claimant or respondent or respondents have not complied with that request; or where the assessor has requested the claimant to submit himself or herself to a medical examination arranged by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and the claimant has not submitted himself or herself to the medical examination.</p> <p>  The section provides that the court may order certain matters, taking into account the failure to comply or submit in the manner specified in subsection (1).   The word "may" in the section refers to the order a court may make on what costs, if any, it will allow a claimant or a respondent.  The making of an order is, and must remain, a discretionary matter for the judge.  The court must take the matters referred to in subsection (1) into account when deciding on whether to make an order.</p> <p>  When the general scheme of the Bill was published in June 2017, it was proposed under head 7 that a court shall have regard to the failure to respond to a request for further information, documents or medical reports in determining the admissibility of evidence in subsequent proceedings and that a court shall have regard to a failure to attend an independent medical examination in determining what medical evidence is admissible in the court case.  </p> <p>  The Bill was drafted in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, which was involved directly in the wording of the section.  It was decided that a proposal to limit a court's discretion as to the admissibility of evidence would raise constitutional issues because it would cut across the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.  It is the function of the court and the constitutional duty of a judge to hear all the available evidence, arrive at a decision on foot of that evidence and determine issues of liability and quantum.  Furthermore, the plaintiff has a right to tender evidence before the courts.  The court must retain discretion in any given case to ensure constitutional rights are vindicated and fair procedures are followed.  By providing for potential financial consequences to be applied for non-compliance with requests by PIAB assessors, the section, as drafted, should have the desired effect to change behaviour and encourage parties to adhere to the requirements set out in the Act.</p> <p>  For the reasons I outlined, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment because I cannot support it.</p></speech>

It gives an indication that this Government is not always in favour of the autonomy and independence of the Judiciary.  I am not trying to hamstring the Judiciary into having to do something but rather ensure it must, at the least, take into account the non-co-operation of a claimant, which is the purpose of the amendment.</p> <p>  The Minister said it runs contrary to the advice of the Attorney General because it would be in breach of the separation of powers, a principle I support, although the Minister of State may not.  I will, therefore, withdraw the amendment, reserving my entitlement to reintroduce it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Section 8 applies to applications made to PIAB on and after the enactment of the section, and applications made to the PIAB on enactment of the section where the assessors have not requested information or documents from the claimant, respondent or respondents regarding special damages, or where the claimant, respondent or respondents have not been requested by the assessors to co-operate or assist retained experts or where the claimant has not been asked by the assessors to submit himself or herself for a medical examination arranged by PIAB.</p><p>The amendment was drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  I am conscious that where the State sets up a system where people&rsquo;s rights are engaged, it is critical that the procedural and administrative system is clear and transparent.  People need to know what they are and are not required to do.  The amendment makes clear the applications that will be covered by the section on commencement of the legislation.  It is important that claimants fully co-operate with the PIAB process to maximise the model and ensure as many claims as possible are settled in a timely, cost-effective manner.</p><p>This Bill will cover all the new claims and any claims that are in the system, subject to the circumstances that I have just described.  We are trying to capture as many as we can with the new legislation.</p></speech>

We were told at the time that the awards made in Ireland could not be compared with those made in other countries.  I would like an explanation as to why we cannot benchmark the awards made in Ireland across the norms.  We benchmark the cost of medicines in Ireland with the cost of the same medicines in OECD countries.  In the context of personal injuries, we would want to draw a comparison of awards in Ireland with those in common law jurisdictions.</p><p>I make this point because the awards made in our nearest neighbouring country, which has a similar legal system, are much lower.  For example, the award for whiplash in the UK is about &pound;4,000 compared with a figure of &euro;20,000.  I know that we have a problem when it comes to awards <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other countries.  I wonder at the reason for the great difference in the level of awards.  I would like to see an explanation in the review of the book of quantum as to how a particular figure is arrived at.  It is fine to publish the details as to what awards should be for various injuries, but there must be some broader assessment as to why a specific figure is arrived at as opposed to the arbitrary announcement that an amount should be paid out when a person suffers a personal injury.  The people as well as the Judiciary have a difficulty with the large disparity between awards across jurisdictions.</p><p>The book of quantum will be a discretionary tool for the Judiciary.  There needs to be research and analysis and a broad assessment of the figures that are awarded for specific injuries.  This is an important point and goes beyond the scope of this Bill.  The Judicial Council Bill 2017 is under consideration, which will in effect take its potential instructions from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, in terms of assessing awards.  I am led to believe that PIAB will assist the Judicial Council in assessing what should be the broad benchmark.  I would appreciate clarity on section 9 in respect of a benchmark which is not self-explanatory in terms of advising and helping the proposed Judicial Council</p></speech>

It will probably be up to the Judicial Council to decide when it has the power to do so.</p> <p>  At the time of the publication of the Bill, the second and final report of the Personal Injuries Commission had not been published.  This report was subsequently published on 18 September 2018 and a key recommendation of the report was that the Judicial Council, when established, should be requested by the Minister for Justice and Equality to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  When the judicial guidelines are in place, it is intended that they will supersede the book of quantum.  The intention for the future is that the Judicial Council will take ownership of the judicial guidelines for personal injury compensation and it will recalibrate them when it considers it necessary.  That should be better because the Judicial Council can change it easily.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.825" nospeaker="true" time="18:40:00" ><p>Question proposed: "That section 11 stand part of the Bill."</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.826" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120400002#C01600"><p>I am opposing this section.  Section 11 seeks to reconstitute the nomination process to the board of PIAB.  As it stands, two members of the board are nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, one person is nominated by IBEC, and one person by the Irish Insurance Federation or any successor of it.  The proposed change contained in section 11 would remove the power of ICTU to nominate two people to the board and replace it with one nomination from Insurance Ireland and one nomination from the Central Bank.  The balance of the two nominations from ICTU and one from IBEC reflects injured parties and premium paying policyholders who should be the principal stakeholders in PIAB.  I do not see the need for the composition of the board to change in this way and I think it would affect the balance on the board.  Therefore, we are opposing section 11.</p></speech>

Section 11 removes ICTU and IBEC as bodies designated under the Bill to nominate members to the board.</p> <p>  As I mentioned during the Second Stage debate, it will be open to members of ICTU or IBEC to apply through the PAS process when vacancies arise.  Seeking expressions of interest for board appointments through the PAS process allows for appointments to be made from a greater number of potential candidates with the desired skill sets, which can vary over time, depending on the skills available to the board.  Board members are appointed as individuals by the Minister where, in the opinion of the Minister, they have the expertise in a field relevant to the board's functions.</p> <p>  The code of practice for the governance of State bodies published in 2016 provides that board members should have the appropriate skills and knowledge appropriate to the activities of the State body to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.  The code of practice also requires that, in determining the criteria for board vacancies, the Minister consult the chairperson of the board to identify the appropriate and collective mix of experience, knowledge and skills required to oversee the board's performance of its functions successfully.  All applicants who meet the criteria may apply to PAS and be assessed.  Corporate governance standards require that the board members act in good faith and in the best interests of the State body.  The duty of the board member is owed to the agency and not to any specific stakeholder.</p> <p>  Under the Bill, it was proposed that five board positions would be filled through PAS, through open advertisement operated by PAS, which since 2014 has been responsible for putting in place an open, accessible, rigorous and transparent system to support Ministers in making appointments to State boards.</p> <p>  I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the current board consists of a Chairperson, the chief executive of PIAB, and nine ordinary members, of whom six are nominated by external bodies designated under legislation.  The Minister normally nominates a senior departmental official to the board.  The external bodies are as follows: two persons nominated by ICTU, one person nominated by IBEC, one person nominated by the Irish Insurance Federation, one person nominated by the Central Bank, and one person nominated by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.</p><p>Under the Bill, it is proposed that the five positions will be filled through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.</p><p> When the board was established social partnership was in place.  The chair of the board, along with the two board members appointed via PAS, decide what skill set is needed.  It is for that reason they will have the flexibility to appoint or recommend an appointment of people with different skill sets.  </p><p> For the reasons I have outlined I ask the Deputy to withdraw his opposition to section 11.</p></speech>

We must be careful not to be overly prescriptive about these boards.  Sometimes we can get into the habit of saying there must a representative from "X" sector, "Y" sector, the voluntary sector, the business sector, the corporate sector and the regulatory sector and then, before one knows it, there are 20 people on a board and we start asking why the board is so big and suggesting that something be done to reduce its size.  One can become trapped in that mindset.</p> <p>  I am unfamiliar with the original composition of the board.  Deputy Quinlivan has said that ICTU and IBEC almost mark each other on the board.  I understand why IBEC would be on the board.  Part of the reason that we seek reform is to reduce the cost to business and make insurance more affordable.  </p></speech>

I can see the benefit of including representatives of the Irish Patients Association and there might be other associations.  It is not obvious to me why trade unions should be included.  Trade union members are not the only people who slip and fall coming out of a shop.  Maybe there is a particular focus on employee and employer injuries but I believe that the PIAB is far more wide reaching.  The inclusion of ICTU and IBEC strikes me as a hangover from the days of social partnership, which the Minister mentioned.  The inclusion of the social partners and every board going was in vogue when PIAB was originally established ten or 15 years ago.  The inclusion of ICTU and IBEC may no longer be appropriate but I am open to persuasion.  I remain unconvinced that we should continue with something just because we always did it like that.  Perhaps the board needs a different composition but I suggest that we do not make it too big or too prescriptive.  The Minister seemed to say that it is open to all parties and none to nominate people, and if they pass the test and get on the board then so be it.  Her suggestion has a lot of merit but I am open to persuasion about nominations.  I would like to understand the issue a bit more.</p></speech>

The board acts as an oversight for the agency and makes sure that it fulfils it functions.  The Central Bank operates both a regulatory function and consumer protection function, and brings experience of both aspects to the corporate governance of the board.  That is why we have the Central Bank on it.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission brings its financial management and information function to the corporate governance of the board, as well as its consumer welfare knowledge.  I believe it is important that the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission are designated because they bring that experience and aspect to the board.</p></speech>

This section seeks to give the Minister power to take the financial reserves of PIAB, which currently stands at &euro;19 million.  I oppose the change as PIAB has built up the reserve over years, since its establishment, by continually re-engineering efficient processes and fighting judicial reviews by vested interests.  This money was collected for the purpose of assessing injury claims, as provided for under legislation, and for no other purpose.  Perhaps the reserve should go back to the policyholders who paid it in either directly or through their insurance premiums, which has already happened to an extent.  For example, the fixed fee for an assessment has reduced from &euro;1,500 in 2004 to &euro;600 currently for respondents and their insurers.  In addition, the Exchequer has been repaid a loan of &euro;5 million for set-up costs.  PIAB has been very successful in being self-funding and the reserve gives the board a certain degree of independence.  I do not believe it would benefit PIAB if the reserves were taken.  It is for those reasons that we oppose section 13.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General recommended to the Department that the Department and the board agree an appropriate level of revenue reserves to be retained by PIAB and the basis for holding such a reserve.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also recommended the introduction of appropriate legislation to deal with excess funds held by PIAB.  Legal advice obtained by the Department is to the effect that legislative change is required to enable the board to remit excess moneys to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  The proposed amendment at section 13 of the Bill implements the recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It provides for a reserves policy for PIAB.  It also provides that PIAB shall remit to the Minister, for the benefit of the Exchequer, any moneys in excess of those authorised to be retained by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Bill specifically provides that the Minister will have regard to the operational, capital and contingency costs of PIAB when determining the sum to be retained.</p> <p>  In 2011, PIAB refunded its establishment costs of &euro;6.9 million to the Exchequer.  PIAB is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions and the Minister is not permitted in his or her executive function to interfere in any way with the day-to-day operations and functions of PIAB.</p><p>Section 74 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 provides a role for the Minister in the provision of funds to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  On the basis that this section implements a recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as I outlined, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his opposition to section 13.<font color="#FF0000"></font></p></speech>

I have not tabled an amendment but I would like to get some clarity.  While our concerns do not apply to the current Minister, a future Minister may not be as supportive of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board as the current Minister.  Similarly, a future Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may not be supportive of PIAB.  From my reading of the legislation it will be a matter for the Minister, in discussions with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, to decide what are appropriate funds for the running of PIAB, both to meet operational and capital costs.  I am aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General has made a report.  We certainly do not want to have millions of euro in public funds not being used in a fitting manner and there should be remittance to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  Who evaluates the cost of running PIAB and ensuring it can operate in a manner we hope it will operate?  I make this point in view of the fact that in the event of a downturn, public expenditure could be cut without any real evaluation being done of the impact such a cut would have on the capital investment PIAB requires to operate over a period of time.  Should we accept that there may be a role for some form of independent evaluation of the funding required annually for the purposes of running PIAB, both in current and capital costs?  Beyond this, there would then be a remittance to the Exchequer?</p> <p>  The summary account of a report by the Office for the Director of Corporate Enforcement discussed in the D&aacute;il today is a case in point.  We all know that the reason the office did not function was that it was starved of resources.  We need to have some independent evaluation as to what is required to run an entity.  Assuming always that the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform is the person responsible for public funds, it would be reasonable to provide for an independent evaluation to be carried out to determine how much funding PIAB would need to operate and the funding threshold below which the board would be unable to guarantee a service.</p> <p>  We may revisit this section on Report Stage to ascertain whether we can provide for an independent assessment that would determine how much funding would be needed to ensure PIAB can function, both in terms of current expenditure and capital investment requirements.</p></speech>

We may return to this section.  The reason I want PIAB to retain unspent money is to allow it to do other things.  We are talking of changing the book of quantum every three years and PIAB would require funding for this task.  As Deputy Kelleher said, a future Minister for Finance may decide not to provide the funding needed.  Fees have come down already in recent years and may reduce further.  The reason we want PIAB to retain unspent money is to help it work more efficiently.  I will withdraw my opposition to the section with the proviso that I may oppose it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Department and PIAB must agree an appropriate level of revenue reserves.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended this.  The funding it requires is also a matter for the PIAB board, which will establish what it needs.  This will be agreed with the Minister of the day.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which also audits PIAB, has made this recommendation.  That is why we are following through on it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.875" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018120400002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;139 million for 2018.  Primarily, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to fund the Christmas bonus for Vote 37 social assistance recipients.  The Christmas bonus will be paid this week.  For the first time in many years, it is being paid at 100%, which we all very much welcome.  It is being paid over the course of this week to approximately 1.2 million customers.  The bonus is a welcome contribution for people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments in the run-up to Christmas - because it finds its way into communities, local businesses and economies - and for families and individuals to allow them to prepare for the festive season, which is its overall aim.</p> <p>  The Christmas bonus is estimated to cost approximately &euro;266 million.  This cost is broken down into just over &euro;120 million for Vote 37 recipients and nearly &euro;146 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients.  The Social Insurance Fund is providing for the cost of the bonus being paid to people on contributory payments such as the State pension contributory, invalidity pension, and so on.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on this Supplementary Estimate application.  The Social Insurance Fund is in surplus this year.  In contrast, the bonus paid to people in receipt of payments from Voted schemes is met entirely by the Exchequer.  The bonus is not included in the original Estimates for the Department and, unless savings are made that will meet the entire cost, a Supplementary Estimate is required in order to ensure that the bonus will be paid.</p> <p>  The Chairman suggested at a previous meeting that it is difficult to compare like with like when comparing the original Estimate with the Supplementary Estimate because of the inclusion of the bonus in the outturn position for the relevant schemes.  For this reason, I have included an additional table, beginning at page 3 of the committee's brief, which shows the variance before the bonus is paid and the effect of the bonus on the outturn position.  I hope the committee finds this approach helpful.</p> <p>  The income from pay-related social insurance, PRSI, receipts during 2018 will result in a Social Insurance Fund income of an estimated &euro;10.6 billion.  This will be &euro;252 million or 2.4% ahead of profile for this year and will be &euro;793 million or 8.1% ahead of the position in 2017.  This position is a reflection of the continuing improvement in employment levels in the economy and continues the welcome trend that I presented to the committee here last year.</p> <p>  Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration, including payment of the Christmas bonus, is expected to cost approximately &euro;9.5 billion.</p><p>This is &euro;187.6 million, or 2% above profile, and &euro;145.5 million of this is due to the payment of that Christmas bonus.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus of the fund is still expected to be around &euro;1.1 billion at the end of 2018.  The accumulated surplus in the fund at the end of the year is estimated at &euro;2.32 billion.  While all of this is good news, and it is welcome to see the social insurance fund in such a healthy state, it is worth noting that the fund was also running a significant surplus of &euro;3.6 billion at the end of 2007, but that surplus was exhausted by 2010 when Exchequer subvention was again required because of the economic climate of the time.</p><p> The overall expenditure of the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2018 is expected to be &euro;20.33 billion and this will be &euro;320 million, or 1.6%, more than provided for in the original 2018 Revised Estimates.  As I mentioned earlier, &euro;266 million of this is due to payment of the Christmas bonus.  The total expenditure for the Department, which includes expenditure from the Vote and the social insurance fund, comprises overspends on some schemes and underspends on others.  For example, on the social insurance side there has been higher than anticipated expenditure on treatment benefits, which is very welcome, but lower than expected expenditure on invalidity pension.  On that Vote, there has been higher expenditure on administration and on illness and disability payments but lower expenditure on the working age employment supports.  When taken together, and excluding the Christmas bonus, the Department's expenditure on such schemes and services is expected to be &euro;54 million ahead of the profile, less than 0.3%.</p><p> The live register is expected to average at around 221,300 in 2018, a reduction of over 39,000 on the average for 2017.  Most of the estimated costs of paying the Christmas bonus of &euro;25 million to jobseekers is being offset by an underspend of over &euro;22 million in the jobseeker's allowance allocation.  The ongoing strong performance of the live register is evidence that growth is continuing and that more people are continuing to make the move into employment.  The live register is now well under 200,000, the first time it has been at that level in ten years and the CSO figures that came out this morning are welcome indeed.  We will continue to work with jobseekers to ensure they are adequately prepared to enter the workforce and can benefit from the recovering economy.</p><p> In 2018, the Supplementary Estimate referred to the committee and the briefings provided to committee members list the schemes for which additional sums are being sought, as well as some of our underspends.  We can go through the positions of individual schemes as required by members.  The amount of the Supplementary Estimate is derived by estimating the outturn across all voted schemes, which includes underspends on some schemes and overspends on others and adds in the cost of the Christmas bonus.  Nearly all the Department's expenditure is demand led and, as people apply for income supports when they meet particular circumstances such as ill health or unemployment or when they reach pension age, demographic trends, economic and societal changes and developments in the labour market all play a role in expenditure incurred by our Department.</p><p> Any estimate of expenditure for any scheme for the following year is published in December as part of our annualised Revised Estimates volume.  The individual Estimates are constructed on a scheme by scheme basis using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant information that is available at the time the Estimate is calculated.  It is appropriate to note that the outturn position of the Department in the absence of the payments of the Christmas bonus would be &euro;20.7 billion, or just 0.3% above our original Estimates.  In this regard, I am satisfied that the Estimates process is working well.  It takes account of all key trends and expenditure patterns and provides an accurate picture of the following year's expenditure.  Trends can and do, however, change over the course of a year, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than originally provided for.  The actual expenditure on most of our schemes can probably never be precisely predicted and the extent of an overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of a year when the outturn of the year has been confirmed.</p><p> I hope my opening statement, along with the briefing material which I sent over yesterday, provides the necessary information to the committee and supports the reasons given for the Supplementary Estimate.  I am happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

I will make two comments before opening up the discussion to members of the committee.  The changes the Minister made to the presentation on pages 3 and 4, showing the figures with the Christmas bonus stripped back, are very useful because they mean we can see exactly what is happening.</p><p>I thank the Minister for that.  It is also worth acknowledging the work of the staff in the Department who are tasked with preparing the Estimates.  As the Minister rightly said, the variance in terms of the output in comparison to the Estimates across most subheads is very small which means that somebody is doing a good job of work.  That being said, I am sure that colleagues will have issues and questions.  In general terms, in the global figures presented there is close correlation between the Estimates and the outturns.  Those working on the figure and the projections have been doing a good job.  </p><p> Deputy O'Dea is first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.879" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018120400002#D00200"><p>I reiterate what the Chairman has just said.  I also welcome the 100% return of the Christmas bonus, which is made possible by the lower payouts under the jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit schemes thanks to the increase in the number of people working.  However, that is offset to some extent by increases in payments of illness benefit and so on.  There seems to have been a marked increase in payments under the different disability and illness headings and while I know that all of these things are demand led, I would like the Minister to comment on that.</p><p>On page six of the briefing note there is a payment of &euro;21.3 million for agency services.  I ask the Minister to outline what exactly is involved there.  I note that under the exceptional and urgent needs payments category, the number of such payments is 16,000 over profile, which is a significant number.  While that has been provided for, it indicates that the Department seriously underestimated the demands on that particular fund.  On the other hand, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is around<b></b>5,000 below profile.  I appreciate and accept that there have been some changes to that scheme around rates and so on but does the Minister have any plans to change or relax the rules?  I have been contacted by a significant number of people who are just on the margin and who do not qualify for the allowance.  There are 3,000 fewer people availing of the school meals scheme and I ask the Minister to explain that.  Spending on community employment is slightly below profile.  I made the point to the Minister in the D&aacute;il last week during Question Time that the rules relating to community employment, CE, schemes should be relaxed.  I do not say that because I want people to spend 12 years on a CE scheme but because some people in their mid to late 50s find it hard to get work and it would be better for them to be doing something.  Furthermore, sometimes it is easier to get a job when one is actually doing something.  On T&uacute;s, I note that the decline in numbers has been reversed and the reason for that is that in most of those community type schemes, increasingly T&uacute;s members are replacing CE participants.  </p><p>Spending on rent supplement is down by &euro;9.5 million.  Does the Minister have any figures for the corresponding increase in spending on the housing assistance payment, HAP?  I know that the latter payment comes from a different Department but it would be useful to have that data to get the total picture in this area.  The back to education allowance payments are 579 over profile.  A report was prepared in recent years on the back to education allowance scheme which indicated that it was not working particularly well and that the results were not very impressive.  On carers, I note that the Minister can make more than &euro;13 million in savings due to the fact that there are 1,300 fewer people qualifying for the carer's allowance.  The figure for the carer's support grant is approximately &euro;2,500, which is surprisingly high.  All of the statistics show that the number of carers in Ireland is gradually increasing.  What I detect from these figures is that because of the rules, a bigger percentage of people who are actually caring are not entitled to the carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  Certain changes have been recommended by the various organisations representing carers that would make quite a significant impact and introduce much needed flexibility into those schemes.  </p><p>The back to work family dividend payments are 541 below profile.  The working family payment, previously known as family income supplement, FIS, is just short of 3,000 below profile.  There were suggestions that a lot of people were not aware of their entitlement to FIS.</p><p>Has any action been taken by the Department to increase awareness of this scheme?</p><p> On illness benefit, I refer to the figures for disability allowance in particular.  Disability allowance is nearly &euro;2.4 million above what was anticipated.  Is there a proposal to employ additional medical assessors in the Department?  If so, how many and at what level and salary scale will they be employed?</p><p> I take it that the increase in treatment benefits is due to the extension of the benefit to those who are self employed.</p><p> On pensions, I noticed that the figure for non-contributory pensions is only up 3%, even taking the actual increase into account and it is something similar for contributory pensions.  Does the Minister have any actual figures on the extra number of pensioners we had to pay over and above last year and over and above the previous year?</p><p> Has the Minister studied the recent Supreme Court decision on pension entitlements for somebody who is incarcerated and what are the implications of that decision for the system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.881" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018120400002#E00200"><p>I welcome the Christmas bonus payout of &euro;266 million to 1.2 million needy people.  It has to be warmly welcomed.  It also has to be welcomed from the point of view of the injection of money it brings to local economies because I said it at a previous committee meeting - probably last year's Estimates - how important the Christmas bonus is for individuals and for the local economy because very few, if any of those people will be heading abroad to spend that money.  Every penny of that money will go directly into the local economy.  It is an invaluable injection into businesses and retailers at this time of year.</p> <p>  On the figures and community employment, CE, under heading A12, there is a massive underspend of &euro;7.2 million in 2018.  I went online today and I saw that there are 1,678 vacancies for CE places across the State.  I have said before that this is a serious problem and I will say it again.  I ask the Minister what her views are on why there are so many vacancies on CE schemes across the board.</p> <p>  On heading A31, which is the working family payment, again there is a really large fall in the spending for this.  Could the Minister give additional information on why exactly that is the case?  Has there been a fall in applications or has there been a serious change in people's circumstances which means that they are no longer entitled to the working family payment?  It would be useful if we could get that information.  I appreciate that the Minister might not have all of the information to hand today but it would be useful.</p> <p>  I refer to heading A32, which is on the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  Again, there is a fall in the number of recipients and the money being paid out for this allowance.  Given the increasing cost of sending a child back to school which is only going up, does the Minister have the actual number of applications that were refused to hand?  I know we have the numbers that were granted and I know that many people do apply and there are many criteria that have to be met.  Does the Minister have the exact figures for how many people have been refused?</p> <p>  I raised it with the Minister that there were a lot of delays in people getting payouts and I know she said that it was because people applied late but that is not the full reason there were late payments.</p><p>People were getting payouts in September and October when kids were long back at school.  There are problems there.  </p><p> The underspend on school meals is a little strange.  The Minister said it is due to a lower uptake from schools.  Is there an explanation for that?  Has she considered that?  Is there a reason schools are not drawing this money down?  It is badly needed and if there is a reason, that needs to be examined.  Will the Minister elaborate on that a bit? </p><p> Under subhead A2, administration non-pay, there is a sum of &euro;4.2 million for "Office Equipment and External IT Services".  Over the past few months, there have been major difficulties with the payout of illness benefit for many thousands of people and it transpired that there were problems with the IT system being rolled out by consultants.  Was some of that money for the roll-out of that system supposed to be for illness benefit or where are those figures to be found?  There are issues in this regard and the Minister said they related to the IT system.  Has that money been paid to consultants for the roll-out of that system, which caused massive difficulties for many people? </p><p> There is a reduction in the amount for rent supplement, which is understandable because people are being moved onto HAP.  That falls under a different Department but the intention is to ultimately move everyone off rent supplement onto HAP.  Is there a timeframe for that?  How many people have transferred from rent supplement to HAP?  There are difficulties with some landlords who refuse to sign the HAP lease.  That is putting people in serious difficulty because their rent supplement payment is being cut.  Claimants are being told their landlord has no choice, he has to sign HAP or the rent supplement will be cut.  Could the Minister give an overview of that?  There are concerns that there are higher standards for HAP, which is brilliant because a minority of landlords have been getting away with blue murder in respect of the conditions they have been providing through rent supplement.  Much of that goes back to local authorities that failed to carry out inspections.  Landlords do not want to go to the additional cost of having to carry out refurbishment and upgrade works to meet the HAP criteria.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could outline the figures in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.883" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018120400002#F00200"><p>The Christmas bonus is welcome.  People have been struggling in recent years and it is a significant boost to their income at this time of the year.  It will be welcomed by millions of people in the State.  It is great that it has been reinstated in full.  We know that many thousands of people are caring for parents or siblings in the home and the Minister referred to the "lower number of recipients than estimated - 1,294 lower than profiled".  The carer's allowance by its nature is difficult to get.</p><p>There is no information on how to go about making an application for the allowance.  Many people are refused and they appeal but that takes time.  I have a case where a claimant was awarded carer's allowance in September but, two months later, they have still not been paid.  It will be backdated but the system is slow.  I would have expected many more people to have applied for the allowance.  Is there any reason it has not happened?  Perhaps the application process should be examined.</p><p> It is disappointing that more schools do not have access to school meals.  The Minister stated that the lower take-up by schools in the 2018 budget is due to applications on hand that may not be processed by year end and to applications yet to be received.  Is the Department expecting many more applications?  Have the Estimates taken into account the possibility of more people applying?</p></speech>

It is significant that this is the first time in ten years that a 100% Christmas bonus payment will be made.  It will be made this week and that is welcome for the people who receive it.</p> <p>  There was higher than anticipated expenditure on treatment benefit, which is probably good news because it means a big take-up of the scheme.  Has the Department examined the numbers involved?  Deputy O'Dea asked if it was down to the self-employed taking up their entitlement.  Does the Minister foresee a greater take-up in the coming years?</p> <p>  It is welcome that the live register continues to fall, with 39,000 fewer people on it this year.  What figures are anticipated for the coming year?  Is the figure expected to reduce further as more people return to work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-04a.886" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2018120400002#G00300"><p>I welcome the 100% Christmas bonus.  Last week, the papers reported that retail spending would increase this Christmas.  People are dependent on social welfare payments.  It is not that they get wealthy from them but they help keep people out of debt and away from moneylenders.  It also gives them the opportunity to have a decent Christmas.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea's contribution was comprehensive and he went through most of the subheads so I will not add to that.  However, there are two figures in subhead A2, administration non-pay, which I would like the Minister to explain.  One is payments for agency services at an additional &euro;21.3 million.  That is a lot of money.  What was the original Estimate and what additionality did the Department get for the &euro;21.3 million?  Under the same subhead, there are allocations for training and development and incidental expenses.  There were savings of &euro;6 million under training and development   What had the Department intended to do and what training programmes were forgone to make that saving?  It is also a substantial figure.</p> <p>  Members referred to savings in the carer's allowance.  More and more people are presenting at our clinics seeking supports for caring for somebody, though I do not suggest everybody is eligible for the allowance.  However, while many of the target Estimates have been good, there has been a saving in this area and the figure is lower than the profile figure.</p><p>Could any of that be attributed to the time it takes to process those applications rather than the number of applicants?  Carer's allowance can take quite a period to be processed.  Rather than saying there are fewer people on it, are the savings more attributable to other factors?  The Minister knows what I am getting at and I ask her to comment on that.</p><p> As an example, the working family payment was lower than expected with 2,800 fewer people on it.  There was also a smaller number in receipt of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  This is a bugbear of mine.  Does the Minister future-proof existing schemes when she is doing her Estimates and budgets?  Are people falling out of some of the schemes from an eligibility point of view based on increases they might have received from the Minister or tax increases or whatever else?  Does the Department use future-proofing?  In our clinics we do not notice a significant reduction in people who are looking to join such schemes.  When the Minister increases social welfare payments, are people falling through the cracks?</p></speech>

I have one further question.  This is a small point but it is interesting.  I refer to subhead A40, the grant to the Citizens Information Board, CIB, which made a small saving.  Despite the rationalisation, the budget year-on-year for 2018 versus 2017 is still up a couple of million euro.  Are there any efficiencies to be generated given that the Minister is no longer servicing 90 or so boards?  However, the savings are in areas where we might have expected to see pressure for increased spending.  There was an underspend of &euro;400,000 on the mortgage arrears services being provided by the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  Another &euro;100,000 was saved on Abhaile staff.  The figures are not significant, but at a time people are having difficulties in this area, I am concerned whether those organisations have evolved quickly enough to meet the existing demand.</p></speech>

The first point relates to the step-up effect.  There is a bit of work to be done with regard to some other Departments in terms of changes that are made in the budget and the impacts of those changes.  In the main, there were increases.  If payments under any scheme increase by &euro;5 or &euro;3.20 or whatever it happens to be, then the qualifying conditions have to be cognisant of that.  One cannot suddenly no longer get access to a back to school allowance just because an increase has been provided.  That is called the step-up effect and that is reflected in the legislation.  Everything gets stepped up in line with the increases provided by the Department.  However, that is not true of some other Departments.  The Chairman and I have had conversations about medical cards and Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and a body of work needs to be done in that regard, in particular in terms of positive changes that can be made to welfare payments.</p> <p>  One of the reasons the CIB's budget has increased is it has been asked to provide additional services.  One of the Chairman's party colleagues was responsible for increasing the services provided to the deaf community.  I put in a few million euro more to ensure the CIB could through its funding streams give money to the organisations that provide additional signing services and additional access to information, and to increase the availability of the service on a daily basis to people in the deaf community.  That is very welcome.  I accept that there are some reductions in the anticipated spend on the CIB and it is because there is genuinely not the same requirement for them that we anticipated.  One can reflect on that and conclude that, thankfully, the number of people in long-term arrears on their mortgages are reducing.  That means we must now change and reflect the services to suit the needs of the people.  One of the changes that has been made in the past year is that to provide mentors to attend court sittings with people.  That is  positive and has been well received and we might further roll out that service.  Some of the Abhaile services and the work with PIPs in the community have not entirely fulfilled some people's expectations of getting a deal and providing them with a long-term route to deal with their longer-term debt.</p><p>It might be time to consider putting in place some internal performance improvement plans, PIPs, in that service to ensure they do not have to use vouchers, but the Chairman is right.  Some of the underspend is due to the fact that the number of people accessing the services is reducing.  It is time to examine those services and make small changes and tweaks so that we can help the people equally as well as we have done in recent years.</p><p> I will come back to the training shortly.  </p><p> On the administration, the original Estimate for 2018 was &euro;119,820,000.  The actual Estimate is &euro;141,141,000, so it is an increase of &euro;21,321,000.  That is to pay our agents who carry out the work on behalf of the Department.  To give some examples of that, An Post is paid for making scheme payments to customers and, thankfully, that is up this year.  I believe we are the largest customer and user of An Post, and long may that last, and its services with us have increased this year, which is very welcome.  Doctors are paid for certifying illness in respect of illness benefits and that figure is up this year, notwithstanding the difficulties we experienced.  They did not come from the certificates but there is an actual increase in the number of people making applications for illness benefit this year and therefore the doctors have to be paid.  I have the figures now if they are any good to the Chairman.</p></speech>

The figure for JobPath was estimated at &euro;48,800,000, and the Revised Supplementary Estimate is &euro;71,698,000, which is the increase of &euro;22,895,000.  Therein lies the increase in that one.  We probably did not anticipate JobPath being as successful as it has been in the past year.  If the Chairman looks at our job figures, which were only released by the CSO this morning, he will see they are down significantly year on year than we would have anticipated.  That is reflected in the number of people who are getting work using our JobPath programme.</p></speech>

It reflects the success of that particular programme.</p> <p>  The training programme was estimated at &euro;17.5 million and it came in at &euro;11.4 million, which is an underspend of &euro;6 million.  Approximately 40% of the savings under this subhead relate to the Department's contingency fund.  This fund is reserved for unforeseen circumstances.  We did not have any unforeseen circumstances to be able to draw down that money this year.</p></speech>

The primary savings related to bank charges, which was &euro;2.8 million.  I am not sure why bank charges are under the training subhead.  I am informed it is the training and incidental figure.</p> <p>  The Department also incurred savings in other areas including training in customer communications and advertising, PeoplePoint charges and the higher of rooms charges.  It is difficult to extend those subheads with 100% or even 99% accuracy.</p> <p>  Training savings of &euro;665,000 were incurred in this particular area.  That was primarily as a result of lower costs than were initially anticipated.  We got our training courses last year for less than what we thought we would have to pay.</p> <p>  With regard to additional information on learning and development, savings were incurred.  The Department has provided extensive training for all our staff in 2018.  To date, there have been 13,416 staff attendances at instructor-led classroom training, and 2,678 staff received this training in 2018.  There have been 2,447 e-learning modules and front-line serving training areas were completed in 2018.  Other internally delivered staff training outside the scope of these programmes was provided to 2,796 staff and another 1,799 staff received an externally delivered training programme.  The Department arranges approximately 100 one day learning courses across a range of subjects, and those are available to all our staff.  Those are the training and administration figures.</p> <p>  Deputy Joan Collins raised the issue of school meals, as did the other two Deputies.  Most, if not all, of our schemes are demand led.  We can put out an offer, as we did in this year's budget, to extend a hot school meals pilot scheme, which we hope to take on board at the beginning of next year, but we cannot make schools take up that offer.</p><p>A significant amount of additional money was provided, at a sitting of this committee at which I was present in October or November 2017, for the year 2018 but there was not the level of uptake that we expected for which there is a variety of reasons.  I would not have viewed the matter in the same way as the Deputy concerned who sounded  frustrated and wondered why schools would not avail of such a good scheme.  </p><p> We had an issue with one particular area.  I refer to instances where school meals were distributed by staff or volunteers who were over and above the staff in the school.  In the past year something happened to the provision of those staff members so schools could no longer deliver the school meals programme.  Thankfully, we have resolved the issue but it would have meant the non-delivery of school meals for a number of months in a small cluster of schools.  There are other schools where the staff are not available in the schools to take in meals and distribute them on a daily basis over and above the normal day-to-day running of the schools.  Again, we are trying to work with individual schools to break down whatever barriers exist that prevent schools from availing of the programme.  When we added the extra money last year, it was probably before we addressed the matter and we added people to the list thinking nobody would say "No".  Some schools have different issues.  We have to break down those barriers school by school because the barriers are not the same in each school.  Again, we are working with people.</p><p> Let me give the example of a school that has difficulties with the items listed on the school meals programme as suggested by Healthy Ireland in its health eating guidelines.  The school is a special needs school.  Some of the children will not eat what is listed on the school meals programme and, therefore, pulled out of the school.  We worked with the school and decided that we needed to be more flexible about recommendations.  We brought in a nutritionist and considered what should be provided to the children to ensure that we can continue to deliver.  Reasons vary in schools.  We have an incredible division located in Sligo that looks after the scheme and they are very proactive.  If there are issues, we visit the schools and work with them to make sure that we break down the issues, where we can, and bridge any gaps.  We are intent on ensuring that the school meals programme is fully up to spend.  We will also add the hot school meals pilot programme next year.  Please God it will go well and we can add another string to our bow in terms of school meals.  </p><p> In terms of the carers' allowance, there has not been a decrease in the number of people applying for the allowance.  I know it probably looks like there was a decrease.  Last year, we anticipated that more people would apply than applied because there had been an increase year-on-year.  For example, at the end of last October as many as 17,406 applications had been received and we received 20,852 last year.</p><p> There is a new carers' form planned.  Deputy Joan Collins suggested that it is a very difficult scheme to apply for and the Chairman suggested that one of the reasons for a reduction in the number of applicants is due to the process taking so long to complete.  My answer is no as the process took equally as long the year before and the year before that, unfortunately.  As a result we have worked very closely with the Carers' Association of Ireland in the past year and come up with a new application form.  As Deputy O'Dea will be aware, particularly with our work with the domiciliary care allowance and DCA Warriors in the past number of years, we have similar issues because it is a very similar scheme.  Obviously, one scheme is for adults while the other scheme is for children.  It was a difficult application to navigate and we did great work with the DCA Warriors.  The organisation and the parents helped us enormously to make the application a much simpler process.  We have done exactly the same work with the Carers' Association of Ireland and we will release a new form at the beginning of next year.  I hope that the new form will mean that far more people will be successful with their first application.  </p><p> To answer the question posed by Deputy O'Dea, we have a new recruitment campaign for medical assessors planned for January.  It is not just to extend the service.  A  number of medical assessors left over the course of the year and we got new replacements this year.  The new recruitment campaign will help us to continue and extend that employment recruitment drive.  We want to make sure that the application is as easy as possible and people give us all of the information.  The reason it takes a while to process applications is not that the qualifying, from a condition perspective, is onerous.  One must meet the conditions outlined in the means test, which are relatively simple.  Out of all of the schemes, they would have the highest conditions to reach.  One's income threshold and all of that kind of stuff on the carers' allowance would be much higher than some of our other schemes.  Due to the fact that people need to be medically assessed and the bar for a full and half carer's allowance - the threshold of the care that has been given has to be fully detailed and examined by medical assessors, which takes a little bit of time.</p><p>We all accept that it has taken too long, but I hope the new application form and the employment of additional medical assessors next year will bring a drastic reduction in the numbers.  I believe, and management share my view, that there is a need for more staff in that area, and we are awaiting staff arising from efficiencies in other areas to move into this area.  It will then benefit from a double whammy of getting the attention and new initiatives it deserves.  The annualised figures for the number of carers at the end of October 2018 were 78,681 an increase from 74,881 in the same period the year before.  The rate of increase has slowed down.</p><p> Deputy Carey raised the issue of treatment benefits.  We increased the allocation for treatment benefits this year and allowed both the self-employed and employees to claim under this scheme.  We expected the uptake to increase, but never to the level received.  This is good, as it means that people perceive this scheme as a genuine benefit.  When people think about their social insurance contribution, all they think about is the pension that comes when they reach 66 years, which in their case is donkey's years away.  We wish to instill the value of the social insurance contribution and treatment benefits are one clear way that resonates with the people and there has been a significant increase in the number of applications this year.</p><p> Deputies Brady and O'Dea raised the issue of the CE scheme.  There are 1,600 and odd vacancies on this programme.  The scheme is entirely different from T&uacute;s, the community work placement initiative.  Under T&uacute;s, the employment official in consultation with the unemployed person and with his or her co-operation send him or her on a T&uacute;s scheme whereas under the CE scheme, one has to apply for a place on the scheme.  People on the live register visit the Intreo office on a weekly basis and they choose to apply for the CE opportunities.</p><p> The number of people applying for places on a CE scheme is reducing for two reasons.  First, there are fewer people on the live register than there used to be so fewer people are available to apply for the scheme in the first instance.  Based on the contributions of the members who were of the view that JobPath was hampering people in applying for CE places, we allowed anybody who was on JobPath this summer to do both.  That has not resulted in a significant increase in the number of people applying for the CE programme from this summer.  The only factor I can put my finger on is that because there are jobs in the community, people are looking for full-time employment as opposed to work experience.  We work with all of our CE sponsor schemes which do tremendous work on a monthly basis and we try to improve their access to people and help them to advertise their positions</p><p>.  As unemployment numbers reduce, the number of positions on CE schemes should reduce by a percentage in line with the reduction in the live register because the CE programme is purely an activation model.  I do not subscribe to the fact that it is an activation model because a raft of people on community programmes are not there just to be trained to move on to the next job as they see what they do as a fulfilling and worthwhile activity.  Members share my view that this work is of significant value to our communities.  We need to reflect on that and change how it is viewed.  Sometimes it is more than just a work experience or training opportunity for people but the reasons the numbers are falling is that the unemployment figures are reducing and it is reflected in that.  The falling numbers is not due to anything we are doing differently in the Department, as the scheme is entirely demand-led.  The places are available because of the reflected numbers that we expected to be on the live register this year.  That number will reduce next year as the number on the live register comes down again.  Nobody is preventing anybody from applying for a place on a CE scheme anymore.  Anybody who is on the live register can apply to be on a scheme.  They are choosing not to and we will reflect on that.</p><p> The working family and the back to school allowance payments are demand-led schemes.  People are benefitting from the fact that the economy is recovering.</p><p>This relates to the back to school allowance as well.  Nothing has changed.  I view the changes in the back to school allowance and the working family payment as positive for those who receive these payments.  We introduced a disregard into the working family payment.  People who rely entirely on the working family payment to top up their incomes now have a weekly disregard for their rent payments.  Back to school payments for next year were increased significantly in the budget.  I know we have not finalised that yet.  Deputy O'Dea is right when he says that this increase reflects the fact that the cost of going to school is increasing.<br/><br/>The number of people who are accessing both of these schemes is a reflection of the fact that the economy is recovering.  Many people are moving into full-time employment at a level where they do not reach the means test, do not need the working family payment or do not qualify for the back to school allowance anymore.  The number of new applications for the working family payment received so far this year - the figure was 23,803 at the end of October - is relatively similar to last year's number.  I have mentioned the introduction of the disregard.  It is a good thing that the numbers are slowly decreasing.  It is not something to be worried about.  As I have said, this will always be a demand-led scheme.  I want to be able to allow people who are currently on the scheme to earn more and to take home more of the money they are actually earning.  I hope this will incentivise and encourage them to earn more and keep more of their own money.  The scheme will always be led by demand.  If there is an increase in the need for the scheme next year, we will respond to that.<br/><br/>I have spoken about school meals.  I will come back to illness benefit in a second.  Deputy Brady mentioned the overspend of &euro;4.2 million under the heading of Office Equipment and External IT Services.  Our list of ongoing schemes is continuing to grow.  Every time I introduce a new scheme, I have to get into the queue to get an entirely new platform developed.  Thankfully, we are introducing new schemes.  We introduced the paid parental leave and the self-employed jobseeker's schemes this year.  These brand new schemes need brand new IT platforms.  We are investing in our online digital services.  We are about to go live with <i>mywelfare.ie</i>, which is a new and hugely positive method of interacting with the Department.  It is so user-friendly that even I am totally impressed by it.  This new system is incredibly easy to use.  We have 6,000 staff and 70 schemes.  This means that our IT platforms are constantly being upgraded and new systems are constantly coming on board.  The only difficulty we have as a society, a country or an economy at the moment is that there are so few software developers on the Government procurement list.  They are all busy.  They are already doing stuff for all the other Departments.  This will probably slow down our ability to deliver on some of the new schemes we would like to deliver on.  It is possibly something that needs to be looked at.  That accounts for the &euro;4.2 million overspend.<br/><br/>I think Deputy Brady is under the impression that there is a programme to move people off rent supplement and onto HAP.  I say that because I am making an assumption.  I hope I am wrong.  No one in the Department is working off a list with a target of getting 100 people off rent supplement.  Rent supplement is a short-term measure to bridge a gap in the housing need of a family or couple.  The State has to make sure it provides long-term sustainable solutions for people.  Ideally, we would like to see people not being on rent supplement for any more than about a year.  That has not been the reality in recent years because we have given people rent supplement for more than 12 months.  It was always intended to be a short-term stop for people as they come in and out of need.  Over recent years, HAP has been introduced, there has been a move away from RAS and a long-term requirement for HAP leases to be five or ten years has been introduced.  As a result, people have moved gradually from rent supplement to HAP.  There is no agenda of getting officials to hurry through a list of 10,000 people.  It will happen as people come.  Therefore, I am disappointed to hear from the Deputy that people are being told they will lose their RAS if they do not take up HAP.  It is definitely not coming from the Department.  People will get RAS for as long as they need it.  Rent supplement is provided because there is a need for it.  When somebody moves onto HAP or into a social house, or wins the lotto and buys his or her own house, he or she will come off rent supplement because it is no longer required.  Nobody is actively pushing people off rent supplement.  All of our schemes are led by demand.  If someone has a need and the conditions apply to him or her, he or she will get what comes from the Department.  There is nobody telling that person that he or she should or should not be here.</p><p>I have just been given the figures.  At the end of October, we had 25,654 people on rent supplement, 19,196 people on RAS through the local authorities and 41,693 people on HAP.  I might be wrong, but I think the Deputy is asking how many people came off rent supplement and went onto HAP.  Is that what he is asking?</p></speech>

We have a new interactive platform for engaging with our clients, customers or citizens.  There is a conversation that I would love to have around this table one day.  I am going off script slightly at the moment, not that I have a script.  I am going off on a tangent.  Every time we announce something, we get a barrage of responses from people asking why we have a &quot;customer&quot; charter.  We decided to draw up the charter a number of years ago because we wanted to provide the most excellent level of customer service.  That irks people because they are not really customers.  Then we called them &quot;clients&quot;, but they are not really clients.  We cannot call them &quot;citizens&quot; because we look after many people who are not citizens.  I am not sure what the correct language is.  Someone told me one day that I should just call them &quot;people&quot;, but sometimes that does not quite fit into what I am talking about.  I would love some advice on this.  The last thing we want to do is to upset somebody by saying &quot;citizens&quot; when we look after people who are not citizens or by saying &quot;customers&quot; when they are not really customers.  If I could get some advice on this issue, that would be deadly.  Similarly, it was noted this week that some people do not like the idea of us calling the Christmas bonus a &quot;Christmas&quot; bonus.  It was suggested that we should think about calling it something else.  We are all gone very politically correct lately.</p><p>We are making people aware of the new <i>mygovid.ie</i>and <i>mywelfare.ie</i>platforms, which are very interactive.  All of our people in the Intreo offices and all of our front-line staff are well aware of the conditions around FIS.  The idea behind FIS when it was introduced a number of years ago was to try to encourage people who depend entirely on welfare to go out, take a chance and try to do work.  We were trying to give them comfort that they would not lose the supports they previously enjoyed.  We are trying to make sure the transition period is well supported by the Departments of Health and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That is what is there.  We are consistently trying to help people to get into employment.  We are certainly not shy about telling people that FIS is there.  The new &euro;95 disregard for rent payments will certainly be well advertised in all of our offices next year.  It is not something that we are keeping secret.  I genuinely believe that it is because people's fortunes are improving that these schemes are not required anymore.</p><p>I have covered the issues of community employment, school meals, back to school payments and agencies.</p><p>I have not yet responded to Deputy O'Dea's question about the court ruling during the week which deemed that our withholding of contributory pension payments to a particular gentleman under section 249 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 was unconstitutional.  The report from the court is very lengthy.  We are probably still assimilating it without jumping to any conclusions.  I know what my gut is telling me to do, but obviously I have to get some advice before I can do that.  The Attorney General has the report.  I expect to have a meeting before the end of this week, or early next week, at which a final decision can be made.  The Deputy is well aware that this is not something that can be put on the long finger.  We need to decide soon whether we are going to appeal or make alternative arrangements.  I will be looking for the co-operation of all parties in the House when the time comes to rectify the position we currently find ourselves in.  Even if it is not of our making - I hope it is not - it is not very satisfactory.</p><p>The final point I would like to make in response to Deputy O'Dea relates to pensions.  He was looking for the actual numbers for the year-on-year increases.  This year, an additional 17,300 people are receiving the contributory State pension, an additional 500 people are receiving the contributory widow's pension and an additional 130 people are receiving the non-contributory State pension.</p><p>The total pensions additional this year are 17,930.</p></speech>

That went among those JobPath companies to administer the scheme.  Is it because they dealt with more people or did they retain people in employment for longer?  It is a phased payment but it strikes me, from the point of view of doing an Estimate, that if &euro;48 million is estimated and the outcome is nearly &euro;72 million, that is a substantial difference.  Something happened that was not predicted, which may not have been bad, but that is what I am trying to get to because it is a significant figure.</p></speech>

Not only are more people staying in work longer, but they have the capacity to take more people as well.  The schemes with both of these organisations are entirely demand led so they only get paid when there are successful outcomes.  They do not get paid just for showing up to work, they have to take people, work with them and then they get approximately &euro;300 for working with people for the year.</p></speech>

That is what they get for working with somebody but then the bonus payments obviously kick in when somebody gets a full-time job for 13 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks.  That increase is purely down to the success of the project so maybe we should have been more ambitious when we made our Estimates last year that they would be more successful.  Also, that is reflected in the fact that the live register numbers are lower than we would have expected and there are 13,000 to 14,000 more people working than I would have expected at this time last year.  It is all based on positive outcomes because people are getting jobs and the two agencies that we have employed to help us get people jobs are doing a great job.</p></speech>

The econometric analysis is being finalised and I hope to have it in January but the preliminary findings are looking good and that is the report, alongside the position on our projected targets, that will determine what we will need going forward.  I do not know right now what the needs of those 127,000 people who are full-time unemployed, as announced this morning by the CSO, are going to be in a number of years but we will have to devise schemes to make sure that they are as successful as JobPath has been for us in recent years, but that might change.</p> <p>  Any changes in that route will come from the econometric review that we have done on JobPath but the Deputy is aware that I have also commissioned an Indecon report on the review into LESN's and our jobs clubs.  I am currently assessing that and I only started reading it last week.  All of that will feed into the State's service and provision of activation for some 86,000 people who are unfortunately long-term unemployed and the entire 127,000 people who are full-time unemployed.</p><p>If the figures on the unemployed and underemployed are looked at, there are 197,000 people, so there is still a big body of work to be done.  I know that we constantly say that when we get to the magic number of 4% we will have reached full employment, as if we should nearly give up, say that is grand and the job is oxo, but there are 197,000 people in this country who are unemployed or underemployed and we will not stop trying to help them get full-time employment until they do.  We have a lot of work to do and there are big decisions to be made next year, but it is to be hoped members will play a role in those decisions next year.</p></speech>

Is it next month or in two months?</p> <p>  I refer to the housing assistance payment, HAP.  I am surprised that the Minister is saying that there is no drive to get people off rent supplement onto HAP because that is not the case in Wicklow.  The county council is actively writing out to people in receipt of rent supplement telling them that they have to talk to their landlord and that their landlord has to sign up to the HAP payment or otherwise it will impact on their rent supplement payment-----</p></speech>

We know people are referred over from Intreo.</p><p>Some of the massive increase from &euro;48.8 million to &euro;71.69 million might be those sustainment payments.  Something else happened during that period in 2018.  Was there renegotiation around the contract with Turas Nua and Seetec to see an increase in numbers being referred over?  </p></speech>

The figures are alarming, to say the least.  This scheme has been in place for three years.  I do not buy what the Minister is saying so it would be useful to get an up-to-date picture on all of those figures.</p></speech>

Turas Nua and Seetec get paid on outputs.  When they have a successful outcome, they get paid the extra bonus money for that successful outcome.  The numbers we shared last week were never hidden beforehand.  Commercial sensitivity relating to the State being able to ensure it gets good value for money does not necessarily mean that we bare all.  Everybody knowing exactly what everyone else is getting paid does not do the State any service.  What we can clearly see-----</p></speech>

What it does show clearly is that,  for the hundreds of thousands of people who have had the experience of going through it, a very large percentage - an enormously successful percentage - with the exception of JobBridge,  which people in Deputy Brady's party did not appreciate for a number of years, it has been the most successful activation programme we have ever run in the State.  I know the Deputy does not like it and that is fine but it affects tens of thousands of people who have got jobs because of the interaction, assistance and help from the great staff in Turas Nua and Seetec, who are all Irish people by the way in case there is an ideological difficulty there.  They are Irish people helping Irish people to get work and they are succeeding, which is great.  It is wonderful to see the extra money that is being paid to those companies because it means they are actually being effective, which is what we want to see.  If the Deputy does not want to take my word for it, the live register and CSO figures were issued this morning and they are going down.  The reason they are going down is because our activation methods are working.</p></speech>
