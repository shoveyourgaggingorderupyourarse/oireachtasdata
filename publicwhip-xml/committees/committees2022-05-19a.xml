Apologies have been received from Deputies Matt Carthy and Sean Sherlock who are engaged in other parliamentary duties.  Please note that to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, be respectful of other people's physical space and adhere to any other public health advice.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit, from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to examine the following matters: the 2020 appropriation accounts for Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances; Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement; and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  Also, from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2020 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services, we will look at Chapter 4 - Vote accounting and budget management.</p> <p>  The Department has been advised that the committee may also wish to examine the following matters: the format and content of the appropriation accounts; public private partnerships; the Benefacts database; and the Department's role in the recruitment process for the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department: Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General, Ms Mary O'Donohue, director, Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, Mr. David Feeney, principal officer, corporate office, Mr. John Pender, principal officer, work and pensions division, and Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer, expenditure policy division.</p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As such witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits or objective of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022051900002#A01100"><p>As members are aware, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the Accounting Office for a number of Votes, reflecting the diverse responsibility of the Department for the development and administration of a number of key cross-departmental functions in specialised and technical areas.  Separate to the accountability that the Vote-holding entails, and arising from its statutory responsibility in relation to central control and oversight of public spending, the Department sets the general accounting policies for all appropriation accounts, and issues binding directions around public financial management and procedures, and the corporate governance of public bodies.</p> <p>  I am happy to report that I issued clear audit opinions in relation to each of the appropriation accounts for 2020 being considered this morning.</p> <p>  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, records gross expenditure of almost &euro;42 million.  This spending was divided between two spending programmes, which were broadly similar in scale and which comprise the core administration activity of the Department.  At the end of 2020, the Department had a surplus of &euro;4.2 million relative to its budget and this amount was surrendered.</p> <p>  Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances is used to pay pensions, primarily to retired civil servants across all Departments and offices, and to retired prison officers.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged, directly or indirectly, to other Votes, including those for education, health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions, and to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.</p> <p>  The gross spend on Vote 12 in 2020 amounted to &euro;628 million.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;366 million in 2020.  The receipts into the Vote were significantly ahead of the level forecast.  Mainly because of this, the net outturn on the Vote for 2020 was a surplus of &euro;113 million, which was for surrender at the year end.  A similar level of surrender of surplus occurred in 2019.</p> <p>  The Office of Government Procurement, which is often referred to as OGP, carries out specialised functions in relation to the procurement of goods and services by public bodies in Ireland.  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement records gross expenditure of &euro;16.5 million.  The surplus for surrender at the end of 2020 amounted to &euro;2.3 million.</p> <p>  Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer was established as a new vote in 2020, having previously been a programme within Vote 11.  As a result, the appropriation account appears without comparator prior-year figures.  Like the OGP, the office remains legally part of the Department.  The office provides an ICT shared service to a number of Departments and offices, which includes the provision of managed desktop services, including telephone, email and productivity applications.  The office also provides Government cloud and Government network services, including application hosting, and voice, video and data services across the public service.  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 43 records gross expenditure of &euro;21.4 million.</p> <p>  Chapter 4 on Vote accounting and budget management is a recurrent annual report which aggregates and summarises the results of all appropriation accounts.  I publish this report because there is no other source of aggregated appropriation account information.</p> <p>  There has been a strong upward trend in voted expenditure in recent years, with an even greater increase in 2020 as a result of additional expenditure requirements due to the Covid-19 pandemic.   The total gross expenditure for all 45 Votes in 2020 was &euro;70.1 billion.  After the deduction of receipts retained in Votes totalling &euro;2.8 billion, net voted expenditure for the year was &euro;67.3 billion.</p></speech>

He has five minutes in which to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022051900002#B00100"><p>I thank the Chairman.  My prepared statement is probably a little longer than five minutes but I will try to keep it to that, maybe by taking some of it as read, with the Chair's permission.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, there are four Votes under my Department, namely, those of the office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, superannuation and retirement allowances, the OGP and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  I understand that the committee has expressed an interest in examining the format and content of the appropriation accounts, public private partnerships, PPP, and the Benefacts database.  With the Chair's permission, I will not go through the detail of the Votes, which is set out in the opening statement I have submitted.  There are some surpluses to return to the Exchequer, which relate mostly to the timing of staffing and pensions.</p> <p>  As the Comptroller and Auditor General noted, the Vote of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is new.  It is an important innovation and the need to establish it emerged as a result of the build to share initiative, which was a pillar of the 2015 public service ICT strategy, and that remains central in the recently published Connecting Government 2030 - A Digital and ICT Strategy for Ireland&rsquo;s Public Service.</p> <p>  In regard to chapter 4 of the report, the Comptroller and Auditor General summarised the main amounts.  The total gross amount was &euro;70.1 billion and the net figure was &euro;67.3 billion, after deducting realised appropriations-in-aid totalling &euro;2.8 billion.  There were a number of changes to the Estimates in 2020, relating to the Covid pandemic and the restructuring of a number of Departments.  The strong position of the public finances before Covid put the Government in a position to deliver very significant supports in regard to Covid.  As the impact of the crisis recedes, the summer economic statement of 2021, agreed by the Government and published last July, set out a fiscal strategy, including a medium-term expenditure strategy.  This is based on growth and core expenditure each year broadly in line with the estimated trend growth of the economy, and will facilitate continued investment in our economy and society to deliver on improvements in infrastructure and public services while reducing the deficit to underpin the sustainability of the public finances.  It is the role of my Department to implement a credible and sustainable public expenditure framework in tandem with reforms supporting excellence in public service delivery, strategic policymaking and public governance structures.  To achieve these, my Department sets out policies and guidelines for Departments to follow.  In order for effective and transparent management of public expenditure and achievement of value for money, it is important our colleagues across the public service apply these policies and guidelines in their organisations.</p> <p>  On the format and content of the appropriation accounts, the committee has written to the Department in respect of the manner in which a number of issues are dealt with in the appropriation account, including pay, funding received from European funds and legal costs paid by Departments, which I will now briefly address.  On foot of earlier requests from the committee, we took in the 2021 accounts to revise the presentation of legal costs.  This will allow for an examination of costs arising in the year of account and also allow us to disclose the total number of cases settled in that year.  We will, of course, review the impact of that change, along with any views of the committee or the Comptroller and Auditor General, to see whether any further changes are needed in 2022.</p> <p>  The Department also took action to provide for the disclosure of Accounting Officer salary in the 2021 account and committed to examining this issue further for 2022.  I acknowledge that the committee has sought further changes in this regard to provide actual levels of remuneration, rather than as set out in the circular.  There is a need to have regard to potential legal issues that may arise in this instance, but the Department is happy to consider this further, with a view to the 2022 account and possibly also as an additional note to the 2021 account.  We are also reviewing the points raised in respect of greater disclosure regarding pay and will engage in consultation with other Departments on this issue shortly.  The Department also continues to progress the wider reform of the accounting framework for central government in order to align our framework with the international public sector accounting standard.  We are currently reviewing a set of 12 standards as a priority and will write to committee members shortly to seek their further views.</p> <p>  On public private partnerships, significant infrastructure projects have been developed on behalf of the State through the use of PPP procurement.  Some of the advantages associated with PPPs include that they allow the public sector to avail of greater private sector expertise and innovation and that the private partner assumes responsibility for a considerable portion of the risk.  The contracts tend to be long-term arrangements, typically spanning 25 years or more.  The Department&rsquo;s role in PPPs is to maintain and develop the general policy framework within which PPPs operate.  It has had no direct involvement in the procurement or delivery of individual PPP projects.  Therefore, the delivery of projects through the use of PPPs is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant Departments.  As part of the review of the national development plan, NDP, the Department undertook a review of PPP policy.  Broadly speaking, the review found the PPP policy framework was robust and that the current guidance was fit for purpose, with a track record of successful delivery.  Hence, PPPs remain an option for public procurement where they provide the best value for money, with risk transfer forming an important element of that assessment, and we will continue to monitor the role they can play.</p> <p>  The year 2021 saw my Department enter its final funding arrangements with Benefacts, covering the three-month period to March 2022.  This agreement was primarily to enable Benefacts to cease its operations in a timely, orderly and compliant manner.  Benefacts was a pathfinder project established in 2014 amid heightened disquiet among the public concerning the charity sector, in particular.  During 2020, my Department undertook an evidence-based review, which found the environment had altered substantially.  In reaching its decision, my Department considered a number of factors, including the Charities Regulator&rsquo;s production of a register of core data sets and transparency information, the vesting of policy ownership of the Department of Rural and Community Development of the State's relationship with the not-for-profit sector, and the persistence of state aid and procurement risks associated with the continued funding of this company.</p> <p>  Before concluding, I would like to update the committee on some of my Department&rsquo;s priorities for the sustainable management of public expenditure and driving and supporting the reform programme.  The progress we made in these areas in 2020 was set out in considerable detail in my Department's annual report of that year.  Our report for 2021 will be published shortly and I will be happy to forward it to the committee.  Looking ahead, our priorities continue to be to manage public expenditure at sustainable levels in a balanced, evidence-informed manner to support Ireland's economic, social and climate goals, alongside challenges such as the impacts of Brexit and Ukraine, and to drive reform and innovation across the civil and public service to improve service delivery to the public and enable strategic policymaking and public governance structures.</p> <p>  To develop and implement policy, my Department will continue to: produce multi-annual Estimates and expenditure statements that meet Government objectives and are consistent with the Government&rsquo;s agreed fiscal strategy; mainstream budgetary reforms and, through the Government's economic and evaluation service, drive capacity-building for evidence-informed policy in the Civil Service; enhance the governance, oversight and delivery of the new national development plan; manage public service pay and pension costs on a fiscally sustainable basis; continue to address the challenges posed by Brexit while maximising the opportunities and benefits to Ireland of EU membership; and lead the development and implementation of Civil Service Renewal 2030, which will build an innovative Civil Service organisation and workforce that delivers evidence-informed policy and services; while the Department will continue, in its leadership role, to drive digital transformation across the public service as well as lead a procurement reform programme to enable effective, sustainable and compliant procurement across the public service.</p> <p>  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleagues in the Department for their hard work, the contributions they have made to delivering on our objectives over the past couple of very difficult years and their role in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in particular.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention.  I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

I was interested in what he said about Benefacts and how a decision had been taken over time whereby the establishment of the Charities Regulator and the openness that engendered meant the Department was satisfied it no longer needed Benefacts and did not regard it as a solution.  Openness was created in the sector that may not have existed previously.</p></speech>

The key issue for this Department in terms of Benefacts was that we established it as a pathfinder pilot project.  We conducted an evaluation, at first in 2017, that found it continued to provide value for money at that point.  In 2020, however, a further review suggested there had been a lot of changes in the overall context-----</p></speech>

It is a single-point scale, so yes.  We only have one issue around the publishing of more granular information than that.  I think the committee has come back to us looking to publish the actual salary that individuals are on.  That may not be a difficulty but we just have to be sure around the legal responsibilities we have in respect of data protection.  As the salary scale is on a certain point if, for example, a person is sick for more than six months in a year the salary he or she receives might be less.  If people work a four-day week rather than a five-day week, the salary they receive will be less.</p></speech>

How would that compare with a CEO of a commercial semi-state body?  Are they under the same requirements then in terms of a scale or data protection concerns around the value?  When I look them up in the media, and I appreciate this may not be the same thing, I can see dollar figures.  Maybe they are not accurate.

The one distinction I would make between the code of practice and the circular setting out what needs to be put in the appropriation account is that one has the force of law and one is a comply-or-explain framework.  We are not requiring anyone to publish a particular figure under the code of practice.  We are setting out guidelines where we feel that should be and the legal assessment of the costs and benefits of that and the legal assessment of the information that a particular public body can publish, given the public interest versus the individual right to privacy.  That is an assessment that each public body makes under the comply-or-explain nature of the code of practice, whereas we set out in a circular requirements to publish particular pieces of information.  Then that is a requirement and in that case, we make the assessment of the public interest versus the rights under data protection and other legislation-----</p></speech>

It is so basic.  I was looking at the accounts of the Peter McVerry Trust, for example.  It gives much more detail about the profile of the organisation and gender or the organisation.  I am curious about how and when we will get to a point where we can see a better profile of the organisation in terms of seniority and distribution of salaries throughout the organisation and in particular in respect of gender and how that is working.

This is not directly with Mr. Moloney.  It is a frustration we have in many instances.  For instance, the Irish Prison Service was here some weeks ago.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I asked about a report, which was then published two or three hours later.  That is deeply frustrating because it was clearly available to be published.  I am not suggesting that is the same with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but we often get answers such as "shortly", which I heard in Mr. Moloney's opening statement or "as soon as possible".  There is a scheduled date for meetings with the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is several months since we wrote seeking the information.  Could we agree that it would be before July, for example, that is, before the House rises for the summer?</p></speech>

For example, in 2020 the estimate was &euro;180 million but the figure realised was &euro;279.27 million.  Before that the estimate was &euro;160 million and &euro;252 million was realised.

That triggers quite significant amounts in terms of values.</p></speech>

With the data available to us, we only have seven months of the current year.  For the 2020 estimate, for instance, we would not have the full 2019 data at that point.  We would only have the first eight months.  We base the estimate on what we have seen in the year to date.  The single scheme membership is growing at a very fast rate.  In 2013, for example, we had about 13,000 members in the scheme.  As at the end of 2021, we have 190,000 in the scheme.

Has best practice been followed?  Are there things the OGP can influence now that there is a brand new project?  Can it influence a better outcome and process than the Committee of Public Accounts has experienced with the children's hospital?</p></speech>

In terms of learnings from the children's hospital and a better experience, the key changes we have made have been to the public spending code, which is a matter for the core Department rather than for the procurement division.  We have introduced several ways of strengthening the public spending code, as well as a major projects advisory group.  We hope that the strengthening of the public spending code we have introduced will support the management of projects, including large bespoke projects, into the future.</p></speech>

I often say it is a poisoned chalice, depending on the way in which one is coming in here.  One could say the Committee of Public Accounts and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are on the same side.  We should be working closely together.  The committee makes recommendations based on the information given to us by the Department.  It is all about working towards the public purse and how we can save money.  That is why, particularly when the committee requires information, I do not see any reason for obfuscation in that regard.  The committee and the Department should be in line with one another.</p> <p>  To continue on from the questions asked by Deputy Carroll MacNeill, the construction material price inflation on public works projects was reviewed recently.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently announced the inflation co-operation framework, which will pay up to 70% of the builder's inflation-related construction costs.  What impact will that have on the national children's hospital from a cost perspective?  What is the estimate of our guests in that regard?</p></speech>

Although the framework applies to a wide variety of projects, the national children's hospital is a bespoke programme that already includes a provision for inflation.</p></speech>

I will start by asking them to provide an update on the implementation of the roadmap in respect of the international public sector accounting standards, IPSAS, and also regarding the financial management shared services system.

As requested by the committee, we provided a timetable in a letter dated 2 November 2021.  That timetable is still on track.  Obviously, it is a long-term project.  The next phase is a focus on 12 particular accounting standards and making progress on them.  With regard to the financial management shared services, FMSS, project, that project has now gone live in respect of the first wave of clients, which includes my Department.  That is proceeding.</p></speech>

There is my Department, the Department of Finance, the Exchequer account, the Office of the President, I think, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Ombudsman.  Those are the first wave of Departments for the financial management shared services system.  I think it went live three weeks ago so it is quite recent.  They are working through the implementation of that and a report will be done on how that implementation goes.  Obviously, with any new system there are issues to be ironed out.  The next decision will be to see whether a second wave, which will involve a number of larger Departments, will proceed.</p></speech>

A recent report from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, namely, The path for Ireland's health budget, stated that the rise in public health spending over the past half century has been dramatic and that now we rank as the highest spender on health internationally.

We monitor against that allocation to quite a considerable level of detail, obviously, limited by the data available to us.  In recent years there have been challenges due to Covid-19.  There have been considerable shifts in terms of priorities and spend at the Department of Health.  Prior to that, we would have argued for stronger financial management and a stronger financial management system within the HSE.  There have been, in the past, considerable challenges.  Part of that is also related to the nature of the health services themselves, many parts of which are demand led.  For us it is about financial management and reporting.  It is about fiscal discipline and management within the HSE, accepting the challenges of some of the parts of the business being demand led.</p></speech>

We get Revised Estimates yearly, but urgent reform is needed in this area.  We are spending over &euro;21 billion in a health budget.  When we look at the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on procurement and value for money, there are certainly questions to be answered.</p></speech>

We have strengthened our oversight in recent years.  We have established a health budget oversight group where we sit down with the Department of Health and HSE on a monthly or more frequent basis.  We have established a process of reporting quarterly to Government on health spend.  We have quite intense engagement over the course of the year with the Department of Health in relation to expenditure trends and where the money is going and in relation to the fiscal discipline that is there.</p></speech>

To ensure management of these reforms, what additional resources is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform putting in to ensure that there will be additional expenditure?  How will that be managed in the future?  An enormous amount of planning is involved to deliver on this policy.  I wish to get an understanding of the measures the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will start to focus on.</p></speech>

I think those were discussed and considered as Sl&aacute;intecare itself was being discussed.  I think at that stage it was anticipated that there would be a significant increase in expenditure.  In recent years we have seen a significant increase in expenditure.  The management of that expenditure is primarily a matter for the Department of Health.  From our point of view, we have internal procedures to strengthen the oversight through the health budget oversight committee, through the resourcing of what we call the health Vote team in the Department, the team that is responsible for the oversight of health expenditure and we continue to do that.</p></speech>

It has a build-to-share service that is increasingly being supplied to Departments throughout Government.  The resources that that attracts are not just from the Department's own Vote but from other Votes.  We felt it would be more efficient and more transparent to pull those resources into a single Vote to demonstrate the impact and breadth that the OGCIO was having and to rationalise expenditure throughout the Civil Service ICT.  My colleague Mary O'Donohue is from the OGCIO and can explain further what the Vote entails and what activities are there.</p></speech>

So as not to disproportionately influence the overall Vote in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it was decided in the Department that establishing a separate Vote for OGCIO, as the Secretary General said, allows for transparency and it is obvious to see how we grow and how we grow those services.  We currently offer the standard suite of corporate desktop services as any organisation would use to 18 organisations covering over 5,000 users across the Civil Service and public service.  That will grow by another six organisations by the end of 2023 and so we will support about 10,000 users directly.  We do Government networks, a nationwide service to all public service bodies.  We have applications services.  We build something once and use it many times so that it maximises the investment of the State in services like that.

I hope to cover three areas.  The issue of the accountability of public representatives has been there for some time, particularly in respect of our pay.  Increasingly the public is demanding that same level of accountability particularly for senior civil and public servants.  There has been some correspondence between us and the Department committee regarding the remuneration packages for Secretaries General.  This may have been covered in the opening questioning from Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  Some politicians in this House have suggested that they take a reduction and that has turned out not to be true.  Having accountability in respect of people who suggest they are taking a reduction in their salary is actually quite important because they are clearly trying to court positive public opinion in suggesting they might take a reduction, but we need to know that the reduction has actually taken place.</p> <p>  That goes to the heart of our request for the remuneration packages for particular public servants.  It is not that anybody has a navel-gazing obsession with people's salaries.  It is about the accountability of ensuring something is done if was said was it done.  I am not clear whether Mr. Moloney's predecessor took the reduction in his new role that was suggested.  I may be wrong in the information provided, but my understanding in respect of that appointment is that we have a salary range but it is not clear what the exact salary details are.  I ask Mr. Moloney to talk to us about that.  If somebody says there was a reduction there should be an accountability structure for that.</p></speech>

We will look at it further for next year and see whether we can do anything more this year on it.  The constraint we are under in relation to the publication of salary is not really about the salary for the job but personal information that could be contained therein.  Typically, Secretaries General are on a single point scale.  They may or may not have personal pension contributions depending on whether they began before or after 1995.  There is no real difficulty in setting out the gross salary of any Secretary General or any civil servant.</p></speech>

This comes to the point of the difference between gross and net pay and the decision to gift money back under the relevant taxes Act.  This is the procedure used by officeholders if gifting money back or accepting a lesser rate of payment.  It is a tax matter for the individual.  There would seem to us to be significant issues.</p></speech>

I want to broaden this beyond one individual.  A person is essentially using public money to court public opinion and there is no accountability as to whether that public money was or was not used.  It is a significant issue.  Politicians and public servants should have nothing to do with their salary one way or the other, up or down.  The idea of public representatives or civil servants gifting back money with no accountability as to whether it happens is clearly an issue of accountability and appropriate conduct in these roles.  Does Mr. Moloney see the point I am making?</p></speech>

As we see it, the difficulty for us is that it involves a very specific provision of the tax legislation.  There are also rules and legislation on identifying the tax affairs of individuals.  We have not yet fully fleshed it out in terms of seeking legal advice and detail on it.  The overall picture really is clear enough with regard to the Taxes Consolidation Act.</p></speech>

I imagine this would be the case for any individual, whether an employee of ours or not.  If people publicly state they are gifting money to the State, the State should be in a position to confirm whether it received the money.  This is a direct question.  I am aghast that we cannot confirm whether the State received money that people purport to have gifted it.</p></speech>

I am making it broader than the individual.  I refer to Members of the Houses who often purport to do the same.  We cannot have a situation where public servants purport to gift money to the State with no public accountability structure for it.  They are not individuals who have no accountability structure.  They are public servants and in their public role they suggest they are making a gift to the State but the State cannot confirm whether it received it.</p></speech>

It is not an individual matter or a pay matter.  It is a matter that impacts standards in public office.  What will happen is that we will have a race to the bottom and only people with independent wealth will be able to engage in public service.  It is a serious point.  Politicians are free to do it because they have their own accountability structure but if public servants are engaged in it and there is no accountability structure, then there is a significant issue with standards in public office.</p></speech>

I want to focus on two areas, Benefacts and public-private partnerships, PPPs.  Benefacts was the only organisation drawing together data from audited financial statements from thousands of non-profits.  I think it dealt with somewhere in the region of &euro;7.4 billion and, very often, it would receive funding from multiple sources, sometimes multiple State sources.  It was an open access database and was heavily used.  It took &euro;250,000 to close it down and this was after &euro;6 million had been spent since 2015, a lot of it State money - public money - and some of it from philanthropy.  There is no replacement for it.  A resource that was being used has disappeared and that, to me, screams waste of money.</p> <p>  I find it very difficult to figure out what the thinking was, given there was no replacement.  The Charities Regulator, for example, would have about 11,000 entities on its books, with 4,000 of those being schools, whereas this particular database contained a much bigger number of entities.  We are supposed to be taking an open governance approach.  This was very important information.  Why was it closed down without even consulting the stakeholders who, I understand, found out through a freedom of information release?  Why did that happen?</p></speech>

It was a pilot programme, it was always a pilot programme and it was never going to be a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform programme.  It was at a time when, as the Deputy said, there was very little data available on the charities sector in particular, and that is why we funded it on a pilot basis.  The reality is that we engaged with the potential funders in government in regard to whether this was something they were prepared to fund or take over.  In the course of 2020, for various reasons &ndash; for their own reasons, and I am not even fully sighted on them - the charities regulator-----</p></speech>

My understanding is that it is considering what its data needs are in regard to the sector.  It is clear that the context has changed considerably since 2014 in terms of the regulatory requirements of the sector, the establishment of the charities regulatory authority and the requirements of the Department.  It is a matter for the Department now to decide what its data needs are and I understand it has not fully decided that yet.</p></speech>

We have this supposedly open government approach.  My distinct impression is that, at best, we are going to end up with a fragmented system where we will have a piece from the Charities Regulator, we will have gaps because Benefacts covered a much wider remit and we will not have the oversight.  It is as if there is a management of information that is the opposite of what is desired in terms of the open government approach.  The public have an interest in this.  It is their money.  Does that factor in at all?</p></speech>

That is the reason it could not continue as a pilot project.  It was reviewed and was found not to be value for money.  At that stage, we consulted with every Department and agency we could think of that might have an interest in the data and that might have an interest in taking over some or all of it.  None of those Departments or agencies felt the particular solution to their data needs went in this direction.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that people found out about this very late.

When it was set up, was the issue of state aid something that was considered at that stage?  It seems ludicrous that the Department would allow it to run for six or seven years and not have done that if it was going to be a risk.  Those kinds of risks would be considered in advance of setting up something, surely.</p></speech>

This is going back to 2014 but, as I understand it, that issue would have been considered.  At that stage, the reason it was seen as okay to support the project on a pilot basis was that there was no other activity in the marketplace and the level of information gathering, the level of data gathering-----</p></speech>

I want to ask about public-private partnerships, PPPs.  In Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s opening statement, he talked about the advantages but he said nothing much about the disadvantages.  I remember that at the previous Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was a member, many of us did not conclude what Mr. Moloney concluded about value for money.  For example, there would have been guaranteed traffic levels with some of the PPPs, which goes absolutely against our climate obligations, which are not new.  We are paying considerable amounts in compensation in regard to some of the PPP schemes where traffic counts have not met the minimum that was set.</p><p>Mr. Moloney says the Department did a review of the PPPs.  Could he furnish us with a copy of the review where it was concluded that they represented value for money?</p></speech>

That is okay.  Does the Department carry out reviews of all the PPP projects?  That is one of the issues that came up when the previous Committee of Public Accounts had hearings on the matter.

Is it satisfied with the proportion of social housing units directly delivered by local authorities or approved housing bodies from a value-for-money perspective?

As she is also aware, the targets set out in Housing for All for social housing, including the breakdown of those targets, have been decided by the Government.  Therefore, this is a policy matter.  In the national development plan, as per the Minister's role, we have provided significant funding in order to support social and affordable housing.  We monitor the spend on that function and we participate in the implementation of the Housing for All report.</p></speech>

That is required to meet the housing needs of people who are supported through the likes of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Mr. Moloney referred to many years of decline historically with regard to the delivery of housing stock.

Could we have included in that, as part of the assessment at the end of the ten-year lease - it is mostly a ten-year lease for the long-term ones - the fact that the State does not have an asset?  I will explain properly what I am asking.  If the money is invested in social housing, which one cannot do all at once - private rented accommodation is a short-term interim solution that has become a long-term solution, unfortunately - either through the local authorities or an approved housing body, there is an asset in the form of a house which the local authority may sell to a tenant at a future date or continue renting, or which the approved housing body will continue renting.  In terms of the note in relation to value for money on that, can Mr. Moloney include in the calculation the fact that there is not an asset at the end of the process?  No matter how long HAP goes on or a lease goes on, there is not an asset for the State, the local authority or approved housing body at the end of that process.  I am asking whether that can be factored in.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the process of the putting in place of public contracts, as a result of which a major cost is being added to the contracts.  I will cite the example of a contract with which I was directly involved.  It was a school premises where a new school needed to be built.  A State agency objected to the planning permission.  Even though that State agency was given an undertaking that the number of students in the school would not be increased further, it took the matter all the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That State agency caused a delay to the provision of a school.</p> <p>  A second issue was a further delay arising from the time the tenders were submitted to the when a tender was accepted, as a result of which the pricing of the project had changed.  The lowest tenderer could not complete the project for the price the contractor tendered and it offered to submit a revised tender, which would still have been lower than the next lowest tender.  The Department refused to allow that.  It went to the second lowest tender and that contractor would not accept the project and neither would the third or fourth lowest tender.  The project was awarded to the fifth lowest tenderer that tendered for it.  There was a price difference of approximately &euro;700,000 between the tender price that was finally accepted and what the revised tender of the lowest tenderer would have been, if accepted.  That did not represent good value for the taxpayer.  Surely there must be a process for dealing with those problems.  A State agency objected to planning for a State project and despite entering into discussions on it, that State agency did not back down.  There was also a delay in processing the tendering and even getting the project ready for tendering.  How does Mr. Moloney envisage such an issue would be dealt with in future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.277" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022051900002#L00300"><p>As the Deputy will know, in terms of our setting out the guidelines for procurement frameworks, we do not have that much visibility of individual projects.  As a general principle, we would not want different arms of the State conflicting with each other.  We would want them to reach negotiated and mediated outcomes, whether it be with respect to planning permission or any other legal action.  As a result of the fiduciary and other duties and statutory or other responsibilities State agencies have, it is not always possible to avoid it, but I do not have oversight of the specific issue.</p> <p>  Regarding the difficulties that arise, particularly in the current circumstances around the length of time that passes between a tender being accepted and the project being initiated, which can sometimes happen, this year we have tried to introduce some flexibility into the public works contract in January.  We said there could be a more flexible arrangement with new contracts to take account of that time factor.  We are also encouraging contracting parties to minimise the time involved.  In a zero inflation environment the time factor is one thing, but in a higher inflation environment the time between tender awards and implementation needs to be minimised.</p></speech>

Does he accept that process needs to be reviewed, given that in the private sector there is a far faster turnover time for projects from start to finish.  A project in the private sector will be turned over in two years whereas in the public sector it can take anywhere from six, seven or eight years.  How can we become more efficient in dealing with projects?</p></speech>

We do not consider they, in themselves, have an impact in slowing down of the process because many actions are taken in parallel.  We encourage contracting parties to move through the bases of the public spending code as quickly as possible.  Many of the delays in project formulation can be about deciding what the project is and how to specify it, getting consensus on what the project is and going through the various consultation processes in the public sector, which is not a feature elsewhere.</p></speech>

I had the privilege of being Lord Mayor of Cork from 2003 to 2004.  I had a very good city manager, Joe Gavin, there at that time.  We had many properties rented for staff around the city.  He wanted to do an extension to City Hall.  He got companies to tender, design, apply for planning, build, finance and deliver the project.  It was delivered within two years from start to finish.  It probably cost four times less than had we gone through the process of waiting to be allowed borrow money and of what would be involved in Departments.  There was a great saving for the State in building that additional accommodation in City Hall.  Do we need consider a more expeditious way to deal with projects than our current structure?  I accept we need to have checks and balances but they have extended from layer to layer within Departments.  It is not helping the system.  Is it time for a review?</p></speech>

The single most effective way to address the delays the Deputy referenced is to carry out external independent scrutiny of project proposals within the planning and appraisal stage in order that clarity in the design and in what is being done facilitates the type of project the Deputy referenced being done in shorter timelines.  We have put in place a framework under which Departments can appoint external assurers which we believe will substantially reduce timelines in some places.  Reviews take six weeks and can be done in parallel to other parts of the project inputs.  Our experience is that clarity about what needs to be done and how it needs to be done, which the Deputy referenced, is often missing.</p></speech>

What mechanisms need to put in place to ensure with public private partnerships there needs to be an external oversight on behalf of the relevant Department to make sure all that is set out in the contract is being delivered?</p></speech>

It is certainly the case that public private partnerships, like any contract, need to have strong governance.  The sponsoring Department needs to put in place strong governance and oversight of those projects.  While we have had, broadly, success in relation to the public private partnerships we have delivered, it is noticeable no new PPP projects have been agreed since September 2015.  One of the things we have now done to ensure greater visibility in the financial costs of public private partnerships is to include the full cost in the capital envelopes of the Department, which therefore has stronger incentives to put in place strong governance frameworks around those projects.</p></speech>

The PPPs are subject to the same rigorous oversight processes as any other capital expenditure.  When I said we had no new PPPs since 2015, we have things such as schools bundles decided before 2015, and social housing bundles, that are being progressed.  There are a relatively small number of areas but a number of Departments benefit from using PPPs and delivery through PPPs.</p></speech>

In my case, if I gave back so much to the State by personal choice in respect of the pay rises over the past 11 years, I would have evidence of it.  I would have a photograph of it on my phone because we sometimes get asked about these things by journalists and so on.  If a senior civil servant is gifting back, for example, &euro;80,000 a year, or said he or she was doing so, where does Revenue come into it?  The question being asked is nothing to do with a civil servant's net salary or the net effect of all of that.  It relates to the amount of gross salary being gifted back.  Why is there a Revenue issue around that?  I do not get it.  I am missing something there.</p></speech>

My understanding of it is this.  If a senior civil servant, in general, says he or she is gifting back &euro;50,000 or &euro;80,000 of his or her gross salary to the State, why can there not be some paper trail of that or evidence to show it is happening?  I am not asking a question and, in my memory, this committee or any member of it has never asked a question, about the net effect of that on the person's take-home pay and his or her net income.  What we are asking about relates to that gross figure.  Surely, there should be some paper trail for it relating to the gross effect of that or, in other words, if someone states he or she is surrendering &euro;50,000, &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000 or whatever.</p></speech>

There is a document.  I wanted to clarify that.</p> <p>  I will deal with the issue of construction inflation.  Last week, the Government announced a fund in excess of &euro;500 million to meet more than 70% of construction costs that are related to inflation.  As I understand it, the scheme is not time-bound.  It is retrospective and goes back to 1 January this year.  It covers increased energy costs.  While there is no doubt but that energy costs have gone up, energy on its own is not the major part of inflation in construction.  It is significant, in the context of road construction and things like that, where heavy machinery is being used.  We know from previous discussions we had with the board of the children's hospital, there is recognition and provision for 4% inflation.  Once it goes over 4%, they can make a claim for it.  Will the Government provision of that fund potentially add further costs to the children's hospital in respect of price inflation on that project?   </p></speech>

My understanding is the answer to that is "No".  It will not.  The children's hospital has its own framework.  In effect, under the existing public works contracts, as I understand it, after three years, negotiations on price changes cannot take place in any case.  Obviously, the children's hospital project is more than three years but, as the Chairman said, there is that 4% provision in the contract, which is quite a bespoke arrangement.</p> <p>  On energy, the Chairman is quite right that energy costs for construction are mostly a relatively small component, but there are particular construction firms for whom it would be a larger proportion of their costs. </p></speech>

I understand that.  They have shareholders and have to have profit margins and so on.</p><p>This could become an area of contention with Government Departments.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's role in terms of oversight is not just about authorising the signing of cheques.  It must take an interest in this, which it has done over the years.  In terms of reduced profit margins, dividends for shareholders and so on, that will become an area of contention because when a claim is submitted by a private company that is building a hospital, a road or some such, a percentage of that claim would be related to profit margins and dividends for shareholders.  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerned about that?  Last week the Department said it was going to cover up to 70% of inflation-related costs.  Is there a concern that there is a grey area here, in terms of companies saying that their profit margins have been wiped out and they cannot pay dividends to their shareholders this year?  That is where the commercial world and the public purse meets and that could result in a bang or a collision.</p></speech>

Departments that were trying to deliver projects were saying that projects were at risk and that people were walking away.

That is certainly the situation at the moment.  It is with that in mind that I am asking the question.  In terms of the oversight role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there is potentially a big grey area there, where the public purse and the commercial world meets.  I understand that.  That is the business they are in and that is why they are there.  They have profit margins to meet and shareholders to satisfy.  What I am asking is whether the Department will be on high alert when it is overseeing the signing of cheques by other Departments to ensure that the grey area, that area of contention or negotiation, is not abused.</p></speech>

In the first instance, it is a matter for the contracting authorities but we would expect them to have a line of sight on what the actual costs in the contract were and, therefore, how those costs were affected by the inflation in the particular sub-components of the wholesale price index that are involved.</p></speech>

As referred to earlier, the budget for this year is over &euro;21 billion.  I have no argument with that but there is a sense that even if we filled a tipper lorry with money and tipped it up outside the HSE's headquarters, the services at the other end would not materialise.  I do not want to rhyme it all off here because I have taken this up with the Department of Health and the HSE previously and will be doing so again when they appear before this committee again.  Basically, we have increased and increased the amount of money we are putting in to health, which is good, but the services are not there.  Not alone are the services depleted, they are actually disappearing.  Public dental services have disappeared in the part of the world that I inhabit.  They do not exist any more in the county in which I live.  I could go on and on.</p> <p>  Recently we got a profile of the schemes available for children with autism and there are gaps all over the place, lengthening waiting lists and so on.  I know we have come through Covid and we must take that into consideration.  That said, we are a high spender on health.  In fact, I think we are now the second highest for health spending, which is good but countries that are spending less, which are not low-wage economies but comparable northern European countries, have amazing outcomes.  I know we cannot have a utopia with a perfect health system because that does not exist but other countries are 90% of the way there while we are only 30% to 40% of the way.  There are gaps all over the place.  Any public representative, whether a county councillor or a Deputy, or anyone familiar with dealing with the public on these issues knows of the gaps in the system.  Day after day, we come across gaps where services do not exist.</p> <p>  My point is that from the point when we tip in the money - &euro;21 billion plus, which is fine - to the point when we get the services, is anyone talking to senior and middle management in the HSE and asking them what is happening here and why are there no services at this end?  I am sure the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform monitors what goes on in the D&aacute;il and in the media in relation to the absence of health services, despite all of the money being invested.  What is happening there?</p></speech>

Obviously, we are concerned to secure value for money from the considerable investment that is being made in health services.  We do monitor it on an ongoing basis.  We spoke about the health budget oversight group previously.  In doing that, we acknowledge, as the Chairman has done, the impact of Covid in recent times.  We also acknowledge the impact of the increased population and so on.  We certainly take every opportunity to try to drive better value for money in the health services but from our point of view, these are issues that are fundamentally a matter for the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></speech>

Imagine the chairperson of a board or someone in middle management coming back to a body like this committee, eight years later, and saying that nothing will happen until the back end of 2025.  I am open to correction, but I think that was the last date we got from them.  That means it will be over 11 years from the time they were told they needed such a system.  That is more than a decade.  We cannot run public services like that.  It is bananas.  That is the only way I can describe it.  It is bananas that they do not have a single, integrated financial management system.</p> <p>  The more I look at the HSE, and others here have been looking at it for longer than me, the more incredible it seems.  I know that as Secretary General, Mr. Moloney could devote his entire Department to looking at this but he cannot do so because he has his finger in a lot of pies and has lots of responsibilities.  That said, in terms of the area of health, the Civil Service and the Oireachtas must get on top of this.  The public willingly pay their taxes.  Every week tax is taken out of employees' wages before they see it and the self-employed pay tax every three months to Revenue but at the other end of that, we just cannot seem to get the services.</p> <p>  Since coming into office, has Mr. Moloney taken up the issue of an integrated financial management system with the CEO of the HSE and the Secretary General of the Department of Health?</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Committee of Public Accounts need to be on the one page about this.  Someone needs to start examining what is going on in our public health system and the failures there.  Money is being frittered away.  The amount of taxpayers' money made available is willingly increased each year.  It is voted through in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Where do people go to access services at the other end?  This is a big issue that we could spend a month discussing.  We do not have that time to spend on the issue.  I am trying to highlight that because of the oversight role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we need to get on top of this.  Health is the one Department from which we need better outcomes.  I ask Mr. Moloney to give priority to that integrated financial management system.  I was first told in 2020 that it was going to be the back end of 2022 before the project would be delivered.  That has since shifted to 2024 and I think 2025 is the current target, although I am open to correction.  The fact that it has taken eight years from the time the Department was told it needed this system to delivery of same bamboozles me.  We are now talking about the process taking 11 years and that is totally unacceptable.  I urge the Department to do everything possible to try to get on top of that.</p></speech>

That central unit co-ordinates the network of IGEES people who are employed in almost all Government Departments.  There are IGEES people, taking staff movement into account, in all or almost all Government Departments.  The central unit recruits and allocates people to different Government Departments.  Those Departments have a number of different ways in which they organise internally.  Some have IGEES units, others have strategic policy units and others again have analysis units.  They feed into the analytical work done in those Departments, alongside other policymakers.</p> <p>  IGEES does a number of key things.  For example, it supports the annual spending review process.  There are a large number of analytical papers produced and published under that process.  The idea is to inform and feed into the policymaking process.</p></speech>

Every problem we have seems to be caused by the fact we cannot recruit people, particularly within the HSE.</p> <p>  That brings me to another question.  What is the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when it comes to the question of public health and its budget?  The health budget has grown significantly, year on year, since 2016.  The increase has been significant and the budget has almost doubled.  However, for every aspect of health service that I deal with, including child services, carers and adolescent services, the waiting lists are growing exponentially.  It seems we are putting money into a black hole and no service is provided.  I will ask the Taoiseach about the issue under Questions on Policy and Legislation.  Why are we getting such poor value for money from our health service?  Have our guests any idea?</p></speech>

My definition of investment does not apply to the health service because I cannot see a result.  I cannot see anything except lengthening queues.  I know Mr. Moloney does not work in the health area but I am asking what is his position on this issue.  We have doubled the budget and things are getting much worse.</p></speech>

The role of our Department is predominantly around advising the Government on funding levels and reaching budget agreements that then go to appropriations that are adopted by the D&aacute;il.  We also monitor the use and spending of the money.</p></speech>

I am asking what advice the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has given.  That money is going into a black hole.  The HSE is not fit for purpose.  There is no yield for the billions we are putting in.  I met a little boy in a wheelchair yesterday.  His application for funding for a new wheelchair sat on the desk of a civil servant for nine weeks.  That boy had a neck operation but did not receive the required physiotherapy thereafter, meaning that neck operation will have to be performed again.  That is counterproductive.  It is an inefficient use of public moneys.  What is Mr. Moloney's position and advice in that regard?</p></speech>

I have a question on it.  Some 30% of the OGCIO&rsquo;s programme expenditure related to pay and that is understandable.  Its next largest expenditure was on ICT services, which accounted for approximately 68% of overall expenditure.  Is that an initial set-up cost and a once-off or is there an ongoing reliance on expenditure for ICT within that new office?</p></speech>

The money that was transferred was the 2020 allocation based on what had been in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Vote previously.  The office is well established but we are growing in terms of the level of services we provide.  This is part of the reason for separating the Vote from the main Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Vote, so that it does not skew the Vote in a particular way.  It is part of ongoing running costs, as well as continuous investment into the services that we provide and deliver on behalf of others.  The build once is used mainly.  However, there was a build-to-share, which was predominately the investment in the <i>gov.ie</i>, the Government portal.  This became prominent particularly as a primary resource during Covid-19.</p></speech>

The annual budget will not increase by that amount every year.  There is a baseline cost for the running and building of the services.  We provide common standard desktop services.  There are ongoing running costs once the initial investment is made in capital.  Obviously, there are ongoing operational costs in terms of resources, ICT, etc.  As for the cohort of people we service, we have gone to 5,000 users this year on our common desktop platform.  We will be doubling that over the next two years.  There is an efficiency in that rationalising and a cost-benefit on an Exchequer-neutral basis across all the organisations we provide service for.  It will continue to grow as we deliver services and bring it under a common banner.</p></speech>

It was mentioned that there was a 3.9% increase in the number of pensions year on year.  I presume that will increase further in the coming years.  A colleague referred to pension numbers not being accurately predicted year on year, although I know it is difficult to do so.  How will expenditure grow over the coming years?

I will read from the conclusions of the Indecon report: &ldquo;The overall benefits of the Benefacts&rsquo; service are likely to be in excess of the costs&rdquo;.  It also referred to a need for more specialised data and expanding on the service.  Indecon&rsquo;s analysis reads: &ldquo;The methodologies used by Benefacts are appropriate and are in line with the approaches used in other countries.&rdquo;  The same report refers to the terms of reference being exceeded, which I mentioned earlier.  Indecon considered whether it was a market good and talked about this being a mature market and that Benefacts could bid within a process.  In that context, the Indecon report is stating that, if there were such a bid and depending on the timescales involved, the Government may need to consider transitional arrangements if the existing assets, experience and knowledge are to be maintained.  Indecon&rsquo;s analysis suggested that ceasing funding of Benefacts or an alternative service would reduce information that was needed for effective governance.</p> <p>  I do not understand how the Department can dispense with a database about which all of this is said in a report that the Department commissioned.  For good governance, this information is required.  I do not understand why Indecon was asked to consider the question of whether it was a market good or a public good and why the Office of Public Procurement could not have undertaken a fair and open inquiry into this.</p> <p>  Databases similar to Benefacts exist in other countries.  Now we are moving to a point where Pobal will be asked to recreate a similar, but probably more limited, database.  What is the point of that?  We are discussing &euro;6 million.  I do not understand the rationale for shutting this database down.  How could the Department consider that value for money?</p></speech>

We need to be clear about the steps that our Department took over 20 months to see if any of the Departments that had a responsibility for these data wanted them.  We asked that question over 20 months.  We were aware that there were many people who used the database and we were aware that many people thought there was value in it, but when we looked to the people who had responsibility for the data and for identifying what the data needs were, none of them saw Benefacts as the answer.  Perhaps it looks a little procedural to the Deputy, but from my point of view, I had a pilot scheme and it was not supposed to run indefinitely.  As the Deputy rightly stated, almost &euro;6 million had been spent on it.  There needed to be someone with statutory responsibility who felt that this was value for money and was able to proceed with it, but there was none.</p></speech>

If nothing else does, the Benefacts situation highlights that.</p></speech>

Is it the case that it is not involved?  In speaking about long-term planning, I am talking about saving money for the taxpayer.  For instance, local authorities undertake their five-year development plans, but the implementation of those plans is then subject to the whim of Irish Water because houses cannot be built unless Irish Water is prepared to install services.</p><p>Now the planning regulator is intervening.  In order to carry out long-term planning, we need to have a 20-year programme rather than a five-year programme.  Would Mr. Moloney accept that the way in which it is currently structured will result in a significant long-term cost to the taxpayer?</p><p> Turning to the health budget, the number of people working in the HSE has increased from 103,000 to more than 132,000, an increase of more than 27%.  This is about saving money in the health service and whether Mr. Moloney's Department can examine such an issue.  There has been a 27% increase in the total number of staff, including administrative staff, doctors and nurses, over a six-year period, but the one area in which there has not been an increase is public health nurses.  If we want to keep people out of hospitals, we will need to have more people on the ground.  In fact, the number of public health nurses increased by less than 4% in that period, from 1,460 to 1,523.  In the interests of saving money for the taxpayer, can the Department examine such issues and decide it needs to review certain aspects of a given Department's policy, rather than wait for that Department to make a proposal to be examined?  There is a considerable problem with the lack of long-term planning.  Five-year plans are being undertaken by local authorities, but that no longer works because that is a very short timeframe in which to put in infrastructure.  For instance, the Ringaskiddy bypass is being built in Cork, where the landowners were served notices in November 2014.  Eight years later, we are only turning the sod, without even having a contract yet in place.  The general structure does not seem to be working.  Is the Department looking at that aspect of reform?</p></speech>

Project Ireland comprises the national planning framework and the national development plan.  As the Deputy will be aware, we reviewed the national development plan last year, published a number of documents relating to long-term issues and agreed ceilings in that regard.</p> <p>  As for whether we can take the initiative in long-term issues such as workforce planning, we certainly can.  We have a number of vehicles through which we often work with Departments to look at the kinds of issues the Deputy raised.  For example, in this year's spending review, we and the Department of Health are looking at some workforce planning issues including the provision of nurses and doctors.  Those issues are capable of being dealt with in a collaborative way and, in driving change and reform across the system, we try to work with Departments and suggest topics-----</p></speech>

Does Mr. Moloney accept there is no point in putting in a 2 inch water pipe to service 50 houses if there will be 500 houses in the area in ten years?  That is the kind of issue I am talking about.  If the planning regulator is now controlling what local authorities are doing but if those local authorities have no say about what Irish Water does, where are we headed?  It will amount to a huge increased net cost to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

For example, in the context of Housing for All, we engaged intensively with Irish Water, the housing delivery co-ordination office, HDCO, and local authorities in regard to where water infrastructure is.  We now have a map that shows where water availability is and there is water availability for a large number of houses.  Whether they are in the places where people want to build houses becomes the next question and our long-term planning in that regard flows from that data and from that sharing of knowledge.  The website is available to view.  Obviously, we are not in a position to cut across the functions of statutory regulators but we are in a position to work with Irish Water and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as we do under the umbrella of Housing for All, under which I chair the public service delivery subgroup.</p></speech>

At any one time, 50% of all the people occupying hospital beds are over the age of 65.  We now face a huge logjam in the system unless we undertake long-term planning involving care in the community, yet we are doing nothing about that.  Has Mr. Moloney's Department engaged with the Department of Health on that issue?</p></speech>

Surely Mr. Moloney's Department should intervene in that scenario?  I was recently contacted by a 78-year-old man who lives less than 1 mile from an office where public health nurses are based.  He was in hospital for three months as a result of Covid, after which he came home.  To this day, he has not been seen by a public health nurse.</p></speech>

I mentioned dental services earlier.  We understand that Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s Department is not going to deal with the minutiae of the interactions between the Department of Health and the HSE.  Nevertheless, it sanctions the large health budget every year for both organisations.  Between now and whenever that budget is sanctioned, will Mr. Moloney ask them that specific question?  We in the committee may disagree on many other issues, between the Government and the Opposition, but not on Sl&aacute;intecare.  If public health nurses are not provided and if the complement is not increased, the point Deputy Burke articulated well will be a problem.</p> <p>  The case I referred to related to dental services.  There is no public dental service system at the moment.  A contract that had been won with private dentists collapsed and, as far as I can ascertain, it has not been resurrected, in the midlands at least.  Moreover, the school dental scheme is non-existent in most counties.  In Laois and Offaly, it has not existed for a number of years and children are not seen in primary school or within the first three years of secondary school.  Some of them leave school before any contact is made with their parents or anyone else about it.  Children complete their junior certificate without having been seen by a public dentist.  It has been a few years since I was in school, in the 1960s, but I recall being seen in third class.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Moloney ask the Department of Health why this is?  I am raising this in a respectful way.  We are trying to alert him to what is going on here.  He will have to sign off on this budget, which I know he will do with good intentions, and we will approve it with good intentions in the House after debates and so on.  We have highlighted just two examples.  This is at the centre of Sl&aacute;intecare.  If there cannot be public dentists providing a school dental scheme, and if the point Deputy Burke made about public health nurses is not addressed, it will have a very significant impact on the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is central.  We are trying to keep people out of hospital.  If we do not deal with oral health in children when they are young, there will be awful health outcomes, which is already the case, as doctors have told me, because oral health is not being dealt with.  We are accumulating problems for child and adolescent mental health services for children on the autism spectrum because we are not reaching children in time.  Similarly, if elderly and infirm people who live at home are not seen by public health nurses or if those nurses are not available to deal with their circumstances, they will end up in nursing homes or accident and emergency units.  The system is just piling up.  My understanding is that other countries look at the front-line services and start building them.  I have attended meetings with representatives from the HSE at which - I am not kidding - your brain would turn into jelly after an hour.</p><p>You get all the management-speak and everything else but what you do not get is what they are doing to actually fill the gaps in public services.</p><p> We are trying to get Sl&aacute;intecare.  I understand Mr. Moloney cannot see everything that is going on.  As any public representative will tell him, and I am saying this in a respectful way, the services at that end are just not there and it is so frustrating.  We are held accountable by members of the public because they believe we can change things.  As I said, we could fill an articulated truck with money on Kildare Street, drive it over to the Miesian Plaza, start offloading it with a forklift truck and put another &euro;10 billion into the health service but, as things stand, it would not change matters because of how the system operates.</p><p> There are some people in the HSE trying to do good work.  I meet and speak to them and they have shared their frustrations with me.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the Department that signs off on expenditure.  The Department of Health is the biggest spending Department.  I believe its budget is bigger than that of the Department of Social Protection, or both Departments may spend around the same amount.  With the Department of Social Protection, however, we can see where the funding is going.  It is more straightforward.  I understand health is complex and providing health services is complex.  There is no perfect health system on the planet but some countries do it much better than we do.  We are doing terrible for the amount of money we put into health.  We are a developed country.  We go around with our chests out saying how great we are doing, which is good, and that we are among the richest countries in the world.  Why, 100 years on, can we not have a health system that provides a school dental scheme?  That scheme has collapsed since the 1960s.  There were always loads of public health nurses but there are not now, despite the increase in population.  Before Mr. Moloney signs off on the budget for health, will he contact the Secretary General of the Department of Health &ndash; I am not sure if he has a direct line to the CEO of the HSE &ndash; and raise those two issues with him?  I am asking him to do that as the new Secretary General.</p><p> I wish to revert for a moment to the Benefacts issue.  Approximately &euro;14 billion goes into the not-for-profit sector each year.  The Benefacts database monitored that and provided information on it.  It stopped because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was signing off on it, which meant that Department was central to the database being maintained.  Despite other Departments and Accounting Officers not making a business case, is there not a business case for having that database?  Less than &euro;1 million - I believe it was &euro;950,000 - was the biggest annual spend on it.  That seems like a small amount of money relative to &euro;14 billion.  It seems that &euro;1 million to allow politicians, journalists and, indeed, civil servants to have information at their fingertips from Benefacts is a relatively small amount.

Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s Department took a great interest in this.  I have a letter here from the Department dated 16 April 2019.  Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the monitoring of this project, about which I have articulated my huge concerns.  There was a single contractor and all of the other bidders backed out.  I know the reasons for that because I heard some of them and they are clear at different stages.  I do not get any pleasure out of saying this, but some of the chickens are coming home to roost, including, for example, with regards to the delay in the roll-out.  Eir, a private company, has a fair amount of control over the pace at which this project moves because two or three years before the contract was signed, it was able to capture those households and premises that were easiest to serve.  The project is now moving into more remote areas, as a cursory glance at the map of the national broadband scheme would tell us.  I saw it first four years ago and raised it with the then Minister at the time.</p> <p>  We know the national broadband scheme is way behind schedule.  My understanding is that 44,000 homes and premises had been passed in mid-April, whereas 115,000 were to have been passed by January.  The first plan was revised because of the Covid lockdown.  The second plan is being revised because of Covid, even though the telecommunications sector was not prohibited from working during the 2021 Covid restrictions at that time.  However, another plan was then put in place and it too has since fallen behind.  By mid-April, 44,000 homes had been passed.  According to correspondence we received from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications last week, it reckons the project is 12 or 13 months behind.  It accepts that the company, National Broadband Ireland, NBI, has a case for a delay of eight and a half months.  I raised this specifically with the Taoiseach last week.  There is a variation and a gap here now.  Penalties should apply.  According to the letter from the Department, that is confirmed.  I do not have the exact wording as I do not have the letter with me but that is my reading of it.  I asked the Taoiseach to monitor this.  Is Mr. Moloney aware of the issue and will his Department ensure that penalties are levied on NBI for failure to meet the targets?  We are now on to the second revised plan, plan number three.</p></speech>

We have an oversight role, so we can have that conversation.</p></speech>

Some of the reasons given include blocked ducts.  For example, when they go out and push cables through ducts, they find they are blocked.  One would expect that to happen if ducts are unused.  There are issues related to Covid and how that was stretched and stretched, perhaps further than it should have been.  It is the first time I have seen committed to paper that the Department has conceded there should not be a 12- or 13-month delay but a delay of eight and a half months.  It uses wording around that and states that penalties should apply in this case.  I said this to the Taoiseach yesterday and today I am asking the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that happens.</p> <p>  The national broadband plan is a very precarious and complex project.  A lot could go wrong but one hopes it does not go wrong.  Does Mr. Moloney&rsquo;s Department stand over the concerns expressed in his Department's letter of 16 April 2019 to the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in which his Department questioned the affordability of the project and expressed fundamental concerns in relation to the unprecedented risk to the State and taxpayer?  The letter referred to the project as a huge leap of faith, questioned the justification for spending scarce public funding on this scale and noted the unprecedented risk involved given that the Exchequer was committing &euro;2.7 billion to the project, whereas the only risk for the operator was &euro;175 million of its own funds.  It also noted that the private operator would have all its moneys paid back at the point where the Exchequer had &euro;2.5 billion paid out.  The Department also said it was difficult to see how the contract represented value for money.</p><p>Does the Department still share all of those concerns?</p></speech>

Mr. Moloney's predecessor, Mr. Robert Watt, flagged these concerns with the Department at that time.  Some members who were on the communications committee at that time, including myself, raised those concerns.  My jaw dropped when I read this letter first back in 2019 or 2020 when we got hold of it.  Does the Department still share even some of those concerns in that letter, which I have here?</p></speech>

As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated.  Decisions taken by the committee on correspondence are recorded in the minutes of our meetings and published on its web page.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.</p> <p>  No. R1232 B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, HSE, dated 9 May 2022, providing information requested by the committee during our meeting with the HSE on 10 March.  The meeting focused on the HSE's expenditure on mental health services and the child and adolescent mental health services.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Deputy Munster flagged it for discussion, but she had to leave.  Does any other member wish to comment on that correspondence?  Everybody is okay with it.<br/><br/>The next correspondence is No. R1233 B<b></b>from Mr. Kevin McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, dated 9 May 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding a timeline for the implementation of the White Paper to end direct provision and the establishment of a new international protection support service.  The Secretary General addresses the impact of the war in Ukraine on that work, stating that almost 28,000 Ukrainian refugees have come to Ireland under the temporary protection directive, with over 19,000 accommodated by the State.  As the Department is responsible for providing short-term accommodation to Ukrainian refugees, it has had to redeploy staff, which has impacted on some areas of the White Paper implementation process.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence and to forward it to the relevant sectoral committee for its information.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  Again, Deputy Munster had flagged it for discussion.<br/><br/>The next correspondence is No. R1235 B from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General, Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, dated 11 May 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the digitising of records of the Irish Land Commission.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence and to request information on the timelines for digitisation of search aids from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as whether there are plans to digitise all records.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy wishes to speak on this.</p></speech>

Those records are held in Portlaoise, Chairman, so you are probably familiar with the location in which they are held.  There are 8 million records.  They are a treasure trove.  They are one part of the Land Commission records.  The other part are the ones that relate to Northern Ireland and they are available to view in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland in Belfast.  They are not digitised but they are available.  The matters they relate to are tenants of the land, issues around the revolutionary era, rentals, etc.  They give a great deal of information and date back as far as the late 1800s.</p> <p>  What we are being told here is that the catalogue is being digitised rather than the records.  The Department is telling us that these are very delicate records.  It is dealing with the National Archives, which does brilliant work in conserving documents.  However, there are two matters of concern.  One is the longevity of these records in the first instance and the second is accessibility to those records, which have an important historical and genealogical benefit that we are not exploiting.  We have a desperate attitude to our historical records.  A load of them were burned - not by us but on our behalf - in the Public Records Office in 1922.</p></speech>

I visited the National Library some years ago with members of one of the committees and I was horrified at the risk at which we are putting our national collection.  Money has been allocated for that since.</p> <p>  This is bad news in this letter in that what has been agreed to is very limited.  We should write back and try to find out why it was decided and what was the methodology for deciding.  There was a big announcement not long ago about this.  Why was it decided to only digitise the finding aids, as it were, rather than the records themselves?  If they are that fragile, one would have thought that conservation and digitisation would be the optimum.  I also do not understand why we do not see the benefit of these.  Historians and genealogists have been looking for these for years.</p></speech>

Turbary rights are registered in them.  There are also tenant holdings, as you mentioned.  There is information regarding leasehold, freehold and the like.  I am open to correction on this but we should write to the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine about it.  I went to Cavan looking for records at one stage and I ended up with the Portlaoise situation.  It is the first time I saw where all those records are pinned down.  At least we know now that they are in place.</p> <p>  It would be useful as well to ask the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr. Brendan Gleeson, for information regarding where they are stored.  I believe I know the building in which they are stored and I have some concerns about retaining the quality of the documents.  They are probably fragile, as you said.  In addition, there is the security of the documents and their accessibility.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine seems to be the responsible body, so we need to ask Mr. Gleeson in the Department to give us an outline on that.</p> <p>  Your point on that is that is only the index or the catalogue that is going to be nominated or-----</p></speech>

It is how accessible they are, the security of where they are, the building they are in and the maintenance of the documents, particularly if they are fragile.

It was around homicide classification and the investigation by the Garda in 2017.  Essentially, this letter is giving us some reassurance that a report was published in December 2019.  The letter states, "the classification did not impact the quality of the subsequent investigations undertaken [but they wanted] ... to prevent a reoccurrence ..."  To be honest, what concerns me about that and the reason I wanted to raise it is there has been a recent newspaper article that makes me doubt that information.  A guy, a civilian, was appointed by the Policing Authority.  I am reading from a newspaper article.  Mr. John Mooney wrote it but I cannot see the date.  I can provide it to the clerk to the committee.  The article states, "a civilian appointed by the Policing Authority to lead the GSAS after an international competition, resigned unexpectedly in 2019 shortly after accepting the role."  There had been a whistleblower.  She was the deputy head of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service.  She was concerned with the classification.  This is fairly recent.</p> <p>  I do not want to accept this at face value where there are reports that indicate that there are people who are pretty much saying otherwise.  There was a couple of them who refused to sign off on the report on the grounds that it contained unreliable data and who say they were subsequently excluded from compiling a report on the issue for the Policing Authority.</p> <p>  I will give the Chairman the newspaper report.</p></speech>

Senator Conway is substituting for Senator Seery Kearney.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to resume our discussions on employment and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to: Mr. Patrick Flanagan, create employment co-ordinator, from Independent Living Movement Ireland; Mr. Patrick Murphy and Mr. Alan Porter from the National Learning Network, NLN, Bantry; Dr. Aideen Hartney, director, and Ms Marion Wilkinson, senior policy adviser, from the National Disability Authority, NDA; and Mr. Alan McGrath, executive director, and Ms Roisin Doherty, director of learner support, from SOLAS.  We look forward to our engagement with the witnesses.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate if they are physically located on the campus of Leinster House.  I ask members who are joining us remotely to confirm that they are within the grounds of Leinster House prior to contributing to the meeting.  For anyone watching online, some witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented nature of these circumstances, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical difficulties arise.</p> <p>  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending and giving evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be provided on the extent to which such evidence is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect the decision of the Chair.  Members are reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice.</p> <p>  I call on Mr. Patrick Flanagan to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

On behalf of my colleagues at the Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, we welcome these opportunities to address issues of policy and provision for disabled people across Ireland.  We also welcome the recognition of the ILMI as an authentic voice that represents the lived experiences of disabled people.</p> <p>  We will all agree that disabled people have an equal right to work and should be given the supports that they need to access or retain employment, and to have the same career opportunities as others.</p><p>In its 2021 report the Irish State made 35 observations under Article 27 of the UNCRPD relating to work and employment.  We will all agree that this suggests substantial work is being done but we may not all agree on whether or not this work has been, or will be, successful.  I will share ILMI&rsquo;s view on this question, through our observations on Ireland&rsquo;s first draft report to the UN under the UNCRPD in April 2021, ILMI&rsquo;s submission on the review of the reasonable accommodation fund, RAF, of May 2022 and ILMI&rsquo;s CREATE project, which is an employment initiative supported by the Dormant Accounts Fund and which has run from March 2021 to the present.</p><p> It is important to note at this point that ILMI&rsquo;s observations and feedback emerge from inclusive and participative spaces that bring disabled people together as a collective on a cross-impairment basis.  As a result, the views and experiences we share are diverse and varied just like those who offered them.</p><p> ILMI&rsquo;s vision for Ireland is one of an inclusive society where disabled persons have freedom, choice and control over all aspects of their lives and can fully participate in an inclusive society as equals.  The UNCRPD is an important tool in providing a framework for the realisation of this vision, with employment a key pillar alongside housing, transport, and personal assistance services.  Inaccessible or in some cases, non-existent public transport, as well as unaffordable private transport, prevents disabled people from being able to travel to any potential place work.  Remote working, while beneficial, is not possible for some roles or in some areas due to poor broadband infrastructure.  It also risks pigeonholing disabled people into specific types of work, as well as isolating them from their colleagues and work communities.  There are also serious attitudinal barriers and employers who demonstrate negative perceptions about work productivity among their disabled employees.</p><p> Time efficiency is often quoted as a reason for a disabled person not getting a job, and job applications often require statements of impairment or additional needs which many fear will undermine their prospects for success.  Disabled people can be made ineligible for supports once they begin to earn above certain thresholds, and can lose secondary benefits which many disabled people rely on, such as a free travel pass, blind pension and the medical card.  The rising cost of living and the cost of disability combined with the risk of losing essential benefits means that disabled people face the prospect of being worse off should they take up employment.  ILMI welcomed the recent review of the reasonable accommodation fund, RAF, and the chance to address some of the issues disabled people experience in respect of reasonable accommodation.  </p><p> Currently in Ireland some employment supports are only available at entry level or interview stage for disabled people, while others do not follow the person throughout their employment journey.  The job interview interpreter grant is available to persons with a hearing or speech impairment but only at interview and induction stages of work, unlike the personal reader grant.  Meanwhile the workplace equipment adaptation grant supports a range of provisions, including assistive technologies.  However, these must be first purchased by employers and cannot be retained by the employee should they change jobs, putting repeated, unreasonable and unnecessary costs on employers and the State.</p><p> With work accommodations, there is a repeated onus on disabled people to have to apply for supports and the provision of these is not administered in an open and transparent way, nor through the same schemes or State Departments.  These are also framed through a medical model of disability and highlight a person&rsquo;s impairment and limitations, rather than their professional qualities and potential, which reinforces the attitudinal barriers already highlighted.</p><p> I am conscious of so far having only told the committee what the problems are.  Let me share some solutions and the positives that we see at ILMI. particularly through our CREATE project.  CREATE works with disabled people across Ireland, delivering professional and peer supports that aim to grow their confidence and capacity to start or progress their employment journey.  I have had the privilege of leading this project for the past 14 months and have worked with a hugely diverse community of people of all ages and abilities.  Every person has had their unique skills and qualities, and every person has shown a willingness and ability to positively contribute to our society as workers.  </p><p> The success of our project, and our participants, has highlighted for us a number of important lessons.  One is the variety of different ways in which people can and want to work.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach and our employment opportunities must be reflective of, and adaptable to, the diversity of disabled workers.  The same must be said for reasonable accommodations, which should be provided more effectively, aligning the support with the needs of the disabled person themselves. </p><p> As I have mentioned, CREATE&rsquo;s focus is on finding confidence rather than explicitly finding a job.  This might seem unconventional or insufficient for an employment project but confidence is at the core of ensuring that disabled people have an equal right and opportunity to work.  We must have confidence in our own ability to work.  We must have confidence in employers&rsquo; willingness to hire and capacity to support us.  We must also have confidence that the State and society will provide for, and not penalise, us when we seek employment opportunities.</p><p> If we continue to adopt the social model of disability over the medical model, and continue to put views and voices of disabled people at the centre of our conversations, we are confident that Ireland can meet its obligations on Article 27 and ensure that we can all participate as equals in the labour force and society.  </p><p> I thank the members of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and my colleagues.  I look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the invitation.  I know the Deputy representing Cork South-West, Deputy Cairns, is also here.  She was instrumental in the invitation being afforded to us.  We are delighted to be here today to give a synopsis of what we do in Bantry NLN and to consider some of the issues we can tease out, going forward, and which might make employment opportunities for people with disabilities more easily accessible and attainable.</p> <p>  I am the manager of NLN in Bantry, west Cork.  We cover the whole west Cork area.  I have been with NLN for nigh on 20 years.  Time is not long slipping by.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Alan Porter, who recently completed the employment skills training programme in NLN and has moved on to employment.  He will speak to his journey in NLN in due course when I have finished my remarks.</p> <p>  NLN is the training and education division of the Rehab Group.  There are approximately 50 NLN training centres around the country.  We provide a range of flexible training courses for people who have experienced a setback, have had an accident, a mental health difficulty, an illness, or injury or who have a disability or extra support needs.  Our vocational courses are funded by Cork Education Training Board.  Our rehabilitative training programmes are funded by the HSE.  At any given time, there are approximately 120 students on various programmes in NLN in west Cork and Bantry.</p> <p>  NLN operates a unique continuous intake approach whereby students can start their training programmes at any time.  Students learn at their own pace and have an individual action plan and reviews that take place monthly to make sure progress is going in the right direction for everybody and their needs are being met.</p> <p>  Our HSE-funded courses offer rehabilitative training programmes for students of 18 years and over.  We also have a few innovative mental health programmes.  Only last August, we were recognised by the WHO as a model of good practice in our home focus programme.  It was heartening to be recognised as one of 25 projects internationally that achieved that recognition.</p> <p>  Our vocational programmes in Bantry are funded by the Cork Education and Training Board and offer introductory skills training.  Our employability skills programme, which is a Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 3 programme, is an example.</p> <p>  We also offer skills-specific training programmes, including an employment skills QQI level 4 programme, which is known as employer-based training.  That is the course Mr. Porter completed recently.  We have a horticulture programme that is QQI level 4 certified.  We also have an office administration programme by independent learning, whereby people study at home and come into the training centre two days a week.  That is a QQI level 5 programme.</p> <p>  We have a multidisciplinary team supporting students which includes a rehabilitation psychologist, rehabilitation officer, a resource teacher and a team of instructors.  The multidisciplinary team supports and provides an holistic approach to training and provides one-to-one and group sessions to help students build their study, organisational, social and psychological skills.</p> <p>  I will focus on the programme that Mr. Porter completed because that is pertinent to what we are discussing here today.  That is our employment skills QQI level 4 programme.  As I said, it offers a QQI level 4 training certification and is aimed towards the development of skills, knowledge and attitudes to transition to employment, further education and training or both.  Students can spend up to two years on the 30-hour per week programme.  The programme includes 22 hours on-the-job training, which is important, and eight hours in-centre training, working on the certification elements of the programme.  Students within the NLN receive nationally recognised qualifications after completing their training and progress to employment or further education.</p><p>Last year, of the students who completed their training in the NLN in west Cork, 92% progressed to either part-time or full-time employment and further education and training.</p><p> One thing we do quite well in west Cork is our links with employers.  Building that bond and that relationship is hugely important.  Building links and trust with local employers is critically important in providing quality work experience and employment opportunities on completion of the training programme.  NLN Bantry has a very comprehensive database of quality employers, spanning a broad range of employment sectors such as retail, tourism and hospitality, agrifood, public service, administration, pharma, social care and education.  This enables NLN students to access quality work experience placements and job opportunities on completion of their training programmes.  The network operates a close working relationship with these employers by regularly engaging through our employer-based training co-ordinator and our work experience co-ordinator.  Additionally, the network offers all employers disability awareness training, and epilepsy and autism awareness training where required.</p><p> I will highlight some important points the committee might consider when putting together its report on employment and the UNCRPD.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the further and higher education sectors are currently working on providing pathways through the various different levels within the further and higher education sectors.  It is important that the programmes provided by specialist training providers, STPs, such as NLN,  be included on this continuum to facilitate students&rsquo; access to clear progression routes on to further education and training, institutes of technology, technological universities and university courses in due course after having completed their programmes.</p><p> Something we find very useful in west Cork is the wage subsidy scheme for people with disabilities.  This remains critically important for both employers and students in the provision and taking up of employment.  We commend the recent increase in the rate of subsidy under the scheme.  We would like greater flexibility brought into the scheme so more people can qualify, such as people who work less than 21 hours per week or whose expected duration of work is less than six months.  The review of the scheme must meet the promise in the programme for Government to fine-tune and expand this scheme.</p><p> The Chair and Deputy Cairns will appreciate this next point, being from very rural communities.  Our previous contributor mentioned it as well.  Transport can be a large impediment to people with disabilities accessing training and education opportunities and employment.  We hear this all the time.  It is especially difficult in a rural context such as west Cork, for example, where public transport is underdeveloped.  Greater investment is needed in this area to allow people with disabilities to take up these opportunities.  The Local Link service could be expanded to offer a bespoke solution to people with disabilities travelling to work and training.  I spent the past two days scrambling around trying to find transport for two students who were leaving school in Castletownbere so they could travel to Bantry to take up training places with NLN.  We are working on it but there are no easy solutions. </p><p> The cost of disability needs to be addressed generally.  The cost of participation in work or training can be high for many people with disabilities.  The Indecon report on this was published last December and we really need the Government to respond to that in the upcoming budget, if at all possible.</p><p> There is another challenge in special schools.  There is a lack of formal transition planning process from special schools to further and third levels.  There is limited knowledge about post-second level training providers, such as NLN, so students lose out on inclusive education and training opportunities because they simply do not know these opportunities exist.</p><p> I thank the committee.  I look forward to answering questions or expanding on any of the issues I have highlighted.  I will hand over to Mr. Alan Porter, who recently completed our employment skills training programme.</p></speech>

I was born with a condition called congenital hydrocephalus.  I was told I would be able to live more or less like anyone else, with the exception of never being a football captain, which suited me as I was never really a huge sports fan.  Throughout the years I found I had fared better than others like me and had not needed any revision or replacement surgeries for the shunt that had been placed in my head when I was five days old.  All that changed in 2013 when I learned that I needed a shunt replacement.  I put my best face on and went through the procedure.  I was left with trouble concentrating, focusing on and memorising things and with some bad balance.  Although I had been struggling a little with these things throughout my earlier years, they became more apparent after the surgery.  That was a bit of a wake-up call.</p> <p>  After several failed attempts to gain employment, I was introduced to NLN and joined its employability skills training programme.  There, I began to reclaim a lot of skills I had thought lost forever due to neurological difficulties.  As time passed I found that I was able to function more efficiently and began working in the kitchen at the centre, which, in turn, led to work experience in several different businesses around the area.  My time at the centre also gave me the opportunity to work on my social interaction skills, which I had also been struggling with since adolescence.  I now have a sizable group of friends in west Cork, whom I tend to consider family.</p> <p>  I graduated with a QQI level 3 qualification in employability skills and enrolled in the level 4 employment skills training course with the support of my head mentor, where I continue to further my skills in matters of employment.  Shortly before the pandemic I had also secured some work experience at a coffee shop in Skibbereen but when things spiralled out of control, everything got cut to the bare minimum in terms of work time.  Some time after that, I finally moved to Bantry.  Things were still a bit shaky around restrictions and employment.  I gained valuable work experience at a local bar and restaurant called The Quay's Bar and under the watchful eye of my employer, I learned new skills and tasks.  I enjoy the role I was given working behind the scenes, performing all different sorts of tasks from dishwashing to moving and placing stock, and feeling part of the team.  After The Quay's Bar mentored me, my skills improved and the outcome could not be more positive.  After completing my training programme with NLN I was able to secure paid part-time employment in the bar.  I do not believe for a moment that this could have been possible without my time at NLN.  I feel I owe the staff there and at The Quay's, as well as my adopted nation, a debt I could never repay.</p></speech>

The NDA provides independent and evidence-informed advice to Government on policy and practice relevant to the lives of disabled people.  We also incorporate a centre for excellence in universal design, promoting the design of buildings, products, services and ICT so they can be accessed, understood and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability.</p> <p>  I will begin with a few key statistics that are worth considering.  Data available from the CSO show that only 36.5% of disabled people aged between 20 and 64 are in employment, compared to 72.8% of the non-disabled population.</p><p>Among people with a disability who are employed, 14.8% are self-employed.</p><p> More than one third of people in receipt of disability allowance would like to work, if the conditions were suitable.  Approximately three quarters of people of working age with disabilities have acquired their disability between the ages of 18 and 65, many of whom have a prior connection to employment.</p><p> NDA research shows people with disabilities experience consistent poverty at more than twice the rate of their non-disabled counterparts.  Being at work helps reduce this risk, although we know that disabled people still experience deprivation at a higher rate than the rest of the population.</p><p> Article 27 of the UNCRPD recognises the right of persons with disabilities to work, on an equal basis with others.  In Ireland, progressive realisation of this article is being driven through the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, a ten-year whole-of-government approach to improving employment outcomes for disabled people.  The national disability inclusion strategy also has a commitment in this regard.  The NDA carries out independent annual assessments of progress on both strategies.</p><p> The Disability Act 2005 requires a minimum of 3% of public sector employees to be employees with disabilities.  The authority monitors compliance with this Part of the Act, Part 5, and our 2020 report shows that the sector has achieved a level of 3.1%.  Legislation to increase the minimum target to 6% by 2024 is expected to pass in the coming weeks.</p><p> The NDA welcomes progress to date on these strategies and policies but advises that there are some key areas where further focus is required, which could be captured in the final three-year action plan for the comprehensive employment strategy currently in development.  These include addressing challenges relating to: career guidance; effective transitions; providing supports and reasonable accommodations in the workplace; a programme of vocational rehabilitation; building the capacity and competence of employers; and ensuring self-employment is a viable option for disabled people.</p><p> This year, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will work to develop a UNCRPD implementation plan, and we recommend that this should include ambitious goals on employment.  Relevant mainstream strategies must also include actions to meet the needs of disabled people, as the pathways to work strategy does, for example.</p><p> The Employment Equality Acts oblige employers to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities, unless this would impose a disproportionate burden.  Many accommodations cost little or nothing to provide and simply require a flexible approach.  NDA research on reasonable accommodations has shown that meaningful engagement with individuals is key to creating an inclusive workplace.  We welcome the review of the reasonable accommodation fund under way in the Department of Social Protection, as this will be relevant to those cases where a cost is required to provide an accommodation.</p><p> Research delivered by the OECD in 2021 in partnership with the NDA highlighted a number of ways in which the State could promote the employment of disabled people, both directly with employers, and through the public employment service.  Many of the recommendations made by the OECD are reflected in the Pathways to Work commitments, and we look forward to the implementation of this strategy over its lifetime.</p><p> Self-employment and entrepreneurship are also routes to positive employment outcomes for disabled people.  Barriers experienced include fears that income earned might put at risk essential benefits, such as the medical card, self-employed individuals not currently being eligible to access the reasonable accommodation funding administered by the State and lower disability awareness in some local enterprise offices.</p><p> In recent years, the NDA has engaged with Enterprise Ireland on how its entrepreneur support programme can be made accessible, through universal design, for all those who have a business idea that can be developed to attract external investment, including entrepreneurs with disabilities.  Work is also under way at IDA Ireland to ensure that good practice in supporting employment for disabled people in foreign direct investment firms is applied in their Irish locations.</p><p> At the start of the comprehensive employment strategy, the Government committed to increase the percentage of people with disabilities in employment to 38% by 2024, from its baseline level of 33%.  The 2022 census will tell us much about how close we are to achieving this target.  Our analysis shows that more than 15,000 additional disabled people in the 20 to 64 age range must be at work in 2024 relative to 2017 if we are to achieve this target.  These numbers show clearly where increased cross-sectoral co-operation is necessary to drive progress.  The importance of the forthcoming final three-year action plan for the comprehensive employment strategy cannot be understated.</p><p> I would be delighted to answer any follow-up questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

Through the 16 education and training boards, ETBs, and other providers, the FET system offers access to a wide range of learning opportunities and supports in every corner of the country, regardless of background or formal education level, and a learning pathway to take people as far as they want to go.  The FET system currently serves a base of approximately 200,000 unique learners every year.  SOLAS also has statutory responsibility for oversight of the national apprenticeship system and serves as the co-ordinating provider for craft apprenticeship in Ireland.  A National Apprenticeship Office, which is jointly managed by SOLAS and HEA, has recently been established.</p> <p>  Apprenticeship is a dual model that combines learning in the workplace, at least 50% on the job, and learning delivered by an education and training provider.  More than 8,400 employers currently use apprenticeship as a talent pipeline and place a high value on the learning their apprentices complete in the education environment.  It is intended that the number of employers using apprenticeship will grow significantly in the coming years, with 10,000 apprentice registrations per annum by 2025, requiring a significant expansion of the system.</p> <p>  There were very encouraging signs in 2021 of increased interest in new apprenticeship opportunities, of which there are currently 65 programmes.  There were 8,607 new registrations in 2021, with an overall apprenticeship population of approximately 24,000, far outstripping pre-pandemic levels in 2019.  This demand has continued into 2022 with 2,286 registrations so far this year.</p> <p>  Progress has been made in implementing the review of pathways to participation in apprenticeship, which has impacted positively by creating more diversity in apprenticeship; ensuring information on apprenticeships is available via a new website; the promotion of apprenticeship for all through Generation Apprenticeship campaigns; and introducing pre-apprenticeship provision.  However, we need to build on this progress and as with all other learning opportunities, access, diversity, and inclusion remain essential within the national apprenticeship system.</p> <p>  The action plan for apprenticeship includes a significant number of actions which will accelerate the number of women apprentices, those with disabilities and other under-represented groups.  A dedicated equity of access committee is being established to advise the National Apprenticeship Office in this work.  A first step is already under way with introduction of a gender-based bursary for eligible apprenticeship employers.</p> <p>  Of the current live population of 24,035 apprentices, 640 or 2.45% have self-declared a disability.  As it is a self-declaration process, this data may be an underestimation.  The female apprentice population has grown substantially in recent years and now stands at in excess of 1,500, although more needs to be done to address barriers to entry.</p> <p>  A broader range of programmes in a wide array of industry sectors means there are increased options for all who are interested in starting an apprenticeship.  In addition to construction, electrical and engineering-related apprenticeships, we now have a suite of apprenticeship programmes in areas such as tech, biopharma, financial services, healthcare, hospitality and manufacturing.  Apprentices can achieve qualifications at levels 5 to 10 on the National Framework of Qualifications and the national apprenticeship system provides multiple lifelong learning opportunities where people can complete advanced apprenticeships as part of their career progression or as a means of changing career.</p> <p>  Fostering inclusion is one of three pillars in the Future FET: Transforming Learning, the national FET strategy.  SOLAS has published national system reports as well as a series of specific reports on priority learners, one of which includes information on FET learners who self-declare if they have a disability.  In 2018, the first year of this report, 8,644 learners declared a disability.  In 2019, this had increased to 13,098.  Since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the numbers of learners from priority cohorts have decreased but this is beginning to change this year as overall participation in the FET system increases.</p><p>SOLAS has commissioned an independent evaluation of specialist training provision for persons with a disability, as mentioned by my colleague earlier.  That is offered across the FET system.  This evaluation, which initially started in 2019 but was paused as a result of the pandemic, is now set to continue into 2022.  The review will consider many aspects of the provision, including outcomes for learners who participate in it.  It is anticipated the review will be completed by the end of this year.</p><p> I hope that provides a brief overview of our work and I look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>

For those who do not know me, I am a Member of the Oireachtas with a declared disability - I have an eyesight difficulty.  I am also on the OECD democratic participation advisory panel, which works to see how we can increase the number of people with disabilities who are involved in elective politics throughout the world.  It will come as no surprise to the witnesses that the number who are elected to public office is less than 1%.  In this country, at this moment in time, I am the only Member of the Oireachtas with a declared disability.  Difficulties and challenges employment stretch across all strands, including in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  I was very taken with some of the presentations, particularly the presentation from Mr. Flanagan.  The CREATE programme sounds very interesting.  He might talk us through some of the successes of the CREATE programme.  How many people have gone through it and then successfully gone into employment?</p></speech>

Over the 12 months of the project, of the 25 or so participants involved, five or six have either gone on to employment or secured employment or additional work opportunities during that time or just after the time they were involved in CREATE.  I will not put all of the credit down to CREATE.  Our project has worked to develop confidence and to support the participants involved to grow their capacity to seek and find employment, but they have very much been the success story themselves.</p></speech>

Are there wins that can happen quickly if that was to be altered?  What would his recommendations be to the Government to make it more flexible?  What needs to be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#E00800"><p>As I mentioned, the fact there has to be a contract period of six months or greater to access the scheme should change.  It is easier for people to get a leg in the door if it is for a shorter period and the employer is not committing to something for longer than they are willing to.  Quite often, once a person gets in and proves themselves, it expands and extends.  That is one issue.</p></speech>

It is a big issue.  At some stage, while there are some benefits that need to remain, such as free travel and that type of thing, there is a point where the benefits have to be lost if somebody is in full-time employment.  Can he suggest a mechanism for achieving that balance in trying to ensure somebody with a disability gets into employment and, at the same time, is able to do without the benefits that are unnecessary?  Is there a way of achieving that?  It is a very tricky issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.524" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#E01000"><p>It is very tricky but certain benefits should remain.  There should not be a cliff edge.  For example, a medical card for a person with a disability is absolute gold.  The fear of losing that is hugely prohibitive to their mindset of taking up employment.  The key message I would have regarding benefits is that a medical card is gold.</p> <p>  Mr. Porter is in a similar position at the moment, having taken up employment.  We are now trying to argue for him to keep his medical card, which is not encouraging for people.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is the issue of access to transport.  I represent a rural constituency and, as we know, to represent people in politics, I have to get places.  I do not drive so I know as well as anybody the importance of good quality public transport.  While a lot of progress has been made, we have a long way to go in that regard.</p> <p>  On a question to the NDA, does Dr. Hartney feel the authority has done enough to help CREATE smooth access to employment, as the State agency, funded by the taxpayer, that is responsible for disability policy?</p></speech>

We work closely in providing support and guidance to Departments and public bodies but, ultimately, the delivery of policy is a matter for those public bodies.  Of course, we recognise there is still much to be done in the space and all our efforts in terms of guidance and the analysis of statistics are on highlighting those gaps and indicating where good practice could be applied, whether that is learning from national initiatives or international initiatives.  We are very keen to see the final three-year action plan of the comprehensive employment strategy be implemented and achieve the goals of that strategy.  I agree there is certainly room for further work in this regard.</p></speech>

However, there are other areas, frankly, where it has let down people with disabilities, and this is one of them.  It has not been in any way strong when it comes to arguing this point.  The facts speak for themselves.  We are one of the worst countries in Europe when it comes to the employment of people with disabilities.  I believe the State agency that is funded to write the policy and advise Government has failed in that area.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we do not have responsibility or powers to impose, direct or create policy.  We advise.  Nonetheless, this is a very significant strategic priority for the NDA and we have a number of staff dedicated to that.

As we know, the employment rate for people with disabilities in Ireland is extremely low.  It is only about half that of the general population.  From listening to people who contact my office or talking to people in the disabled persons' organisations, one of the biggest problems is the attitude of employers.  They tend to see the disability rather than the ability of the person.  How do we make employers more aware of their obligations under the employment equality Acts and the UNCRPD?</p> <p>  A person I know with an intellectual disability qualified as a nurse and she went to work but she was failed in her probation year, which prevented her pursuing her career because she was not given the understanding and support she needed.  She told me that she could do everything any other person could do but it just took her longer.  She was not treated with any empathy or support, which worries me for the people in the profession.  I thought she had a lot more empathy than the people who were employing her.  It did not destroy her confidence, but it knocked her confidence big time.  What can be done to stop that happening and to put in supports?</p> <p>  Many of the witnesses have talked about reasonable accommodation.  I was a teacher before I entered politics and if a child in primary school was assessed as needing a particular type of assistive technology, the technology followed him or her into secondary school.  It was attached to the child rather than the school.  A lot of witnesses made the point that the employer provides supports but the supports do not follow the employee if he or she moves on to a different employment.  Could that be easily addressed?</p> <p>  I also want to ask the witnesses from the NDA about the employee targets for the public sector, which are to increase to 6%.  Is that ambitious enough?  Should it not be higher than that?</p> <p>  Another of the barriers the witnesses referred to regarding people taking up employment was that disabled people are fearful of losing their benefits such as free travel and the medical card.  For those who want to enter self-employment, anyone who has an idea to set up a business should have tailored supports to help them do that.  What happens is that the back-to-work supports have a timescale and everyone is supposed to fit into that.  However, a disabled person or someone who suffers from chronic pain may take longer to get a business established, so they need supports to continue, but because that is not available to them they have to give up on the idea.  That is very unfair.</p></speech>

It looks at productivity shortfalls because of a disability and compensates the employer.  That is why I highlighted the wage subsidy scheme as being a cornerstone to facilitating employers to employ people with disabilities.  That might be a solution in that regard.</p> <p>  When we speak to employers' they have never heard of the wage subsidy scheme.  We have to introduce it to them.  We have to explain it to them and walk them through it.  The awareness out there is terrible on the various schemes that exist.  When we explain it to employers, walk them through the process and produce the application form, most of them come on board but there is no doubt that there are a few out there who will employ someone where it will not turn out well.  An awareness campaign on the wage subsidy scheme is definitely something that should be rolled out.</p></speech>

They are some of the most creative and innovative people you could meet.  That is the case for many reasons, not least the different ways in which we have to adapt and navigate society and our daily lives in order to be able to live independently and to be able to live the lives we choose to lead.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the person who became a nurse.  With regard to employers, the first point that is essential is that disability equality training is provided, not disability awareness training.  We see that as being important in addressing attitudes that should not still but do prevail in society.</p> <p>  The wage subsidy scheme is a very negative one that focuses on what people cannot do and deficiencies and inefficiencies.  It is not inefficiency; it is a different way of working.  People do different things.  With regard to employer confidence, in any situation, whether it is a business, health or building expert, we are asking them to suddenly be an expert in disability.  They will never be an expert in disability unless they have either a disability themselves or the lived experience of it.  We consider that supports such as the wage subsidy scheme, assistive technology and reasonable accommodations are essential and that they are provided through and to disabled persons themselves, and that they are empowered and they are made the experts in what they need.  There is no onus on employers to have to know what to ask or what to provide.  All they need to do is say: "What do you need, what do you have and how can we facilitate that?"  If I have all the accommodations I need, the medical supports I need and I have confidence that I will not lose supports, if somebody wants to offer me a job, I can turn around straight away and say, that is fine, I can start on a particular day and I need the employer to be prepared to accept that I am bringing X, Y and Z with me, and the employer may need to provide one or two things in addition.  If they are already provided and I can access them, then the employer will not have the issue of delays in accessing grants or having to retrospectively apply for funding.  Putting the disabled person at the centre and at the start of everything that we do would lead to great strides being made in terms of beginning to address a number of issues that are being raised.</p></speech>

The minimum target as currently described in the legislation is 3%.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, across the entire public sector the average is 3.1%, as of 2020.  There are individual Departments and public bodies that are considerably exceeding this target, and some of them are already exceeding the revised 6% target.  That target can only be achieved through a mix of recruitment and also developing inclusive and diverse work places where employees feel comfortable sharing their disability status, many of whom might not have felt comfortable doing so to date.  It will be a mix of ways in which the 6% target can be achieved.  It is to be achieved by 2024, which is only two and a half years away at this stage.  While there may understandably be a feeling that it is not ambitious enough, at the same time we do not want to create targets that are so daunting that people feel that they might not have any hope of reaching them.</p> <p>  Another way of looking at it is to look at the other statistic I mentioned in the opening remarks, that 15,000 more people with disabilities need to be in the workforce in Ireland by 2024 if we are to achieve an overall employment rate of 38% of people with disabilities in employment.  That breakdown incorporates 7,500 people in the public sector.  The public sector would do half of the heavy lifting on achieving that target.  That is probably even more than would be fair for the public sector in terms of its overall share of the Irish workforce.  The legislation also provides for these targets to be revised, reviewed and reset by the Minister at intervals.  We would advise that they are regularly reviewed in line with the labour market conditions applying at the time.  I will now hand over to Ms Wilkinson.</p></speech>

One is around the research that the NDA has conducted on the issue of supporting people at work.  One of the important features we have in our work is how we consult with people about what the research is telling us.  In 2020 we did a piece of work around reasonable accommodation.</p><p>We looked not only at good practice but also at the cases on which the Workplace Relations Commission had adjudicated.  A number of important features came out of that.  First, a large number of employers are unaware of their responsibilities around equal status legislation.  Second, there are the difficulties that some people have gone through in accessing the accommodation they need.  That is for a couple of reasons, and includes cases where people do not know precisely what accommodation would work well for them in their place of work, which can come about from returning to work after acquiring a disability.  That led the NDA to produce a paper on the gap in the Irish system as regards vocational rehabilitation.  These issues coalesce because there is a huge gap in awareness among employers.  In some regards, there are also attitudinal barriers.</p><p> As my colleagues mentioned, the review of the reasonable accommodation fund currently taking place presents an opportunity.  Some of the commentary and suggestions made by the NDA to inform the review have been reflected in the comments this morning about funding the person who requires a piece of equipment, technology or accommodation.  As Dr. Hartney said, not all accommodations cost money.  Flexible working approaches and reduced hours can be one solution.  Another solution is to support the individual using some of the apparatus that is already in place, such as the IBEC-ICTU reasonable accommodation passport our colleagues spoke about, where somebody only looks for a support once and then that travels with him or her.  All of those measures can be put in place.  The NDA has made recommendations about what they would look like to make the service and approach more seamless.</p><p> The case raised by the Deputy, where the reasonable accommodation fund is not made available to people in the public sector, also arose in the NDA consultations.  That issue needs to be addressed.  I have given an outline of some of the commentary on NDA contributions.</p></speech>

In particular, I am delighted that representatives from the National Learning Network in Bantry could join us.  I am aware of the incredible work the organisation does in west Cork and the significant difference its work makes not only in the lives of students but also in the broader community.</p><p>As previous speakers noted, statistics show that Ireland has a disgracefully low employment rate for people with disabilities.  Today's discussion and the previous session on this topic illustrate the realities for disabled people whose rights are being restricted and eroded continuously.</p><p>I will touch on the conversation about the disability allowance.  Senator Conway argued that this benefit has to be reduced at a certain point.  I do not believe that is necessarily the case.  We know that having a disability creates added costs, which are estimated to be between &euro;10,000 and &euro;12,000 a year.  I am sure everybody knows that the cost is higher than that.  Time and again, we hear people express the fear that they will lose the allowance.  The Senator also mentioned the medical card.  It is acknowledged that this is a serious barrier which must be removed.  We know there is an added cost, so people should be able to keep their disability allowance.</p><p>Central to this debate is the appreciation that all people are entitled to meaningful employment as a foundation for independent living.  People have the right to live independently.  I<b></b>will first ask Mr. Flanagan a few questions to help us understand the underlying issues.  His observations on Ireland's report on the UNCRPD contains an incredible amount of insight and examples that address that area.  It mentions that the State excludes disabled people from certain careers, for example, in the Defence Forces, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Ambulance Service.  This exclusion feeds into the notion and expectation that disabled people occupy jobs and not careers.  I ask Mr. Flanagan to elaborate on that point and the implications of that kind of exclusion.  What should the Government do differently?</p><p>Mr. Flanagan highlighted that time efficiency is the greatest barrier, one that is often cited as a reason for a disabled person not getting a job.  I ask him to discuss that a little in order that members can fully understand it as an obstacle.  Does it have to do with misunderstanding and assumptions?  I ask Mr. Flanagan to elaborate.</p><p>The importance of personal assistance support and the challenge in accessing it come up very often at this committee.  I ask Mr. Flanagan to give us an overview of the personal assistance system and how difficult it is to get funding for personal assistants and to recruit them. </p><p>Mr. Murphy discussed the importance of building links with local employers in west Cork to create employment opportunities.  Will he outline how those relationships were developed?  Did the National Learning Network have to overcome or address any assumptions or obstacles on the part of businesses and companies?  If so, how were they overcome?  What advice would Mr. Murphy give to other organisations or individuals seeking employment?</p><p>The ILMI outlined that the lack of public transport, especially in rural areas, is a significant barrier.  The committee has heard about this issue previously.  Can we get a sense, perhaps from lived experience, of how this barrier impacts on people?  Will Mr. Porter give us some more information on his experience of the training course and outline how it helped him?</p><p>The action plan for apprenticeship has increased inclusion as a main objective, as does the further and training strategies of SOLAS.  Mr. McGrath mentioned that only 2.5% of current apprentices have a self-declared disability and the current percentage in further education and training is unclear.  Will he elaborate on the practical measures SOLAS is currently engaged in to increase the number of disabled people who can undertake an apprenticeship and-or further education and training courses this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.543" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#G00300"><p>On the exclusion of disabled people from certain careers, this is an explicit example of discrimination.  One career that comes to mind is the Defence Forces.  If Ireland had to defend itself against a hostile invasion tomorrow - I hope we will not have to do so but, as we can see, there is plenty of hostility in the world - and I wanted to be a member of the Defence Forces, I have a severe physical impairment and although I may look normal, I cannot hold up a gun so I would not do much good on the front line.  However, I would like to imagine that I might be able to help with strategy.  If I wanted to be a garda, there is no reason to prevent me from becoming an IT expert or criminology expert.  If I wanted to be part of the National Ambulance Service, I might be an excellent co-ordinator or communicator or I might be great at organising the movement or distribution of services.  To explicitly say that these areas of work are automatically off limits to disabled people is unnecessary and unfair.</p> <p>  There are certain jobs that disabled people cannot do.  We are not going to look to do those jobs because we know ourselves when we physically cannot do something.  An example that springs to mind involves a friend of mine whom I have known for years.  I hope he will not mind me referring to him.  He is a huge fan of Airsoft and paintball.  He has a similar condition to me and uses a powered wheelchair.  It has an incredible tank that has been built up over his chair.  He has travelled all over Europe to play paintball and Airsoft.  If this country was down to its last few guys, I am sure he would happily go to the front line and change the paint balls to live ammunition.  He would do what he needed to do.  My point is that there is always a way.  There should be no explicit barriers to deter disabled people from taking up roles in various areas.</p> <p>  On time efficiency being the biggest barrier, that is an issue for the individual.  An individual assigned a piece of work may be concerned that they will not get it done in time to meet a deadline or in the time they wanted to complete it.  It is an issue for a reason and a reality but it can often be the perception of employers.  If it takes a disabled person half a day longer to complete a report, the employer should ask the employee to get the report done half a day earlier.  If there is a more pressing time issue, perhaps someone could assist the employee.  If the task cannot be completed in time, the person should be given different work to do.</p><p>There is always a way to adapt to maximise the ability of somebody rather than focusing on the limitations.  Time efficiency is valuable perhaps in respect of time efficiency travel.  I was here late today by ten or 15 minutes which was due to traffic more than anything else.  I spent a great amount of time this morning trying to ensure I would be on time or early and sometimes things come up and just get in the way, and perhaps more so for myself than for somebody else.  That is something that we just have to adapt to, be aware of, and be willing to accommodate.  If we are willing to accommodate the issues, there is no issue.</p><p> Can Deputy Cairns remind me of her third question, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#H00200"><p>I believe it was about the personal assistant, PA, support.  It is something that comes up a great deal and it can be a difficult process to get that for a person.</p></speech>

I would not be here talking to the committee today without him.  He helped me get up this morning, to get into the van, and drove me here.  It was not his fault that we were late but it really was the traffic lights.  I forgot my laptop and he ran back outside and was able to get it so I was not here even later.  Without Bruno and the team of PAs that I have working with me, I would not have gone to college and might not have gone through secondary school education as easily as I did.  I would not have the life I have now, which is a very personal observation.  It is the same for anybody else who has a personal assistant service.</p> <p>  There are so many people who do not have the level of assistance and support they need.  The average amount of personal assistance per day that a disabled person in Ireland has is 47 minutes.  I will not even go in to what people need because it is so unique and different but there is such a small number of people who have the level of support equivalent to what I or some of my peers would have in order to be able to live independently on their terms.  It is just not good enough.  Without it people cannot live their lives.  It is as simple as that.  No statistics or testimonies should be needed to justify the increase in spending or the provision of what is needed for people to be able to live their lives because that is a basic human right.</p></speech>

I will copper-fasten what Mr. Flanagan has said.  In a previous life I managed the Centre for Independent Living in Limerick.  Having a PA is transformative and it allows people to live full inclusive lives and I echo all of his sentiments in that regard.</p> <p>  On the employer&rsquo;s side of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, we work very hard to build relationships.  We are involved in chambers of commerce, business associations and, perhaps, in rural areas it is easier to build those links than in urban areas.  We work very hard at getting to know the main employers in an area and building very strong relationships with the management and human resources, HR, structures in their organisations.  It becomes a trust thing.  As I said, we have quite an extensive database of employers who we can call upon for employment and work experience options, and so on.  We work hard at this.  </p> <p>  More generally speaking, there should be more national awareness campaigns around employer&rsquo;s obligations and the benefits in employing people with disabilities within their organisation, in the diversity that brings and how it helps their organisations.  Does that answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question?</p></speech>

I did the employment skills training and the employer-based training also.  We are so similar as nations in that we may look alike and speak the same language but when I first got here, culturally I found it was something of a challenge and for many years I struggled to fit in.  My time with NLN helped me to assimilate better, granted me the ability to function more in society, and in a better way than I did before.  It has worked out great with my current employer as it keeps asking me to come back.  I do not know why but I must be doing something right.</p></speech>

To become an apprentice, you must be employed before you are in the education system for part of your programme.  The good news is that they are employed.</p> <p>I was struck where jobs and not careers were mentioned by Deputy Tully.  The aim of the programme is to set a person up for a career. If one is an electrical apprentice or is in one of the new information technology, IT, programmes, the goal is to set one up with an employer to make a career in that area.  Obviously, people change and continue to grow and that is something that we are working on.</p> <p>  A key part of having more people with disabilities in apprenticeships and, in further education and training, FET, goes back to Deputy Tully&rsquo;s question about raising awareness with employers, which is completely crucial.  A good bit of work has been done but a job of work still needs to be done.  The plan on the apprenticeship side is to engage with employers this year and to set a baseline, for example, which is one of our aims for participation for people with disabilities.  We need to understand what industry and employment require and are saying and we need to understand then the legislative requirements for them to support someone participating in employment.  That will be done.</p> <p>  As to some practical measures, with the National Apprenticeship Office, which is a construct of SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, together, is setting up an equity of access committee to support and advise it on delivering the action plan for apprenticeship recommendations, which includes specific actions around disability.  That will be important because it will have the key people telling that office what is required.</p> <p>  On broader supports, incentives have worked in other areas of apprenticeships.  During the pandemic, for example, we introduced an incentive for people to be employed and that could be used to increase participation with disabilities.  I am glad to say that there is an action in there to develop a bursary for people with disabilities, as there is for gender bursaries.</p><p> On the further education and training side, we fund education and training boards to support all learners, including people with disabilities.  We are trying to embed universal design for learning, which was mentioned by colleagues and which involves removing as many barriers as possible so the system is accessible to all.  We also provide wraparound supports where required, including personal assistance and those kinds of things.  The fund for students with disabilities has been introduced for post-leaving certificate and other learners in further education and training.  In 2020, we introduced a mitigating disadvantage fund.</p><p> On the transport comment, it is not a replacement but during Covid and shut-down when people had to go more or less remote and online, the mitigating disadvantage fund made sure devices were available to all learners to ensure they could continue their education, engage with their tutors and other learners.  Those are some of the practical measures introduced in the past year or two.</p></speech>

Of all the topics we discuss at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, employment is the one that gets me the most because it crosses everything.  It is about valuing yourself.  As someone who was out of work and looking for a job for a long time, I know it gets you down and makes you feel you are not there and not at the races.  To use the word they use now, it triggers me.  It is important that we work hard to listen and learn as much as possible.</p> <p>  So much has been covered this morning.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on moving disability payments from the Department of Social Protection to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment when you are working?  What do they think about a cost of disability payment to enable people to go out to work?  We know there is a higher cost of going to work for those with a disability.</p> <p>  My next comments are addressed to Mr. Flanagan.  There are fantastic programmes throughout the country.  I have a major problem with the fact it is personality-led.  Mr.  Flanagan is leading it in his area.  There is no streamlined focus nationally.  Mr. Porter did well and is lucky he went to Bantry.  In other areas there is not so much because it is personality.  Mr. Porter worked and got the bus service but there is a lack of streamlining.  It is confusing.  There are EmployAbility, Intreo and the witnesses' organisations.  Where does one go?  There is a need for possibly the NDA to look at this so, for someone who needs help and asks where they go, it is not boxed off in loads of different areas.</p> <p>  Mr. McGrath mentioned the gender-specific funding and the ongoing review on disability.  Is that review looking at specific funding for positively discriminating towards people with disability in apprenticeships.  In the SOLAS report, there are funds for students with disabilities of nearly &euro;400,000.  What is that fund?  Is it supports, assistive technology or grant aid?</p> <p>  Probably because of the confusion and lack of streamlining, there are huge barriers to people entering education and training.  I have a situation in which a young woman is battling with the HSE for funding and supports to get into a training course.  Therein lies another problem.  She has the training course.  If we had a streamlined system, a person with disabilities who needs to get to point A would not have to beg the HSE for something and make a business case.  Maybe that is a question for the NDA as well.  We are looking at personality all the time, who you meet along the way someone and if you have someone who is conscious of the needs of someone with disabilities.</p> <p>  I ask representatives from the NDA if there is a breakdown of the type of disabilities across the public sector.  Is there any accountability or has the NDA looked at making people accountable where they fail to make reasonable accommodations in the public sector?  I have seen many cases where people are not getting reasonable accommodations in our public sector and Civil Service.  They are afraid to go to their trade unions or management because there will be prejudice against them.  They have nowhere to go.  Is there something the authority has looked at to make the public sector accountable and not allow prejudice towards people who try to make the sector accountable?</p></speech>

On the previous discussion, as well as awareness-raising campaigns that have been mentioned, it is worth thinking about the area of peer-to-peer support for employers, where they can get advice and information from other employers and organisations and where they may feel more confident and at ease asking questions about their fears or attitudes.  There is a programme called employers for change being funded on a year-to-year basis by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The research we funded with the OECD last year talked about how the area of peer-to-peer support is important to employers across Europe and how a scaled and sustainable solution in the Irish context would be well worth pursuing.</p> <p>  Turning to Senator McGreehan's questions, there is no breakdown of disability type across public sector figures because it is a voluntary sharing of disability data under Part 5 of the Disability Act.  We collect anonymised data.  We do not want to make it challenging for people to share their disability and once you start breaking down by disability type, that is a risk.  We are in the process of reviewing the Part 5 data-collection process and will be piloting new ways of collecting data over the next 18 months and new ways of collecting more information, to see what is feasible in this regard.</p> <p>  We can do a breakdown of disability type in employment from CSO or census figures.  The latest data is from 2016 but will be refreshed later this year.  It shows that people with intellectual disabilities have the lowest rate of employment while people with deafness or a serious hearing impairment have the highest rate of employment among people with disability.</p> <p>  We have monitoring duty in relation to public sector employment.  We do not have powers of compulsion or enforcement.  That is often a point of frustration for many.  We engage with public bodies consistently throughout the year, particularly where they are falling below the compliance target.  We engage with them intensively to offer guidance and support on how they can increase performance in relation to Part 5.  Where employees feel they have been discriminated against or reasonable accommodation has not been applied, they, like private sector employees, have the option of taking the case to the Workplace Relations Commission.  We appreciate that is a daunting prospect for people and a route they may not wish to go down, but those routes are open.</p><p>As my colleague, Ms Wilkinson, said earlier, the ability to apply for reasonable accommodation funding within the public sector would be well worth exploring as part of this review because it would be a further support for public sector employees.  Our approach is to guide, advise, support and provide examples of good practice so employers can see what has been achieved and accomplished in the past and therefore understand what is feasible for themselves.</p><p> The Senator spoke about the need for streamlining and joined-up thinking.  We are involved in a number of cross-departmental working groups that are being convened to achieve just that.  For example, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is convening a working group on transitions.  It also has a working group on transport supports and assistive technology supports, all in the context of employment.  We sit on these groups in our advisory capacity and we conduct research to help inform the deliberations of the group.  That is the kind of work the NDA does, seeing the practices, challenges and barriers that are out there, and we carry that knowledge in all our work and from group to group.  That helps with some of that knowledge transfer and streamlined thinking the Senator is calling for.  It is important that the departmental actors can move forward on solution-finding.  It is ongoing work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.568" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#K00200"><p>The answer to the Senator's question is "Yes".  There is a specific action in the Government's plan for apprenticeships to support people with disabilities and other priority groups, which may include lone parents and people from ethnic minorities.  A bursary will be developed and provided for that.  In broader terms, there is support in further education and training in two ways.  One is system-level supports to help embed an inclusive system that removes the barriers at source for people accessing education and training.  Outside of that there are more individual supports, whether personal support or other learning supports that are required.  Ms Doherty can give a bit of detail on that.  Regarding the public sector, there is a target in the action plan for apprenticeships to recruit 750 apprentices per annum through the public sector system.  That includes public sector bodies like county councils.  The Department of Education has also hired people in recent years doing IT jobs, as electricians, or whatever the case may be.  The plan is very clear that that will go up dramatically to 750 a year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.569" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roisin Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#K00300"><p>We are looking at it from a systems perspective but critical to that is ensuring there is a commitment at a high strategic level. I am delighted that there is an inclusion goal in both the Department's strategy and the FET strategy because that allows for resources to be dedicated to it.  Without having that at that strategic level it would not get achieved quite as well.  The question is what we have done or are trying to do to make it more inclusive.  That was a recommendation of the NDA's report with the OECD, to make sure the system is more inclusive.  We have taken a number of measures such as implementing universal design across the entire system.  We have funded a number of organisations to support us in that regard which have that expertise.  We also had an interdepartmental, cross-community and cross-sector committee to help us and guide us in that approach.  We now have that embedded in the system through our funding systems and significant numbers of practitioners have been trained in the universal design digital badge.  We are working with UCD and the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, AHEAD, this year to put in place a digital badge for learner support.</p> <p>  What Mr. McGrath was saying is that we ultimately need to move a system where everybody feels they belong.  The one barrier to participation is when people feel it is not their place and do not fit in but if they feel they fit in they will thrive.  It is about that ethos.  As Mr. McGrath said, significant developments have been made in that area.  The fund for students with disabilities is now &euro;4 million and the learner support general allocation is &euro;6 million.  That is integrating the universal design approach for engagement with learning representation and that model of learning.  The mitigating education disadvantage fund will roll out this year as well.</p> <p>  We also fund other organisations to help the system become more inclusive.  This year we are working with Down Syndrome Ireland because we have identified that certain priority cohorts are over-represented in some of our programmes, such as the literacy programmes.  People are participating in those programmes for ten years to maintain their skill.  We are trying to break that cycle and put in the supports at an earlier stage, such as when people are transitioning from school.  We have six programmes rolling out in a number of counties, funded by ETBs, with regard to Down Syndrome Ireland.  We are delighted to work on that.  We also work with Dyslexia Association of Ireland and make sure supports are available for further education.  The Trinity College intellectual disabilities programme has been successful in demonstrating that there is progression.</p> <p>  I know the focus of today's meeting today's focus is employment but a factor that has come to our attention over the last number of years is the fact that one in every two people is blocked from participation due to a lack of digital skills, numeracy and literacy.  We have a new ten-year adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy, which will ensure those who are locked out of any participation can now progress, have full participation and become more familiar with literacy, numeracy and digital skills.  It is not just about that but about access to digital assistive technology that will help as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#K00400"><p>I agree with the point that many of the services and supports we rely on come from Departments or organisations that are personality-led, and that there are too many of them.  That is true with regard to getting work supports, transport or PAs.  There are too many different areas.  To standardise that and enshrine that in law and policy would be a huge step forward.  As I am sure members will be aware, ILMI has been very prominent in the last number of years in the #PASNOW campaign and the drive to legally recognise the right of disabled people to personal assistants.  Actions like that, as well other key supports beyond that, would go a long way to normalising and equalising what is provided to people because at the moment there are too many personalities and too many Departments.  It is too disjointed.  The personal assistance service comes from the HSE while the disability allowance comes from the Department of Social Protection.  I imagine any other employment supports come from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the Department of Social Protection.  Transport issues are dealt with by the Department of Transport.  I may have to go back to the Department of Education regarding my qualifications and if there are any issues with that I have to raise them with the Department of Justice.  It is a maze or a crazy labyrinth we have to navigate to get any of the supports we want, particularly with regard to employment.  It is a major issue.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about moving the disability allowance to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  If it was moved to another Department we would still have work around other areas such as the HSE.  We need something like a centralised Department for disability, where all these key supports and actions could be taken in relation to disability.  That Department could support and advise other Departments, much in the same way the NDA does, but with that legislative power Senator Conway spoke about earlier.  That might be a suitable approach.</p></speech>

There is a plethora of stuff to deal with and even as someone working in the area, it is hard to navigate and keep abreast of.</p><p>It is changing.  There is ongoing change all of the time so it is very hard for an ordinary Joe Soap on the street who is looking to get access to something to find out where you get it.  It is really hard.  What is the solution?  I was listening to the NDA representatives talking about the cross-departmental group they are working on.  Perhaps something may come out of that but, as has been said, there are so many actors on the stage that it is very difficult to get that type of joined-up thinking.  I do not have a solution but there is absolutely no doubt that it is a problem.  I have one suggestion but I can make it at the end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.573" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#L00200"><p>I have been listening to what has been said and I have heard a number of words such as "exploring", "reviewing" and "piloting".  Mr. Flanagan spoke about the fragmented approach to the delivery of employment services for people with disabilities.  As a public representative, if I was approached by people with disabilities about finding work, which I have been, I would not know where to steer them to get advice and to get onto a system.  We have a fragmented approach.  We have people sitting on bodies, boards and whatever else, going to meetings and bringing experience from one meeting to another but, ultimately, there is too much of that going on.  Too much money is being spent on all of the policies, reviews and whatever else without actually getting results.  The NDA indicated that there must be 15,000 additional disabled people between the ages of 20 and 64 in work by the end of 2024.  We will probably have to wait until the analysis is done on the 2022 census to see where we are going with that.  It beggars belief that we do not have a system to look at all of the money that is going out and the outcomes we are getting from it.  Who controls the annual statistics on employment within the disability sector?  If we have to wait for the census every five years, things will pass us by and we will end up analysing the results for the five years until the next census comes along without actually doing work.</p> <p>  SOLAS has put a number of apprenticeships out there and is dealing with them.  There are additional apprenticeships in play in biopharmaceuticals, the digital area and so on, but the information is not out there.  People do not know about these things.  I do not want another agency hired in to do something about that.  It is time to stop posturing about these things.  We need a system whereby each year all bodies getting funding in respect of employment or whatever it is return a report to the funding body detailing the outcomes, that is, the number of people who benefited and by how much.  It should include details on whether the employment is temporary, whether it is part-time or full-time and the area of work involved.  We need hard facts to understand what is going on here.</p> <p>  From talking to people who have disabilities, it is my understanding that they just do not know where to go.  It is important that we grasp this now.  We have to measure what we are doing rather than keep doing what we are doing, which is, from what I have heard all morning, reviewing, piloting, exploring and putting together working groups and strategies.  If that man in Bantry, whose name eludes me at the moment, is not there to help the people down there and if he is telling me that he is finding it hard to get information on how to deal with people despite him being at the coalface, we are really and truly not going anywhere fast.  We have targets to meet but it seems we are not setting any annual targets.  We are not measuring we have actually achieved the targets we have.  We are not taking any corrective action where they are not being achieved.  We are spending a lot of money on nothing.  At the end of the day, we need to make sure that, if there is money available for apprenticeships, there are banners outside of SOLAS offices saying that people with disabilities are welcome on courses and will be assisted.  There needs to be a contact number given and people need to be brought in, interviewed and put on an apprenticeship course.  It is as simple as that.  We have to put the resources into that rather than into reviews, pilots, explorations, strategies and meetings all over the place.  I am frustrated listening to what I have heard this morning.  I feel for the people who have disabilities if they are listening to this.</p> <p>  We have a number of witnesses here today.  They all have a niche in this game but the people who really matter are those with the disabilities.  From a Government point of view, at this stage, we have to put our hands up and say that, because a person with a disability has additional expenses of up to &euro;12,000 a year, if they are brave enough and want to take up employment, we will not cut their disability allowance until we know they are in gainful employment.  We need to make sure that happens.  We want to transition people away from being supported by the State.  Under the UN convention, they have a right to work.  We need to do that not by talking about barriers, strategies, reviews and whatever, but by getting on with the bloody job we are supposed to do.  I will leave it at that.  Perhaps the witnesses will have some comments for me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aideen Hartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#L00300"><p>Capturing and updating data is challenging and time-consuming.  Obviously, the census is only taken every five years.  The 2022 census will tell us how far we have travelled since 2016 and how much further we have to go before the end of the lifetime of the comprehensive employment strategy.  However, there are ways of measuring progress between censuses.  There are other survey instruments, such as the survey on income and living conditions and the labour force survey, that are carried out at other intervals and which can be used as a check.  The Central Statistics Office is also engaged in a number of pathfinder projects with relevant Departments to use administrative data that would not be captured in something like the census to give us a picture of what is out there.  There are other data points that can be used as indicators of progress or lack thereof.  Part of our role is to explore and look at these.  One of the ongoing challenges is just getting public bodies to capture and gather data about disability.  We are very much encouraging all public bodies to continue to do that.  The next three-year action plan for the comprehensive employment strategy is being developed at the moment.  There is a push to include some clear targets in that.  I hope we will see good progress in that.</p> <p>  On the range of different Departments and public bodies that people need to engage with, that is indeed challenging and frustrating.  It is borne out of the Government policy of mainstreaming whereby every Department should offer its services for all who live in Ireland regardless of ability or disability so that it is not deemed a specialist service to offer.  That is what lies behind the principle of universal design.  I will pass to my colleague, Ms Wilkinson, who has some examples of good practice with regard to referrals and protocols between some public bodies that could be applied more widely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.575" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marion Wilkinson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#L00400"><p>There has been NDA work in this area and the OECD made some findings last year.  Bearing in mind that, as Dr. Hartney said, the Government strategy of mainstreaming is really important, the OECD suggested that the main port of call when looking for work, further education or training is when you access your Intreo office.  At that point, you are referred to what is available in your region or if you aspire to further or higher education, guidance is provided.</p><p>However, the clear recommendation colleagues here have spoken about is that there are referral processes from Intreo, SOLAS and further education and training providers and that there are protocols established that support people where they are, that is, what level of educational attainment they have and where they want to go.  One of the key findings from our work is exactly as Deputy Canney mentioned, that is, that people are unaware of what is available.  When the NDA spoke to SOLAS about the review of specialist training provision, we mentioned how people are referred to specialist training because it is a key part of the transition from education into further education and training, jumping from whatever one's QQI level is on leaving school and having a direct transition pathway into what is available locally that one can be supported to take.  We understand absolutely that there is a body of work to make that a practical, seamless direction for people with disabilities and their families.  In that regard, the NDA is working on a piece of work on career guidance in order that the route into employment starts not the day someone leaves school but a lot earlier in that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.577" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022051900002#M00200"><p>I agree with the point Deputy Canney made about the need for things to be much clearer to disabled people.  Mainstreaming is both a positive and a negative in this regard.  Ideally, the disabled person just applies for a job and goes into whatever service or department he or she needs to get support or information, the same as anybody else does.  The issue is that disabled people do not come from a point of equality at the start.  If things are provided for us that allow us to go in as equals to seek those supports, if we know we are not disadvantaged by our economic status or our current education status, and if what we need is afforded to us before we go in there, we can reasonably expect mainstreaming to work.  If, however, the disability supports to minimise the impact of some of the impairments or limitations that come with disability are not in place in the first instance, mainstreaming will not work because people with disabilities come in at too different a point in their lives or too late to be able to expect the same benefits as somebody else going in.</p></speech>

From the NDA's perspective, there is no doubt but that mainstreaming is driving the agenda.  As Mr. Flanagan said, there are arguments for and against it.  Sometimes things are lost in translation when everything is boxed off into individual departments, as are the cross-fertilisation and the information exchange between them.  I understand the principle and why it goes that way, but it creates a lot of problems.</p> <p>  I will make a final point.  Perhaps the committee could consider bringing in employers who have experience of the wage subsidy scheme and of employing people with disabilities to inform the committee's deliberations at some stage.  I could suggest some people who might talk to the committee about that.</p></speech>

I thank one and all for their detailed contributions this morning.  Some of the evidence we have heard recently, particularly on employment, shows the fear among people who have a disability and who are on benefits of going into employment and losing those benefits.  It was mentioned that the medical card is crucial and gold.  We hear that week in, week out.  We really need to zone in on it.  We have looked at transport, but it is also a matter of navigating Government Departments and State agencies, getting the best possible outcomes, whether in Bantry, in the large urban centres or wherever else, and trying to knit it all together.  It takes a huge amount of work to knit it together to provide the best service for people with disabilities.  We thank the witnesses for the honesty of their evidence and the way they have answered Members this morning.  If there are any issues they think we have not dealt with or about which they wish to make further points, they should feel free to send us further information on them.  The difficulty we have is that when we address some issues, we put another layer of bureaucracy onto the system rather than seeing if it can be knitted into the existing system to make it less cumbersome and less difficult for people with disabilities and the organisations that support them to access funding.  We will look at that and we will certainly take up Mr. Flanagan's point about employers because that is a perspective we need to get as well as we go forward.  I thank one and all for being present this morning, including those who have us joined online, our members for their dedication week in, week out, the witnesses for their time and efforts on this and our team here, who keep us on the straight and narrow every week.</p> <p>  We have a private meeting at 3.15 p.m. on Monday afternoon to go through the work schedule and maybe some of the issues that have arisen recently.</p></speech>

In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, please note that the Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, and to adhere to public health advice.</p> <p>  Today's meeting will be in two sessions.  In the first session, we will discuss with the Minister for Education, Deputy Norma Foley, the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality on norms and stereotypes and education, recommendations 26 to 31.  In the second session, beginning at 11 a.m., we will meet with Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan and representatives of women in research Ireland to discuss the same topic.</p> <p>  I offer a warm welcome to the Minister, Deputy Foley, and her officials from the Department of Education.  We are very grateful to her for engaging with us.  The Minister is accompanied by Mr. Dalton Tattan, assistant secretary general, management board; Mr. Martin McLaughlin, principal officer, initial teacher education and professional development; Ms Orlaith O&rsquo;Connor, assistant chief inspector, inspectorate; Ms Karen Murtagh, assistant principal officer, curriculum and assessment policy unit, and Mr. Ronan Kielt, assistant principal officer, curriculum and assessment policy unit.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make them identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on the Minister, Deputy Foley, to make an opening statement.  I will then open the floor to members for questions and answers.  We very much appreciate the Minister joining us.  We have taken a view as a committee that the 45 recommendations of the citizens' assembly will be taken as a blueprint for the achievement of gender equality in Ireland.  We are taking a practical approach and hope to produce an action plan by the end of our term, which will be this December, as to how those recommendations may be implemented.  We are grateful to the Minister for engaging with us on the recommendations that are specifically related to the Department of Education, that is, recommendations 26 to 31, on norms and stereotypes of education.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge that it is very positive for the Department of Education.</p> <p>  I am pleased to be before the Joint Committee on Gender Equality to discuss the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality regarding norms and stereotypes in education.  At the outset, I would like commend the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality that culminated in the production of this important report, setting out 45 recommendations across eight themes and successfully doing so against the backdrop of the pandemic, which was a great achievement.  It is positive that the assembly and this report have done such a comprehensive and wide-ranging review of this important issue.  I know the committee is continuing to engage with a number of Ministers and Departments in relation to recommendations which have been made in their fields, and I am pleased to be here today on behalf of the Department of Education.  As the Chair outlined, I am joined by a number of Department officials.</p> <p>  A core value of the curriculum from early years to post-primary level in Ireland is equality, inclusivity and diversity.  Across all levels of schooling it aims to foster inclusivity where gender equality and diversity are promoted.  It must cater equally for all learners, from all backgrounds, regardless of gender, socioeconomic background, race or creed.  All curricular developments use extensive engagement with stakeholders, something which has significant benefits in ensuring that as curriculums and materials are updated, they reflect latest developments and best practices across the board.</p> <p>  To provide for a fully inclusive curriculum in our schools, it is vitally important that we work to support our student teachers and serving teachers through teacher education programmes and supports.  Our staff make our curriculum come alive in the classroom and I know they need the support to provide fully inclusive teaching and learning experiences for our children and young people based on all of the principles of equality, including gender equity.</p> <p>  As committee members will be aware, questions of equality, respect, and diversity are part of all elements of the curriculum, and it is for this reason the Department and the Teaching Council have now designated inclusive education as a key component of all initial teacher education provision.  Initial teacher providers are now in the process of re-accrediting their programmes.  The term "inclusive education" refers to any aspect of teachers' learning aimed at improving their capacity to address and respond to the diversity of learners' needs; to enable their participation in learning; and to remove barriers to education through the accommodation and provision of appropriate structures and arrangements, in order to enable each learner to achieve the maximum benefit from his or her attendance at school.  Many of our teachers and teacher training colleges are already undertaking very positive and strong work in this regard, and these new standards will underpin this work.</p> <p>  Ensuring all students have access to positive, inclusive, and high-quality guidance is equally and hugely important.  In respect of gender equality in particular, high-quality guidance can help students to see the full range of careers and options that are available to them, irrespective of their own background.  In the context of developing a coherent long-term strategic framework for lifelong guidance, my Department will aim to improve on this and to promote initial and continuous training for guidance professionals and other staff with a particular focus on strengthening cultural and gender sensitive guidance and counselling.  Indeed, guidance counsellors are trained and alert to the need to promote a diverse range of gender-neutral education, training and career path options.</p> <p>  Members will also be aware that there is a particular focus on subjects, such as social, personal and health education, SPHE, in supporting students&rsquo; holistic development and ensuring that our schools are inclusive and positive environments for all.  SPHE is a mandatory curriculum subject in primary and post-primary and seeks to ensure that all students are supported in making positive choices and in developing positive and respectful relationships and respect for others.  Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students.  Relationship and sexual education, RSE, is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle.  As members are undoubtedly aware, there is significant reform under way in respect of RSE and SPHE in order to ensure that these curricula reflect the needs of our students, best practice, and are inclusive of all.</p> <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has undertaken a major review of RSE across all stages of education to ensure it is fit-for-purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland.  Establishing two subject development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area, the immediate focus of the work of the NCCA has been on creating support materials for teachers as part of an interim guidance toolkit, providing practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.</p><p> In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE-RSE curriculum for primary, junior cycle and senior cycle is under way.  A draft revised junior cycle specification is due to be agreed at the NCCA meeting in early summer, with a public consultation to follow.  The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of the year.  Preparation to update the senior cycle SPHE-RSE specification has commenced.  The senior cycle development will now be charged with preparing a background paper.  This group will prepare a background paper and brief that will form the basis of its work of redeveloping the senior cycle specification.  Work on the primary curriculum framework will be published in 2023 with individual subject specifications being introduced to schools thereafter.  Learning pertaining to RSE in primary school will be addressed within the curricular areas of well-being and social, personal and values education.</p><p> The Department continues to work with the Department of Justice in formulating and implementing the third national strategy for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  As well as the work being carried out to develop and update SPHE-RSE curricula, this will also be achieved by building on continuing professional development, CPD, and anti-bullying procedures.</p><p> The Department&rsquo;s STEM Education Policy Statement 2017&ndash;2026 acknowledges the need to achieve gender balance in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, education and careers.  It aims to increase the numbers of students, in particular females, taking STEM subjects at post-primary level and to ensure that all schools, learners and parents have access to high-quality information on the diversity of STEM careers.  Earlier this year, I published Recommendations on Gender Balance in STEM Education.  The recommendations point to the need to support equitable learner access to and experiences of STEM in order to inspire learning, foster creativity and prepare for later engagement and success.  The recommendations will be included in the new STEM implementation plan for the period 2022-2026, which I expect to publish over the summer, with roles and responsibility and timelines set against each one.</p><p> As members of the committee will no doubt be aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a citizens&rsquo; assembly on the future of education, ensuring that the voices of young people and those being educated are central.  We can all see the valuable insights and recommendations previous citizens&rsquo; assemblies, including that on gender equality, have given us.  I look forward to the citizens&rsquo; assembly on the future of education commencing shortly.</p><p> I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to discuss these important recommendations.  I assure it that my Department will continue to work across Government to ensure that we respond to each of the recommendations.</p></speech>

It touches on quite a number of themes in the recommendations.  I invite members to contribute.  Deputy Clarke indicated first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.589" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister and her officials for giving of their time this morning.  Their engagement here is very productive and most welcome.  It makes our job as a committee much more rounded and, hopefully, much more impactful as we continue our work.</p> <p>  The Minister and I share the same opinion on the importance of citizens&rsquo; assemblies.  However, implementation is key in respect of them, regardless of the topic to which they relate.  I have a few questions specifically relating to the RSE curriculum.  We heard last week from the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, and from Mr. David Byrne, a research scholar in Technological University, TU, Dublin.  They would have very different lived experiences from what the Minister outlined as being the plan.  The ISSU's presentation stated "if a young woman is attending school and that school doesn't offer woodwork or technology or engineering, well then that young woman is significantly less likely to explore those career paths, because they're not available to her now so why could they be available to her in the future?"  That statement very much captures what we have also heard from the third level education providers, namely, that there is a significant block in terms of access to more rounded options at second level for all pupils.  As such, it is having a significant impact on the career options, especially of younger women where they are not eligible for a career path because they have not had the opportunity to undertake certain leaving certificate subjects and so on.</p> <p>  The Minister touched on STEM education.  My first question is specific to that area.  Why are there no all-girl Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools piloting the new computer science course?  I find that concerning, and it is something of which we must be aware.  That is obviously quite a gap.  Is the way we approach these subjects impacting on how schools would apply or express an interest in piloting any new STEM course that is available?</p> <p>  The Minister touched briefly on the RSE curriculum.  The NCCA review found that there was considerable variation in the provision of RSE across schools in terms of what is being taught and who is teaching it.  We know there have been cases of schools that have not engaged in a process of providing certain levels of education.  What mechanisms are in place in the Department of Education to monitor the implementation of the RSE curriculum?  Does the Minister believe that the implementation of the curriculum is standardised?  If not, what actions does the Department take to ensure it will be?  Regarding the NCCA completing the development of the new RSE syllabus, the review found massive differences in how that is delivered.  Why is that taking so long?  The review has been carried out.  We know what it is that needs to happen, so what is the delay in it being implemented?</p> <p>  Another issue that arose in a number of our engagements is that there appears to be no formal training or curriculum requirement for teachers providing SPHE or RSE or pre-service gender and diversity-related training.  This issue arose at our meeting last week at which we were told by a witness that "Worryingly, it is ... apparent that SPHE may sometimes be assigned to a teacher based on their balance of available teaching hours, as opposed to their expertise in the subject."  Will the Minister also address that issue?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.591" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#B00500"><p>The Deputy raised issues around STEM.  In the first instance, I want to be very clear that we all understand it is extremely important young females see themselves as being fully participative in all STEM subjects and areas.  There is a strong and ambitious programme of work set out in the Department&rsquo;s STEM education policy statement.  I recently published the gender balance in STEM education advisory group's report.  It contains a number of significant aims and objectives, including to continue to focus on gender balance and equity and inclusion in the review of all our curriculum specifications and to focus on everything from language to visuals to examples of programmes.  We are involved in a significant number of initiatives, whether it be Science Foundation Ireland or the discovery primary science and maths programme, which the Department is supporting with an investment to the tune of &euro;500,000.  Also, that includes engaging with families in STEM programmes, encouraging the greatest visibility possible for our students.  The Deputy specifically raised the issue of promoting STEM education in our schools.  There is a major commitment in our schools to promote girls to participate in the uptake of all STEM areas.</p> <p>  Regarding the computer science course, schools had an option, as they will have as we move forward in terms of senior cycle reform. to become the pilot or network schools.  The Deputy specifically referenced DEIS students.  It is a matter for schools to put themselves forward for the pilot programmes.  Specifically on the targeted encouragement of STEM education in DEIS schools, we have significant programmes such as the STEM passport for inclusion, which is very much targeted at girls in schools of disadvantage, both DEIS and non-DEIS schools.  It is a significant programme, which I have observed, whereby girls are supported, encouraged and mentored into the world of STEM.  That programme is anchored by Maynooth University, in partnership also with the Munster Technological University, MTU, and students have done the most terrific work in that regard.  I witnessed that last week.</p><p>That is just one of the examples of flagship programmes we have specifically aimed at disadvantage and the encouragement of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM.</p><p> On the review of the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme and how it has taken so much time, there has been a significant amount of public consultation, including with students, parents, and a wider public consultation.  As members will be aware, the specifications for junior cycle will be published imminently and there will be a final round of public consultation before implementation in 2023.  Work has commenced in the scoping of the senior cycle RSE programme.  The primary curriculum framework will be published in 2023, subject to specifications thereafter.  I acknowledge that within our schools we have very caring, very bright and very ambitious staff who want the very best for their students.  Excellent work is being delivered on the ground.  There is, however, an acknowledgement that we need to have a curriculum that is current and up-to-date, and as relevant to our students as necessary.  This is why all of this work is going into the updating of the specifications around RSE.  In the interim, a very significant toolkit of supports has been made available to our schools, covering a whole range of topics and areas of interest that are current and inclusive, and which are important in bridging the gap between what is currently there and what we envisage will be there on completion of the specifications.</p><p> I will turn now to the formal training of staff in social, personal and health education, SPHE.  I come from a background of schools and have worked for a long time in schools.  I absolutely understand that where staff do not have significant encouragement and knowledge of a particular topic, they will not feel they have the confidence to deliver it.  I am very pleased to have announced in the last weeks a new programme to bring on stream a postgraduate programme, which will be fully funded by the Department, that will offer opportunity to our staff to be fully trained in the areas of SPHE and RSE.  This is in addition to the continuing professional development that is available.  Specifically, there will be a diploma qualification, funded by the Department.  This will, in the first instance, increase capacity and also leadership and confidence in the delivery in this area of education.  I agree with the Deputy that this has been lacking.  As ever, in all things and not just in education, where we feel there is a lack then we must jump in and we must move forward.  I recognise this as something that is wanted.  I am very pleased that we have announced it.  I am very confident that we will have a significant uptake from schools in that regard.</p><p> With RSE in our schools, it is important there would be equality in the programme being offered.  We have our inspectorate, which has oversight of all that is being implemented in our schools, and which regularly inspects what is happening in our schools.  Equally, I want to be very clear that access to RSE and SPHE is an absolute and important right for all of our students.  The curriculum is there, the information is there, and the factual curriculum and information must be implemented, notwithstanding that we are in the throes of updating the curriculum across primary and post primary, and the different levels within that again.</p></speech>

I am aware that this is an important issue for the Minister.  She has outlined her commitment around STEM, and access for girls in particular, and I could not disagree with anything she said about any of the work that she has done in this regard.</p><p>In the past we have seen a very low take-up of apprenticeships by girls.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, said that 5% was the legacy for girls going into apprenticeships.  I believe we need a joined up approach between primary, secondary and tertiary education.  I am aware that work is under way.  It would be a good opportunity to outline that with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and with the Minister's own announcements about leaving certificate reform.  This would be reflected in that.  Is there more work that could be done before that around having more mentorship and an approach that is more akin to transition year but going right through all of the years so that it is much more hands-on?  We have a legacy in the State of, quite rightly, thinking that third level education is something we all want to have available to everyone.  There is a certain image of what third level education looks like but we are a very different society now.  Those would be my first couple of questions.</p><p>I am glad the Minister addressed the SPHE question.  That issue strongly came up when Mr. David Byrne of the Technological University Dublin appeared before the committee last week.  Mr. Byrne specifically mentioned that it did not appear to be accredited and that this was a concern.  It is important to see how this is being addressed.  I am very happy to see that there are times now for the conclusion of the work on the RSE programme.  At this stage it is hard to say what that is going to look like, so I will reserve my comments.</p><p>Last week the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU, was quite clear that a lot of people are getting their information online and they do not feel there is enough in schools around sexuality education.  Given the ages of students in secondary school, they are crying out for information to be provided in a genuine way.  They are going through a change in their lives and there needs to be joined-up approach.  I mentioned some of the websites available that are actually other Departments' websites.  For example, <i>consenthub.ie</i>is a joint project between the Department of Justice and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Is the Minister looking at ways we could connect with young people when they are through the education system?  There is no point in having a very formalised education in schools that does not speak to young people.  It must be all joined up and the information has to be current and reflective of their lived experiences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#C00400"><p>On apprenticeships, there is a hugely important role in the area of guidance and directing our students, as in the instance referred to by the Senator with girls going into opportunities that heretofore might not have been considered.  We can never underestimate the power and value of guidance in schools.  I was very pleased that one of my first acts as Minister was to ensure the provision of 120 careers guidance posts that would fully restore ex-quota allocations to our schools.  I also acknowledge a programme I launched, the new national policy group, to look at lifelong guidance whereby it is not just something we think of when we are considering post-primary students, and that we very much also look at a younger cohort from preschool right up to primary and on.  There must be a lifelong positive experience around guidance.  The key purpose behind it is to ensure there would be equality, gender fairness and gender opportunity, and the opening up of gender possibilities for all of our students.</p> <p>  With regard to apprenticeships and tasters, members will be aware that we are currently looking at a redrawing of the transition year programme.  It is very much my aim and objective that students would have pre-sample opportunities in the widest realm of experience of STEM and beyond that.</p> <p>  I visit quite a lot of schools and even as recently as yesterday I was in Longford.  Some of the students there had spent time working with a construction company recently.  I was speaking with one of the girls who had done her work experience there.  She was full of the information on how it works and she had actually made the decision that she was not interested in pursuing that.  That was fine.  The important thing was that she had the opportunity to make an informed decision.  This is the direction we are moving in now.  Let every child and young person sample and decide for themselves.</p> <p>  I know how important SPHE is.  It is vitally important that students get the right information from the right professionals and that they get it appropriately.  As I said earlier to Deputy Clarke, this is very much the reason to build that capacity in our schools.</p><p>This new diploma programme will be introduced for that purpose.</p><p> I appreciate what the Senator heard from ISSU and I acknowledge that it has been participative in all that we are doing within the Department.  It sits around the table with us as partners in education and it has been an invaluable resource to us with the experience its members have.  They are the ones who are at the coalface and it is their experience of education that we need to listen to.  Reference has been made to the time it has taken to bring the SPHE and RSE guidelines to the fore and that is because there was an intense consultation process that included the students.  The students were clear about what they needed and they were specific, as the Senator and previous speakers have referenced, that the information should be as current as possible and should meet the lives of students in the 21st century.  That is why we are putting an incredible amount of weight on what they have said and why we are looking at ways of introducing that into our curriculum.  As I have said previously we have introduced the toolkit as an interim measure.</p><p> They will be delighted with me in Longford as I have to reference another experience I had there yesterday.  I visited a class where the students were in the midst of a programme being delivered that covered areas that included sexual health, vaping and a variety of areas.  The students were so positive about their engagement, about the type of information they were getting and about how it was being delivered and it was working seamlessly in the school.  I want to point out that there is no shortage of good examples of best practice but the impetus must be to ensure that we see that everywhere.  That is the focus behind the RSE guidelines and the subject specifications at all levels.  It is taking time but I am adamant that we will move it at the greatest pace we can without compromising the delivery of the type of information that needs to be there.  The Senator is correct and I am pleased that we have given the timelines, which we are working towards with urgency and priority.  I am joined by my officials and I want to acknowledge the work they are doing in that respect.</p></speech>

It states that its core values are equality, inclusivity and diversity and that it must cater equally for all learners from all backgrounds regardless of gender, socioeconomic background, race or creed.  That paints a positive picture of the situation out there but the ISSU was here last week to say that according to its surveys one in three students stated that they had not received any form of relationship and sexuality education during senior cycle.  How can we make those broad statements when they do not reflect the situation for students and kids out there?  How does it make the Minister feel to know that part of this generation and generations before them have gone through the education system with no reference to same-sex relationships or gender diverse students?  How does that make her feel as the Minister for Education?  Those are my questions in addition to my earlier questions about the DSGBV and the third national strategy for women and girls.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.603" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#D00800"><p>On the Senator's first query on the third national strategy for women and girls, my Department has had ongoing engagement with the Minister for Justice and her Department and I have met the Minister personally about the input from the Department of Education into that strategy.  That is in recognition, as the Senator will appreciate, that there is a cross-departmental and cross-governmental approach to this and that it has to be so.  It is a societal approach as well and there is an ownership and leadership responsibility on all of us across Departments and society, not just to put this strategy together but to make sure it can be implemented.  My officials are with me and many of them are working specifically in that area.  I am conscious, as I have said to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, of the role that education can play in information and in highlighting domestic and gender-based violence, in educating our young people and in playing a role, as a partner, with all the other Departments and with the rest of society as well.</p> <p>  On the information that is available, there is recognition that there is need for an updated RSE and SPHE programme.  I am unequivocal about that and I would know that from my experience.  The Senator knows that as well and he has been clear in articulating that.  There is a general acceptance across society that this body of work needs to be done and we are in the midst of doing that work.  In the interim, as I have referenced previously, we have the toolkit that is made available to our staff and that includes toolkits on domestic and gender-based violence.  For example, there is a significant programme beginning at primary level, the gender quality matters programme, and there is a second programme supporting children and young people living with domestic violence and abuse.  At post-primary level we have the SPHE personal safety handbook and a personal safety resource pack.  This is to bridge the gap of information that might not be there currently and that is not available to the schools currently.  That does not take away from the fact that it is important that our staff have the appropriate training and confidence to deliver it.  It is for that reason that we are rolling out and funding the postgraduate diploma.</p> <p>  I refer to the engagement the Senator has had with the ISSU.  I cannot reiterate more clearly that the voice of the ISSU is hugely important and that its experience is important but I can specifically point as well, as I have done, to examples I have seen of excellent practice around the country.  I want to be clear on the following point, which I have to make.  I am pleased to say that we have talented, ambitious and caring staff that want the best for their students, and there will not be much disagreement about that.  I have seen best practice in information being delivered in a variety of different types of schools.  Are there opportunities to do more?  There are.  Am I intent on ensuring that will happen?  I am.  It is for that reason that we are committed to updating the specifications to ensure the information is available and to work with other agencies that can provide support.  There is a role for health professionals in this as well, whether they are from the HSE or whatever, in feeding into the information that needs to come into our schools.  The input of the ISSU and others has been important to us but it does not take away from the fact that there are also good examples of work going on across our schools.</p></speech>

People are tired and wondering if we will ever see a standardised curriculum across all schools so students can have an equality of opportunity to access inclusive sex education, for example.  There is a reason the programme for Government makes a specific reference to LGBTI relationships and making legislative change, if necessary.</p></speech>

I know the junior cycle review is to be published soon.  We could have all these reviews and improvements, however, and still have loopholes that deny the education required for gender-diverse and young people who have same-sex attractions.  Does the Minister envisage a need to use that element in the programme for Government to advantage those kids?</p></speech>

They must receive the education that they should across a variety of curricula, and specifically as referenced here the social, personal and health education and relationships and sexuality education, RSE.  I am absolutely committed to ensuring they receive the correct, factual, most up-to-date and inclusive information so that, as I reiterate, every student and child would see and hear himself or herself reflected in the information being delivered.</p> <p>  I understand and nobody is more challenged than me when I hear about a review of a policy or this or that.  It is the implementation that is the most important aspect.  I hear that.  I am not quite yet two years in my role and in that time I have ensured that there would be confidence among staff to deliver the information that must be delivered.  We are rolling out this postgraduate programme.  The work must be done.  I come from this background and I appreciate the importance of having the curriculum laid down.  I must say that and it is important and the bedrock of the process.  The urgency and priority around it, however, means that in the interim we must have something else.  I point to the toolkit we have that is crossing a variety of areas, including consent, domestic and gender-based violence, LGBTQI rights and all of that.  That interim support is being offered.</p> <p>  We will move the greatest possible pace.  As I stated, we have already given the timelines, whether it is for junior cycle, the new framework for primary or the senior cycle.  I am cognisant of the Senator's frustration and that of others, and it is for that reason I am keen that in the interim we should have capacity, trained and confident staff.  We must also have toolkits, resources and continuing professional development available to bridge the gap.  For too long it has not been available and I know that.  I am looking at the interim and the long term.  We are doing all we can to ensure this is delivered appropriately.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#E00800"><p>I have had difficulty with my computer this morning but I am on the campus.  I heard the Minister's comments to Senator Warfield and I thank her for coming before us today.  She said the facts were up to date in information and education is required for this in schools, particularly in RSE.  I have not heard that sex education should not be ethos-based.  I raise this because the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality is not the first citizens' assembly to recommend that sort of intervention in our education system being required.  The Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment to the Constitution recommended that in 2017.  It was a further or ancillary recommendation of the all-party Oireachtas committee in 2018, which is now four years ago.</p> <p>  I have heard what the Minister said about preparation, training and all the rest of it but does the Minister not regard the process as being extremely slow in an area where such change is urgently required?  Young people in particular are having difficulty grappling with identity and dealing with harassment around identity and sexuality, for example, which I will deal with in my next question.  We are still without proper sexual relationships training in our school.  The Minister has said we will roll out a course and ensure staff are trained but will she put dates on the process?  Will she comment on how the education should not be based on ethos?</p> <p>  Needless to say, there have been a number of Bills, one going back to 2016, that were put forward by Opposition groups, including mine, to try to help the Government to introduce this measure with some urgency.  They have always sat there waiting for a money message and nothing has happened.  Perhaps if one of those Opposition Bills had been passed, the Department might have been quicker to implement what young people require rather than seeing this as a long and drawn-out process.  As I mentioned, four years ago we saw the first recommendation on this coming from the Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment and the Oireachtas committee.  We still do not have what young people need in schools.  Most of the kids from the days in which we first saw the recommendation would be in the workplace or college now.</p> <p>  I have a second question that has a sort of a link to the first.  It relates to sexual harassment and violence in secondary schools.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland has called for a study to be carried out on the rates of such violence and harassment for over a decade.  Will the Minister comment on the possibility of such a study being carried out and a report being available to all of us who are concerned about the education of the next generation and the prevalence of sexual harassment in secondary schools?</p> <p>  This is really important for LGBTQ+ young people.  There is a finding from Dr. Michelle Walsh in 2021 that almost half of all students in secondary schools have indicated they would not know who to go to in their school if they experienced sexual harassment.  That is an indictment and a half of our system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.612" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#E00900"><p>The Deputy might come back to me if I do not respond to everything as I did not catch some of it.  She mentioned the RSE framework and the timelines.  We have given timelines now, and as I said to Senator Warfield, with the best will in the world I can only look at what I have done in the less than two years I have been Minister.  I hear the frustration around how long it has taken to bring various specifications etc. to the fore.  In that time there has been considerable engagement and reference has been made to the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU, parents and the widest engagement and consultation.  That has fed into these programmes.</p> <p>  I can now say the programmes are moving and we have set those targets.  For example, the junior cycle specifications will be published in the next number of weeks, followed by public consultation and implementation for 2023.  The primary curriculum framework is due to be published in 2023, with subject specification following.  The work has already commenced on the specifications for RSE has already commenced.</p> <p>  I do not wish to repeat myself but I am saying that I have recognised that we cannot wait in the long term for these dates so we have put in place resources online via the toolkit.  The Deputy has referenced, along with me, the upskilling and training of staff, either through continuing professional development or the specific postgraduate diploma.  The tender process for that is currently taking place and we are hoping to roll it out in the coming months, most likely the second half of the new school term.</p><p>That would be around the start of 2023.</p><p> The Deputy referred to the importance of the information being given to students.  Everything done in the education sector concerning teaching obligations is based on accurate, fair, up-to-date, factual information in all areas.  That is the core principle, irrespective of a teacher's subject area.  Student access is the core principle here as well.  I am determined to ensure students will have that access, irrespective of other considerations.  When the arrangements are laid out in the curriculum &mdash; the curriculum is the curriculum at the end of the day &mdash; factual, accurate information must be delivered in the schools.</p><p> Specifically on sexual harassment and violence, we are very conscious of the matter.  I referred earlier to the engagement I have had with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith will be aware that a new action plan on bullying is being drawn by the Department.  We have a significant steering group working on it.  It will be reporting to me very shortly.  There are interim and long-term elements.  The specific issues of sexual harassment and identity bullying, including gender stereotyping and gender-identity bullying both in person and, importantly, online, will be part of the review of the current action plan and the new guidelines and specifications that will be issued to schools.  A considerable body of work is being done in our schools.  I have seen the work in operation in schools.  As recently as yesterday, I saw excellent engagement in schools regarding the delivery of programmes, covering topics of sexual health, inclusion and all the issues referred to by the Deputy.  The key is to have a curriculum that includes all these aspects.  We are doing the work as quickly as we can.  I realise the work has taken some time.  For that reason, I am pushing consistently so we will meet the targets.  I have set the timelines and ensured interim availability of significant resources to schools, including continuing professional development and the toolkit.  Resources are also being made available through the postgraduate diplomas.</p></speech>

I asked whether she endorses and whether it is part of her plan to have non-ethos-based sexual education in schools.  The Minister mentioned everything else, such as how information should be fair, informative, accurate and scientific, but I asked her specifically about the non-ethos-based sexual education as the committee recommended reviewing the eighth amendment as part of a measure to help to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies to eliminate the need for terminations in this country.  In this way, young people would be better educated, in a non-ethos-based way, as to how to be sexually active without it resulting in a crisis pregnancy.  That was how it was recommended at the time, and it is probably being recommended here also, for other reasons.  The Minister, within two years of being appointed Minister for Education, recognises that the examination of this area and the implementation of recommendations have proceeded at a snail's pace, so her first step should be to ask why and determine how she, as the person now in charge, can address the stagnation.</p> <p>  The second question the Minister has not answered for me concerns the now ten-year-old call by the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland for a study to be carried out on the amount of sexual harassment and bullying in our secondary school system.  It has been reported that more than half of the young people in secondary schools would not know who to go to if they felt sexually harassed.  Has the Minister two minutes to answer my questions, which are on non-ethos-based sexual education and the commissioning of the report that was called for several times?</p></speech>

I was referring to the pace at which the new specifications are coming on stream and the fact that it has taken considerable time to formulate the new specifications for the new curricula across SPHE and RSE.</p> <p>  Specifically on the issue of implementation in respect of information in our schools, I want to be very clear, and I was clear when I last spoke to the Deputy, that the curriculum is the curriculum and that every school has an absolute obligation to implement it as laid down by the Department.  That curriculum, in the areas of SPHE and RSE, will include factual, up-to-date, current best-practice information.  To ensure there is oversight of that, our inspectorate operates in our schools to ensure that whatever is laid down in the curriculum is being taught.</p> <p>  On bullying and bullying reports, I have determined that the inspectorate, as part of its school inspections, will now include a report on issues concerning bullying, how it is handled and issues of that nature within schools.  It is now being charged with that specifically.  From that, there will be excellent examples of best practice in our schools.  When we speak of issues of this nature in our schools, we need to be balanced.  There are excellent examples of best practice in our schools with regard to how cases of bullying are being handled.  There are schools that could learn from that best practice.  For that reason, the inspectorate now has an oversight role in this area.</p></speech>

The Minister said a number of times to Senator Warfield that she has been a Minister for only two years and has been doing all the work mentioned in that time.  She has been a Minister for just short of two years.  When I asked my first parliamentary question on this subject, which I believe was in July 2020, I got a general response.  I was happy enough with that at the time because there had to be follow-up.  Since then, I have asked about 12 or 15 parliamentary questions on this subject and have got the same general response.  I have never got specifics on the timeline.  When I read the Minister's opening statement today, I saw the same general information of the same standard that I received all the way through.  The Minister says nobody has been more challenged by this than her but I have not seen any output on this.  I have submitted Topical Issue debate questions, for which the Minister has not been available, and withdrew them until she was available.  Therefore, if I ask a question seeking clarification, which I am entitled to do as an elected Member of the Oireachtas, it is because I am trying to get a more detailed answer.  Perhaps I could get more detailed answers on the timeline, because it is extremely important.</p><p>Our frustration with the Department has been ongoing for some time now.  We do not have dates for anything at this point.  We have generalities.  For example, the Minister's opening statement reads:</p><blockquote>	Preparation to update the senior cycle ... specification has commenced.  The senior cycle development will now be charged with preparing a background paper. </blockquote><p>When will that start?  How long will it take?  When will the background paper be published?  What does that mean?  How will that feed into the next stage?  How long will that take?  Specifically when will there be a programme that is available to be seen?  The Minister says she has been in schools where she sees excellent examples, and we hear them too.  However, we also hear from secondary school students who tell us they are not getting a certain level of education, so we see a mixed picture.  What the committee and Members of the Oireachtas would like to see is actual output from the Department, actual content we can see, even on a private basis, such that the Department is available to invite us in and to say this is where we are and this is what we are doing.  Everybody is clearly very interested in this.  The work on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence has been ongoing for the complete period of this Government so far, and these are programme for Government commitments, but we have not seen any output.  As for the actual work coming out of the junior cycle, the senior cycle and the primary cycle, in what academic year does the Minister for Education expect the programmes for each of those cycles to be commenced in schools?</p></speech>

We have acknowledged that there is a significant body of work involved in the specifications for each of the levels, junior cycle, senior cycle and primary school.  To reiterate with absolute clarity, the junior cycle specification is due to be published in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It is appropriate that they go to public consultation.  It is very important - and I have reiterated this a number of times - that there be an opportunity for everyone to engage across all the different levels and to feed into the specifications, whether parents, the student voice, which we have spoken of the importance of, or wider society.  The specifications are due to be published shortly, in the coming weeks.  They will follow public consultation, and implementation for the junior cycle will be in 2023, as we have already said.  At senior cycle, work on following a similar approach has already commenced, and there will be the initial scoping work to be done.  The development group is then charged with moving this on.  We are looking at that work being fulfilled beginning now and into 2023, with an intention, if at all possible, of implementation in 2024.  Again, I have very clearly given the date.  I gave it in my opening remarks and we have given it consistently.  The primary school curriculum framework will be published in 2023 and, thereafter, subject specifications.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill has clear guidelines of dates in respect of 2023 and 2024 across RSE and SPHE.  Equally, in the interim, we have been very clear that supports are required within our schools and we have put those supports in place.  They cross a wide variety of areas, including, as I said, consent and domestic and gender-based violence.  Those toolkits of support for our staff are there and include CPD and the further step we are taking to make the postgraduate diploma available to our staff.</p></speech>

I think we would all like the second level programme especially to be accelerated.  There is also the question of opt-outs - for example, parental opt-outs - from these subjects.  Maybe it would be as useful to get responses on those matters in writing because I will focus on a couple of other topics.</p> <p>  As for the curriculum reviews, the citizens' recommendations refer to a broad range of subjects that counter gender stereotyping and curriculum review in the widest sense that promotes gender equality and diversity.  It would be very useful to know what review is happening in respect of the rest of the curriculum.  We have heard about history lessons with maybe three or four women in them, geography lessons and other lessons.  Often there is an embedded gender inequality.  We have gone from a world that has had very strongly unequal systems for years, and they are embedded throughout subjects, even in the examples that are given and the framing.  One thing that has been highlighted is intersectionally in, for example, the way in which women from African countries are framed or the way in which Traveller women are reflected.  There is a whole set of issues to be teased out.  It is part of the process of decolonisation of the curriculum that has been discussed and the reframing of the curriculum in gender equality terms.  I am interested in that wider curriculum review and what is happening.</p> <p>  To take a break from SPHE, one specific area I am really concerned about is civic, social and political education, CSPE.  It has been highlighted that, very recently, just three years ago in fact, just before Deputy Foley became Minister, CSPE ceased to be an exam subject at junior cycle level.  We have heard that this meant it stopped getting the same time and attention and field trips were no longer happening.  If we are committed to creating a more gender-equal society, it should be not just through the relationships or the workplace but also through the wider civic, social and political space, having our young people engaging early on with issues of equality on that basis.  Is the Minister considering re-establishing CSPE as an exam subject at junior cycle level?  That would ensure every child would get a foundation in civic, social and political education to a known level because of the exams.  That may be an opportunity in respect of the CSPE curriculum.  It is one way we could do a lot to address embedded gender inequality throughout society.  It is a matter of wider curriculum review.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned qualifications for those teaching SPHE, which are important and needed.  However, what training programme is in place for the inspectorate, who will enforce the proper teaching of RSE and SPHE?  I ask the Minister to comment on the training plans for inspectorates.</p> <p>  Also, in-----</p></speech>

I just want to point out that while it is not an exam subject, there is a current increase to 100 hours allocation on our timetables for CSPE.  It is part of the well-being framework in our schools as well.  However, that is just one tool, if you like, or subject area in terms of addressing equality, gender balance and issues of that nature.  We also have included the work that we do on STEM in our schools and the significant programmes that we are running, as I referenced earlier, that have proven to be very successful around the STEM passport for inclusion, as well as the work that we are doing with Science Foundation Ireland and all of that.  CSPE is just one of those.  I do not believe it has to be an exam subject to be successful and well delivered within the school.  </p><p> Specifically, the Senator asked about our inspectorate and their training in terms of when they go out into the schools.  There is an ongoing programme of internal training of inspectorate.  We have a very effective inspectorate.  As I pointed out, their scope is being widened all the time in terms of what they are capturing within our schools, which is positive.  I referenced that their domain now stretches to include practices around anti-bullying and oversight in the STEM programmes that we have in our schools.  Specifically, what they do when they go into a school is look at patterns of uptake and what is working well in one place that could be transferred to another in terms of student uptake of particular types of subjects, which would include gender and how many students of a particular gender are taking a particular subject, or whatever the case might be.</p></speech>

To follow on the Minister's statement about the inspectors and their work being extended to include bullying, how many inspectors are there?  Will the Minister's Department extend the inspectors' remit to also look at the facilities that are currently in place in schools to ensure that this systemic gender equality in accessing courses, particularly for younger women around woodwork, metalwork or whatever it may be is addressed so that there is parity of availability of these courses in our secondary schools?  Is that something that she will consider the inspectorate could do?  While there are many barriers to gender equality, some of them are very blatant and very much in our face, but there are others that are historic.  Due to the fact that they are almost systemic at this stage, we have grown up in an environment that has resulted in us being blind to them, and one of them is physical availability.  The Minister spoke of the schools putting themselves forward in relation to that computer science course in response to my question about the all-girls DEIS schools.  However, that would lead me to think that there are many schools out there that simply could not put themselves forward because they do not have the facilities to be able to undertake that course.</p></speech>

I am just making the point that there is more than &euro;100 million, and &euro;50 million again at the start of this year, specifically for digital side of technology and all of that.  On the availability of particular traditionally gender-based subjects being made available, first, the Department is absolutely committed to resourcing these key subjects.  This means, in the first instance, ensuring that we have the staff available to teach them.  We currently run a number of upskilling programmes that ensure that staff who have a particular qualification and wish to take a further one in a particular area where there might be a challenge can do so; that is running very well.  We are committed on an ongoing basis to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, which again helps subjects that might have a smaller cohort uptake, but an uptake nonetheless.  Whether that is in areas of physics, chemistry or whatever it might be, the reduced PTR actually helps to increase subject choice within a school.  Where there is a specific difficulty that a school might have in not having staffing capacity to cover a particular subject, the Department engages directly on a one-to-one basis with the school and is prepared to assist it with whatever might be required, such as additional hours or whatever else.</p> <p>  I can acknowledge from my own experience that there was a time where subjects were very specific to gender.  That is decreasing now because of the work we are seeing coming from the Department and the resourcing from the Department.</p> <p>  On the role of the inspectorate, it is very important and useful to us that we have the inspectorate having an oversight of patterns of uptake so that-----</p></speech>

Just to follow up, we have heard much about STEM and I do not need to hear more about that now.  We have begun to hear more around that question of the other subjects, such as humanities, and the fact that one of the citizens&rsquo; assemblies also talked about supporting boys and men into other subjects.  Getting everyone into STEM, including women, and getting people into apprenticeships, including women, is not the same as actually addressing gender equality.  Humanities are key for that.  Not having CSPE as an exam subject sends a very early signal that those other parts of life -  the civil, the social, the political engagement &ndash; things that we know women end up doing, are not given the same value if they are not given an exam status at junior certificate.  I urge the Minister to revisit that.  It is one of the most fundamental things.</p> <p>  School is not just a channel to a career.  It is also where you model being in the world, and that is why we have to get it right.  On that modelling being in the world, I raise the issue of equality.  One thing that was pointed out is there are exemptions in the equality legislation for schools.  That is one of the anomalies that we have in Irish society and it is because of the ethos-based exemptions.  That could be part of looking at the question of whether there should be legislative change around ethos and the equality legislation.  A very simple example is that schools can have these uniform rules, which are extremely difficult for young women, and they can do that because they do not have the same constraints under the equality legislation.  We should be reforming and giving that space for equality pressures by reforming the kind of ethos-based exemptions on equality.</p> <p>  Lastly, the gender division of schools was highlighted very strongly.  Is part of the reform and shift in our programme to move towards mixed schools and away from the very strong emphasis on gender segregation that we have now in Ireland?</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister might answer Senator Higgins's questions when responding to him, just to allow us to be more efficient.  That issue of coeducational schooling came up very strongly in last week's hearing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.675" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#H01500"><p>I thank the Minister and her officials for being here today.  I apologise if I repeat questions because I was at the health committee next door.  I promise to be less robust here than I was next door.</p> <p>  It is such an interesting area because education has such an informative role in culture.  As Senator Higgins said, this is not just education or career preparation, it is about culture.  We had a very powerful engagement with Jennifer&rsquo;s Poole&rsquo;s brother, Jason Poole.  She was the victim of gender-based violence and was tragically killed.  Her murderer was recently sentenced.  Mr. Poole is a teacher and talked about the toxic culture that develops among young men and the things that they say.  Sometimes those all-male environments are places where we need to empower young men to call out that toxic environment.</p><p>It can be a really difficult thing to be a young teenage boy.  We have to understand the place that the young man might be in when he is among a group of people.  There might be just one individual engaging in it, but for other young men in that group to have the strength to step out of the mould and to call out that behaviour is very difficult.  I am interested to hear what the Department is considering in trying to tackle that culture.  We can do it in GAA clubs and soccer clubs, but there is also a role in schools and all-male schools are one environment where that happens.  I am particularly interested in that.</p><p> The second area is male representation in the teaching profession.  The last time I looked at numbers for primary school level only 14% of the teaching profession was male.  That says something to both young girls and young boys in primary school.  I was at a fantastic event yesterday in Erin's Isle GAA club where Dublin City University launched a programme to try to increase diversity in the teaching profession by including more young people from disadvantaged areas applying for teaching, particularly primary school teaching.  The point made by DCU was that their diversity adds to the overall strength of the profession.  With men being only 14% of the teachers at primary school level, the teaching profession is weaker because men are under-represented, in the same way as many other professions, and perhaps far more professions, are weaker because of the under-representation of women.  The issue is that balance in teaching.</p><p> The last issue is subject choice.  St. Mary's Secondary School in my constituency heard that I was a member of this committee and for one of their CSPE projects the students wrote to me asking me about gender equality and about subject choice, in particular.  What was interesting was that they did not have enough male teachers in the school to get a good sample of data regarding whether male teachers had been impacted.  That is interesting because it ties back to the last conversation.  They also were not able to engage with male students because their school is an all-female school.  At the very basic level of them trying to gather the data to tackle an issue, they ran into the first problem all of us encounter, which is that they did not have the opportunity to engage.  Young women in an all-female school with very limited choices in science - that is some of them but there are obviously others such as woodwork and so forth - are seeking to tackle gender inequality and they run up against the first hurdle of not being able to access people of a different gender.  It is such an example, and I give them credit.</p><p> Will the Minister comment on subject choices, the balance in the teaching profession and the toxic culture that often exists and what we can do in education to call it out?</p></speech>

With absolute respect, I disagree with her on the importance of it being an examinations subject.  I do not believe that it has to be an examinations subject to be of importance in the school.  There are many aspects of school that are not examinations regimented, as it were, and they are many of the most positive and enriching aspects of school life.  There is all the extra-curricular activity and the initiatives that students are involved in.  I hear what the Senator is saying about-----</p></speech>

It is up to 100 hours.  It is a very significant allocation of time across the timetable.  It is an underlining of the commitment we have to the importance of the subject.  I do not believe it needs the examinations title to give it the importance it deserves.  The fact that we are increasing the time allocation for it is testament to the importance we place on it.</p> <p>  Both the Deputy and Senator raised the issue of the gender division of schools.  Some 90% of our primary schools are mixed gender and approximately 69% of post-primary schools are mixed gender.  Generally, all our new schools, because they meet the demographics and the accommodation needs of an area, are also mixed gender.  Somewhere along the line in the great debate about single-sex schools or mixed-gender schools, that statistic of 90% is very high for primary school.  It is quite a high statistic for post-primary schools.  Again, for a variety of reasons, most notably the demographic that is being served in new schools and the accommodation needs, our new schools are mixed gender also.</p> <p>  Regarding the teaching issue, it is almost a reverse here in terms of there not being the male role models.  The Deputy referred to primary school.  It is interesting to note that in the leadership roles in primary schools more than 2,000 of them are female principals and more than 1,000 of them are male principals.  That is interesting in itself.  A significant body of work is being done on the promotion of teaching through the Teaching Transforms programme.  I accept the necessity to have an equal representation of genders.  It goes back to a phrase that is used consistently, "If you cannot see it, you cannot be it", so it is very important that co-equality would exist.  We are doing a huge body of work through the Teaching Transforms programme to encourage diversity in the teaching and wider education sector.  It is not just the teaching sector, but all those who work within the education sector.  That is not even just from the male and female genders.  There is also diversity.  We need to see people of all backgrounds and all ethnic groups teaching and working and being part of school communities.  It was my great pleasure recently to have the opportunity to visit the graduation in Marino Institute of Education of migrant teachers, for example.  They are superbly, highly-qualified individuals who are now enriching our school environment.  It is a body of work to continue to encourage that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised subject choice for schools.  I referred to that earlier as well.  Resourcing of key subject areas is a priority for the Department, particularly areas that are a pinch point in our schools.  The Deputy referred to science.  We have a very strong upskilling programme, with a big uptake for it, to increase the availability of that staff.  A consideration that is sometimes lost, and I referred to this earlier, is also committing to the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio because the smaller class size number suits some of those subject areas.  It also improves subject choice availability in a school.  As I said, where there is a specific challenge for a school we ask the school to contact us directly to see what scope we have in terms of whatever the additional resource is that might be required to make something happen.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  Not every school demands a uniform but where they are requested and where they are part of the school procedure, it is massively important that all students have an opportunity to feel comfortable and be comfortable in how they are presenting in a school.  Where that needs to be addressed it can be addressed.  We have seen a much broader scope of that provision being made available to all students.  There has been a much greater increase and improvement in that.  I accept what the Senator said about work needing to be done to ensure it is across the board.</p></speech>

I reference this even at teaching conferences.  It is hugely important that we have upskilling courses and mentoring courses, which we do have, and that we encourage those who would have a desire to become leaders to take those opportunities of mentoring and coaching courses that are available to them and that they would do it in advance even of putting their names forward for those positions.  It is hugely important that we see equality of participation across leadership roles and all other roles within the education sector.  As I say, it is for that reason we are doing all that we can on every side of it to see that campaigns, such as Teaching Transforms, will bring into the education sector diversity, whether it is equality in gender, ethnicity or whatever.  That work is ongoing.</p></speech>

We are engaging with Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan and with Women in Research Ireland.  I am grateful to both Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan from the department of psychology in Maynooth University and Ms Emily Sheridan, treasurer and web manager of Women in Research Ireland, for joining us in person, and to Dr. Cathy Corcoran, committee member of Women in Research Ireland, who is joining us via Teams.  They are all very welcome here.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make them identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  Today, we are addressing the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly around norms and stereotypes in educations.  Those are recommendations 26 to 31.  The committee has been dealing in a modular fashion with the different recommendations of the assembly which we see as amounting to a blueprint for gender equality in Ireland.  Our view is that we are charged with seeing how best we can implement those recommendations.  We ask witnesses to address that issue of implementation in a practical sense.  We also ask that they might confine their opening statement to five minutes as that will give us more time to engage.  For engagement with each committee member, we have an eight-minute limit on the exchange.</p> <p>  I call on Dr. O'Sullivan to make her opening statement.  This will be followed by those of Ms Sheridan and Dr. Corcoran on behalf of Women in Research Ireland.</p></speech>

I have chosen to focus on female equality issues only and participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, as these are the ones which have the most impact in terms of participation in modern society.</p> <p>  Recommendation 26 talks about resourcing schools to ensure equality.  There are some easy changes in schooling that can be made to ensure gender equality.  All science subjects should be on offer in all schools.  Women are under-represented in the emerging workforce because we are socialised and educated out of these jobs.  By the age of 11, many girls have already decided science and STEM are not for them.  We must make whole education changes to ensure young women see their potential in all areas.  Science and technology subjects should be mandatory for all students in the same way that mathematics, English and languages are.  This would reduce gender disparities in participation.  Recent research shows that while 92% of all boys' schools have physics, chemistry and biology on the leaving certificate timetable, while only 77% of girls' schools do.  In co-educational schools, it is even lower, at 62%.  I recently interviewed a group of girls from a delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, school in the inner city which was moving to co-educational status.  They noted that this was the first time ever they were being offered woodwork and engineering.  They were really angry about this.  They knew this was only because they boys were joining the school.  Science for all is not only about jobs for all.  It is about ensuring everyone can engage in modern society critically.  When we fail to offer all sciences to all students, we fail to prepare students for modern life, the consequences of which can be seen in fear of modern developments, such as vaccines and artificial Intelligence, AI, technologies.</p> <p>  I would also urge the committee to consider the intersection between gender and class.  Not all girls are the same.  Not all schools have the same resources.  DEIS schools need added support to ensure working-class girls can access all courses, capabilities and careers.  I would ask the question, why are no all-girl schools piloting the new computer science programme for schools?  What are the governing structures in place to ensure equity of resources across all schools?  When we consider resourcing of education, we must consider the impact of gender, race, class, and ability on participation and must ensure all girls are served by education.  Recommendations 26 and 27, in my view, are related.  Career guidance and curriculum reform should consider what we communicate to young women about women.  My research shows that young women often cannot name a female scientist from history - apart from Marie Curie - or a female leader in finance or science.  With young girls' aspirations being guided by what they see in society and learn in school, we need to sense-check the curriculum content to ensure it celebrates excellent women.</p><p>If the media only speak about women in terms of their husbands or their looks, then how can we be different?  Sense-checking the media would help.  Career guidance is not just about the teachers in school; it is what we show young women.  If girls do not relate to women in all roles, they will not try to be them.</p><p> As regards recommendation 30, a systems and strategic approach is needed to strengthen existing programmes.  We have best practice examples of gender equality activities occurring across education, employment, and society.  From mentoring to the Athena Swan programme, coding and computer science courses, we have excellent programmes making changes.  The problem is these programmes often work in silos and compete for funding.  We need to join up the system.  We need to spend time identifying and evaluating programmes that support gender equality, and then scale them.</p><p> I have been funded by the Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, Discover programme to deliver the STEM passport for inclusion programme.  This plugs some of the gaps in the system.  It offers senior cycle girls across Ireland three key STEM resources, namely, a STEM university qualification while they are still in secondary school, a STEM mentor and STEM career guidance.  Instead of working alone, we partnered with Munster Technological University, Microsoft Ireland, Teen-Turn, Accenture, RDI Hub, Dogpatch Labs and others to build a systems approach to empowering young women to see STEM as a future for them.</p><p> What I am doing is not unique.  There are thousands of programmes worldwide doing some of this work.  What we are doing that is different is inviting others to join us to change the system.  We are inviting every university and school across Ireland to work together to build a STEM pathway for girls to get them into STEM careers and courses.  What we are doing is working.  Munster Technological University is awarding the STEM passport girls 50 bonus leaving certificate points which they can use towards STEM courses.  Some 125 women from various companies have acted as mentors.  They have been trained on how to mentor for equality.  With 4,000 applicants for only 1,000 places, we see that 78% of these girls are now interested in studying and working in STEM.  The STEM programme has been included as a recommendation for the national pilot in the recent gender balance in STEM education programme.  What we need is joined-up thinking, systemic change and a systemic approach.</p><p> Like all other good programmes, we face challenges in trying to implement this nationally.  In the context of girls in STEM courses or careers, universities are often scared to develop gender-only programmes.  The conservative nature of the education system stops reform happening at the pace of societal change.  I am not sure whether I should say this, but it is my view that while our leadership is primarily made up of males, we will never be able to change the dial and ensure all women are educated, employed and empowered equally.  Finally, now is the time to make the changes.  Women have never been more at risk of being left out of the emerging world.  Covid-19 has shown that women, especially those in service roles, are at risk of entrenched poverty if we do not ensure they are prepared to participate in the technological revolution.  Being STEM-prepared is no longer a workforce issue.  We need to be STEM ready so we can stay connected, get educated and be part of the changing solutions for the world.</p></speech>

I am a PhD student in STEM at UCD and I am here as a representative of Women in Research Ireland along with Dr. Cathy Corcoran, a fellow Women in Research Ireland committee member who is joining us online.</p> <p>  Women in Research Ireland is a volunteer-run charity working towards increased representation and equality for women, non-binary and gender-fluid persons and members of under-represented groups working in research and academia in Ireland.  We welcome the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, particularly its efforts to advance a more gender-equal Ireland with recommendations underpinned by human rights, equality, justice and fairness values.  We agree with the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality that mainstream gender equality considerations should become a key element of all State and Government policies and legislation.  The Citizens' Assembly made a number of significant recommendations and we are here to comment on chapter 8 of the report, relating to norms and stereotypes and education.</p> <p>  As regards recommendation 26, despite improvement in recent years, gender gaps remain prevalent within the education system.  The imbalance is influenced by societal stereotypes that suggest men and women have a biological set of natural skills that define what professions are suitable for them.  Developmental studies confirm these influences come from the closest environments, mainly being family and school, but also from more distant systems such as media or cultural values.  School subjects and later career choices are often heavily influenced by gender stereotypes.</p> <p>  Women in Research Ireland recommends that schools, in partnership with universities where possible, provide a more inclusive learning environment, celebrating diversity of both students and staff.  We agree with the recommendation to provide a broader range of subjects in schools to increase participation in particularly gender-stereotyped subjects.  We suggest that students be fully introduced to subject options in late primary or early post-primary education, allowing them the opportunity to explore and engage with subjects they may not have considered or encountered before.  We agree that second-level schools should train their career guides and teachers on how not to associate job roles too strongly with a specific gender.</p> <p>  As regards recommendations 27 and 28, teaching about gender and gender-based discrimination should not be the sole remit of specialty classes but, rather, should be an important component of all subjects in post-primary education.  Curriculums in all subjects can make efforts to improve the gender balance of studied individuals and groups while also incorporating discussions on who is absent and the reasons that underpin who has been considered worth studying and who has not.  Women in Research Ireland suggests the delivery of a mandatory gender-sensitive teaching methods skill set module for all educators in schools and universities alongside ongoing evaluations of gender equality policies and outcomes.  Women in Research Ireland commends the Citizens' Assembly on its recommendations to cover the important issues of consent and domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence within the revised relationships and sexuality curriculum.  We highlight, however, the need to explicitly address the intersectionality of gender as it relates to power dynamics and violence.</p> <p>  In the context of recommendations 29 and 30, we note the recently published Funding the Future policy launched by the Minister, Deputy Harris, in early May includes expanding the SUSI grant system to those on part-time courses.  We welcome this approach and hope to see it implemented soon.  Women in Research Ireland also welcomes the recommendations for additional State funding to encourage a more diverse uptake into career paths and apprenticeships programmes through increased resources.</p> <p>  As regards recommendation 30, it is a case of if you can see it, you can be it.  As media, including television, radio and online content, contribute to the learning and maintenance of stereotyped perceptions, media literacy programs in schools would be helpful to sensitise students to gender-role depictions.  In addition, the media and advertisement sector is capable of showing young children the possibilities open to them in a variety of fields.  For example, we know that women are less likely to be invited to participate on television shows and that they make up less than 20% of experts featured in news stories.  Thus, television radio and news media should implement policies that guarantee equal representation.</p> <p>  With regard to the regulation of the media to avoid discrimination and gender stereotypes, we highlight the role of both the Government and technology companies in creating policies in the pursuit of fighting harassment, bullying and other forms of abusive behaviour that are often directed towards women and minority groups.  Research shows that women drop off social media and even leave political careers due to the tremendous amount of online abuse they receive.  Appropriate legislation should be introduced to regulate and prevent such behaviour, remove content and punish perpetrators where necessary.</p> <p>  The monitoring of compliance is essential for the success of gender equality policies.  The data gathered can be used on equality grounds to identify data gaps on gender inequality and used to drive improvements in the data infrastructure, analysis and policies necessary to close those gaps.  We encourage universities to make more extensive use of data from Athena Swan, which is already a rich source of data but can be used in the development of specifically targeted gender equality actions as needed.</p> <p>  Care is often seen as the default work of women.  It is work that goes largely unseen and unpaid.  In academia, the strain of care has been amplified for women due to the additional burden of home caregiver responsibilities, which has had a negative impact on women&rsquo;s academic publications and grant funding, especially in the past two years.  More specifically, the recommendation to improve the visibility of men performing caring roles should instead be broadened to portraying and respecting care work as valuable regardless of gender.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I again thank the Chairman and committee members for including Women in Research Ireland in this important discussion.  Women in Research Ireland is committed to advancing equity for women and minorities.  Addressing norms and stereotypes in education will pave the way for a more equitable society where opportunities are available to all, regardless of gender.</p></speech>

The written submissions provided by our guests, which I read yesterday, are excellent.  I am particularly interested in the idea of giving students a chance to try subjects at primary level.  Are our guests suggesting that secondary schools be used as a place for primary school students to try woodwork, home economics or engineering?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#L01200"><p>We have done it the other way.  We have done it in higher education through secondary schools.  The secondary school students are doing the subjects that are on in secondary school and they are getting a qualification.  It being run in primary schools or having a link between the three is a fantastic idea.  Ms Sheridan referred to combining approaches in this context to make more clear the pathways between the subjects, courses and schools so the transition is much easier.</p></speech>

I did as many practical courses as possible.  The idea of having a discussion on the theory side of the class about who is not there is revolutionary and has never occurred to me.  I wholly support that.  I commend the witnesses for introducing class to the discussion.  We will reflect on that for our report.</p></speech>

In all our work, we try to target those with an intersection of disadvantage due to gender, class and ability.  If the solution works for them, it is easier to serve those who have just one challenge.  It is essential that we think about class, specifically with the shecession.  Working class women are the most affected by what has happened with Covid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#M00300"><p>Going back to the introduction of subjects, engineering was not offered to me.  The Central Statistics Office has shown that, as a leaving certificate subject, engineering is mainly run in mixed schools and single sex boys' schools but not in single sex girls' schools.  Only 10% of people who take up that subject in mixed schools are women.  That is reflected in university, with 8% taking up the subject.  It was not run in my school.  I did not hear or know about it.  When people chose it at university level, I did not know why.  I asked what they even knew about it, because I had never heard about it before.  I feel like people end up making choices about secondary school, which influences their leaving certificate decisions and their university decisions, at primary level, where they do not have any introduction to subjects at all.  They can end up choosing things based on what friends choose and what is offered.  People should have the opportunity to choose those subjects early on.  If there is not an initial large uptake, it will still grow as time goes on.  Sometimes, subjects are offered and then are cancelled after having small uptakes.  They cannot continue to grow and have increased uptake if they are removed immediately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.712" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cathy Corcoran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#M00400"><p>I thank the committee for inviting Women in Research Ireland.  As everyone has acknowledged, research has shown that girls lose interest in STEM as they get older, between ten and 12 years of age.  As Ms Sheridan mentioned, sometimes that relates to peer pressure, lack of support in school or the home, or a lack of a perception of what a career in STEM might look like in the real world, bringing a practical approach to the issue.  It is important that we expand that interest in education and employment in STEM and computer science.</p> <p>  As was mentioned earlier, there is employment and growth in this sector.  Increasing the likelihood of girls and women pursuing degrees that allow them to fulfil jobs in growth areas in technology and engineering, as Ms Sheridan mentioned, is extremely important.  The sooner we start that in primary and secondary education, leading into higher education, the better.  As Ms Sheridan outlined in her opening statement, providing teachers with more engaging, hands-on projects that would nurture the interest of all students, both girls and boys, over the course of primary and secondary education, would go a long way to nurturing, sustaining and building that interest in the subject areas, in degrees and in employment opportunities.</p> <p>  The showcasing of STEM mentors and role models to build confidence was mentioned earlier in the open meeting.  As Ms Sheridan mentioned, "if you cannot see it, you cannot be it".  That was mentioned in the first opening statement.</p> <p>  A final matter which was mentioned in the open meeting and both opening statements by my colleagues is the importance of cultivating inclusive classrooms free of stereotypes and biases for all children and young people.  It is essential to deliver equal opportunities for all in an unencumbered classroom environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.713" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#M00500"><p>The presentations were really interesting and covered interesting subjects.  I am torn about what to speak on because I would like to ask about so many things.  I wanted to pick up on the intersectional issue.  I was glad to see it named.  There are gender equality issues and also layered issues.  We talked about the changing of the secondary curriculum, its decolonisation, gender-proofing and examination.  The story of science, technology and engineering tells itself.  It is not just about who goes into them but also how the curriculum is changed to reflect, for example, Middle Eastern contributions to maths and science, which is the kind of thing that makes it different.</p> <p>  I am interested into the entry routes and also how STEM needs to and can change.  I was struck by Dr. O'Sullivan saying that it is not just a workforce solution but about being part of changing solutions for the world.  One issue in technology is not just what happens mechanically but how it fits with society and culture.  For example, how do we change artificial intelligence so it is not discriminatory?  Much needs to be considered.  I am interested in the importance of having diversity in STEM and how it evolves.  That links into Ms Sheridan's point about care, which is not just about caring professions, but care being recognised, much as we brought in empathy examinations for medicine.</p> <p>  We have focused on entry points.  A good point was made about the lack of people coming from DEIS schools.  What about those coming into education from the social welfare system?  Anecdotally, women I know are often asked if they would think of taking a course to be a special needs assistant or in childcare, which reverses a two or three-year degree in a new science or engineering field.  Will the witnesses comment on that route into education and what we need to do to make sure that women are given that opportunity, including women who may not even have done science subjects in their secondary school education?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.714" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#M00600"><p>I thank Senator Higgins.  A thing that frustrates me in conversations about gender or class equality is the charitable nature in which we frame this.  People might say, "Oh, God, the poor women need our help."  Excuse me saying, "Oh, God".  Men rolls their eyes at having the conversation again.  The reality is that without women's voices in technology and STEM, we are missing out on wonderful creative leaders who can change what we produce and provide in STEM, technology and engineering.  When I talk to Microsoft and Accenture about working class girls, it is not a charitable endeavour.  I am telling them that they are missing out on a talented pool of workers.  We have all heard about seatbelts that are only tested on males or recruitment practices that are automated and move females out because the practices only use male data.  There are many ethical reasons to include working class women or ethnic minorities.  There is also the potential for creativity.  Research shows that companies that empower women to lead their work are more profitable, more creative and have happier workforces.</p><p>This is not just something we should consider because it is fair; it is actually better for society and industry.  That is one of the reasons I am so passionate about it.  The Senator spoke about role models and companies.  I will mention one thing we have done.  The systems approach I am really passionate about is not just about changing the young women but about changing industry and society.  The majority of women who are in industry are quite affluent.  They have forged their way through this male-dominated path and been able to get there and succeed.  We have developed a programme where we teach them about equality, diversity and inclusion.  We are actually saying what it is like.  You are not allowed to slag someone's accent when they walk into a room or to say "Hey, how are you? What's the story?" as if that is funny.  That is classist and makes people feel separated.  There is a whole piece of work to do on educating industry about how to be more inclusive.  We should lead on that as a society.  We should teach industry how to be more inclusive because it is beneficial for it.</p><p> I am a working-class girl and I was a lone parent.  I was forced into a community employment, CE, scheme here and another one when I was living in Dublin 1.  I am really intelligent and graduated with a first from Trinity College but, at that point, I was just told that this was what I was to do because that is what everyone else living in a flat in Summerhill does.  However, I met a woman by accident on the street who had got into Trinity College through the access programme and thought I could do that because she was like me.  That is a really anecdotal story but the truth is that, unless we see and celebrate women from every background, things will not change and we will not move those women from the social welfare class into roles and responsibilities where they can achieve.  The celebration piece, showcasing what can be done and supporting women all the way through those initial CE schemes and courses until they become professional in whatever way they want is really essential.</p></speech>

With regard to intersectionality and gender, we know that, while a person will have further to travel to the top because she is a woman, she will be even further down the scale if she is a woman with a disability or a woman from a working-class background.  To achieve equity, all of that needs to be taken into consideration.  Again, this is an anecdotal story but I have done a lot of maths grinds.  I used to teach on the side, although not so much lately because I have been too busy.  I have noticed a class component to people assuming their maths ability is bad.  That is already a gendered thing but it is also not enforced enough.  There is a wider variety of people who say "We are not good at maths."  I emphasise "we".  They are not just saying they personally are not good at maths but that "we" are not good at maths.  It becomes a larger issue.  Of course, in private schools there may be better-paid teachers and the ability to do extra grinds.  It is already easier for people in those schools to get further along in these subjects.</p> <p>  With regard to my own personal story, I took part in the disability access route to education, DARE, scheme to get into Trinity.  I would not have got into STEM in university but I got to do science in Trinity through the DARE scheme.  I am doing a PhD now.  I am well capable but I recognise that helping me, as a woman, to get there also meant helping me with the disability access route.  You need to help the whole package of a person if you want to bring them forward rather than focusing on their gender alone.</p></speech>

I have followed their work in different ways and am delighted to have them here.  I am very much enjoying listening to them.  I want to ask two things.  The first is about care in the home.  We have seen this issue particularly throughout the Covid pandemic but, let us face it, it has always existed.  There was a really good report published at EU level about this issue.  It analysed, on a pan-European basis, which women got back to work most easily and so on.  It is not just an Irish issue or a Covid issue.  It is a European issue and a men-and-women issue.  I am interested in how we can explain to any organisation, not specifically Microsoft, the additional work that women do according to all of the reports and statistics we are familiar with and what that actually means in practical terms.  In the context of rebalancing that quickly for people today without having to raise a whole new generation of people, do the witnesses have any thoughts as to how corporations or any other organisations can explain or tackle that for the men and women?  It is a core part of the inequality challenge we face.</p> <p>  My second question is slightly contrary.  I do not know what the answer to this is, but there is a balance to be struck between women spending their time trying to get ahead, do their jobs successfully and simply move on to the next stage and continue to progress, and spending their time remedying the gender inequality problem.  For example, both of the witnesses are taking time out of their professional academic lives in order to be here to do this.  We give our time to researchers to tell them what it is like to be a woman in politics.  There are so many examples.  We are very happy to do it because the very last thing we want to do is to pull up the ladder and to not provide assistance to researchers who are coming behind us in different ways.  However, it strikes me that very few of my male colleagues have the same asks made of their time.  Each of these engagements takes an hour or whatever it happens to be.  That is just one example.  Two things happen.  One is the taking of your time, time that could otherwise be spent simply doing the job in order to retain it or progress in it.  The second is the continuing othering involved in having the gender issue continually pointed out in a way that only happens to one gender.  Again, I say this question is slightly contrary because, for as long as that continues to happen, you continue to make things different but you also continue to take from the time available to actually do the job.  I am interested in the witnesses' perspectives on that because they are clearly also doing the same.</p></speech>

It really frustrates me when, having been asked to present at any conference or anything else to do with gender, I turn on the screen and only see women.  Realistically, it is men who need to be listening to this rather than women.  I find that quite frustrating.  What the Deputy has said about how we spend our time is really interesting.  With regard to industry, I believe there needs to be penalties.  I am one of these people who believe people need to be forced to engage with equality issues at this point because making it optional and leaving it to women to progress the agenda is not working.  If we keep going the way we are going, we are never going to reach gender equality.  There needs to be definite male champions and our workload needs to be recognised as part of our job because a lot of women do it as extra work.  It is a really good point.  I ask the question "Why are there no men here?" a lot.  I know Senator Warfield is here today and I am really glad that he is but why do men not come to these events?  The reality is that it does not affect them in the same way.  It is really not a priority but it should be made one.  People should be forced.  I do not mean that in a harsh way.</p> <p>  The other issue the Deputy raised related to care.  My research during the Covid pandemic really pointed to women being at the brink of breaking because of home schooling, work and everything being brought into the household.  The research showed that mothers did a lot of this while the fathers were just going to work and getting on with it.  One of the big fears I have as we move back to normality is that working from home will become the norm.  Many women I know are delighted that they might be able to stay home because they can manage the extra workload that is on them because of their children, appointments and cleaning.  The possibility that this is going to become the norm really frightens me.  We are going to take a step back in terms of gender equality if we do not do something with regard to who is staying at home and working from home.  Is that just going to be a female piece?  On the care point, care should be recognised as part of our work.  When I apply for a grant with the European Research Council or for a promotion, having children or, as in my own case, fostering is recognised with regard to progression.  When I am applying for a promotion, that is taken into account so I am not supposed to be the same as a male or female who has not had children.</p><p>That should be everywhere and it should be much more explicit.  If someone has children and cares for them or anyone else in the home, and men care for their children as well, it should be celebrated to a greater degree.  There are policies in place that really do this.  I have so many children that I should never have even got my PhD at this point from my last grant application because I had one so young.  It is great that it gives us that recognition when we are trying to progress as females, so people who have taken maternity leave can say they have not published so many articles because they have been at home with caring responsibilities.</p></speech>

It took three or four hours of my time.  I was asking myself what the point was because everyone there was already convinced.  What Dr. O'Sullivan said about working from home is really important.  It is so easy to put a wash on and do all of those things but it is also so easy to retain responsibility for all of those tasks.  In terms of flexibility in corporate culture, I told a story before about a friend of mine going from a five-day week to a three-day week when she had her second child.  I was telling her not do it because of her pension and the possibility of promotion and saying everything would change, instead of proposing the obvious solution, which was for the couple to both work a four-day week.  However, it was just not culturally acceptable in the corporate world for a couple to say they had had a second child and wanted to do a four-day week for the next three or four years.  Until that is culturally acceptable in the major commercial organisations, nothing will change because every time a woman drops from a five-day to a three-day week instead of both partners moving to a four-day week, it only entrenches the position for many more years.  That was the point I wanted to make.</p></speech>

Care is such a big thing, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic.  A medical article was published in <i>Nature </i>not that long ago.  The author visited Women in Research for a talk about the increased burden of care that occurs with women in academia.  Regarding what the Deputy said about self-advocacy, the same is true of the Athena SWAN awards and equality, diversity and inclusion panels.  Much of the time, they are made up of women.  Of course, people would like to get involved in self-advocacy but it also takes up their time.  In much of academia, people are not necessarily paid for the work that takes place.  To retain their job, academics write grant applications, which is not part of their nine to five main responsibilities such as teaching and looking after students.  Writing grant applications in their spare time, reviewing papers and going to conferences, all of which can become part of it but can also be done outside hours, are quite difficult when someone has a caring responsibility at home.  That can become a large part of it and this is stuff that is not going to recognised when someone is applying for grants and jobs.<br/><br/>There is a major problem surrounding people who take time out through maternity leave because they do not have that output and so many grants are based on age and output, not even quality of output.  There is a level of quality of output but it is also quantity, so a large quantity can often outweigh output that is almost equal in quality.  It is very important that care is taken into consideration.  It has to be acknowledged even within universities.  A lot of administrative tasks end up falling to women, even at the exact same level.  Responsibility for undergraduates and additional work always falls to women and that is something that needs to be taken into consideration.  To be honest, I cannot say I know what the answer is.  I do not know how we can fix that or how it can be acknowledged.  I do not have the answer but I know it is a problem.</p></speech>

We could be here all day discussing this issue.  I am not sure what progress we would make but I am sure we could be here all day.  In her presentation, Dr. O'Sullivan stated that women have never been more at risk of being left out.  Never be afraid to say it, say it repeatedly, say it loudly and say it often because it is absolutely true.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  When Covid hit, the first people affected were predominantly women.  We were most affected because our workplaces were the ones that closed down first.  We then went to working from home with childcare closed so we were working and caring for children on top of other responsibilities.  When our friends' workplaces reopened but childcare services did not, we were minding their children as well because we were in bubbles so we have been the most disproportionately affected.</p> <p>  As I said at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and this committee, it is my firm belief that if we take any retrograde steps in terms of the progress we have made for women's rights and equality, we will leave this world a much poorer place than it was beforehand.  What we have seen in the aftermath of Covid in terms of gender equality and women's rights needs to be the catalyst and not the excuse to go backwards.  We know what needs to happen.  We have never been given a better opportunity to make it happen than we have as we emerge from Covid.</p> <p>  I will return to intersectionality concerning challenges around access.  During our first session this morning, I asked the Minister why no all-girl DEIS schools were piloting the new computer science programme.  We were told about reports, reviews, initiatives and how schools were not putting themselves forward.  I know that my own constituency has very good quality clubs such as CoderDojo, science clubs and astronomy and space-based clubs.  They are wonderful.  However, if there is going to be a delay in the State providing access to certain subjects in secondary school because no resource is every delivered overnight and the only option to bridge that gap is one that puts an additional financial burden on the family, how do we get around that?  How do we help hose who are talented and want to be involved in STEM?</p> <p>  No child I know does not know something about STEM.  They just do not recognise it as STEM.  How many kitchens have been destroyed in the making of slime in recent years?  How many volcanoes have erupted in bathrooms?  This is science.  We just do not recognise it as such.  How many bug hotels were built over the past number of years and put out in back gardens?  Coming up with that design is engineering.  It is not that I do not believe there is talent there and a pool to work with.  I am just concerned about the delivery of additional resources - even classroom spaces - for engineering, woodwork or science subjects and meeting the needs that are there.  How do we bridge that gap?  Do we need to provide additional financial resources to make these courses less expensive for parents?  That still does not sit very easily with me.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' opinions on that.</p> <p>  Regarding recommendation 31, "If you can see it, you can be it", we had this conversation with other witnesses who have appeared before us.  There is a very real need to see those from under-represented communities, whether based on their racial or economic background or whatever the case may be, in the national media.  This needs to be coupled with other things.  Look at where we are having this conversation today.  This building is male-dominated.  That is just a fact.  We have not made much progress over the past number of elections so there is a body of work to be done everywhere.  There is a responsibility on the corporate side but also on the influencing side.  If we think of the social media influencers we see at the moment, the majority of them are female and most of what they are seeking to influence does not in any way, shape or form - I do not know how to put this diplomatically and I am struggling to find a diplomatic term for it - influence younger women to focus more on an academic or research career choice.  It is wonderful to see people going off on holidays.</p><p>Lord knows I am looking to going forward to going on holidays and sending a few photographs.  How do we change that?  How do we get people such as Dr. O'Sullivan, Ms Sheridan and Dr. Corcoran and their work out into the ether and the various forms of media?</p></speech>

The mission of Women In Research Ireland is to give a voice to the under-represented.  We extended our reach during lockdown because we were able to host our webinars, talks and panels online.  It is about giving researchers from minority groups and the under-represented the opportunity to present their research to the public, through Women in Research Ireland's fora.  That has been extremely well received and has obviously extended our reach.  We find ourselves at the table in this meeting and very much appreciate that access.  Someone mentioned not pulling up the ladder.  In terms of giving people that equity opportunity and an opportunity to share their research in ways that extend the reach and audience, we all have a role to play in helping each other provide that access to and reach in research in these very important areas.</p> <p>  I also wanted to speak about the fundamental societal and financial impetus to solving the problems we have as a society, where we know there is a dearth of qualified and skilled folks available in certain sectors.  It is a growing issue.  We know that jobs will be out there ten years down the line.  We need to reach students today in primary school to fill those roles, regardless of gender, starting with everything Ms Sheridan mentioned in her opening statement.  In ensuring that those opportunities are amplified early and often and that opportunity is provided on the education side regardless of school type, in Ireland, we really need to put our shoulders to the wheel on this.  It is an absolutely societal need we need to address in equity and opportunity.</p></speech>

What Deputy Clarke said about the influencers was very interesting.  What I will put back to her is that everyone has a responsibility to sweep his or her side of the street.  The bottom line is that the Government's role is to ensure the education system moves quicker and goes with the times.  Rather than focusing on industry or influencers and their role, the Government should ensure that its role is working.  Why is computer science not being offered in schools?  It is not the choice of schools.  The Deputy is not doing this.  However, DEIS schools are not able to incorporate much of what is on offer from the Government because they are too busy caring for all the challenges that happening in their schools.  This is not necessarily directed at the Deputy but influencers would change if society changed.  There are top-down issues and bottom-up issues.  The top-down issues need to be taken care of by the Government.  We need to ensure that everyone has access to digital commodities.  Every child should have a laptop.  We should be providing that as a State, because we are in a tech revolution.</p></speech>

The reason I put that there is that the response of the Minister, Deputy Foley, was that it was up to schools to put themselves forward.</p></speech>

That is a cop-out in a sense.  Schools, especially those that are very disadvantaged, with which I work day in and day out, are offering as much emotional and social support to their students as possible.  Some of them do not have a chance to engage in these wonderful opportunities and then they get blamed for not taking them up.  The reality is that we need to be stronger as a Government and a society and say everybody needs to leave school with the scientific capabilities to engage meaningfully in society.  That is the Government's responsibility.  Anyone who says that a school did not take up the option does not understand schools.  That is not the Deputy.  I am directing that at a Minister if that is what the Minister said.</p> <p>  I loved when the Deputy spoke about CoderDojo.  I went to sign up to CoderDojo for my son years ago.  One needed a laptop and to be able to drive there.  It was just at the new time of laptops as well.  That was my son out.  We were not poor.  We were okay.  The reality is that one has to have the money to be able to engage in the clubs.  The truth is that it is the Government's job to ensure the schools are adequately resourced and have the commodities and capabilities and that it understands how to govern correctly.  Until that happens, the influencers will still be selling whatever products they are developing and getting young ones to think that Mykonos is the best place to go on holiday.  That is okay-----</p></speech>

I am loath to use the term extracurricular activity because they are not hobbies.  They should be provided in school.  While there is a delay in the delivery of those resources, if the only option for children to engage in the likes of computer programming is through a club that operates outside of a school, are we not further disadvantaging a certain group of people who are already disadvantaged because they do not have access in an educational environment?

The issue is that we do not have enough communication about them.  We are funding great programmes in places such as Clare and Athenry.  They are free but the difficulty is linking them together.  That is why I go back to that systems approach.  Everybody needs to know what is out there and available to them.  There are amazing free programmes running in universities throughout the country.  There is definitely a disenfranchising piece, or a separation or an inequity that is being added to, but great funding programmes are also being run.

I apologise that I will not be able to stay for the reply.  I thank the three women for their contributions this morning.  We all agree with absolutely everything that has been said here today.  I do not think I have ever been as frustrated with the slow pace of Government.  It is not just the Department of Education, although I know we are talking about education.  The slow pace is across Government with regard to the societal changes that need to be implemented.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill touched on it earlier.  I wonder whether we will ever get the progress in and equality of access and opportunity that we need, for all our women and men and young girls and boys, if we do not have the support of men.  The root of the slow pace of change is men liking society angled and favoured towards the patriarchy, the way it has been for years.  I cannot find any other reason as to why there is such a slow pace of change.  Dr. O'Sullivan is a legend.  She is an absolute inspiration and a real representation of what we can see, we can be.

It was great that she got an opportunity to speak.  I was excited when I saw that the witnesses were coming in because it is very close to my heart.  To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Foley, she was talking about schools putting themselves forward for a pilot.</p><p>I think she believes there is a commitment to roll it out across the board.  I wanted to say that first.  Having said that, it struck me that if our guests are finding a certain section are not putting themselves forward then, in the same way as when we are looking for women to run for election, you must find people and bring them with you.  Even in pilot programmes there must be a sense in which WRI reaches out to those schools that are not putting themselves forward if there is not a proper representation.  It is important to put on record the Minister was talking about a pilot there and not that it would not be rolled out everywhere.  There is obviously a difficulty, no matter what Department you are in, with your ambition not matching the pace of what can be achieved.  I am also frustrated with the pace of things.</p><p> I speak quite a lot about the importance of mentorship in education.  It does not happen enough.  Especially in these kinds of areas around innovation and research, we need to have innovation and, therefore, it almost has to be cutting-edge.  It cannot be based on an education system that can sometimes creak at the seems.  I would love to hear what our guests think about having more partnerships.  Leaving certificate reform is one part of that but it goes right through primary, secondary and tertiary partnerships so we constantly have, as some guests touched on earlier, people  in front of you who are actually doing it, so you can really imagine yourself in that role.  We say that about politics quite a lot but it is the same across the board.  It is about what that might look like in schools.  I am also on the education committee and we are doing work similar enough to some of the work we are talking about here.  An awful lot of the other questions have been covered but I thank our guests for their passion.  It is important to have passion in these rooms.  It motivates all of us as well.</p></speech>

That was a good concluding question.  I will return to each of our guests in return,  beginning with Ms Sheridan, then Dr. Corcoran and giving Dr. O'Sullivan the last word.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022051900002#Q00300"><p>In reference to the pilot programmes idea, I find it hard to believe many schools feel they have the capacity to take on additional work so it kind of has to be something that is made available but made available in a way they can actually taken on and not just giving them an additional workload.</p> <p>  On representation and mentors, as Dr. O'Sullivan said, a lot of that exists already.  Of course it can be expanded but in having a combined approach, the infrastructure that is already there is very important.  I do not know whether SFI itself can even keep track of what it is funding because there is so much.  That is fantastic but there needs to be a package of measures to be delivered to schools and career guidance councillors who know what is available, including stuff like the STEM passport for inclusion and STEM in the classroom where you go in and visit.  It is important to have a mentor, even to look up to.  Of course, students want to see someone they can relate to.  That is a big thing.  It has to be someone who seems like themselves so they can see themselves in them but also someone they think is cool.  It is a silly thing to say but science is often portrayed as something - and I am not saying that is me - very clinical or that you have to be a certain kind of person for it.  Just to meet regular people who are exactly like you has a major impact.</p> <p>  There are programmes already out there.  The money has already been spent and these are already being funded.  Schools must be made aware of this.  They can be expanded but without even spending a cent it has to be put together as there is an opportunity for uptake there.  The mentor programmes must be expanded as well.  The support and infrastructure should be expanded.  Not only do we need to add extra but we need to expand the ones we have and give them the capacity to spread wider.  We have done online education for the past few years and I do not know why, if there is not a teacher in a regional area, we cannot expand the libraries and computer classes to a computer programme.  I do not think we need to end up hiring thousands more people to start off these programmes to get those skills into schools.  We have the capacity that is within the education system at the moment and what has been built over the past two years.  There are already people who do after-school subjects as optionals.  It is something that exists.  It can be added in.  We have teachers who then do it in loads of different classrooms.  Of course there is a correcting aspect and wider things but they can be expanded in a much easier way than it might seem to begin with, especially building on the capacity of the past two years.</p></speech>

I go back, and this was mentioned earlier, to the Department of Education and the focus on ensuring equity across all schools in Ireland to address the issues that are there with food poverty, access to equipment and supports in both society and the family and in schools.  There is so much more to addressing the equity issue beyond technology and increasing that opportunity to pursue STEM and other careers for both girls and boys at the primary and secondary level.  I thank the committee members for their time and wish them the best of luck with their work.</p></speech>

I really appreciate the Senator's comments on the mentorship piece.  Mentorship can be used in so many different ways.  When I talk to women in industry, it is about someone to get you up the ladder.  When I talk about mentorship, it is literally about having a relationship with another person that could possibly transfer information about where they could go.  We definitely need more of that across the system.  We need more of it from higher education, to secondary, to primary and more opportunities for girls to see people like themselves, to talk to them and to understand.  That costs money.  It is not like you can build a programme and just deliver it.  It requires a massive commitment to trying to change the face of it.  My belief is the only thing that really moves a woman or girl from the place of thinking she is something to something else is being able to have the human capital or the skills to do the thing; the cultural capital, which is to understand the environment, and finally the social capital, which is a relationship with another person where the woman or girl says that person did it and so could I.  If we consider everything from that point of view, we can definitely change things for young women.</p> <p>  It is like research.  When you are a girl you think it is a man in a white coat and it is quite nerdy.  I remember a girl from a DEIS school coming to me and saying Kim Kardashian is really a researcher.  I said no, but she is something.  She is a businesswoman.  These girls were actually looking to who they relate to and asking who is like me and who likes what I like who I can relate to.  I was not necessarily advocating her as the role model but I said it is really important we see people who are a bit like us or that we can relate to, too.  I do not know whether that answers any of the Senator's question but relationships are key to everything.  That is it.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I again thank Dr. O'Sullivan, Ms Sheridan and Dr. Corcoran from Women in Research Ireland for giving us their time and expertise and sharing with us their insights in their written submissions.

They are very welcome.  Some people are attending our meeting remotely and will ask the witnesses questions and hopefully praise them too.</p> <p>  I have a note on privilege, which is read before every committee meeting.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding any references the witnesses may make to other people in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location from outside the parliamentary precincts, which is not the case of the witnesses today, are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and are advised to take legal advice.  That does not apply to the witnesses today.  Witnesses are asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person or entity's good name.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement to be physically present to participate in public meetings.  People from a different political jurisdiction can attend remotely.</p></speech>

We are delighted to be able to attend to share the work of our Strive partnership with the committee.  I am Dearbhla Holohan, from the lead partner, Include Youth.  Deborah Watters is from Northern Ireland Alternatives.  Mary Nolan is from Newstart Education Centre.  Tony Silcock is from Youth Initiatives.  Our fifth partner, Lifford-Clonleigh Resource Centre is not present today, but we will ensure that its valuable contribution is given adequate mention during the course of the afternoon.  Ahead of today&rsquo;s, meeting we provided the committee with background information to the Strive programme, including an independent evaluation with detailed analysis of the types of interventions used and key achievements to date.  To summarise, Strive was one of 11 Peace4Youth programmes supported by the special EU programmes body, with match funding from the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.</p> <p>  From our launch in late 2017, to the recent completion of the project in March 2022, a total of 837 young people completed the programme.  The overall project value was almost &euro;4 million and 28 staff were employed across Northern Ireland and County Donegal.  Many of the areas that we have worked in are underserved by opportunities for young people to participate in youth work activities and some have spent long periods of time without any services.  For example, before Strive became operational in the Lifford area, there had been no youth provision there for nine years.</p> <p>  Strive builds the capacity and skills of young people, decreases the risk of them becoming involved in paramilitarism or anti-community activity and it helps address educational underachievement by supporting young people to remain in education.  It also addresses key issues relating to mental health, suicide, identity and understanding "the other", thus promoting a shared society and peacebuilding.  Strive provides young people with a voice, develops skills and promotes leadership.  It helps young people to shape policy decisions and legislation and ensures young people have a say in key debates and platforms.  As a youth-led programme, young people who are expert by experience, having come through similar situations, use their experience to lead on design and delivery across the programme sites. They work in partnership with skilled and experienced youth workers to support and encourage programme participants to take the lead in setting the agenda for the programme and to look to the needs of their wider community and how they could help to address them.</p> <p>  In addition to the planned outcomes of the programme, there was a myriad of unexpected outcomes from our work, some of which were provided by the Covid pandemic, which none of us could have foreseen.  The way in which our youth workers swiftly mobilised to support our participants with a variety of creative and effective interventions was inspiring, to say the least, and reinforced the necessity and value of the programme to our young people.  Consistent feedback from young people has been that they want to engage with Strive over a longer period.  To this end, we implore funding bodies to focus on the value of nurturing relationships, reflecting on distance travelled, and to adopt an approach that allow for it to take as long as it takes, without restrictive time constraints.</p> <p>  Delivery under Peace IV demonstrated that the programme works for mixed ability groups through supporting young people with a range of complex needs, learning and physical disabilities and behavioural issues to partake in our inclusive programme.  In addition to the leadership opportunities offered through our expert by experience approach, young people from Strive acted as advisory groups for impactful academic research projects.  In partnership with a member of our steering group, Dr. Siobhan McAlister, and her colleagues at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, young people examined issues such as the transgenerational impact of the conflict and the nature of violence in our society.</p><p>The committee has been provided with both the summary and youth versions of the report entitled It Didn&rsquo;t End in 1998: Examining the Impacts of Conflict Legacy Across Generations, to which our young people were key contributors.</p><p> Strive proved particularly effective when we partnered with schools to target those who were most at risk of disengaging with the education system.  We believe the programme has a role to play in tackling educational underachievement and early school leaving.  This is detailed on pages 25 and 26 of the external evaluation.  We know that young people who stay in education and complete their qualifications have much better outcomes across the board and are less likely to become involved in anti-community activity.  We believe this link between the intensive support provided by Strive in maintaining young people in education is something that needs further exploration and there is potential here for a model that could be used more widely in school settings North and South.</p><p> Now more than ever, the need exists to nurture sustained relationships at an all-Ireland level in socially disadvantaged communities to ensure real peace-building through the Good Friday Agreement remains a priority.  Socially disadvantaged communities are feeling increasingly fragile and marginalised due to the impact of Covid-19, Brexit and debates on the protocol, identity, and border polls, in addition to the current cost-of-living crisis.  Many of the issues are the same for those living in rural Border communities as well as those living in urban areas on both sides of the religious and political divide.  We want to use this meeting as an opportunity to share with the committee best practice in the context of our youth-led model of peace building.  We want to champion the added value of genuine, meaningful and truly collaborative partnership working and highlight the conditions needed for consortiums to thrive.  We want to have a discussion on the need for ongoing flexible funding mechanisms that can allow for organisations to work together on a cross-community and cross-Border basis.  We welcome the comments and questions of members and look forward to the discussion ahead.</p></speech>

I am very glad they are here.  What challenges are children with additional needs, particularly autistic children, facing at the moment?  What difficulties are being faced by children in any sort of interface areas?  In her opening remarks, Ms Holohan referred to additional challenges post Covid.  I ask our guests to address the particular issues they may be facing in each of those areas.</p></speech>

We focused on that because young people with special needs were being targeted as a result of their vulnerability.  They were easily recruited into drug-running paramilitarism and even violence in interface areas.  As the young people who go through Newstart Education Centre are aware, it is located very close to the major interfaces, between Springfield Road and Shankill Road.  It is one of the major interfaces, and where the trouble erupted the last time.</p> <p>  Ms Holohan may wish to come in on the response to Covid.  I will leave that topic for my colleagues.</p> <p>  As regards autism, the challenges we are facing are astronomical because kids are coming through primary school without a diagnosis.  When they get to secondary school, they are then fed into special needs schools where they are treated completely differently.  If they had been in special needs schools earlier, it would have made a significant difference to them.  Their lives are completely in turmoil by the time they get to 13 or 14 years of age.</p></speech>

Our programme is more along the lines of social, emotional and nurturing support, along with role modelling.  We have expert by experience support involving young people who have already been through the programme and know the difficulties those children are facing.  They can be role models and peer mentors for them.  Speech and language therapy, however, comes under the authorities.</p></speech>

Ms Nolan stated that by the time children get to secondary school, they are in a very difficult situation.  I was not sure if that was partly due to an absence of service provision or if it was down to the nature of the schooling or simply the nature of what they were facing.  Of course, all autistic children are not the same.  I was trying to delve into her statement in that regard.</p></speech>

Those who are most vulnerable and deprived and live generationally under that umbrella are those who cannot access the services.  The National Health Service, NHS, does not have provision for it and the Education Authority is not providing it.  The responsibility gets passed from Department to Department, such as from health to education.  If the young person reaches the age of 16 and has not had any of the service provision or youth support - that is what we are trying to provide - he or she ends up in either the social care system or the justice system.</p></speech>

I hope my computer is working now.  It did not want me to speak earlier.</p> <p>    I wish to ask our guests about social media because at the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee this week there was focus on how social media may play a part in targeting youth in terms of generating anti-social behaviour or being influenced by paramilitaries.  What are the views of our guests in that regard?  </p> <p>  I left Tyrone when I was a teenager.  In the context of the report, I ask our guests to address the trans-generational trauma and the unique challenges that kids are facing.  </p> <p>  I am on the board of Social Anxiety Ireland.  Social anxiety is the most common anxiety disorder in the world but also the least known because people with social anxiety do not wish to speak about having it.  Is that something our guests notice?  </p> <p>  I thank our guests for coming in.  I will drop down to the committee room at some stage.  I was waiting for somebody to come to my office so I could not leave.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.778" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deborah Watters" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022051900002#F01100"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  I will try to respond on some of them but I will also go back to a pertinent question asked by Deputy Carroll MacNeill in respect of interfaces, Covid and post Covid.  For me, that also feeds into social anxiety.  As regards our findings in respect of interfaces, I am based in the Shankill area of Belfast and Ms Nolan is in west Belfast.  We share an interface and Strive straddles that.  There are still ongoing issues in respect of interfaces.  It is not what we had a number of years ago but we are dealing now with complex issues.  We cannot really talk about Strive and the youth work model without talking about Brexit, the Northern Ireland protocol, the legacy of Covid and the issue of trans-generational trauma.</p><p>I run an organisation that works predominantly within loyalist socially disadvantaged communities.  The issue of the Northern Ireland protocol is very pertinent for us at present.  <br/><br/>To respond to Senator Currie's question, in some ways, one could say the protocol and the narrative around it have been used partly as a recruiting ground for young people and because it gives organisations another reason to be there, a sense of purpose and a sense to be active, whether that is violently or non-violently within their community.  Many of our young people feel that pressure and the pressure of some of the narrative around the protocol.  I do not want to be too critical of that because people have the right to protest and to make their voices heard but I would be quite critical of some of the words used that can tend to incite violence.  That is very dangerous for our young people.  For young people in the Protestant community, there has been that element layered with Covid and a sense of social isolation, decreased levels of mental health and the issue of poverty and the cost of living as well as trans-generational trauma, which is ongoing.  Members of this committee will know that because we have not dealt well with our past, it continues to seep into the very fabric of who we are and how we do business in the present.  Our young people, irrespective of whether they have been active in the conflict, feel that every day.  That is still passed down.  We also feel it in government.  If our politicians do business in that way, why would our young people not reach out and touch that?  <br/><br/>We are working in a very complex environment at present and that is why I think a youth work model is very much needed.  Youth workers in Strive are on the ground.  We are present.  We are at the grassroots and at the interfaces.  We work not only with young people who offend and who traditionally come to the attention of the system but also with the socially isolated young people at home.  We advise them they need help and assistance and ask them how can we be there for them.  That youth work model will be very important as we move forward in dealing with all these complex issues.  <br/><br/>The other element to it, which has been very successful for us, is youth work in schools.  There are some regions that do not like that but teachers love the fact we can go in and ours is not a top-down, punitive or power-over approach.  We bring out the best in young people because we are doing power with them.  We work with them in group work settings and assist with some very difficult issues in schools.  For me, the Strive model is about joining school, community, families and youth work in a model that deals with all those complex layers.<br/><br/>I would cite one example in response to questions raised by Senator Currie and Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  When the recent trouble broke out on the Shankill Road, Ms Nolan's youth workers were out on the street on her side of the wall and our youth workers were on the street on the Shankill Road.  We were there alongside the PSNI to help de-escalate the situation and move people along and with the creditability and legitimacy that we can say to some people:</p><blockquote>	Just cut it out.  Go home.  Inciting violence is not what our community needs and public disorder only destroys your own community.  There are no winners in this. </blockquote><p>That is the kind of youth work model we are trying to sell to the committee today, not in a lucrative way but in a way that says we need this to continue because in a post-conflict society we really need this level of partnership working across the interfaces.</p></speech>

There is much sense in what Ms Watters said.  I used to be a teacher in a school where many of the students had difficult backgrounds.  She put her finger on it.  She has identified her support for them as individuals and recognised their importance and self-worth.</p> <p>  I read a report published yesterday on productivity at work.  Because of the problems and educational deficits among young people in the North, which has the largest number of students in the UK who do not continue in education, with many leaving school very young, there is a major issue in terms of productivity at work, which the report stated comes down to educational disadvantage.  Ms Watters put her finger on a extremely important issue.</p></speech>

We would prefer that to be in a positive sense rather than going towards an armed organisation, a criminal gang or a paramilitary organisation.</p></speech>

We plan to visit Belfast soon.  I ask that the witnesses might identify if we could meet some young people on both sides of the divide if they think that would be appropriate.  We would like to do that as it would be helpful for us and hopefully support what the witnesses want.</p> <p>  I took a few minutes off Senator Currie's time but I am sure she will forgive me.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Watters for what she said.  I was in Belfast last summer and met some people who had also tried to de-escalate what was happening in interface areas.  They said the youth workers were out on the ground and they spoke about the role they play.  I thank the witnesses for that.  I would take this opportunity to say, and I am sure everyone will agree with me, that is why we need the Assembly up and running.  The work of the witnesses is targeted, sensitive and attuned to what is happening on the ground.  I am sure the Fine Gael members present and others will support them.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for being before the committee.  It is a really interesting discussion.  I also thank them for their opening statement and all the materials they sent us.  It will take a while to read them all.  It was interesting to hear them detail the work that goes on in the interface with young people that is youth-led.  A large part of the problem is that we do not hear about the good things that are going on, the good collaboration and good communication.  The media bear a big responsibility for that.  Ms Watters mentioned the bus that was burned and straight away that was the story that was portrayed.  That underestimates the work of the young people and of the witnesses being done on the ground.  We must find better ways to ensure that is the message that goes out, that it is a positive one and that there is an acknowledgment of the good work done in the communities by the witnesses and by others where there is real leadership.</p> <p>  I want to get a better feel for what the witnesses are trying to achieve and have achieved.  The Strive participants have been described as the agents of change who have been supported to develop meaningful and lasting relationships that ultimately contribute to building more peaceful and prosperous communities.  What is the most standout example the witnesses could give me from the programme where that is demonstrated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.786" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dearbhla Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022051900002#G00800"><p>Our expert by experience model is based on using the expertise young people have, particularly young people who have been through our services and through similar experiences.  It is not us as youth workers or managers imposing our idea of what peace-building should be or what the programme should look like.</p><p>It is very much coming from the young people's point of view.  Those expert-by-experience young people are very close in age to the participants.  We have found that trying to provide that sort of vehicle for them to facilitate work with other young people is much more meaningful in terms of the programme content and what they get out of it because they feel it is their programme and there is a real sense of ownership.  They can also articulate their feelings about what is going on in the wider world and relate it much more clearly to those expert-by-experience volunteers.  It is also something that is aspirational for young people because they want to get through the programme so they can then play that role for other young people.  They are not the young people who would usually be asked to be the school prefect or to get into those sorts of roles.  They are not used to getting asked to hold these sorts of positions of responsibility.  It can be particularly hard to get young males to step forward because it takes a lot for them to stand up and say they have some expertise they can offer their peers.</p><p> It is so important to look for those opportunities, especially ones that are not just about us continuing to churn out the same peacebuilding programmes again and again.  They may have been great when I was a young person going to them, but the world has changed so much now.  Senator Currie's question was about social media, which has changed where young people get their views from so much.  It is not all about what they hear at home around the dinner table.  It is also what they hear from many unregulated sources.  Some of that work can be around talking to young people, not always through structured debate, but through conversations over a cup of tea about what is going on for them now, or that thing they read on Facebook the previous night, and picking apart what it actually means.  How do they know it is true?  That is how a lot of myths are perpetuated around sectarianism and racism and so on.</p><p> In general, we need to look for more and more forums where young people can feel they have a place in their communities.  A major part of the programme is around community volunteering.  We do not say to young people we have arranged for them all to go to pick litter on Wednesday night, for example.  They come to us, say they have had a look in the area and have seen some areas that might need brightening up, or they think they could raise some money for a particular project.  They come up with the idea of what they want to do to generate a community project and, as far as possible, go about leading that with support from youth workers.  It is all about youth workers as facilitators of the process as opposed to imposing what we think.</p></speech>

We have lots of similar projects here.  Are there exchanges between North and South?  Will the witnesses give some examples of successful exchanges?</p></speech>

The closing day at the end of the programme under PEACE IV was held in Tyrone.  Young people from Lifford Clonleigh Resource Centre came to Tyrone, as did other young people from Belfast, Downpatrick and the surrounding areas, and we all met in the one place.  Sometimes, when we go into halls where young people are from different areas, counties and countries, they all sit in their own cliques.  When we went in that day, and it was a massive hall, the amazing thing about it was they were all playing football, dodgeball and badminton and eating burgers together.  It was lovely to see agents of change right before our eyes.  We watched that on that day.  These were young people who were afraid of what was across the Border.  They were afraid of what was on the other side of the wall, never mind across a border.  We saw that they started out saying, "Prods get all the jobs" and "The Taigs learned in jail", which was trans-generational.  We knew that was either being fed down the family line or was coming from what they had read on anonymous sites through social media.  It was amazing to see them come through the other end of that and watch the peacebuilding take place before our eyes.</p></speech>

This is so it is not just a one-off day but programmes of events where people learn about each other, learn from each other and understand each other better.  I have seen programmes where we have had loyalist students and students from republican areas here.  The dynamic has been very interesting in that I found there was no difference between us, when we talked about mental health and other issues.  It was politics in action.  It was Mr. Peter Weir who brought groups down here.  How do we scale up the work the representatives are doing?  What do they need to scale up that work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.791" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022051900002#H00500"><p>Funding needs to be fluid for this type and model of youth work.  Often, when funding becomes available for youth work or youth models or programmes, it is for a maximum of two to four years.  There is then a two-year gap before more money comes along.  We have lost the vehicle of change in those two years.  Things go back to square one.  That Generation We we have worked with go on to make a small difference, but we do not get the process we wanted or envisaged.  There needs to be a ten- or 15-year strategy on making this turnaround rather than short breaks.  I know that everything has to be reviewed and monitored and all the rest of it, but that can be done parallel to the money coming through.  The funding and resources need to be fluid.</p></speech>

As Deputy Conway-Walsh said, it also needs to be sustained.  I will be very honest about where loyalism is at present.  I definitely think we have gone back ten or 15 years.  We have regressed in our relationship with the other community, with policing, with people in the South of Ireland, and in our perception.  All of that is through the lens of the Northern Ireland protocol.  When the protocol plays out, it does not do so on leafy Malone Road.  It plays out in socially disadvantaged communities.  Let us be honest, middle class Protestants always travelled to Donegal but not our working-class parents in north Belfast.  The one thing parents of the Strivers were looking forward to before Covid was a residential to Donegal because they had never been across the Border.  Those are the issues that sustained long-term funding would address.  It is not just about the gatekeepers in communities being given the access.  It is about making sure that is cascaded down so that ordinary mums and dads, and ordinary young people, really get the opportunity to see the other through a different lens.  It is very important.</p> <p>  In particular, I am living and working in communities where there is currently a policy of non-engagement.  It is, "Do not engage with the Irish Government.  Do not engage with Irish officials.  Do not do this.  Do not do that."  My organisation is a restorative organisation.  We stand up in communities and say our ethos is about engaging so we will continue to engage and to open the doors, but there are people who would not like me being here today.  That is where we are at and it is why Strive is so important.  It is not just about a youth work model.  It is still about peacebuilding at its core and relationship building.  I believe the loyalist community is back where we were ten or 15 years ago rather than moving forward.</p></speech>

It is interesting how young people can influence the adults in their household for positive change.</p> <p>  How do the groups measure increased educational attainment and employability?  I know much of that work is very difficult to measure because a lot of it qualitative rather than quantitative.  How do they measure attainment and people who go on?</p></speech>

Our main focus was on positive progression.  The vast majority of our young people were in school and our focus was on maintaining them there.</p><p>Time and time again, the feedback we got from school leadership was that if it was not for this programme, these young people would have left.  That was not the main reason we designed the programme, but we soon started to sit up and notice that it was happening consistently.</p><p> We were operating in five areas of Donegal, including in youth and partnership with Lifford-Clonleigh Resource Centre, as well as across the Border.  The teachers in Donegal were saying the same thing as those in west Belfast.  The parents were saying that it was much easier to get the child out of bed and to school on the morning he or she knew Strive would be around the school that day.  The pressure that takes off the family that morning is a big deal, if that is what they are dealing with three or four days per week.  Some young people would have attended in school and also in the evening at community sessions.  Others were school age but attended entirely outside of school on an entirely community basis.  However, where the connection was very much with the school, the feedback from the teachers, the leadership and the classroom assistants, who were fantastic and would have sat in on and taken part in many of the programmes, was that they could see the difference in the young people from when they were in an academic session to when they were in their Strive session.  They were different people entirely.</p></speech>

We want to encourage more people into apprenticeships, not least because we have considerable challenges in workforce planning.  We are looking at apprenticeship models across the island.  Is it feasible for somebody to start an apprenticeship in one area and complete it in another?</p></speech>

Many young people are leaving school and not going on to further education.  Where Ms Watters' interface is on the Shankill Road, for years, many boys left school and did not go into further education because they had jobs in the shipyard.  That was just the way it was.  The Protestants got all of the jobs.  That is the way kids saw it.  There was an entitlement not to go on to further education.  Research was done a few years back on the lack of aspiration among young Protestant males.  They lacked aspiration because nobody was encouraging them to go anywhere else.  It is the same on the other side of the wall when talking about young Catholic men.  They are progressing and going on to university.  There is aspiration, but there is still a clique of deprived young people who are not going anywhere.  They need apprenticeships and skills-based jobs.  That can be fluid also.  It can start in County Tyrone and end up in County Donegal.  An apprentice can move about, but it depends on the criteria for entry because of the difficulties the young people are coming back with.</p></speech>

We are compiling a report on student mobility.  We know that even in terms of education, if people can stay in there own communities or are as connected as possible to them, they are likely to bring about positive change.  It has an impact.  I look forward to visiting Strive with the committee.  It is a very good suggestion by the Chair.  I would love to talk to some of the young people about educational opportunities across the island in order that we could work together on the exchanges and learning there.</p></speech>

Our biggest problem is meeting political loyalism, for want of a different word.  There is no engagement.  We want to work with everyone, as does Strive.  That is really where it is at.  If we can bring about that change or Strive can help us to understand the viewpoint in a deeper, more profound way, we would be very happy to participate fully in that as a committee.</p></speech>

I thank them for their presentation.  As far as I am concerned, the work they are doing is very powerful.  We as a committee, or Government members within the committee, can do to help their cause and expand their programme, we absolutely need to do.  Some of their testimony today has been very strong and clear.  Politicians are inclined at times to make comments here and there along the way, as if we know everything that has gone on in Northern Ireland, when actually we do not, for the very reason that we do not engage enough with communities in Northern Ireland.  I am not saying that for any one part; I am saying it for us all.  That is my strongly held opinion.  The point that really came home to roost for me today was that made by Ms Holohan about loyalists having regressed ten or 15 years.  That is a very serious statement, but one to which we down south would very much want to listen.</p> <p>  On the back of what the Chairman said about going up to meet the groups in Belfast and them coming down here, I suggest that we go up first on one of our trips to meet people in their own communities and get a better understanding.  We too are learning as we move along and as things progress.  We need to know more about communities.  Many of us come from a nationalist perspective and we certainly need to know its views, but we are very much lacking the loyalist perspective.  It behoves us to start to get an understanding of all sides and ensure that all voices are heard, recognised and looked after.</p> <p>  I congratulate Strive on the approach it is taking because too many organisations work on one side or the other.  I was struck by Ms Holohan's remark with regard to the religious and political divide.  How true is that?  That is really where our problems are.  If it is a political divide, then we discuss things on a political basis.  Religion should have nothing to do with this but, unfortunately, it does.  We are wasting our time talking about border polls if we are not doing the work on the ground, because a border poll will not have a basis.  Those present have very much brought that home to roost today.  They make a very important point.</p> <p>  I very much want to help with contributing towards having the Governments, especially that on this side of the Border, work with Strive to try, if we can, to develop more funding for it and develop it as an organisation.  Rather than just the Six Counties, this should be done on an eleven-county basis because those Border counties and areas are as badly affected as anywhere in the Six Counties.  We should be dealing with all of this on an eleven-county basis and I would like to see the organisation expanding in that regard on the basis of what it is.  It does excellent work.</p> <p>  I remember meeting a lady called Betty Holmes at the Lifford-Clonleigh Resource Centre approximately 20 years ago.  She started off Lifestart.  She has done great health work since in terms of cancer care and patient care and is an excellent individual.  The centre ran a programme called Lifestart which was about giving support to parents with a new child, until the age of six.  We all bring kids into this world but we do not have a clue what we are doing and we learn as we go along.  I was given fantastic information and support.  That centre does fantastic work.</p><p>I also know about the work that is being done with the likes of St. Johnston, Newtowncunningham and other areas along the Border.  I heard what the witnesses said about the protocol and all these things do not help at all.  I agree with the witnesses that transgenerational trauma is what we need to undo and the witnesses are involved in doing that.  It is about the next generations; it is not about us.  We do not want things to keep repeating.</p><p> In light of the 11 counties that I referred to, do the witnesses have plans to expand across that basis?  If they do, I ask them to come back to us and give us a breakdown of what those plans are.  Do the witnesses engage with the shared island unit or with any of the research it does?  If they do not, we would like them to do so because it is vitally important that they do.  It is particularly important that they engage with the research that is going on as they can be key players in a lot of the research that other organisations and academics are doing, including the likes of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  There are 62 pieces of research ongoing on the whole island and the witnesses need to be feeding into that.</p></speech>

The breadth of their work is impressive and they are dealing with people who are disadvantaged, including young people who are in care or about to go into care, and some migrants as well, particularly people with educational underachievement.  It is so disappointing that in this day and age, when there should be such opportunities in education at second level and in going on to further education and training, we still have so many people leaving formal school settings without any particular skills.  It is so disappointing because, as we all know, by and large there are good opportunities in our island and elsewhere.  We all know that the best way to engage people is to have them gainfully employed for the long term.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that 837 young people have completed the programme since it started a few years ago.  When young people complete the programme, is contact maintained with them to see if they have gone into training or employment?  I remember being slightly involved with the wider horizons programme some years ago, which was funded by the International Fund for Ireland.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan it had great collaboration through the vocational education committees at the time, which are now our education and training boards, through the Youthreach programmes.  The Youthreach programme is a second chance for education.  We have seen people who did not complete their formal second level education go back and I know many of those individuals who thankfully completed Youthreach programmes and went on to further education.  Some of those people have gone on to do primary degrees and get postgraduate qualifications, which shows what can be done if people can be engaged.</p> <p>  The Chair spoke about teaching children who come from homes where education might not have been a priority, which is unfortunate.  We cannot emphasise enough the need for people to attain educational qualifications and training.  The witnesses might revert to me if they have case studies of some young lady or man whose path in life they have followed subsequent to them using their programmes.  I remember seeing encouraging cases from Youthreach programmes.  I go to the graduation programmes every year.  I always find them uplifting from the point of view of our political work.  Some of the guest speakers on the day would be students who had gone through Youthreach.  They might have completed their degree programmes and are now teaching or otherwise employed.  The role model is important for young people.  Graduations from colleges of further education are always uplifting as we see children who we know have come from homes that may have been dysfunctional and who did not get many advantages in life.  It does not just impact on the people themselves but also on their families and on the wider communities.  It has such a positive impact in a community where there is disadvantage when young people from the local area do well.  Do these programmes have any particular links with local employers or statutory agencies?  In many instances we do not use the leverage that should be used with companies that could take in young people for training or give them work experience during the time they are doing a particular programme.</p> <p>  Ms Watters has put the mood in the loyalist communities in stark terms.  As my colleague Senator Blaney and others have said, it is worrying to see the regression she talks about.  Around the time of the election we saw all the emphasis on the protocol, etc.  Ms Watters mentioned that they want no truck or policy of engagement with the Irish Government.  No community in this country, North or South, has anything to fear from the Government, public service or political system here.  It is mutually beneficial for us all and the more progress that can be made in society the more everyone benefits.  Over the years successive Governments have made an effort to put investment into communities.  I was at the Skainos Square community and resource centre on the day that the former First Minister, Peter Robinson, and the former deputy First Minister, the late Martin McGuinness, performed its official opening.  If you look at the funders for that centre, from memory the Department of Foreign Affairs reconciliation fund was one of them.  I was in other community and resource centres throughout Belfast and elsewhere where you will see plaques or messages setting out who the funders were, and in many instances it would have been the Department of Foreign Affairs making a contribution.</p> <p>  None of us in this committee can speak for the Government and we do not do so but there is a willingness there to continue to invest in human and physical infrastructure.  The investment in the human infrastructure and resource is more important now than ever.  Investing in people is so important.  We need to get the message out that we want to continue to work.  I welcome Ms Watters's comments when she said that policy is out there.  It is disappointing that this is the message that is coming down to communities and people working with youth groups.  We were often insular in our thinking as a country but we have to be more outgoing.  There is generosity out there to engage and assist because the broader picture is that an Ireland at peace and communities in every corner of our country doing well will benefit us all.</p></speech>

It wants to have a game of football with a team from the loyalist community in the North on the site of the Battle of the Boyne.  That would be a day out for everybody with social mixing, including for young children.  There is a lot of goodwill everywhere for that.  It is not political and it does not compromise anybody's political views or independence.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on the last point on this all being about people and I want to ask a couple of broad questions.  First, I refer to the evolving funding landscape in Northern Ireland.</p><p>I refer in particular to the evolution of European funds, be they INTERREG or the PEACE III moneys, and the evolution towards the new shared prosperity funding to replace the EU Structural Funds such as the European Social Fund, and how that affects the ability to invest in young people, and especially in certain communities.  Arising from that, are there any wider comments on the more mainstream government funding?  I am very conscious that the European Union funding is additional, and a lot of it should be addressed through mainstream budgets.  Do the guests have any thoughts on how that can be improved?  Do they have any worries with regard to uncertainty around the Northern Ireland budget and the potential for cuts, where they may impact the most, and where they may inadvertently cause unintended consequences, perhaps for those who most need the assistance?</p><p>Do the representatives here today have any other comments on the wider policy framework?  I am particularly mindful of the need for a proper 14 to 19 strategy to better integrate what happens with young people in school and then in further education, apprenticeships, and on to university, and how this can be joined up a bit better.  There is also the report into educational under-achievement, particularly among Protestant boys.  Do the representatives have any comments on the report's conclusion and how they could be better implemented into policy?  That is a very broad range of issues and questions.</p></speech>

We have already spoken with Dr. Farry about this.  Part of the issue around the funding is the fragmented nature and the gap in funding.  Because PEACE IV funding has ended, and because PEACE PLUS will not be operational on the ground, this has caused real difficulties for our programme.  Ms Holohan spoke about the Strive programme ending.  We are here in a period when Strive is no longer operational because of a lack of continuity funding.  This is very difficult.  It is difficult for communities and it is difficult for us in our space in Northern Ireland because of where we are with a very fragile system around government.  Personally, I believe that we need to have a Government in place , an Assembly in place and an Executive in place.  We need budgets agreed.  We need to move forward.</p> <p>  Often, when there are going to be cuts it is the money going into communities that is cut first.  People do not seem to value that funding as much.  They do not see the long-term results and the impact of that.  There is not as much of an outcry.  Often, programmes like ours are not as politically connected as some other programmes.  It is, therefore, easy to cut our money.  This needs to be looked at.  When there are going to be cuts I would say not to cut community first.  The funders need to talk to communities and include them in the decision-making.  A mechanism must be found, through whatever civic structure, to make sure that young people have a voice in the process and that communities have a voice in the process.  The community must be connected with government in the same way we want to connect communities with schools.</p> <p>  On the issue of educational under-attainment among Protestant boys, I am fed up talking about this.  It is 25 years on from the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and that situation has barely improved.  There is something wrong with that.  There is something wrong if we cannot make systemic change, revolutionise our education system, and ensure our poorest young men have opportunities, be they in apprenticeships or third level education.  There is something going wrong with how we are doing business.  It is not just a "me" problem or an "us" problem.  It is a government problem.</p></speech>

Youth work is seen as the bottom of the scale.  Without youth work and the relationship model, nothing else works.  Yet, we are the first to go.  Community education was completely obliterated out of west Belfast because of a change in title and what level of education community providers could give to the adults to progress.  The money just went.  The funding was cut and it went to further education colleges.  That needs to stop.  There is a snobbery within professions.  Youth workers need to be treated as equals.  Our government needs to look at that because this approach needs to go down through the universities.  Youth work should be on par with social work, teachers, lawyers and barristers.  Without us changing the lives of some young people, this does not get any better.</p></speech>

Have you formed a lobbying group?  Perhaps we can assist in that, in the context of the shared island as my colleague has suggested, or by supporting this and drawing attention to the inequalities, especially when one is looking at programmes and the matrix is militating against your good work.  This committee would be happy to help out in that regard if we can.  Perhaps the witnesses will, through the clerk, give the committee a note.  We will have a look at this and see if we can help in any way.  It is not good enough that the representatives here today would feel that and say it here.  It is our job to make sure that we listen to you.</p></speech>

There is real and genuine concern at the moment around the replacement for the European Social Fund, ESF.  With the levelling up agenda and the shared prosperity fund, we can see that the money is not there.  There is not a like-for-like replacement.  As Ms Nolan has said, community education and the employability programme that had previously been funded by the ESF, and which Dr. Farry will know well from his time as the Minister, are all sitting and not knowing what is going to happen after the end of March 2023.   Those programmes would be the follow-on programmes for young people progressing through the likes of ourselves.  That is where they would move into a more employability focus.  There is no clear path for any of us as to what will happen come April 2023.  We will see a lot of organisations closing or severely downsizing, along with the withdrawal of services in the community and particularly for young people and people with disabilities.  This will affect people right across Northern Ireland.  Again, the lack of an Assembly makes it very difficult for us to challenge this in any way or get answers to any questions.  It is a very real concern at the moment.  There are applications going in for peace building funds out of that as well.</p></speech>

This was for young people aged 16 to 17 years who were leaving school.  We were invited onto that panel so we could articulate how Strive works as a model, and what elements of it could be taken into a government-funded training programme, the old workings of which have been delayed due to Covid.  I believe that a pilot is currently being funded.  I do not know if it goes far enough in utilising a youth work approach, but certainly the value of youth work has been recognised through the Peace4Youth programmes.  I would like to see greater flexibility within that space for young people if they are coming out of school aged 16 to 17.  Having to go in and do 20 or 25 hours per week does not work for a lot of them.  We found that they would not last on some of those types of programmes.  As Dr. Farry will be aware, there is a very high drop off rate.  Whether these issues have all been remedied through that or not, I am sure we will find out in due course.</p></speech>

It is nice to be here, and it is good to meet Dr. Farry.  One of the things that is burning in my heart is who youth workers are and what is the purpose of them.  One of the things we do quite well is that we get into the messes of young people's lives.  We are one of the first professions to actually do that.</p><p>One of the skills of youth workers is going on long-term transitional journeys with young people from their childhood into adulthood.  We are the first point of contact for many of the young people, not the social worker, police officer or care worker.  They come to us to see whether they can get support, care and unconditional positive regard.</p><p> Dr. Farry mentioned schools and the associated division.  I would go a little further than he did.  While I believe the school system needs to be different and changed, there is still a large number of housing estates in Northern Ireland that are completely Catholic or completely Protestant.  I live in the Colin area in west Belfast.  The nearest city is Lisburn, to which there is not even a bus although it is closer than Belfast.  I would go further that Dr. Farry and say there is a division around housing.  The peace walls in Northern Ireland have got bigger since the Good Friday Agreement came into effect, not smaller, thus separating communities even more.</p><p> Senator Currie talked about the transgenerational impact.  We have young people who do not think the same as their parents.  They do not have the fear their parents have of going into another area.  They do not have that anxiety or stress.  Young people are agents of change.  I completely agree with Deputy Conway-Walsh in that regard.  The best thing about young people is that they want to change.  They do not want to keep living in the past; they want to move forward.  They see a brighter future and new vision for the north of Ireland or the whole island of Ireland.</p><p> One of the really successful aspects of the programme was that it was co-designed by young people.  Nothing was put in place until they rubber-stamped it.  Young people need their voices heard but they also need to be listened to.  The same applies in respect of our schools, housing estates, bus routes and taxis.  Our first port of call is determining what our young people think.  Thankfully, they are going to be the generation that will take this on.  Therefore, it is vital that we take their voices and opinions on board.  However, I would go a little further than Dr. Farry regarding the divided space.  I think it is about much more than school.  There are many more questions to be asked about that.</p></speech>

I can share the email about it later.  The forum came to our town and there were about 90 young people from post-primary schools in attendance.  They spoke to us about their needs.  They were working with people in the North.  From 24 June to 26 June, they are to have a conference at which they will have a plan.  Young people from the North and South will be involved.  I do not know whether Mr. Silcock is part of that but I am making him aware of it in case it is in any way helpful.  It is more of the same in that it allows young people to articulate their views and plan for the future.  It is about giving them a leadership role and making sure they are listened to.</p></speech>

Therefore, I will resist the temptation to engage in repetition.  I will make my first point without blowing smoke because I know none of the guests need or want that.  From my experience of having lived in and represented an interface area, I am fully aware of the invaluable work that youth workers do at grassroots level on the front line above and beyond the nine-to-five of their jobs, for want of a better term.  From that perspective, they have made the case very well.  I have seen the work at first hand and up close.</p> <p>  I want to make two points.  Dr. Farry touched on some of the EU-related issues I was going to refer to.  We have talked about politics, the political structure and how it relates to young people and youth work.  That is critical.  A really important strand in the broader societal debate is how the media portrays young people, particularly those who live in or come from interface areas.  I do not like the term "interface" because it dehumanises communities.  The Shankill Road has a very proud working-class community with a really rich history.  The same goes for Springfield and Short Strand.  It is little wonder, therefore, that young people feel devalued if they come from those communities.  There is also an element of desensitisation because it is quite easy to engage in violence when you do not see a community, families and fellow young people and when all you see is an interface.  That is what has happened, and that is what is in the news.  What really resonated with me was the point that was made during Deputy Conway-Walsh's slot.  The commentary on the burnt bus on the Shankill Road during the last round of troubles at the interface was made in the absence of knowledge of the hours, shifts and hard graft put in.  There has to be a point at which the media get to the root of youth work and account for what youth workers bring to our society.</p> <p>  The second point I wanted to make was on the issue of post-Brexit and post-Covid circumstances.  While I understand full well the point Ms Watters made about the protocol and the sensitivities in that regard, is there anything emerging from engagement with young people on the loss of their European identity and the entitlements, rights and protections, and even funding streams to develop programmes, that they would have had before Brexit?  I raised a few weeks ago the DiscoverEU programme, which concerns the free travel pass given to 60,000-odd 18-year-olds so they could travel for free for a month across Europe.  That is no longer accessible to young people in the North.  Are we cutting through some of the broader noise?  In saying that, I do not want to be unconscious of the legitimate concerns.  Are we breaking through to say that while the protocol exists and there are concerns about it, there is a broader issue concerning the impact on rights, entitlements and other things? </p> <p>  How did the delegates feel about engagement during Covid?  How do they feel now about the re-engagement with young people?  Have they lost many young people as a result of Covid who have not come back?  Is there an upsurge in the number who want to avail of youth services because they are emerging from Covid and all the associated mental health problems?</p></speech>

We are all part of the voluntary sector, the third sector.  I did not get one day off during Covid.  I did not work from home one day.  We were constantly determining the needs of young people and how to meet them.  Many of us here transformed all our centre-based and face-to-face work in seven days, transferring it to Zoom.  I am referring not only to working with young people but also to the new policies and safeguards and everything that goes along with these.  Young people are coming back.  That is for sure.  We have had to redevelop, redesign, co-design and change how we operate.  Thankfully, we are moving out of Covid although it is still circulating.  However, many opportunities arise from it.  From my perspective, I got to meet more parents, speak to more young people and engage with more teachers.  They got to engage with us and learned to value what we do.</p> <p>  One of the key things going through my head is that youth work is informal education, not formal education, and is therefore about voluntary participation.  Young people choose to be with us.  They do not get that choice in going to school.  They choose to be with us in their hundreds and want to be with us.  There is value in what we do, and they get a sense of belonging and ownership.  Covid brought a myriad of challenges, including social isolation, anxiety, stress, mental health issues, depression, access issues, and alcohol and drug abuse.  These all landed with us and we had to provide support services.  Therefore, there are helpful things and not-so-helpful things.  In general, the voluntary sector, the third sector, is exhausted along with the health service.  We are definitely exhausted and just coming out of that.  I know I am exhausted.  No two days were the same in that you constantly had to think, design, redesign and put programmes out.</p><p>If that did not work because you had 45 young people on a Zoom call and 20 were engaging, how are you going adapt and engage the other 20 to 25 people?  There was constant engagement.</p></speech>

Our numbers went up.  We were not counting those numbers because that was not part of what we were doing.  The kids who were not engaging with online learning when they were meant to be at school from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. were being picked up by us too.  We did not get a day off and our work doubled.  As for recognition, the kids turning up was our recognition.  I understand Mr. Silcock's point about how we got the others to participate when there were engaging 20 online.  We undertook garden gate visits to get to meet parents.  We went on garden gate visits where you were able to stand at the gate and talk to a child who was really struggling in the family home.  We were able to go out to the doors and be with them.  We were masked-up and gloved-up.</p></speech>

My views on that would be very different from those of the young people I work with.  I have an 18-year-old who is about to go to university.  One of my hopes for him pre-Brexit was that he might be able to study in Europe, so I feel that.  I voted to remain.  As a Protestant and a unionist living in Northern Ireland, I feel very keenly the loss of my sense of European identity.  That is a personal opinion but it is important it is heard because we often hear a single narrative around this and there is not a single narrative around it.</p> <p>  Most of the young people Northern Ireland Alternatives works with never had any aspirations to travel.  They live very localised, parochial lives.  At times, even getting into the city centre is an issue.  Strive has endeavoured to begin conversations about rights by saying to people that this may not be real to them now but it will have implications for them in ten years' time.  That is how we begin to talk about a sense of rights.  That has not always been palatable within the loyalist community so it is something we are making a deliberate and conscious effort on.  Rights are for everyone.  Now that Northern Ireland is no longer part of the EU, there is a loss of rights around that.  I am part of looking at the implications of that Ireland-wide, even in terms of people-smuggling, trafficking and all those issues.  If you are charged with an offence in the South, what does that mean in the North?  Those are real issues for our community so it is a valid issue to raise.  Can I say that within the loyalist community, the focus on the protocol is so great that there is no negativity around that?  The only right they are interested in is the right around the constitutional issue, so there is an onus on us to widen that debate out.  When I say "us", I mean leaders within loyalism.</p></speech>

This comes back to and touches upon the point I made around the broader media issue.  There are voices there.  I am certain there have been young people who have penetrated through some of that in the media and have got a terrible time.  Even though all they are doing is being young people, reflecting on life, engaging in thought processes and asking certain questions, they have been harried.  The representation of young people and their portrayal in the media is a societal issue North and South, east and west, and around the world.  The added dynamic in our own experience means we have a job of work to do.  Again, we cannot impose upon the media what its editorial stance should be, and that is not what we want to do.  From the perspective of the peace process and a post-conflict society, I agree with Ms Watters inasmuch as there needs to be a space for all of those voices, as broadly and as regularly as possible, so they are not so confined.  In particular, if our guests do not mind my saying, it needs to be predominantly the voices of young people.  I wanted to make that point as well.</p></speech>

Before Covid hit, the young people we were working with all along that Border corridor were really concerned about Brexit.  It was a hot topic and the anxiety was again passed down through the generations.  I grew up very close to the Border in County Donegal.  I attended Lifford-Clonleigh Resource Centre as a young person.  I recall my experience of what it was like to go to Strabane to go swimming on a Sunday.  There was a checkpoint you had to go through just to go to the swimming pool.  I recall not really understanding what that was about.  Young people have heard stories for years and years about how it affected people's everyday lives.  They just did not know what to expect and how bad it was going to be.  Then you had all the rhetoric and the different voices in the media to contend with as well.  Some young people chose to switch off from it - they thought they could not deal with it because it was just too much.  Others were concerned about the practicalities of visiting family members on the other side of the Border.  If a family is separated, you might have a parent living on each side of the Border.  There are a huge number of practicalities there.  Rural transport is awful, as members will know, so it is very hard for the young people we work with in Donegal to get about.</p> <p>  When Covid hit, a lot of the tension about what Brexit would mean from day to day was put on ice.  Young people are struggling to try to process everything that has happened recently, including the cost-of-living crisis, the war in Ukraine and climate issues.  It is a huge amount for anyone to process.  That is why spaces like Strive are so important because you can come in and have those conversations and not be afraid to ask any questions you might want to ask about it.  There are no stupid questions.  People can vent their opinions as well.  They can ask what is the protocol and what does it mean.  It is a very complex issue that is sort of bandied around in conversation.  If you turn on the radio, you cannot go five minutes without hearing it said at the minute.  There is a lot of that noise out there.</p> <p>  How to get positive stories of young people into the media has been an ongoing issue for years.  Include Youth collaborated on a research project about it years ago.  If you were to pick up that piece now, I would say very little has changed.  There is goodwill in the media but again you have to respond to your audience and what they want to hear.  Sometimes our stories are not going to be what makes it up to the top of the news.  Social media has a place and we are very mindful of trying to put positive stories out there about young people on our social media feeds.  You will get parents following those and young people who are supportive of the organisation doing likewise, so you are probably preaching to the converted much of the time.  We do not want to thrust a young person into the media glare either.</p> <p>  During Covid, our social media was very active.  That was one of the ways we used to have a bit of fun with young people and get messages out there as well.  In addition to the serious messages about staying at home, washing your hands and all that sort of stuff, there were fun activities to try to lift the mood a wee bit.  However, young people were very aware they were being blamed - sort of named and shamed - in the media and on social media as being out at parties and breaking lockdown rules.  If you look at who has been fined for that, we know where the blame sits in reality.  It did a lot of damage, particularly in the early days.</p></speech>

The difficulty with elections in the North, without discussing the outcome, is that people may retreat to their traditional view, looking in and not looking out.  There is no attraction in looking to the future with the Assembly right now to open a door or even a window.  It is the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.833" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022051900002#O00300"><p>I will start by saying I disagree with the Chairman about the outcome of the elections.  Clearly I am an outsider from down here looking up.  One of the biggest outcomes was the rise of the Alliance Party, which is representative of a rise in the number of people who just want to get on with life, in a way.  I will still grieve for the loss of the two Green MLAs, who would also have represented that desire to just get on with things.  There was mention of a loss of European identity and Mr. Steven Agnew, a former MLA, signed in by identifying his community as European.  He certainly spoke much about that sense of loss.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile also referred to the power and importance of youth work.  At the time we saw those clashes and difficulties, with the burning bus and all of that, youth work was on the front line and youth workers were literally putting themselves in harm's way to try to make things better for their communities.  The news reported lots of young people causing trouble but there were older or not-so-young people behind them, riling them and using them for their own political ends.  What comes to mind is one news report where local representatives and youth workers were trying to calm things and they became the target of the attacks.  This is just about speaking to the power of youth work and the role that people like the witnesses play.</p> <p>  Building on that, if we are looking at a European social fund cliff for funding in April 2023, there is a responsibility in Dublin and London to ensure that does not come about and we can step in with flexible funding.  That funding should get out of people's way and let them do the working they need to do, which we have already spoken about as being quite successful.  We cannot control what happens in London but what should we in Dublin be asking for as the budgetary process begins to ramp up over the coming months?  What is it we should be campaigning or asking for?  If the delegations wish to provide exact numbers at a later date, it would be very helpful.</p> <p>  I have two brief questions.  I am interested in hearing more about Include Youth and the one-to-one preventative work it does around child sexual exploitation.  I am conscious that I am coming from this from a background in youth work and child protection and this is not the children's committee, on which I also sit.  I do not know how much the witnesses want to go into that and maybe we can speak about it afterwards.  It is an underdeveloped piece that I would love to know more about.  We can save it for afterwards if the witnesses prefer.</p> <p>  As I said, that strikes me as innovative and underdeveloped work down here.  If we have time, it would be great to hear about some positive outcomes and achievements that the witnesses have heard about.  We should get them on record now as well.  Let us hear about the work they do that they are proud of so we can take it away and, as I have said, argue that the funding cliff is closing in and we need to provide a safe landing.  We should be able to say that we need to prevent that funding cliff and give reasons.  It will help us in that advocacy.</p></speech>

We hope PEACEPLUS will be launched next month.  Ms Nolan spoke earlier about issues we have had with the gap in funding.  With the Strive programme we will apply and we hope we will get further funding to expand the programme.  Again, the concern is that if we are lucky enough to be successful, we will be looking into 2023.  Parallel to that is the European Social Fund money, and that will end at the end of March 2023.  That is what I spoke about earlier with Dr. Stephen Farry.</p> <p>  It is a very concerning question across the communities sector.  There is not like-for-like funding ready to go and these processes take a long time to develop, as the committee knows.  I know representatives of the SEUPB were here a few months ago and there was a lengthy consultation process for PEACEPLUS.  The funding process will be quite long as well and there will be a number of calls over the next couple of years.  In terms of a replacement programme around European Social Fund for employability, nothing exists as far as we know.  We are not entirely sure what is going to come out through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund but certainly it will not be like-for-like funding or anything close to it.  Again, we are looking at the same scenario of big gaps in the funding mechanism.</p> <p>  I can briefly touch on the child sexual exploitation matter if anybody wants to follow up on funding afterwards.</p></speech>

Many of these funding programmes are often designed by somebody very far removed from the front line.  An example down here is the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  Much of the time good work is done in spite of SICAP and not because of it.  Are there roadblocks or poor design in these types of funding?  If we do not have like-for-like funding akin to the Social Inclusion Fund ready and if it will take far too long to create that, surely the responsibility on Dublin and London is to find other ways to get in money quickly.  With community development programmes here, money went straight to community groups without having to go through giant programmes and SICAP.  Is there something we can take away, such as deletions or changes?  Maybe we do not need like-for-like funding to replace the European Social Fund if it is a big, hulking bureaucratic mess.  We could hope for something better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.836" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dearbhla Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022051900002#O00600"><p>Our programme is funded through SEUPB and the funding has really worked for us.  The consultation done took on board the needs of the young people and the framework very much suits youth work organisations coming along and being able to put their stamp on it.  With this programme we very much had the freedom to do that.  We had a very supportive relationship with SEUPB.  All the signs point to the same with PEACEPLUS so far and the process has been very good.  Our only criticism is the gap and that is not necessarily the fault of SEUPB.  There are many hoops to jump through with the European Commission and so on and the Governments on both sides must sign things off as well.  I would not be critical in that respect.</p> <p>  We can go back to the lack of an Assembly in Northern Ireland in which these issues can be raised.  The buck really stops with Westminster, which is now in control of that funding pot.  There are narratives that we are not any worse off for leaving the EU and all the funding will still be there.  That is the scary stuff for us and we are asking where it is.  We are not seeing it or any clear and well thought out programmes that will build on years of very positive work and engagement with the communities sector around what works for employability.  We have the evidence base and a number of organisations have been doing the work for years.  There is also plenty of space for others to come through.  It is just about the funding mechanism and who will oversee that.</p> <p>  I can also speak to the child sexual exploitation matter.  Include Youth runs a specialist programme and we have another programme called Give and Take.</p><p>We work very closely with the five health and social care trusts in Northern Ireland.  The programme is specifically designed for young people who are in or leaving care.  It has an employability focus as opposed to Strive, which very much has a peacebuilding focus.  The programme is funded in the main through the European Social Fund but also through the five health trusts, the Big Lottery Fund, Children in Need, the Esm&eacute;e Fairbairn Foundation and other funders.  It is, therefore, a very big programme.</p><p> The work on child sexual exploitation is funded by Children in Need as part of that programme.  It is very much about running the Give and Take programme with young people based around their personal development; mentoring; essential skills in English, mathematics and ICT; and employability.  It also provides work tasters and work placements but does this on a one-to-one basis to suit the needs of a young person.  The reasons is that where a young person is at risk of or involved in sexual exploitation, he or she will need different supports and safeguarding and it will not always be feasible to take part in a group session for reasons and risk factors relating to safeguarding.  The programme runs across Northern Ireland.  We take referrals directly from social workers and young people will access the programme and be assigned a youth worker who will work very intensively with him or her.  If appropriate, the young person may end up joining the group programmes as well.  The Deputy would probably be better off having a follow-up conversation with me and my colleagues who work in that area.</p></speech>

It is very clear that there is significant need out there.  We are doing training with youth workers across Northern Ireland on how to recognise how somebody is at risk of sexual exploitation.  We have been funded by the education authority to do a piece of work.  We can now train youth workers up to level 2, which means no matter where they are working, be it in a statutory or voluntary setting, they can recognise the signs.  Ms Nolan does an awful lot of work with young people with the same issues.  It is a common issue across the community divide.</p></speech>

There are hard and soft outcomes.  I will not say which are better.  Our hard outcome is 837 people who went through the programme over a four-year period and &pound;4 million was spent so that is &euro;4,700 per person, which is incredible.  The other soft outcomes are around self-confidence, self-esteem, the ability to even to hold conversations and understanding difference and diversity.  Regarding Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's question about role models or examples, we have young people in west Belfast who have never been in east Belfast.  That is shocking.  It is seven miles away.  We have mums and dads who have never been in the city centre so if we want a measurable outcome, it is a young person going across to alternatives or wherever else we are going in east Belfast and meeting and greeting people.  It is not only about meeting and greeting people.  It is about having positive experiences and thereby removing the fear their mum and dad naturally or generationally instilled in the family home.  That fear is being removed.  In addition, they are actually participating in their family and challenging and removing the perceptions and some of the ideas their parents have.  When they are sitting at the dinner table, they are actually having really good, constructive conversations.</p> <p>  There are lots of different ways to measure those outcomes.  It is not just about being in the programme.  It is also about how to transition people out of the programme well, so that they do not lose the skills and way of thinking they have been equipped with and still want to engage with the other side or take the bus that goes from west Belfast to east Belfast.  There are lots of hard outcomes that are very measurable but it is the soft outcomes that are sometimes more impactful in terms of changing people's lives.</p></speech>

Dr. Sean Gallagher and Dr. Tony Morgan wrote a paper for the University of Ulster called "The Process is the Product: Is There a Need for Measurement in Youth Work?".  Our work is our outcome.  Every day a child or young person shows up is an outcome.  We need a conversation that stops looking at what the hard or soft outcomes are at the end of it and invest in our children.</p></speech>

It has had that consequence.  The person filling in those forms is ticking boxes and putting in numbers that do not properly reflect the actual work that is happening and those very positive emergent outcomes.

I am really sorry that I am not there in person.  I would have loved to have been there but, unfortunately, I am in London so I am only able to engage this way.  It has been a fascinating discussion and a really positive event.  The committee has engaged significantly with the witnesses.  I would love to visit as well.  I would love to talk to some of the young people.</p> <p>  I will start with the point just made by the Chairman.  It is really important to have young people who are role models for other young people.  I am the mother of children aged 20, 16 and 13.  My 20-year-old child's girlfriend works in youth work as well.  She is part of a young women's group in Coalisland that does brilliant work.  They are passing on the empowerment they were encouraged to have.  One piece of work they are doing involves period poverty.  They are going into schools and talking to children in primary schools about periods and issues around their bodies.  That is far more powerful coming from a youth group than it would be coming from a teacher or others.  It is young people talking to slightly younger people about issues they will face.  That is really important.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, our youth services have often been the low-hanging fruit and when funding has to be cut, that is one of the areas that seems to go first.  It can sometimes be very hard to have youth provision, particularly in rural areas.  It is harder to get those hard-to-reach young people outside towns and cities to engage.  I listened very carefully to everything that was discussed.</p><p>On Brexit and the protocol, Ms Holohan's perception of Donegal, which would be very similar to mine on the Tyrone, Fermanagh, Monaghan border, was fascinating as was the point made by Ms Watter's on the protocol.  I certainly felt that there was a great deal of anxiety in the run-up to the Brexit vote.  I invited the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People, Ms Koulla Yiasouma, down to Dungannon to do an event with young people to try to listen to some of their concerns.  It was a brilliant event where the young people and children were very engaged.  At that stage we could not answer a great deal of the questions but the commissioner was brilliant in how she spoke to them.  I feel that anxiety around Brexit, when the vote happened and when we went into that period afterwards, and their concerns were not taken into consideration and people used, and are using, young people now to wind them up about the protocol when their genuine fears around Brexit were, perhaps, not listened to to the same extent.  </p><p> I know that we want young people to be engaged with this and we want to hear from them and it is very important that they are given space but, again, on the back of the point that Ms Watters made regarding educational attainment, I would very much like to hear what young people from working-class loyalist communities think about where that difficulty comes from.  It is easy, perhaps, to blame the education system but we have to look beyond that.  </p><p> I have outlined previously to the committee that I recall being on a committee in Stormont and John Simpson, the economist, said that there were children who were no longer suitable for an educational environment within a few miles radius of Stormont.  These were children who were five, six and seven years of age.  To say a child is no longer suitable for educational attainment is an awful blight on our society and we perhaps need to broaden that discussion into the cultural effects in our communities and to the value that is put on education.  That is something I would very much like to engage young people on to see how they feel about it.  Brexit is going to impact big time and not just on the funding and the opportunities around Erasmus.</p><p> Again, I completely take on board the point of view that many working-class young people did not see themselves as having those opportunities in the first place or could envisage themselves ten years onwards to see what these would be.</p><p> This has been a brilliant discussion which I have really enjoyed.  I have learned a great deal and I want to thank all present for having come down to talk to us.</p></speech>

Time has flown by today, so much so that myself and my colleague have spoken a great deal but we only had a minute left.  The Chairman moved on and I am unsure if he noticed that we did not receive any response to our questions.  Before I go to the two questions, the Chairman raised the issue of rural transport in Donegal.  Local Link, is an organisation that is quite flexible.  Where there is demand in particular areas, I would be quite open to working with our guest speakers and with Transport for Ireland, if there is a demand in such areas for which a case can be made.</p> <p>  The two questions I had, with the leave and flexibility of the Chairman if he will allow-----</p></speech>

This is also important, where there is a tremendous amount of talk about the &pound;300 million in the Department of Finance in Stormont.  We should use our pressure as a committee to invoke movement where we can to make life easier for these organisations and, in particular, to develop these services.  As I said earlier, these organisations are doing fantastic work and the key to moving forward to deal with these transgenerational issues is through people like our guests.</p></speech>

Youth work is completely integral to the development of a young person.  I would like that the snobbery be taken out of the profession and the youth work profession to be held up for what it is.  It would be an all-island model, then, which we will have designed.</p></speech>

I appreciate our guests saying that and how important it was to them and still is, obviously, to us.  If there is anything that we can do by way of aid or by making arrangements with the shared island unit to meet with the groups, I ask that they might give us their paper, and we will go up to visit.  </p> <p>  We are happy to do that and it can be done in a nice and quiet way as a genuine visit where we can try to understand and bridge, in the way our guests organisations are doing, the gap between the politicians in the South and young people and to show that we care.

We will have two sessions today.  The first session will consider the issues of preventing the sale, exploitation and trafficking of children born to an international surrogacy arrangement, and protecting the right of the child to his or her history and identity, including the child's genetic, gestational and social origins and ensuring that existing children born through international surrogacy arrangements can also exercise their right to their history and identity, including their genetic, gestational and social origins.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome former UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, Ms Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, and Ms Tanya Ward and Ms Julie Ahearn of the Children's Rights Alliance.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory relating to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting.  I remind those present to wear masks where possible throughout the meeting and that they should only be removed when speaking.</p></speech>

It is an honour for me to share some considerations with regard to the regulation of surrogacy.  Surrogacy is increasingly used as a means of family formation, including in cross-border situations.  The interests of multiple stakeholders are often prioritised over children born from surrogacy, to the detriment of their rights in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  These rights include among others, the right to non-discrimination, identity, nationality and the child&rsquo;s best interests being the primary consideration.  It equally includes the right of the child to not be sold, which is defined in Article 2(a) of the optional protocol as, &quot;any act or transaction whereby a child is transferred by any person or group of persons to another for remuneration or any other consideration&quot;.<br/><br/>The issue of surrogacy is complex due to diverse views.  Some believe there is a broad right to procreate that should be available to all without discrimination and that prohibiting surrogacy would create underground markets.  Therefore, regulation is necessary to create safe surrogacy practices that would effectively balance the rights and interests of all.  Others are of the view that any regulation of surrogacy, including prohibition <br/><br/>of sale alone, would nevertheless lead to legalised markets in children.<br/><br/>We can at least agree that all situations that lead to the sale of children should, as a minimum, be prohibited, many of which I have identified in my report to the Human Rights Council in 2018 when I was the UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children.  To complement this report, I prepared a study on safeguards for the protection of the rights of children born from surrogacy, submitted to the UN General Assembly.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has also pinpointed specific country situations when examining states parties when sale may occur.<br/><br/>In 2021, the Verona principles for the protection of the rights of the child born through surrogacy were launched.  Principle 14 deals with the prevention of the sale, exploitation and trafficking in children.  In 2022, UNICEF and Child Identity Protection, an NGO of which I am the president, published a briefing note on children&rsquo;s rights and surrogacy.  It notes that:</p> <blockquote> 	Children are at greater risk of being sold in commercial surrogacy arrangements.  Sale and trafficking of children born through surrogacy is occurring, especially in [international surrogacy arrangements] ISAs, due to a lack of protective safeguards being implemented by States. </blockquote> <p>Based on these observations, the line is not between regulated and unregulated commercial surrogacy, rather between rightly regulated commercial surrogacy and both unregulated and wrongly regulated commercial surrogacy.<br/><br/>Sale can occur in both regulated and unregulated contexts.  The first is when surrogacy arrangements occur in a legal vacuum where market forces prioritise profit.  The second is when surrogacy arrangements allow parentage to be determined pre-birth.  Even in a well-regulated context, such as in some states in the United States, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has observed that laws may be designed in a way to allow for transfer of the child in exchange for remuneration or any other consideration.</p><p>The third is when the surrogate mother physically transfers the child for remuneration or any other consideration, there may be sale.  Payment for her gestational services is accompanied with the transfer of the child.  The fourth is when intending parents are genetically linked to the child they may participate in child selling if they pay for exclusive parentage and physical custody, or both.</p><p> I would like to make a number of recommendations emerging from these studies on the regulations needed to uphold all children&rsquo;s rights in surrogacy arrangements, including the need to prevent the sale of children.  By definition, altruistic surrogacy cannot lead to the sale of children as a gratuitous act.  To avoid sale in these situations, reimbursements should be itemised and reasonable, or both, in order to avoid any potential disguise of payments for transfer of the child.  While regulation is helpful, it should not allow for legally binding contractual relationships between the surrogate mother and the intending parents established pre birth where the transfer of the child, physical and legal, or both, is dependent on any payment or any other consideration.  This can occur in situations where, for example, the surrogate mother may receive all payments and still have a reflection period post birth.  When safeguards are not fully aligned with the child&rsquo;s rights in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a post-birth best-interest determination, BID, should be conducted.  If sale occurs, both the immediate needs of the child and long-term considerations should be factored in.  Careful attention should be given to how the children may feel when they are older if their intending parents participated in the sale and that the state nevertheless placed him or her with them.  For ISAs, particular attention should be paid to the risk of statelessness.  All states, including Ireland, must ensure that any laws that may be relevant to surrogacy are clear on the prevention of the sale of children.</p></speech>

I thank her for giving of her time this morning.  Her opening statement well signposts the two reports that she wrote and submitted to the UN General Assembly.  In the conclusions to her 2018 report Ms de Boer-Buquicchio states, "Commercial surrogacy could be conducted in a way that does not constitute sale of children", and she goes on to explore that.  In the report we have the detail: that the surrogate mother is the "mother at birth"; that she is under no "legal obligation to participate in the legal or physical transfer of the child"; that the payments must be completed prior to the birth and then there is the post-birth legal transfer; that the surrogate mother can be legally obligated to share parenting of a child but not be obligated to relinquish her status; and that the transfer after birth must be a gratuitous and altruistic act.  Ms de Boer-Buquicchio lays out a template there.  We are in the difficult position whereby some surrogacies are termed as commercial when there are compensated elements such as the Canadian model.  Were we to not facilitate that then same-sex couples in Ireland may not have an option to have children via surrogacy.

What is essential in this summing up is that you can conclude that the surrogate mother was only paid for gestational services and not for the transfer of the child.  This means that the surrogate mother must be afforded the status of surrogate mother at birth and must be under no contractual or legal obligation to participate in the legal or physical transfer of the child.  Second is the severance of the payment from the transfer, which can be achieved by ensuring that the payments are made to the surrogate mother prior to the post-birth legal or physical transfer of the child.  I would add that these payments should not be reimbursable and that if the mother should choose to maintain the parentage and parental responsibility she may be legally obligated to share parentage with others, including the intending parents.  That means she would not be obliged to relinquish her status by the surrogacy arrangements.  These are the crucial conditions which would allow for a legal pathway to regularise and legalise surrogacy but under those conditions.</p></speech>

I thank her for coming here.  Much of the discussion of this committee has treated commercial international surrogacy as a <i>fait accompli</i>; that it does and will occur and we must legislate around it.  I must say the Verona principles paint a stark picture of the closeness of the practice of commercial international surrogacy with the sale of children.  Out of the three criteria for categorisation of the sale of children, this form of surrogacy always contains two criteria and only does not contain the third criterion due to the legal contract hair-splitting.  Paying for gestation with the shared understanding of subsequent transfer is paying for transfer by other means.</p><p>Ms de Boer-Buquicchio proposed a legal solution in her 2018 report to question how we make this not be the selling of children by leaving the transfer of the child entirely up to the surrogate mother.  Surrogate mothers who intend to continue to take clients in the future will need to be true to their word or else it would be bad for business but people doing it as a once-off then have no obligation to fulfil their end of the agreement and the people availing of the surrogacy service have no recourse under law.  Is this really a satisfactory state of legal affairs?  If the solution to this abolishes the distinction between commercial international surrogacy and the sale of the child, where does that leave us?</p></speech>

I was not formally part of this group although I attended some of its sessions.  Principle 14 accurately sums up the permissible approaches to commercial surrogacy, in particular the question of when it is possible to separate, as I said before, the payment for gestational services from payment for transfer, in which case there is no payment for transfer and hence, no sale of the child.</p><p>I think the Senator mentioned that the surrogate mother is exclusively responsible for the decision to transfer the child.  What matters in this context is what happens before that, namely, the pre-birth assessment of the suitability of the parents, and what happens after the birth, such as best interests and the needs determination, because circumstances may change.  It is always essential that such a best-interest determination to take place post-birth.</p><p> In addition to that, it would be imperative to allow the birth mother, or the surrogate, to have the legal parentage at birth.  There should nevertheless be a reflection period during which she can change her mind as to whether she wishes to transfer the parentage to which she has previously agreed or to share it with the intending parents.</p></speech>

I was wondering about the rights of a child to identity.  There is also a right to non-discrimination, including the right of non-discrimination of their parents.  When we are talking about identity, how do we balance the right of a child to their identity with that of discrimination?  We have discussed whether the name of a surrogate should be on a child&rsquo;s birth certificate, or whether it should be registered but kept separately on a private register to which the child and the parents have access.  There is a fear that if it is on the birth certificate, it becomes public information.  That could then lead to some element of discrimination against the child and potentially their parents.  What is Ms de Boer-Buquicchio&rsquo;s view of that instance?  How would she balance the right of a child to their identity with the non-discrimination element?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.890" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maud de Boer-Buquicchio" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#C00600"><p>I thank the Chair for that question.  I agree that this is a difficult area, but I think it can be solved by, for instance, informing separately.  The birth certification is public, so it should not contain any reference to the fact that the child was born differently from traditional family formation methods.  However, we must reconcile their rights.  I have seen an example in Victoria in Australia, where all donor-conceived children - the term &ldquo;donor conceived&rdquo; also applies to these kinds of arrangements - have equal access to information, regardless of their mode of conception.  There are contact data preferences, which allow them to access identifying information on the donor.  The donor can also decide if they wish to have no contact or a certain type of contact with their descendants.  When donor-conceived children apply for their birth certificate as adults, they will be informed that more information is available about their birth.  If they are not already aware that they are donor conceived, then they are likely to find out when they ask about this additional information.  There are, therefore, ways and means to avoid the risk of discrimination.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child applies to all children.  This is in respect of all the other rights, which I have not mentioned, such as access to health and education.  All of these should be granted to every single child, without any discrimination.  That also covers the right to identity.</p></speech>

Her contribution was really interesting and important.  It is beginning to frame in my mind where the regulations need to begin and how we start to control and to properly safeguard international surrogacy, as well as surrogacy in general.  Ms de Boer-Buquicchio&rsquo;s raised the point about the pre-birth transfer and whether there is any compensation involved.  From her experience, is there a country that has been doing this, where this does not constitute the sale of children?  Is there a country that could be considered the best boy in class on this, let us say?  I ask this because we need to make sure we have all the safeguards in place.</p></speech>

If only I could answer by giving her one example of the perfect country but it simply does not exist.  We can find good elements here and there.  Sheer prohibition is not a solution.  There are examples of countries, and I will give one, that safeguards best interests, the determination and the fact the transfer is not pre-established pre-birth.  That country is Israel.  I referred already to the need for a reflection period, which exists under law in Israel.  I think that period is seven days.  During that time, there is the appointment from birth of a legal guardian.  That is an additional safeguard.  It is only after that reflection period that the birth mother can decide, with all the guarantees.  In the meantime, there is a best-interest determination.  This is not just an assessment, but a determination.  Then everything should be fine.  I refer only to this aspect.  There are other aspects in Israel&rsquo;s legislation that are perhaps not so satisfactory.  I do not remember the details, but there is the issue as to whether this should be limited to citizens of Israel only.  There may be conditions that do not meet other requirements that the Senator might consider to be essential.</p> <p>  There is no perfect country.  As legislators, the members have a huge responsibility.  If they try to analyse what situations they would like to avoid, I think that will guide them.  Hopefully, my reports that go into detail, including on the identity issue, may provide that guidance.  However, who am I?  I am no longer the special rapporteur.  I did it a few years ago.  It is important to note also that the committee on the rights of the child identified a number of situations, in particular where the contractual enforceability is part of the legislative framework, that are against the rights of the child to not be sold.</p></speech>

It will not address the best interests of the child.  In Ms de Boer-Buquicchio&rsquo;s reports, she has set out clearly when a sale occurs and when it does not.</p><p>I think that is a very important distinction for intending parents to understand, because I think that people approaching surrogacy are coming from a point of view of only contracting for gestational services, without realising the subtleties that Ms de Boer-Buquicchio very clearly set out in her 2018 report.  We have been speaking about that.  We have a special rapporteur in Ireland who has issued a report that recommends a period of reflection also and there are other elements like that in it.  We have perhaps the opportunity to become that country about which she will be able to say, "in other circumstances".</p><p> One of the elements in the 2019 report, in which Ms de Boer-Buquicchio responds to the submissions of stakeholders, is that she focuses on intermediaries, and a lot of the feedback appears to be on the fact that it is the intermediaries that are problematic and create the environment of sale.  Would she like to expand on that please?</p></speech>

Of course, the sale of a child is a crime, and it should be a crime under international law.  That is what the optional protocol requires.</p> <p>  The other question is to what extent we wish to prosecute surrogate mothers who are involved in this process.  That is very much linked to the question of the role of the intermediaries.  I do not think it would be fair to prosecute, especially surrogate mothers who have accepted this process under some degree of constraint, either directly or because of their vulnerability, because they have come from poor backgrounds and they simply needed the money.  What matters here is to identify the role of the intermediaries, who are at the origin of the whole process and who look for these vulnerable persons to engage in this process.</p> <p>  Intermediaries cannot always be easily identified but it is those who profit from the agreement.  I would definitely exclude from the category of intermediaries the medical staff who merely support the physical process.  However, at the same time, if the remuneration for these medical or paramedical services goes beyond reasonable and itemised expenses, then clinics and sometimes individual doctors may be regarded as being intermediaries and therefore playing a complicit role in the commission of a crime.  This is the reality, and it is important to try to analyse on an at-home basis what has been the role of the intermediary, who has been the intermediary, and whether the clinic, for example, simply provides the facilities once the agreement has been reached between the parties without any implication.  Sometimes it goes far beyond that and then we have a much more doubtful role of the intermediaries, who should really be sanctioned.</p></speech>

It certainly helps us to understand the issue a lot better.</p> <p>  I have read the statement and I do not know how many times in the document I have read references to "child selling", "transfer of the child", and "sale of the child".  That is a massive worry for me.  Article 2 of the CRC clearly refers to the right of the child not to be sold.  Does she find this method of parenting exploitative, both for the child and for the surrogate mother?  What are her views on that?</p></speech>

For instance, it depends on the surrogate mother.  In the United States, very often it is a choice of women who feel they are autonomous in their decisions about their sexual and reproductive health.  They do not feel under any constraint, and they do it because they believe that it is a good thing to do and it is not because they need the money.  It depends very much on whether the Senator extends the term "exploitation" to surrogates.</p></speech>

As to the exploitation of the child, I hope this will not open the debate on whether a child who is not yet born can be regarded as a child under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and it opens a discussion on the right to abortion.  That should be avoided.  What is important is that it is inherently exploitative of the child if his or her future is determined without considering the best interests.</p></speech>

I thank Ms de Boer-Buquicchio very much for being here, for the document she sent us, and for her presentation.  They have been very helpful.</p> <p>  I really agree with what she says about prohibition not being the answer.  That is one of the key points.  If we make something totally illegal, we are not living in the reality of the modern world we live in nowadays.  It is important that the message goes out that what needs to happen is good, robust, strong legislation and regulation so that there are proper practices and that we will not have the exploitation of either women or children.</p> <p>  Some of the questions I was going to ask have already been asked.  I want to ask about the pre-birth versus post-birth parentage situation.  Personally, I think it is better to have a pre-birth model because for the child there is no question mark over who the parent is.  We heard a few examples of where children were born prematurely and they needed medical intervention.  That situation can be difficult if there is any sort of question mark over who is the legal guardian or parent who makes those decisions.</p><p>Many surrogate mothers do not see themselves at all as the mother and are very clear about that.  It kind of protects them as well.  The example Ms de Boer-Buquicchio gave of a seven-day cooling off period, for want of a better phrase, potentially is a possible solution to that.  Could she expand a bit more on that, also bearing in mind that, as I said, surrogate mothers in many cases do not see their role outside?  They do not see themselves involved.  There is no genetic link in many cases.  We need to respect that too.</p></speech>

I think what she is referring to in her question is the need for legal certainty as seen from the perspective of the child.  I am afraid that is a very risky concept in this context because there are certain considerations.  It sounds convincing but at the same time, it does not leave any room for possible best interests determination and, in particular, an assessment of how the process prior to the birth took place and whether there was any coercion.  It really would legalise enforceable pre-birth contracts, which include a transfer of the legal parentage at birth.  As that is exactly what we do not want, I do not think it is an argument.  I do not think we should use it in this particular context.</p> <p>  The other thing I would like to say, which is actually what the Deputy started with, is that it is very important to realise that prohibiting commercial surrogacy is as important as prohibiting sale and, therefore, avoiding the creation of black and grey markets in the practice of surrogacy.</p></speech>

Because of that, however, at the same time, people tend to interpret the concept of sale in a restrictive way to not be too uncomfortable.  We do not want to do that.  We want to create legal pathways.  We should please stick to the concept of sale, however.  It is something that should not be allowed and it has very clear elements.  It is transfer, payment and the exchange of payment for transfer.  These are the three interlinked elements that define sale and that should be avoided.</p></speech>

I will come in briefly because I want to clarify the question I raised earlier about the birth certificate and the balancing between the rights of a child to his or her identity and the rights to non-discrimination.  Because surrogacy is one of those issues about which people hold passionate and often quite divergent views, there would be a risk that were a publicly-available birth certificate that listed a surrogate on it to be made known to the public, there could be some element of discrimination against the child on the basis of his or her origins.  Is it the case, therefore, that a child's right to his or her identity can be met through a non-private register of identity rather than placing the name of the surrogate on a publicly-available birth certificate?</p></speech>

The access to identity information should be facilitated in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.  How this should be done and how the civil registration and vital statistics system should include and preserve identity information relating to each child born through surrogacy is something to which I do not have a final answer.  I did not suggest initially or during my presentation that when the surrogate mother should be identified on the birth certificate, it should say a person was only a birth mother or only a surrogate birth mother.  It should be her name and then all the rest will have to be dealt with, as the Chairman suggested, perhaps, in a separate confidential register.</p></speech>

I call Ms Tanya ward to make her contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.923" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tanya Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#E01200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the committee.  As members will know, the Children's Rights Alliance is an umbrella organisation with more than 140 members.  It is our goal for Ireland to be one of the best places in the world to be a child.  We do that by promoting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I say that specifically because this is very relevant to the discussion we are having when it comes to surrogacy.  I thank the committee for its work in this area because this has been a very difficult area for many children and families in Ireland.  There are many different factors and considerations.  From our perspective, however, this needs to be looked at in the best interests and from the perspective of the child.  That is the way to resolve these issues.</p> <p>  The committee has already seen, through the different inputs it has received, the issues that are happening to children who have been born through surrogacy.  Some of the bigger issues are statelessness, lack of protection of identity and not having a legal relationship with the people who care for and look after the children.  Obviously, there is legislation before the Houses at the moment, such as the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, which provides a basis now to regulate domestic surrogacy.</p> <p>  One thing we in the Children's Rights Alliance think would be very important, and members will see this in our opening statement, is a focus on the best interests of the child and developing a sophisticated approach in that regard.  Obviously, children have a right to ensure that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions concerning the child.  The Constitution actually goes further when it comes to access, custody and parentage, as does the convention, which states that "the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration."  They are the supreme consideration, essentially.</p> <p>  We believe there is a need to amend the health legislation that is before the Houses at the moment with regard to the best interests.  There are a number of ways to address this.  The minimal approach includes the best interests as an interpretive principle.  It would say that all matters concerning the child need to consider the best interests.  The challenge with that approach, if we look at the way that has been interpreted in Irish law, is that there are examples of both minimal compliance and of gold standard approach, essentially.  Minimal compliance is where there is a clear statement that the best interests of the child should be considered.  We see that in relation to, let us say, the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, which has that as a principle.  What happens in practice, however, is that it really goes down to each individual decision maker and how he or she interprets it.  Generally, the research will show that a decision maker can do it very paternalistically, and it is essentially left to the lawyers and the courts to work out whether and in what circumstances it should be expanded upon.  The gold standard approach, which is what the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child would recommend, and we have an example of that in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, is where one actually provides a test.  Therefore, when interpreting what the best interests of the principle are, the judge or decision maker has seven or eight different things to consider.  We think this is something that needs to happen to this legislation.</p> <p>  Members will see in our submission that the Verona principles are relied upon to expand upon what that would look like when it comes to the surrogate consideration.  We would say, at a minimum, that is something that needs to be added to the legislation.  I think the aspirations of people in the country would be to go for the gold standard approach when it comes to surrogacy arrangements because it is fraught with many different challenges.</p><p>The other issue brings us down to the right to identity.  The UN special rapporteur has been before the committee.  I am delighted we had the opportunity to appear in the same session as her.  The UNCRC is very clear about the children&rsquo;s right to know and to be cared for by their parents insofar as possible.  The term &ldquo;parents&rdquo; includes birth parents, genetic parents and those who care for a child for significant periods.  It also provides that a child has a right to be registered immediately after birth and has the right to acquire a nationality, and places a specific obligation on the state to ensure that rights are implemented, in particular, where a child would otherwise be stateless.  Preserving the identity of a child, their nationality and their family relations are, therefore, all key.  </p><p> It is welcome that in the draft health Bill that is before the Houses there is the creation of a surrogacy register in which that information is to be provided.  The challenge is for children who were born through international surrogacy is that the same form of protection would not be provided for them.  That is an omission that would amount to a form of discrimination if children were to be born outside of the State and there was not an attempt to preserve, protect or recognise their identity.  Of course, there is a precedent for doing this.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 includes a provision for the donor-conceived register, but it also provides for children who had been conceived outside of the State, or where an IVF clinic had been involved outside the State, the information could be added to the donor conceived register as well.  There are, therefore, legal solutions that we can find to try to address this as an issue.  </p><p> This brings me to the final, broader point about the need to legislate in this area.  This is coming through from the key bodies that are concerned about the welfare of children.  These include the UN special rapporteur, the Ombudsman for Children's Office and the Special Rapporteur for Child Protection, Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony.  We would recommend that as well, as would the UN committee on the rights of the child.  Notwithstanding the rights and wrongs of surrogacy, we can see that the special rapporteur has outlined clear procedures to protect against the sale of children, which acts as a good guide, as do the Verona principles.  They should be incorporate as far as possible into the legislation.  That would give us the best protection for children. </p><p> If we do not legislate in this area, we will continue to see situations where children are conceived in potentially very exploitative circumstances around the world.  They will arrive back and again be faced with the same problems.  For instance, their identity has not been protected, or there has been exploitation of their commissioning parents.  They may find out that they are not even genetically connected to the commissioning parents.  That is probably one of the most serious things that has happened, and the committee members will have heard about it at the committee.  We believe there is an onus to provide a legal framework to resolve these issues.  The way the State has approached it is to try to discourage it by having a legal framework and to make it difficult.  There are other ways of dealing with that situation.  Policy and other approaches can be used to discourage people who are desperate to become parents from going to countries or using services where there is likely to exploitation of women, where there is poor protection of children, where the sale of children is prevalent and where their identities are not protected.</p></speech>

We appreciate that.</p> <p>  Her submission is comprehensive, which helpfully sets out a framework for us.  I agree with her latter comments.  We have had prohibition by stealth and if we fail to act on the recommendations of this committee, presuming that they are in line with what Ms Ward and many others have suggested, we will likely end up with prohibition by stealth.  Let us name it for what it is.  </p> <p>  We must understand and highlight how the best interests of the child are interpreted.  Ms Ward set out three fundamentals, the first of which is the substantive right that the best interests of the child is the primary consideration.  The second is that the outcome of any decision-making is in the best interests of the child and has that at its core.  There is also that the evaluation of impacts has the best interests of the child in place.  There is a positive and a negative.  That leaves us with no choice but to legislate for international surrogacy.</p> <p>  Then the question arises of providing a mechanism that begins before the conception of a child that arms intending parents with information; has a threshold that has to overcome; provides for counselling; and has a full awareness of - if we are to interpret Ms de Boer-Buquicchio's comments - that idea of a &ldquo;sale&rdquo;.  I guarantee the committee that if we now did a survey of intending parents and existing parents, they would say they understood what were going into in respect of surrogacy is they were contracting for gestational services.  They would be appalled by the "sale" element, and by the nuances of it.  We, therefore, have to first arm people with that understanding.  Women who require surrogacy services may have come through a long IVF route whereby they are trusting medical practitioners.  They are in that frame of mind where they trust that the people in the white coats that they are not in an exploitative situation and, therefore, it is important to arm and to equip couples with that pre-knowledge. </p> <p>  I am keeping an eye on the clock, but it seems to be all over the place.  I apologise.  I will keep going but I am not sure what is happening.</p></speech>

The Verona principles seem to incorporate everything we need.  I am a bit disturbed by the latter end of the Ms de Boer-Buquicchio's contribution.  I would appreciate Ms Ward&rsquo;s comments on that.</p> <p>  Children who have been born abroad generally have a birth certificate from there.  We cannot legislate in Ireland for what goes on a birth certificate in another country.  In another country, the intending parents can be on the birth certificate.  A surrogacy and a donor register, therefore, would seem to ensure that the integrity of a child&rsquo;s identity is preserved in Ireland.  It would also seem to ensure that we would have some threshold in Ireland before conception that would ensure that that will be in place.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.930" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#F00700"><p>I want to say categorically that I have no desire for the surrogate mother&rsquo;s name, or her existence, or a relationship with her, to be obliterated under any circumstances.  However, a child has to produce a birth certificate when going to school.  There are many instances in our lives when we have to produce our birth certificates.  The birth certificate may be produced in a different country because this is international surrogacy.  It will have the intending parents listed on it.  The child&rsquo;s passport will list the place of birth of that child, though their nationality will be preserved on the passport as Irish but the place of birth will be listed as the different country that is consistent with the birth certificate.</p> <p>  We cannot legislate for the information that goes onto a birth certificate in a foreign country for a start because we do not have the jurisdictional reach to do that.  I concur with where the Chair was going on the point of having two registers.  It would preserve in a formal, legal way an obligation on parents who pursue surrogacy to ensure that a child has a mechanism.  One would hope that parents would not rely on a register and that they would tell their child from birth anyway.  Yet, that latter end has left an anomaly that is not in the best interests of the child because it will expose that child, or someone who may not be in the daily life of that child, to that.  For instance, if we produce a birth certificate in the child&rsquo;s school and Jennifer's name is on it, rather than Mary, the school might suddenly become aware of something going on.  They might ask if these are not parents of the child, and what the position of this mother is.  I am not sure that that is in the best interest of the child and, therefore, yes, I am boiling it down to that.</p></speech>

That is what it is.  We just have to recognise that.  It is hard for us to disagree with the UN special rapporteur, because she is part of the UN infrastructure and she is saying that it should be part of the birth certificate.</p><p>We obviously have the power to issue birth certificates in this country.  She is saying it should be part of the birth certificate issued in this country because it is a legal fact, in addition to being a protection for identity and a protection against the sale and exploitation of children down the road.  She is looking at it from that perspective.  She is sticking to a few core principles, when she looks at what is happening in this space globally.</p><p> I agree there is an issue with privacy.  I know someone with an adoption certificate.  One of the things people get a shock about is when an individual has an adoption certificate.  My biological mother is named on it but people do not realise that.  I understand what happens is children experience schools asking how come they have this.  It opens the door to some interference in the child's life.  I wonder is there another way to deal with this that is between short and long birth certificates.  Are there other ways to show the legal fact is the legal fact?  The short birth certificate might be a practical way around it.  </p></speech>

I have asked my personal assistant to look up why we stopped using short form.  It was stated everywhere that a long-form certificate must be submitted, so the short-form certificates kind of became defunct.  There are many situations where a private long-form birth certificate with all the information, whether it relates to the donor, surrogacy, adoption or all that stuff, should be there from the start to facilitate those conversations from the beginning, in addition to the short form.</p> <p>  Fostering is the other matter that comes to me, where a child is in foster care, is going to school and the birth certificate has to be presented.  The school should know about the situation, and that is pertinent to other things, but one form of the birth certificate is a private document and one is a public document.  The question is why we stopped using short-form birth certificates.  What were the deficiencies and how do we correct them?  We will then automatically create the two parts and will not need to create extra registers all over the place.  We can talk about the grim spectre of cyberattacks and that sort of thing.  It would be very useful for us to look at, possibly through submissions, the long-form and short-form versions and talk to those in social welfare to ask why the hell they stopped using short form.  It could be a very useful thing.</p> <p>  I apologise for being late.  I missed a very interesting earlier session but I was listening in the car.  I will pick up on Deputy Funchion's question in the last session about the best interests test and, if such a test is required, it has to be done after birth, whereas it could be argued legal certainty is also in the best interests of the child.  That need requires some process pre-birth.  I will leave it there.  There are dangers to thinking out loud in public session so instead of coming out with a half-formed thought that may turn out to be best left half-formed, I will save it for private session.</p></speech>

We need to look at trying to set out some of the legal certainties that can be done pre-birth and, post birth, the best interests consideration.  In a sense, that is non-negotiable.  If we are looking at it from the perspective of the protection of children and protection of their rights, a post-birth assessment would be done in every situation.  There are issues around the right to access healthcare and what happens if there is a difficulty there but, as the special rapporteur said, there are other jurisdictions to look at - she mentioned the Israeli example - where a legal guardian can be put in place during that cool-off period when the best interest determination is considered.  It is worth looking at those aspects for legal certainty but if we are looking at it, as Ms Ward mentioned, from the perspective of the child and what is in his or her best interests, a post-birth determination of best interest has to be carried out.</p></speech>

It has a very different system where she is not considered the birth mother but, in the UK system, the intending parents are not automatically considered the parents.  That is where we get the lacuna.  Is it about saying we will only accept surrogacy from a certain place, if it matches our system?  It is like trying to match up a jigsaw piece.  We then risk cutting out many countries and in a way saying they have to play by our rules which, when it comes to inter-country adoption, is easier because we have all agreed a set of rules under the Hague principles and we do not necessarily have anything here like that.</p> <p>  I am loath to say we are not allowing a certain country because of what may be a minor technicality.  I am thinking out loud but if we are looking to set a standard here, and we are saying we will allow inter-country adoption if it meets this standard, that standard needs to include something around how we prevent statelessness.  If the unintended consequence is certain countries get dropped off the list, we need to be careful about that but that is something we need to think through because, ultimately, it is about the best interests of the child.  It is then around how much scope we have to dictate to other countries and a whole other mess, but that is what we are paid to deal with. </p></speech>

One of the things to think about, when legislating for altruistic domestic surrogacy, we may find more of it happens in Ireland now and not as many commissioning parents need to go internationally.  In an ideal world, we would have regulation moving in that direction, where countries sign up to bilateral agreements in which the same legal standards are in place so we can be sure a country is a safer place where a child could be conceived, and there is more guarantee the mother is less likely to be exposed to exploitation, but we are not there yet.  That is the challenge.</p> <p>  In the interim, having some basic protections and, as Ms Ahern said, best interest assessments, and maybe through policy trying to discourage people from going to countries where they exploit children and women in surrogacy arrangements, will help to eliminate those kinds of situations.  People are very vulnerable and are getting bad advice.  There are intermediaries in the middle misadvising them and there is a need for the State to step in and try to intervene to stop that.  That is, in essence, what was done with adoption.  The State stepped in on adoption and changed the landscape relating to it.  </p></speech>

It does not necessarily have to be a long, protracted process.  Strict regulation could be put in place stating when and how quickly assessments would be carried out and one of the factors could be the risk of statelessness.  The reality is children will continue to be born through international surrogacy, parents will continue to come back and we need to make sure children have appropriate legal links to their parents.</p></speech>

I will make two quick points.  I am concerned about accelerating the process too much because it then becomes a tick-box exercise, but if it was in the courts it could be sped up and we could have appropriate review through the courts or whatever.  To be clear, while I talked about inter-country adoption, I appreciate surrogacy and adoption are not the same thing.  There are parallels that can help us but we need to be clear we are not saying they are the same thing.</p></speech>

This might seem like a stupid question, but is there a way of doing some of the best interest assessment before the child is born?</p><p>People are arguing that the assessment has to be done after a child is born but then, if we take the example of the seven days, must we then ask is that enough time?  This is similar to what Deputy Costello was saying.  I do not understand why we could not have a system with a pre-birth assessment.  It could include bodily autonomy for the surrogate, which I feel strongly about.  When the baby is born, parentage would transfer over.  I can understand the sense of having some sort of built-in cooling off time.  </p><p>  If a legal guardian were to appointed, who would it be?  We could be getting into a potentially messy situation in that regard.  A parent might make a different decision than a legal guardian.  If the child is very premature, there are many different things to consider.  Is there a way of combining those elements around the best interests of the child and having doing some of the assessment beforehand?  I acknowledge this could be a stupid question but does the baby have to physically be there before that kind of an assessment can be carried out or can some of it be done with a built-in clause that states if something goes wrong within ten, 20 or 30 days, parentage can be revoked or something like that?  Legal certainty is obviously in the best interests of a child.</p><p> Going back to the birth certificate situation, I feel we are getting into strange territory if a number of people are named on a birth certificate.  That is definitely going to have the effect of drawing a red circle around the name of the child and marking him or her out as different.  Is there a way of having a register of that information that is very accessible and even from a younger age.  People might not even have to be 18.  Perhaps from the age of 16, people would be able to access all of their information but it does not have to be included on the birth certificate.  I am thinking how complicated the situation is with regard to passports at the moment, as we all appreciate.  I cannot imagine what it would be like if there are multiple people mentioned on a birth certificate.  Such a child would be treated differently.  He or she would be the subject of discrimination and would also face longer processes as a result.  I appreciate our guests might not have answers to all those points.  I am thinking out loud.</p></speech>

An assessment would have to be done after birth.  Some of the tests could be done in a pre-birth process but one of the key things the special rapporteur talked about was the need to ensure that no money changed hands in the transfer of the child and that no illicit practices took place.  There are many things that could go wrong.  We must provide a basis to ensure all of those things have been picked up to ensure X or Y have not happened.</p> <p>  I am sure certain cases have been discussed by the committee.  There is an American case where a woman became pregnant with three children and the commissioning father wanted two children and not three.  He wanted the third to be aborted during gestation.  The woman did not want to do that.  The necessity for bodily integrity protects against those kinds of things and the legislation is clear that it will be the woman's decision as to what happens in those kinds of circumstances.  However, there are other things that can happen in between and a post-birth assessment is required to pick up on those.</p></speech>

Professor Conor O'Mahony would have set out to the committee how both pre-birth and post-birth assessments can be done together.  However, as Ms Ward mentioned, there must be an element of post-birth best interest assessment to ensure, from the sale of children perspective, that it is all above board and no sale has taken place.  That was well set out by the special rapporteur.  Some of the assessment could be done pre birth, as Professor O'Mahony has suggested.  There does, however, need to be an element of post-birth assessment.  I do not think we can get away from that if we are looking at the situation from the point of view of the best interests of the child.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am wrong but it sounds to me as if the suggestion of a legal guardian would involve somebody else who is totally unrelated to the situation for the seven days.  That is not a good situation either.</p></speech>

Children should not be discriminated against based on the method of their birth.  Not regulating for international surrogacy could be argued as <i>de facto</i>discrimination against children who are born internationally and not domestically.  It would be in the best interests of children that we have a regulatory system.  The UN special rapporteur and all the UN bodies are quite clear that we need to regulate for international and national surrogacy.  Leaving one out can create big difficulties for children and particularly for the implementation of their rights.</p></speech>

Several states and civil society organisations rejected the premise of sale outright in the context of surrogacy, arguing that at no point is there a transaction for the child.  A substantial number of stakeholders expressed concern about the conflation of sale with surrogacy, which could lead to a criminalisation of surrogates and intending parents, as well as the possible violations of the right to sexual and reproductive health.  The report also stated that a number of states and civil society organisations argued for the outright ban on surrogacy, without exception.  I note that the former special rapporteur acknowledged there was discomfort with the idea of putting sale into surrogacy when people do not enter the vast majority of surrogacy arrangements with the intention of buying a child.  That is not to say there are not outliers because there certainly are.</p> <p>  The people who are being left out of this conversation are the intending parents.  We are talking about the surrogates and the children but we are not talking about intending parents who in good faith are on a fertility journey to express their inherent desire to have a child.  They do not have a right to a child but they have a right to go on that journey and explore it as a possibility.  That is important.</p> <p>  Another thing we are not saying this morning is that in an international setting where the intending parents are included on the birth certificate, those parents have the same right to make decisions around their child because they are the recognised parents from birth in that country.  A little bit of what we are talking about is slightly idealistic because there is no lacuna as long as the child stays in the country in which he or she is born.  The lacuna happens the minute the child steps on a plane and comes to Ireland.  The idea of an interim guardianship order would cover that issue.</p><p>It should then be judicially reviewed in the context of parental order in Ireland, which would be a very important measure.</p><p> We have not touched on retrospective.  We cannot put in place a system that first discriminates against countries where the intended parents are on the birth certificate.  From a retrospective point of view, I propose we need a bespoke solution that sets aside all the rules, guidelines and frameworks we will put in place, and sets out a set of circumstances in which people underwent a legal route in other countries.  We have a situation whereby children are being discriminated against and that needs to be addressed urgently with a bespoke solution in Ireland.</p></speech>

In order for children to be able to access their identify rights at a later age, they need to have the same protections, including the right to identity, that child who will be born after this legislation comes into force will have.  We need to ensure that children's identities are protected and to consider their best interest in the right not to be discriminated against.  Forgetting about the retrospective piece in this legislation is a big gap.  It was a point well made by Professor Conor O'Mahony, in that we already did that with the Children and Family Relationships Act.  There is a small retrospective piece within that legislation but it does not cover everyone.  It is worth looking at that example and learning from it so that we can ensure that children can have their rights vindicated, particularly the right to identity and not to be discriminated against based on timing.</p></speech>

I refer to the Children and Family Relationships Act.  We have a tendency in this country, when faced with something complex, not to talk or do anything about it, and that is the wrong approach.  We have failed the children who have already been born through surrogacy.  Hopefully when we produce our report, it will be acted on quickly, which is something that does not happen often in this House but we all have a responsibility to push for that.  It was said earlier that there is a serious responsibility on us as legislators and I have always thought that.  We do not have the luxury of having a position.  We have to take on the responsibility that was given us when we came to Leinster House and that is to legislate.  It is great, in a way, that all the children's rights organisations are on the same page in that it needs to be done and that it should have been done a long time ago.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Georgina Roberts, Ms Rachel Rowley Smith and Ms Meredith Baldwin and little Max.  We will be quiet so that we do not interrupt his snooze.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I am required to repeat the note on privilege and housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory relating to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting.  I remind those present to wear masks throughout the meeting and that they should only be removed when speaking.  I call on Ms Roberts to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I was born through altruistic traditional surrogacy in England in 1998, organised through a not-for-profit agency called Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy, COTS.  My parents tried for children for many years and completed five rounds of IVF with their own gametes and some with donor eggs, none of which was successful.  They then joined COTS and their profile was sent to surrogates, who were registered with the agency, and they were selected by Suzanne, my surrogate.  Suzanne had one son of her own, aged four years at the time, and had also completed one surrogacy journey for a family in the north of England.  I was conceived with ease and my parents were involved throughout the pregnancy.  They formed immense trust with Suzanne and when I was born, I was taken home by my parents.  My first birth certificate had Suzanne and my dad on it.  After a parental order court process, I received a second birth certificate with my mother and father on it.  This took over one year to issue, therefore, Suzanne was my legal mother for a whole year of my life.</p> <p>  I have known about my origins for as long as I can remember having been read stories such as my mummy's tummy is broken.  I have never felt any sense of pain or grief as a result of being surrogacy born and I am confident in the role of my parents as mum and dad.  I feel a sense of warmth that I was born in a situation of love, trust and altruism where one human being did a selfless act to change the life of another.  I see my surrogacy family a few times a year and we are looking forward to getting together at my wedding next month.</p> <p>  Being born through surrogacy has its challenges though, and I would like to outline what I perceive these to be.  First, the role of the parents is often undermined from birth.  When I was born, I went to the neonatal unit and my surrogate and my dad were able to visit as my legal parents.  After discussions with the hospital, my surrogate was able to transfer her visiting rights to my mother.  However, this undermined my mother's role as my parent from the word go.  I believe this damages intended parent's confidence, compounded by having often already been through heartache to achieve a pregnancy through surrogacy.  This damage is not in the best interests of the intended parents, IPs, nor the child&rsquo;s.  I believe the IPs should be the legal parents from birth because the child was always intended to be theirs and this is in everybody's best interests.  Surrogates do not want to be considered the mother and IPs want to be considered the parents, and this is also important for the child.</p> <p>  It is, however, important that the surrogacy is documented somehow.  I believe there could be a way of documenting the surrogate&rsquo;s involvement on the birth certificate, not as a "parent" but in another format.  It should also be documented whether it was gestational or traditional surrogacy, and if any donors were involved.  Individuals should always be allowed to see information about their surrogate and genetically related siblings.</p><p>Existing children born through surrogacy must have birth certificates issued that include their parents as their legal parents.  This is imperative in the provision of emergency healthcare, child benefits and legal family security in cases such as bereavement.</p><p> I have been incredibly fortunate to have been afforded the right to know my parents and Suzanne, to whom I am biologically related.  I am aware, however, that this is not always the case for individuals.  Having the right to know and form a relationship with my surrogate, and half-brothers, and wider family, has brought me a sense of completeness.  I have a good relationship with all of my surrogate family, which is something my parents have encouraged.  Not having this is something that has been the cause of some significant hurt within other communities, such as with donor-conceived individuals, and I felt this when I presented alongside them at the United Nations.</p><p> In the surrogacy community, on the whole people are more open about a child's origins because the lack of pregnancy cannot be hidden from those around.  The right to information about my surrogate and wider family has also been important in the provision of my healthcare, owing to some genetic conditions within the family, and is a basic human right.  There should be a legal obligation for individuals to be made aware of their origins and have the right to access healthcare records in the same way as any other person could.  There should be a centralised way of recording these surrogacy births to ensure that records are kept for future generations and access to information is possible if it is not passed on by family.</p><p> I believe that legalising domestic altruistic surrogacy is in the best interests of all parties.  This avoids the added complexities with international surrogacy such as nationality and passports.  Of course, surrogates should have all expenses covered and should never be out of pocket.  That said, all individuals born of international and commercial surrogacy must still have their rights and their legal parenthood protected.</p><p> The language around surrogacy is important to me.  From my networking, I know it is also important to surrogates and intended parents.  The word "mother" should not be used to describe the surrogate in any sense.  Words should be thought about carefully in the context of the construction of law, as words hold true power and meaning for everybody.</p><p> I thank members for listening.  I would be very happy to answer any question or expand on my experiences of being a person born through surrogacy.</p></speech>

Members are all aware that I have a very young baby with me and his presence is acknowledged and accepted.  I thank the committee and apologise in advance if he does interject in any way.</p> <p>  In 1987, I was born via traditional surrogacy.  I was formally adopted by both parents in 1996.  I have a birth mother, a mum and a dad, who is my biological father.  Surrogacy in the 1980s in the UK was very new and therefore quite controversial, so the process was shrouded in secrecy.  The Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985 was rushed through parliament as a reaction to the Baby Cotton case.  I was born only two years later, and, obviously, only conceived just over a year after the arrangements Act.  So much so, I only discovered how I came in to this world three years ago.  I am in touch with my birth mother, and my mum and dad have been very open with me since the discovery and have never hidden anything.  They have always answered any questions they can.  I am happy to go into further detail in regard to this late discovery if required.</p> <p>  I never really knew much about surrogacy.  I had heard about it in the context of same-sex couples having a baby, but never really in the case of a heterosexual couple in the UK, and not at all for overseas.  During my discovery, I learned that my mum, who raised me, could not have children of her own because she went through the menopause in her late 30s.  After 25 years of trying, my parents were so desperate to have a family of their own they were willing to try anything.  One night, my mum was watching TV and saw a segment on the Kim Cotton surrogacy story, which then helped her discover the amazing service of surrogacy and that her dreams were not dead.  She contacted the agency, and my parents journey began.  My view on surrogacy is that surrogate mothers, be it traditional or gestational, are incredible beings.  Being that selfless to help bring life into the world to fulfil dreams is amazing.  It is wonderful that there is another way to grow a family.  The parents of a surrogate baby are incredible also, as their journey is not free from stress either.  I fully support international surrogacy when domestic has not been an option, due to various reasons such as lack of accessible information, support or legislation.  I believe that legislation is crucial to protect all parties involved for both domestic and international surrogacy, including the child born as a result of the process.  There are may be potential parents out there with their mental health suffering, as they think their dreams are over, and who do not know that this option is open to them, and that they can have a family.  It is important to note that surrogacy should only take place when all parties are consenting.</p> <p>  Establishing legal parenthood for those children already born through domestic and international surrogacy is critical.  Due to a lack of this when I was born, it took six long years for my parents to adopt me.  The stress was palpable on my parents and also on my birth mother as well.  When this does not mean full legal parenthood, it is essential that this is addressed and that there is an easy way to understand the process and information.  Support must be readily available to avoid any future complications.  The lengths my parents went to in order to have a child outweigh the lengths involved in terms of how a lot of other children are brought into this world.  I am so lucky to have been so wanted and born into such a safe and happy home with parents who loved me.  I only wish that others were as lucky as me.  Why should surrogacy be so scandalous?  These children are so wanted that parents will go to such lengths to have them.  How lucky am I?  I have two parents who raised me, a birth mother, and four half-siblings.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.969" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Meredith Baldwin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#L00500"><p>This is my personal story and experience of being born through surrogacy.  My parents, along with Kim Cotton, set up an organisation in England called Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy, COTS, shortly after surrogacy became legal in England in 1985.  They were also involved in the change in the legislation which meant I could be born legally through surrogacy.  COTS has facilitated more than 1,090 births via surrogacy to date.  I was born as baby No. 11 for COTS via straight surrogacy.  This means the insemination of my father's sperm directly into my birth mother and she then became pregnant and gave birth to me in 1989.  Straight surrogacy is not as common as it was in the early days due to the huge advancements in fertility treatment.  It is amazing that a child in England could be born with the involvement of a couple of the same or opposite sex who conceived with donor sperm, donor egg and a host mother.</p> <p>  My parents supported my birth mother throughout the pregnancy both financially and emotionally.  They spent time with her and her family during her pregnancy and flew up to her from Kent to Durham in a hurry for my birth, as I arrived more than six weeks early of my due date.  After giving birth, my birth mother handed me over to my parents in the hospital and they took me to my childhood home.  After my birth, my parents did attempt two other separate journeys with two other surrogates and, before my birth, they had their first attempt but they were unsuccessful.  Before exploring surrogacy, they had also tried to adopt, but this proved extremely difficult and they were not able to finish the process.</p> <p>  My parents and I have a continued bond and relationship with my birth mother and also her family, in particular, her three other children, my half-siblings who she conceived before me with her husband.  Growing up and now, as an adult, I have never had any issues with discussing surrogacy and I feel very blessed to have an open relationship with my parents and birth mother.  My father is one of the most wonderful people in my life and was the driving force behind my birth.  I have always known that I am a surrogate baby, and I am very grateful that my parents told me when I was young.  It was never an awkward, big sit-down conversation, it has always just been a part of my life story.  It can take slightly longer for me to explain to people about how many siblings I have and my birth mother, but I have never had any negative comments towards me.  Generally, surrogacy has gained a lot more popularity and awareness compared to the previous situation.</p> <p>  I have always been very clear in my mind that my parents, whom I will always call mum and dad, and birth mother, are very separate, but we all have a special bond and love for each other.  Many people comment on how similar I am to my mother, but then I explain to them that it is simply not biologically possible.</p><p>Although I may not share the same stature, hair colour or height, I sound like her and have her mannerisms, because she was the person who brought me up with my father and they would never be anything but my mum and dad.</p><p> I am a businesswoman.  I live by myself in London and am very much looking forward to starting my own family in the future.  It is my want for my own children that has encouraged me to be more active in my support of surrogacy of late, and something I am committed to continuing with.</p><p> There is so much support and advice available from organisations such as COTS and legalisation has made it easier to avoid the pitfalls of private and-or backstreet journeys for people who are thinking about surrogacy, have already been through the journey or are currently going through it.  While the legal process in England is not quick and simple or without its difficulties, I am living proof that it can be successful and I am forever grateful that that is the case.  I believe that, because it is legal, people are more willing to speak about it openly and ensure that all parties involved in the creation of a surrogate baby are cared for and represented.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to share my story and for listening and reading.  I am available for questions.</p></speech>

It is a courageous thing to share one's own story, particularly where we are trying to navigate a way through a legislative quagmire.  Hearing from the witnesses about their experiences has been helpful.</p> <p>  The purpose of this committee is to discuss international surrogacy.  In many instances, the surrogate mother does not live in the same country as the parents and child.  A second difference to the situation of the three witnesses is that international surrogacy is much more likely to be gestational surrogacy as opposed to traditional surrogacy, in that the egg gamete will be that of the intending mother or a donor.  I will bear this in mind as I ask my questions.</p> <p>  The experience of identity is something that would be useful for us to hear - the witnesses' experiences at school, how they describe themselves and how the latter has worked out.  We are driven towards ensuring that there is disclosure for the child from the moment of birth.  Ms Rowley-Smith has a different experience of that.  Is there anything she would like to share on this matter?</p> <p>  The witnesses, in particular Ms Roberts, alluded to the issue of birth certificates.  The witnesses have a commonality in having to ensure that their surrogate or birth mothers were somewhere reflected in their legal identify documents in light of the right to privacy.  I would appreciate responses on this point.</p> <p>  The witnesses also spoke about the long process their parents went through to get their parental orders and the ambiguity and stresses involved.  We are anxious to avoid that, so the witnesses might explore that issue.</p></speech>

I was born soon after Ms Kim Cotton's surrogacy story came out in the open.  Therefore, the Act had to be rushed through, so surrogacy was still very new and no one knew what was going on.  When I was born, the situation was very much up in the air.  I do not believe that COTS was around at the time - I was probably just before it.  I was born in Wales and raised in England.  When I was brought home to England, the local council had never come across anything like it before and did not know what to do.  Even though it took from 1987 to 1996 for me to be formally adopted - I was adopted by both parents, including by my father, who is my biological father - it was not because there was any restriction or people did not want it to happen.  It was just that people did not know what to do.  That, in itself, stresses how important legislation is.  Eventually, after my situation had gone before courts here, there and everywhere, I was formally adopted in 1996.</p> <p>  Legislation is important.  My parents were under stress.  In the previous session, mention was briefly made of having what was almost a legal guardian for a cooling off period or whatever.  I lived with my parents, but someone was assigned to me who, if need be, I could go to to be looked after.  There was also stress on my birth mother.  She had made this arrangement.  She never saw it as a transaction and always saw it as helping people who could not have children.  The courts repeatedly going back to her for all those years asking her whether she was sure about it was stressful.  I cannot imagine the stress on all of the parties involved.</p> <p>  I was fortunate to have been so young that I had no clue about what was happening.  I was oblivious to it.  I only found out three years ago.  I do not hold regrets.  With the lack of information available, I do not blame anyone because I do not know what I would have done in my parents' situation.  I cannot empathise, so I cannot comment.  However, for future surrogacy, it is extremely important that a child know.  I believe it was Ms Roberts who said that there was never a big sit-down for her.  It was just what she had always known.  I wish that had happened in my case, but I am not angry and do not hold grudges against anyone for the way my story came out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.974" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Georgina Roberts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#M00500"><p>There were a few points in the Senator's questions and I wrote them down.  If I look down, it is because I am looking at those.</p> <p>  One of the Senator's first questions was on identity.  I have never struggled with my identity personally, within groups, at school or anything like that.  Being aware that you were born through surrogacy is vital.  Like Ms Baldwin, I look nothing like my mom.  My mom is 5 ft nothing and fair, and has ginger hair and blue eyes.  We could not be more different.  If I had not been told, I would have been one of those people who wondered growing up and thought that surely we could not be genetically related.  I never felt any difficulty, as I had been told about my surrogate.  I had always known her, I had met her and I grew up alongside my half-siblings, visiting them a few times a year.  It was always known.</p> <p>  As Ms Baldwin mentioned, the issue of surrogacy comes up with everyone because people ask how many brothers and sisters someone has.  I class my half-brothers as my half-brothers because that is what they are and I did not grow up with any other sibling.  For all intents and purposes, they are my half-brothers, and that is how I like to describe them.  As such, we are always discussing surrogacy.  I have never had a negative reaction, even from people from whom I had believed I might have.</p> <p>  In the university where I am studying, I have encountered many international students from cultures, communities, backgrounds and religions where surrogacy would not be thought of or necessarily accepted and would go against many barriers.  However, when I sit and talk with people about my story, I have never had any negative comment at all.  That is powerful, because when people hear my story, they realise what a selfless and amazing act it is for one person to do for another.  We can confabulate it in a hypothetical setting and decide it is not acceptable, but when we look at a human born in this way and the amazing lives we have all been fortunate enough to have had, there is no arguing that it has worked for us.  No one can argue with that experience.</p><p> Regarding birth certificates, it is important to respect privacy, but it is also important that it is documented.  This is something I have discussed in many other places and we have never really come up with a solution which allows both.  The best solution I have heard of is the suggestion of an online portal where information could be stored and there could be a link on every birth certificate which could state that more detailed information about any additional circumstances surrounding the birth can be found at the link.  Some people who were born "normally" would go on the website and there would be nothing extra while people born through surrogacy, donor conception or other routes to parenthood would have additional information online.  That would mean everybody has access to that information but, equally, it is not plastered over one's birth certificate that one was born through surrogacy, which clearly would not be ideal.</p><p> It is very important to me that my parents are listed as my parents.  I believe it is in the best interests of everybody that this happens from the very start.  In this country, the new legal framework is looking at a six-week cooling off period, which was mentioned in this discussion, as a period of time for the surrogate to put in any objections.  If she did not object, then the intended parents would be considered the legal parents.  That is probably a good solution to allow the surrogate time but also to give the automatic rights, based on the assumed journey, of the intended parents being the legal parents from birth and avoiding these lengthy processes of court adoptions, which take years and are not good for anybody.</p><p> That is all I have to say.  Does Ms Baldwin have anything to add?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.976" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Meredith Baldwin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#N00200"><p>I do not have much to add.  The ladies have summarised it well, and we share some similarities.  As Ms Roberts said, I have written a couple of notes on identity.  For me, the way that my parents and birth mum chose for me to be told at such a young age has helped me to accept it.  It has just been part of who I am forever.  In school and even up to my working life, I never had anybody make any negative comments.  I have always been received very well.  Generally people ask questions about it such as whether I see my surrogate mum, and I have always been open and happy to talk about it.</p> <p>  Regarding birth certificates, interestingly, I do not actually know the length of the period of time of the legal adoption process so I will have to check that with my parents.  I have never asked them that question.  I am assuming it must have been fairly quick because they have never mentioned it.  I must have been very young when it went through.  As Ms Roberts said, having one's parents on one's birth certificate is very important, but it would be insensitive, perhaps, to not have it mentioned somewhere, whether that is on a portal or on an added part of the birth certificate, whether one comes into the world through surrogacy or adoption or anything other than the norm.  It is important to have that documented, for sure.</p></speech>

They have spoken very positively about their experience growing up as a child of surrogacy while also voicing challenges associated with it.  I am glad that the experiences were very positive for them.</p> <p>  I know many others would have serious issues with identity following donor conception.  Are they familiar with a lady called Sarah Dingle?  She is an Australian woman who is donor-conceived.  She addressed the UN in 2019 regarding surrogacy.  She basically said that there is no right to have a child under international law and that children are not goods or services that any state or business can provide.  Ms Dingle along with other persons born via surrogacy have spoken about the commodification, being conceived to meet the needs of others, half their identity being missing and the exploitation of gamete donors and women who act as surrogates.  They spoke of decades of profiteering in a global trade of sperm, eggs, embryos and wombs.  If our guests could say something to those women and men, what would it be?  Do they think we should be hearing from a range of different voices and experiences with surrogacy in this committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.979" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Georgina Roberts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#N00500"><p>I am happy to answer that.  I am aware of Sarah Dingle.  I spoke alongside Sarah and a variety of other donor-conceived individuals at the United Nations.  From a personal perspective, I found that experience eye-opening.  I was the only person on that panel born through surrogacy, and I want to make that clear.  I believe that donor conception and surrogacy have very different issues and, while they are closely related, we cannot treat them as the same thing.  They simply are not.  Granted, some surrogate-born children are conceived through donors but, on the whole, surrogacy is a separate entity.</p> <p>  My eyes were opened in this event in the United Nations by the stories of those who spoke alongside me who were donor-conceived because I had never really spoken to people who had had such difficulties with their origins.  It really broadened my experiences of interacting with different people who had had a very different experience from the experience we all have had.  It was very clear in that interaction that they feel intense hurt and pain, and sometimes betrayal, from the way they have been conceived.  At no point does any of us wish to undermine their feelings about that, but that is not necessarily reflective of how people feel in surrogacy.  As I said earlier, surrogacy generally is much more open and many of the issues I came across within that community speaking at the United Nations were about not having access to information, not being told about their origins, not being able to get in touch with birth parents should they wish to and feeling commodified because of the way sperm donation was done in various countries.  Again, it was not in the UK, so we have to bear in mind that these were different countries with different rules.</p> <p>  In terms of profiteering, I do not feel that surrogacy is about profiteering.  Clearly, altruistic and commercial surrogacy have different issues, but international surrogacy can still be altruistic.  There is no profiteering in altruistic agreements because it is a woman somewhere on the planet wanting to help build another family.  What is allowed in the UK law is reasonable expenses.  It is absolutely right that surrogates should be supported and provided with reasonable expenses and should not bear any costs in the pregnancy.  They should be looked after by all parties.  Personally, I do not perceive that as profiteering.  We have to take some of the comments from the United Nations talks that were publicised and look at them in detail.  All I can say about the comments that were made and publicised with donor-conceived and surrogacy people is that the panel consisted of ten to 15 donor-conceived individuals who had very difficult experiences and me born through surrogacy.  I am not saying our experiences represent those of everybody, but that the comments that were made there do not necessarily represent surrogacy.  They mainly represent the views of those donor-conceived and I happened to be there and, therefore, they were put in the media as donor-conceived and surrogacy.  I want to put that out.</p></speech>

With regard to the voices on the committee, we have worked together to ensure that we have a wide range of voices incorporated, and they are discussions and decisions of the committee.  I would not expect the witnesses to have any comments on that.  However, given the comments on Sarah Dingle, that aspect would be interesting.</p></speech>

If any surrogate mother or any surrogate says "I am doing this for the money", nobody would want to be involved with that.  For me, that would be pretty unethical.  It is about wanting to help a couple who have been struggling to have children.  That is why surrogates want to do it.  They probably enjoy pregnancy.  It is a very selfless act.  As for it being a profitable thing, that was not meant to be the case, and I do not believe it should be at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.986" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Rowley-Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#O00300"><p>I echo what Ms Roberts and Ms Baldwin have said.  My birth mother said it was never for profit.  I have never felt like a commodity or something materialistic.  I have four half-siblings.  She loves her family so much the thought of somebody out there who desperately wants a child and cannot have a child broke her heart.  If she could let somebody experience that love of a family she said that she would have happily done it again.  It has never been for profit.</p> <p>  I also agree with what Ms Roberts said about donor versus surrogacy.  They must be compared as two very different things.  The only thing that is slightly different for me is the question of identity.  I may be the opposite to Ms Roberts and Ms Baldwin in that I look like my mum.  I definitely look like my dad but the only thing that was in the papers was the fact that my mum was 50 when I was born.  When I did find out three years ago it was a bit like "Whoa".  It was mind blowing.  Because I look so much like my mum I never had a clue.  I would never say that there was any damage.  There was a bit of confusion briefly but in the three years since it happened I am completely happy with my identity, with who I am and where I fit into this world.</p> <p>  While I have the floor I will make a point on birth certificates.  My birth mother's name is on my birth certificate.  This is something that does hurt me.  That is the one thing.  I completely agree that it should be my parents because they have earned the title of mum and dad.  They have raised me.  They are my parents.  This is not to dismiss my birth mother at all, but they are my parents and they should be on my birth certificate.  I agree that there should be some sort of link or database for complete legal or medical reasons.  This is not to dismiss the selfless act that this birth mother has done but she is not my mother.  I feel that this is very important to mention.</p></speech>

I apologise if I repeat questions.  One of the things we have been talking about is the birth certificates and how we record these.  I apologise again if I am repeating questions.  What are some of the witnesses' experiences on that and being on the receiving end of these arrangements?  Ms Rowley-Smith has spoken on that and I would love to hear from the other two witnesses also about their experience.  How do they believe it could have been handled better or what would be the perfect system for somebody who has lived through such an experience?  I apologise if that sounds awful.  I will rephrase that.  For somebody who has been born through surrogacy, what would be the best system for you guys?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.988" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Georgina Roberts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#O00500"><p>I am very happy to take that question.  I have done quite a lot of networking among different groups around trying to create law reform on surrogacy in England and Wales.  One of the ideas, which I mentioned earlier but I am happy to go into more detail about, was an idea from someone who was going to conceive, who suggested that we record these births in an online database and then put onto every single birth certificate a link to the database or website.  A person could input a code from the birth certificate to see any additional information about his or her birth.  For some individuals, they would input the code from their birth certificate and there would be nothing because their mum and dad on the birth certificate are their mum and dad biologically in every way, and that would be fine.  For some individuals, whether they are conceived people or surrogacy-born people, there would be additional information on the website that would indicate who the surrogate was, whether they have half-siblings, whether donors were used, and that type of information.  This would, therefore, protect privacy because the information that the person was born through surrogacy would not be plastered all over the birth certificate, and it would also mean that everybody would have access to the information needed, which would be recorded in a very safe place so it could not get lost or go missing.</p> <p>  On the processing of birth certificates, Ms Rowley-Smith and I spoke a little bit in our opening statements about the fact that the process is very long to obtain birth certificates, and for the adoption processes.  One of the things the England and Wales law reform commission is considering is a six-week period after the birth where the intended parents are automatically considered the legal parents, before the birth certificate is issued, so that if there are any medical problems or any legal problems such as claiming child benefits, or whatever, they would be considered legal parents.  That six-week period, during which the birth could not be registered, would allow time for the surrogate to object if she wanted to.  If there was no objection, then the legal parents would be the intended parents, and that would be fine.  If the surrogate wanted to object then she would have the time and space in which to do so.  The thought is that it will go to a court to decide a best interest discussion for that child, on an individual setting.</p> <p>  In surrogacy we can all sometimes worry about these things.  Generally, people involved in surrogacy are really secure, know what they want, and know what they are doing.  These issues do not happen as the media tends to make out they do.  COTS has had so many births and there have not been many problems really at all.  We need to bear in mind that we are talking about a minute number of cases where there might be difficulties.  In the vast majority of cases, there is no problem.</p></speech>

It is extremely important that the parents who are raising the child are on the birth certificate, but that we do not dismiss the birth mother because, after all, she has done something incredible for these families.  It needs to be on some sort of a database to avoid any kind of discrimination or raised eyebrows from people who do not understand the full situation.</p> <p>  I agree with the idea of a time period but once it is passed then that is that.  While those six weeks might be quite intimidating and the parents might wonder "What if this goes bad?", it is better than the seven, eight and nine years that my parents had to go through.  I am sure they would rather wait six weeks than all of those years and just get it sorted.</p><p>We need to make sure, however, that we do not dismiss the birth mother.  That information needs to be on some sort of system where it can be easily accessed by the parties who need to access it.</p></speech>

Ms Roberts stated that in the vast majority of cases, everything is 100% fine but that there tends to be a kind of frenzy about this.  That is not to dismiss some of the cases which may not have gone 100%, but still that is a really important point to bear in mind.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about birth certificates.  This matter has been covered somewhat, but I want to hear what the witnesses think of this suggestion.  What they are saying is that there would be some sort of register or record where people could check that information but that the intending parents would be the ones listed on the birth certificate.</p> <p>  Ms Roberts's statement on language was really interesting.  She said that the language around surrogacy is important and that, having discussed it with other people, she believes it is important to them too.  I have got feedback from some people who have been surrogates.  I know everyone is different, but they do not like to be referred to as mothers.  With a lot of surrogacy now, at least one of the intending parents is one of the genetic parents.  Could the witnesses expand on the point about language?</p> <p>  Again, I sincerely thank the witnesses.  It is great to hear their evidence.  It just goes to show that openness and transparency are the key to so much of this.  Obviously, we need legislation.  What Ms Rowley-Smith said shows that people did not know what to do or how to deal with the situation and that if there were regulations and legislation, it would be so much easier.  The fact that it is an open system and people are talking about it are key to this as well.  I ask Ms Roberts to respond to my question about the language.  Then, if anyone has any further comment on birth certificates, I would be interested to hear it, but I know the question has been answered in detail already.</p></speech>

Personally, and from other people to whom I have spoken, my birth mother is my birth mother because she is maternally linked to me and gave birth to me.  My mum and dad, however, are my mum and dad because, to me, the titles "mum" and "dad" are earned.  One can technically become a parent.  In many cases, it is quite easy to become a parent, but that does not automatically mean one earns the titles "mum" and "dad".  Some people say to me, "Oh, you have two mums."  I say I do not, and I am happy to correct them because education is key and many people do not ask questions because they are scared of offending somebody.  I am not offended.  I want to educate people.  I say, "No, she is my birth mother, but they are my mum and dad."  I would never be offended.  We need to talk about this, as we are all doing, to educate people.  Language is important, whether in gender or surrogacy, and we need to educate people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.995" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Georgina Roberts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#P00600"><p>That is really interesting.  I made my statement prior to those of the other two witnesses.  I notice that both of them refer to their surrogates as their birth mothers, so I do not want to offend either of them in my comments on language.  From my experience of working with all these groups, the overwhelming feedback I have had from surrogates is that they do not want to be considered mothers.  They are not mothers in any sense from their perspective.  They do not want that, I suspect, for two reasons: first, to protect themselves a little, because if they are referred to from the beginning as mothers, that forms a link and makes things potentially more difficult; and, second, they want to respect the intended mother as the mum and would not want to overstep that mark in making her feel like she has competition for the title of mother.  That is why language is really important.  I always refer to my surrogate as my surrogate or Suzanne.  I would not refer to her as my mother in any sense because she is not.  That needs to be reflected in law as well as in the education of people.  I have been asked the question Ms Rowley-Smithy mentioned, "Who is your real mum?"  You think to yourself, I have only one real mum, only one mum.  I have my mum and my surrogate.  They are very different people and I love them both for different reasons, but my surrogate is never my mum.</p> <p>  I know we have mentioned birth certificates in forward-facing terms but I am aware that in Ireland there is also a backward-facing problem of people who have already been born through surrogacy, who have birth certificates and who have their surrogates and possibly their surrogates' husbands or their fathers on those certificates, depending on the circumstances.  We must not forget this group of people.  It is great looking forward to creating laws to help in the future, but people who have been born have an absolute right to have their parents listed on their birth certificates as their legal parents and to have all that put into place in such a way that they are socially and legally secure in their family structures.  We need to think of how that can be catered for in a bespoke way, making sure they are also thought of and their journeys are recorded so their futures are as stable and secure as our futures.</p></speech>

I am a bit of a dinosaur when it comes to technology.</p> <p>  To add to what Ms Roberts and Ms Rowley-Smith said, I do not consider Wendy my mum.  I might call her my birth mum but never mum.  That is just not fathomable to me at all.  My parents are the ones who brought me up.  They are mum and dad.  Identity-wise, the other ladies have already covered most of this.  It probably comes down to it being good to have a general idea as to what language is appropriate, but that has to be decided for each individual between the parents and the surrogate.  Especially among younger children, the phrase "tummy mummy" goes around a lot.  It is a matter of making sure that it makes sense for people at the right time, especially for the child.</p></speech>

It is really valuable to us because they are sharing their lived experience.  We have been given the job of coming up with a report and recommendations on international surrogacy in quite a tight timeframe.  It is possible for us to achieve that only if we hear from everybody involved.  It is really brave of the witnesses to share very personal details of their lives, and I thank them for doing so because it enriches our experience as a committee and will enrich our legislative journey in respect of this matter.  I thank them for that.</p> <p>  Last week, we had before us a psychologist who spoke about the really positive outcomes for children where families have been very open about surrogacy.  I am struck by how different all the witnesses' stories are as to how they came to know they were born through surrogacy.  What the lady before us last week said was about the importance of support for children born through surrogacy as they accept that.  I know that the witnesses are all coming from different stages of that in the context of their childhoods.</p><p>I am interested in hearing their opinions about how we as a State should be providing counselling or whatever support they think could be beneficial in an optional way to ensure everybody is comfortable with it.  I have been really reassured by all our their contributions around how certain they are in their identities and how positive an experience they have had from this.</p><p> Our guests might forgive me.  I think it was Ms Baldwin, though I am not entirely sure, who said how wanted children were as well and that struck me too.</p><p> One thing Ms Roberts said in her latest contribution is surrogates do not want to be considered a mother and that is quite an important thing for us to delve a little deeper into.  She also spoke about two potential solutions floated to the birth certificate issue that we are talking about every week.  The first related to the database and secondly that six-week period.  She reference the idea originally came from someone else but I would appreciate it if she had a little more information to talk us through that further, so we could identify whether that might be a potential solution for us in Ireland.  I am asking the three guests to share their opinions on what optional support should be put in place for families and children in particular, and then for Ms Roberts to take the specific question around the databases and the six-week period.</p></speech>

Although COTS is not a huge organisation, support is always available.  From my childhood, when I was quite a bit younger, we would go to the AGM of COTS and I was able to mix with children born through surrogacy.  Two of my best friends are surrogates; they are twins.  They are actually Kim Cotton's twins.  They have been in my life forever, so I have always had people close to me who I have been able to talk to about my journey and about their journey.  That has continued to now.  They now live on the other side of the world in New Zealand, unfortunately, but that support network is always there.  That is why it is important to have the right channels to go through so one does not feel like one is going it alone, whether that is from the child's perspective, the surrogate's perspective or that of the intended parents, there is a whole load of support out there.  It is not just through COTS but that has been my experience with it.  It has provided so much support.  Even now in my 30s I still like to talk about it.  I still have questions.  I think I always will.  I have been very lucky in that respect that there has been something available for me throughout my life.</p></speech>

Obviously my experience from knowing my background was very different to Ms Roberts and Ms Baldwin.  As I said, I went through probably a period of confusion and there are children out there who still do not know and who should be able to access support through some sort of surrogacy legislation.  I undertook some counselling to help me understand and fathom everything and it was fantastic.  That course of counselling has helped me understand maybe how I got into this situation without knowing, obviously because of the lack of support back then.</p> <p>  I know funding is difficult but it would be worthwhile having an option of surrogate mothers who are going to undertake the journey to have some sort of access to counselling should they feel they need it just to ensure they are 100% sure and know what they are undertaking, just as one would with any other procedure.  It is a bit off-tangent but my husband had a vasectomy and he was told to go away, offered counselling and told to ensure he was 100% sure this was what he wanted.  That should be available when it comes to anything related to building a family.  Making sure there are clear channels to access support is something I have not had and my parents did not have at the time I was being conceived because everything was so new.  I say that but I think surrogacy has probably been around for a lot longer than we reckon but it has never been spoken.  It is probably hundreds and hundreds of years but it is just that we do not know about it.  It only started really being spoken about in the 1980s due to the courage of Kim Cotton.  We have a lot be thankful to her for.  As long as people know how to access help, should they want it, it is extremely important for every party involved.</p></speech>

I thank both Ms Baldwin and Ms Rowley-Smith for their comments.  I fully back them.  It is interesting to hear different experiences because Ms Rowley-Smith did not know and Ms Baldwin did and had lots of people around her who were born through surrogacy.</p> <p>  I had a slightly different experience in that I knew from very early on but did not know anyone else, other than my half-brother, who was born through surrogacy.  I also recall attending the AGMs with all my surrogate family so I suppose I did not mix with the other children so much because it was a time for me to mix with my half-siblings.  I would like to reassure everyone in the room that when people are told from an early age about being born through surrogacy we do not need counselling because of that, because we are just told and it is normalised.</p> <p>  I absolutely take Ms Rowley-Smith's point that counselling was really important for her because she had a different experience, but just to reassure people that when one has an experience where it is normalised from the beginning and one knows from day 1 then one does not need counselling because of that.  It is just like being told one has a brother or sister.  It is just one's family and that is just how it is and that does not damage anybody.</p></speech>

The biggest influence on children's lives is their parents.  If one has parents who are not secure in their role as parents that is potentially where one gets difficulties but if we can maximise the security for parents, that they are parents like every other parent is a parent, then they are secure and they will have secure children.</p> <p>  On my idea on birth certificates, I have done a little mock-up.  I hope no-one minds me holding it up to the camera.  I am not sure people can see it.  If it were a birth certificate one would have one's birth certificate, one's mother and father would be one's intended parents - mother and father as we have all described the mum and dad.  Then one could have something at the bottom, like a bit of text, that says "For further information go to" and then supplies a website.  On the back one could have a code.  That code would be unique to each individual.  One would go to the website and put in one's unique code.  This method would ensure if people had to photocopy their birth certificate, for example, for anybody the front would be photocopied.  Nobody else would have access to one's code or be able to use that code to go onto the website but with the hard copy would be able to turn it over and see one's code and input it on the website.  It does not show there is something different about one because we want to protect privacy but it gives everybody the opportunity to use that and look at it.  Somebody could go to the website, use his or her code that is protected and then access further information.  I hope that is useful.  Someone who was donor-conceived thought that might be useful as a system.</p></speech>

Everyone is so welcome.  This morning's meeting has been so positive and we do not often say that so I am grateful for all our guests' very positive contributions.</p> <p>  An awful lot of stuff I was looking at has been covered.  Birth certificates were mentioned and Ms Roberts has clearly illustrated that.  What struck me from her contribution was the undermining of the parents.</p><p>That urges me on but it also upsets me that parents are undermined.  And it is clear that parents are undermined by Irish law.  </p><p> I have been going from different committees to this one so I do not know if this was covered.  Identity is a huge concept including cultural, familial and genetic varieties.  My identity is very much about where I came from and the family I grew up with but there could be a different genetic identity.  Can someone explain to a layperson how we can understand the genetic identity particularly from a donor or gestational surrogacy?  How do we reconcile genetic identity and protect it?  It is not even about protecting it but for people to understand it.  There are lots of reasons genetics are important.  Ms Baldwin spoke of how straight surrogacy is not as common now.  Does she think that is positive or negative?  I am not sure what is the difference but how does having siblings or half-siblings impact people on an emotional level?  You have half-siblings from people who are not your parents at all - you do not recognise them and nor should you - but you still have a genetic link to people to whom you are not technically related.  What is our guests' opinion from a legal or emotional side?</p></speech>

My mum is still my mum, whether I was created with her egg or not does not really make any difference.  Yes, the technology has advanced but as to whether it would make any difference to me personally or would I feel closer to her if we shared genetics, I do not think so.  To me, the parents are the people who bring you up.  It is wonderful for those who think that their child needs to be genetically made from them; that is what they need but not everyone needs that and then what if it is not available?  That would not have worked for my mum anyway because she had a lot of complications so straight surrogacy was the only way for her.  Her eggs were not not viable and she could not carry.  For me, I do not think it would make any difference.</p> <p>  On half-siblings, I have a very good relationship with my half-brother but not so much my half-sisters because they lead quite a different lifestyle from me.  I do find it odd sometimes.  We see each other at weddings or big events.  I watch things they post on Facebook.  There are a few pictures taken of my older half-sister from the side and I think "oh yes, that looks a bit like me".  That is a bit of an odd feeling but I feel as though I know them as much as I need to know them and I am lucky that I am able to have that.  As I said at the beginning, it is just part of my life story.  I do not particularly feel the need to change anything.  I do not think that I need to have more or less involvement with my birth mum or my half-siblings.  I am lucky that I am very happy with what I have got.  </p></speech>

I am biologically linked to my half-siblings through my birth mother.  I find it quite funny in a way is that I grew up as an only child so if I mention "my brother" to someone, to me it sounds like I am lying.  It is something that I have never usually said.  If I do refer to them I am happy to talk about and share the experiences.  If anything the fact that I am not biologically related to my mum has made me closer to my mum.  I do not think there is that need for a biological connection.  It is what Ms Baldwin said basically.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.1014" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Georgina Roberts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#R00400"><p>I am also related to my half-siblings.  They are the three other children that my surrogate has had.  One is also a surrogate baby for a different family.  That is for context.  I see all of them as my half-siblings.  I have always been very comfortable using that as a language to describe them.  They are my half-brothers and they call me their half-sister.  We need to think of how in most families now it is not just mum, dad and children.  Families are constructed in so many ways.  We are talking here about a specific way to construct families where half-siblings are more likely to have happened but let us not forget that half-siblings, step-siblings and adopted siblings happen in all families.  This is not a problem unique to surrogacy and this is not something that we need to overly worry about.  Surrogate families will come up with their own language.  I have met some families where they do not describe each other as half-siblings but call each other cousins or special friends and that is fine.  So long as the openness is there the language is very much as people want to have it.  I have always got on quite well with my half-brothers.  We speak and we see each other a few times a year.  I feel quite privileged to have them and particularly my half-brother who was born through surrogacy because he has been the only person I have known growing up born through surrogacy.  I have been able to share experiences with him and talk with him about surrogacy a little bit.  It ought to be helpful because it is in the same family so we have had near-enough identical experiences with the openness and the surrogate so we have been able to speak very openly about those things.  So emotionally or legally I have never found having half-siblings problematic at all.</p> <p>  On traditional or gestational surrogacy, I might have a bit of a different view from the other two guests.  My views on surrogacy come from a place where my mum's role as my mum was undermined.  I think she finds that very difficult and therefore I find that very difficult as well.  I feel quite defensive that her role as my mum was undermined from very early on because that is not right.  Whether we have children, like Ms Rowley-Smith had with Max or whether we think about going on to have children, we all assume that we are going to have children who look like us and who share things like mannerisms with us and that we will be pregnant.  For intending mothers it is very difficult because you already have to let go of so much in not carrying a child that it is good to preserve as many of the other things that we all think about having with our child as we can.  If I could have been genetically related to my mum that would have been nice and to be able to say I look like her and we share genetics but I am not and I do not feel any pain about that.  I think, as technology advances, it is in the best interests that if they can be genetically related to both parents then they are.  Mine is just one voice in this.</p><p>I do not think it does anyone any damage if it is a case like Ms Baldwin mentioned where mothers cannot be genetic mothers because their eggs are not viable.  I think that covers all the questions.  </p></speech>

I apologise as I did not explain that properly.</p> <p>  Having listened to our guests, their experiences have been improved and added to from having half-siblings.  They have had a positive experience.  Mine was a probing question on that.  It was not to suggest one should have a genetic link to one's mother it was about having another party involved and our guests' opinion of that experience.  They have had such a positive experience of all of this.  My question was about the adding in of another factor.  My apologies again on that.</p></speech>

I think we are all secure in our identities in our role as being surrogacy born.  If it was birth conceived from a donor egg, a surrogate's egg or our mother's egg, it would not really matter as long as it was recorded somewhere.</p></speech>

It would not make any difference.  It would be perhaps another person but, as I said in my opening statement, we are at the stage where one can have a child that is going home to a same-sex or opposite-sex couple conceived from a donor sperm or a donor egg and a host mother.  The possibilities are pretty endless.  As Ms Roberts said, if one has the physical ability to use some of one's genetics, it would be natural to want to do that, but if one cannot, one cannot.  It is black or white; one either can or one cannot.  If one still wants to go down the road of having a family, then one explores other possibilities.  I do not think it would make any difference if I found out tomorrow that I had an egg donation mum.  Perhaps it would be different, but I do not think so.  The important aspect is having openness and knowing about it.  Things tend to fail when people are not open, try to hide things and it becomes a secret.</p></speech>

I have a question regarding language.  Since becoming a member of this committee, it has been a major learning exercise for myself and probably for the majority of the members.  When it comes to language, I am nervous about saying something that could hurt even if completely unintentionally.  Because we do not have the lived experience we do not know what certain words mean or the emphasis they have for our guests.  They discussed the word "mother" earlier and how the language around that is important.  Is there any other language they find hurtful or would like some clarity around?  There is an element of public education in having them here today in order that people would have an understanding of surrogacy.  Is there any other language they find particularly concerning, hurtful or discriminatory in its approach that they would like to tell us about?</p></speech>

We covered most things but something has just cropped up for me.  During the process of being adopted and all that malarkey my surrogate mother&rsquo;s husband was referred to as my stepdad.  When I found out he was referred to as that by the courts I found it hard to understand why he was referred to as my stepdad and wondered if he had anything to say on it.  I would never have referred to him as my stepdad.  All parties who are potentially involved can be affected, even if it be half-siblings, but I do not think stepdad was the right word.  That is more of an anecdotal comment in case that ever comes up.  From the reactions of Ms Baldwin and Ms Roberts, I guess this is something they have not come across.  I was stunned when I heard about it.  It is an anecdotal comment to point out that I did not see him in that role.</p></speech>

I do not know many surrogate children but I know a few.  I do not think any of us would be offended if you used a term and we had to say we would prefer it if you called them this.  We are all about educating, sharing and making sure everyone has a good experience.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-19a.1025" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Georgina Roberts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022051900002#S01100"><p>It is very natural to be nervous of language in this scenario when it is something of which one does not have lived experience.  It is great people want to hear from people who do have lived experience of what language might be difficult.  I do not have much to add in terms of what might be difficult.  In my case my surrogate was unmarried and my first birth certificate had the names of her and my father recorded on it.  However, I know where Rachel is coming from on this point.  In this country currently if one's surrogate is married, it is the names of one's surrogate and her husband that are recorded on the birth certificate because it is presumed parent law.  That is probably where the comment of stepdad came from, but I am not sure where they got the step part from.</p> <p>  In terms of language, as a child, I also used the term "tum mum".  It is a useful phrase in order that children can understand.  However, I have made a personal decision now not to use the term "mother" when referring to my surrogate because that does not feel right for me but people have different views on that and that is fine.</p> <p>  In terms of language going forward, one aspect I think about, and Ms Rowley-Smith may have experience of this with Max, is that we are the first generation of surrogacy-born people, if people want to call us that.  We have our surrogate and our mum and dad.  I am excited and curious about how that will go on through generations and how we define and describe relationships.  For example, with Ms Rowley-Smith's surrogate and Max, what is the language used in that type of relationship?  However, I would not say it is anything to be offended by.  It is exciting to think of how the language on this will be used as we move forward and how can future-proof it for the next generations.  </p></speech>

I have another son as well as Max.  As to how my two children will refer to my birth, I do not know yet.  I am comfortable with that because it is something we need to explore.  There is no rule book or handbook on how this works and it will be whatever works for me.  In terms of my half-siblings, my brother is very adamant that I am his sister.  I am not his half-sister, I am his sister.  We are referred to as auntie or uncle.  My four year old calls my brother "uncle".  I am interested and excited about how the language will be used as we go forward.  For clarity, my personal decision is that my children will know about my upbringing when they are old enough to understand.  It is not something that will be kept secret.  That is important for them because they may need to use surrogacy in the future.  I do not want there to be any sort of stress or confusion.  I want to be completely open with them.</p></speech>
