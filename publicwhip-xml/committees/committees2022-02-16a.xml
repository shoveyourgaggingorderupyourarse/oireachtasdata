Before we begin, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Today's witnesses are giving their evidence in the committee room so we do not have to give the reminder about giving evidence remotely.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place at which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask that everyone co-operates with this.</p> <p>  Today's engagement is the committee's fourth meeting on the issue of the indexation of welfare and the taxation system.  This is an issue that we will go into in some detail so I appreciate everybody's attendance.  I welcome Mr. Joe Cullen, principal officer, income tax policy unit, and Mr. Matt McGann, principal officer, fiscal analysis unit, at the Department of Finance; Ms Jasmina Behan, acting assistant secretary, and Mr. Cathal McDermott, assistant principal, at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler, assistant secretary, Ms Aideen Mooney, principal officer, and Ms Saidhbh&iacute;n Hardiman, assistant principal, at the Department of Social Protection.  We will go to Mr. Lawler first, followed by Ms Behan and Mr. Cullen, if that is acceptable to everybody.  I call Mr. Lawler. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Lawler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022021600002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak.  We have provided members with some briefing material in advance of the meeting, which I hope they found useful and informative.  The issue of benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments has been a topic of discussion for many years.  It stretches back to the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986, through to the national pensions policy initiative in 1998 and the Final Report of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group in 2001, which was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.  More recently, the focus has been on State pension payments.  A Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 proposed a benchmark of 34% of average earnings as a rate of payment with future increases linked to the consumer price index and wage levels.  The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 presented a defined approach to benchmarking and indexation of pensions, known as the smoothed earnings approach.  This is the approach that has been considered and endorsed by the Commission on Pensions and, along with other commission recommendations, will be considered by the Government in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>  As the committee is fully aware, the rate of State pension each year is decided as part of the budgetary process.  The introduction of a system of benchmarking or indexation can help to alleviate some of the difficulties inherent in that process.  I will highlight a few of them.  First, with no explicit link between pension rates and earnings, the real value of pensions relative to market-based earnings can deviate from year to year.  Similarly, with no link to prices, the real value of pension rates can lead ahead of, or lag behind, changes in prices.  Second, the uncertainties created by the current process, given the scale of spending on pensions, make public expenditure planning and budgeting across all of Government uncertain.  It is worth noting the Department of Social Protection is now the highest spending Government Department and pension expenditure will comprise approximately 40% of the Department&rsquo;s entire budget in 2022.  Third, workers planning retirement arrangements face significant uncertainty with regard to the real value of the State pension at retirement, which impacts upon their ability to make appropriate private pension arrangements.</p> <p>  A number of approaches could be taken to indexing pensions, some of which witnesses have outlined to the committee over the past number of meetings.  While not exhaustive, these include indexing to rises in prices; indexing to rises in earnings; indexing to a certain percentage increase each year; or indexing to the higher of a number of indicators.  Again, there can be difficulties with each of these approaches.  For example, linking to prices only would risk pensions falling behind average incomes in society generally, linking to earnings only may lead to the real value of the pension falling during periods of high inflation, and increasing to a set percentage each year does not take account of either earnings or prices and, while it guarantees certainty to pensioners, does not take account of developments in the wider economy.  Finally, linking to the higher of a number of indicators leads to a ratchet effect whereby the rate, over time, will exceed all of the indicators chosen and outstrip both earnings and prices. As noted by the Commission on Pensions, this can lead to fiscal sustainability issues and has been a recent subject of controversy in the United Kingdom, which has adopted a triple-lock approach. </p> <p>  The smoothed earnings approach endorsed by the Commission on Pensions seeks to overcome this by smoothing pension increases over time, anchoring to a particular benchmark such as a percentage of earnings, but indexing the pension rate to prices during periods where inflation outstrips earnings.  In subsequent years, when the value of the benchmark exceeds a prices-adjusted rate of pension, it is again tied to the benchmark.  In effect, over time this anchors the pension rate to the benchmark level over the medium term.</p> <p>  Ireland is an outlier in not having a benchmarking or indexation mechanism for State pensions.  Throughout Europe and beyond, governments have adopted approaches to calculating state pension increases that rely on earnings or prices indicators &ndash; or a mix of both &ndash; to determine annual pension rates.  Having said that, to adopt this approach would be a fundamental shift in how budgetary planning decisions are made.  In this regard, as outlined in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion, the approach could be overseen by an independent, expert body and could operate in a similar manner to the Low Pay Commission by making annual recommendations to the Government.  The body could also periodically review the effectiveness of the approach.</p> <p>  In the time permitted, we hope to give the committee an insight into current thinking around the benchmarking and indexation approach under consideration.  I thank the Chairman.  My colleagues and I are happy to respond to any questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jasmina Behan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022021600002#A00400"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak with members on the issue of benchmarking and indexation.  My colleague from the Department of Social Protection has already outlined the background to benchmarking and indexation in relation to the State pension.  The report of the Commission on Pensions from October 2021 and the accompanying technical working paper on benchmarking and indexation set out an overview of the proposed policy recommendations and the key considerations relating to these recommendations.  Previously, officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform worked closely with officials in the Department of Social Protection on possible approaches to applying benchmarking and indexation to the State pension in advance of the publication of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, which was published in January 2020.</p> <p>  One approach discussed in the roadmap was referred to as the smoothed earnings approach.  This approach was endorsed by the Commission on Pensions in its report, which was published in October last year.  I will talk through the mechanism of the smoothed earnings approach in more detail and highlight some important considerations of potential changes to determining the State pension rate from a public expenditure management perspective.  Broadly, the smoothed earnings approach is based on two parameters: growth in wages and growth in prices.</p><p>Using wage growth as the benchmark, the State pension is calculated as a percentage of average earnings.  This percentage has frequently been assumed to be set at 34% based on an analysis from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, dating back to 1996.  By benchmarking the State pension rate to 34% of average earnings each year, changes in earnings are reflected in the basic State pension rate.  </p><p> The second component of the smoothed earnings approach applies price inflation to the calculation.  Here, the pension rate is adjusted using the harmonised indices of consumer prices, HICP.  Both the consumer price index, CPI, and the HICP are designed to measure the change in the average level of prices paid for consumer goods and services.  The HICP has gained prominence in recent years as it enables comparison across EU member states.  Its main difference from the CPI is that it excludes items such as mortgage interest, motor tax, house and car insurance and trade union subscriptions.  The HICP and CPI are typically very close in their measure but the HICP has marginally been the higher indicator of the two in recent months.</p><p> Once the pension rates are calculated, the smoothed earnings approach uses the higher of the 34% earnings benchmark or HICP growth over the period to determine the increase in the rate.  The smoothed earnings approach is designed to preserve the real value of pensions over time and to keep pace with both inflation and earnings, whichever is growing faster.  Linking pension payments to developments in earnings and prices in this way can provide greater certainty to individuals and to public expenditure planning.  If implemented, it could bring Ireland&rsquo;s approach to determining the appropriate pension rates more in line with other countries.</p><p> However, benchmarking and indexation would be a fundamental policy change which also gives rise to important considerations in relation to managing the public finances.  Future pressures on the public finances due to an ageing population are well documented.  Expenditure on the State pension is due to increase considerably as a proportion of modified gross national income, GNI, over the coming decades.  Department of Finance calculations included in the pensions commission's report estimate that expenditure on social welfare pensions will increase from around 3.8% of modified GNI in 2019 to 5% by 2030, assuming that the pension age is retained at 66.  By 2050, this estimate increases to 7.9%.</p><p> A change in policy such as implementing the smoothed earnings approach would impact on the current budgetary discretion available to the Government, which allows for consideration of the overall prevailing economic conditions.  Periods in which both earnings and prices are both falling, and periods in which the public finances are under pressure due to economic conditions, could represent problematic scenarios for the application of the smoothed earnings approach.  The Government is currently considering the recommendation of the pensions commission to establish a pension rate commission.  While the presence of such a commission may help with the deliberation process for applying a benchmarking and indexation approach, there is also the consideration of the administrative complexity and cost that may arise.  The Government is due to deliberate on the pensions commission's recommendations by the end of March this year.</p><p> I hope that gives this committee an insight into the high level detail of the benchmarking and indexation approach under consideration for pensions and the key considerations in relation to the public finances.  My colleagues and I will be happy to take any questions committee members may have. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Cullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022021600002#B00300"><p>On behalf of the Department of Finance, I thank the Chairperson for the invitation to appear before the committee.  We are happy to provide the Department&rsquo;s expertise to support the committee in examining the question of indexation of the tax and welfare system and, in particular, the rationale for and against indexation of the tax system; the approach that might be taken, including how it might operate; and how automatic indexation might affect budgetary sustainability.</p> <p>  We have followed very closely earlier discussions which the committee has had with other contributors over recent weeks.  Those discussions have covered in some detail the rationale behind indexation of the tax and welfare system and we are happy to make available our analysis to further inform the discussion today.</p> <p>  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s responsibility, and hence expertise, in this area largely relates to tax policy.  However, the Department also has responsibility for overall fiscal sustainability.  In that regard, as part of our contribution, we can outline the extent to which the EU fiscal rules impact on budgetary flexibility and, in particular, how the rules would account for a system of automatic indexation, as compared with the present approach.</p> <p>  In terms of the underlying rationale, when welfare support payments or personal income tax credits and bands are increased in a particular year while earnings and prices are rising, such an approach seeks to ensure that the purchasing power of welfare supports is maintained and the value of take-home pay for those at work is preserved.  Our ESRI colleagues indicated during their appearance earlier this month that indexation of tax and welfare changes in line with wages growth as opposed to prices growth is the only way to ensure that welfare recipients and workers see their income grow at the same rate.  We also note in this regard that the current programme for Government contains a commitment that from budget 2022 onwards, "in the event that incomes are again rising as the economy recovers, credits and bands will be indexed linked to earnings."  The question of whether the base reference for the index used should be prospective or retrospective is also a point for consideration and it is brought into particular focus at the moment by current price and wage movements.</p> <p>  A further key point made by our ESRI colleagues, one which we would underline, is that, historically, changes to tax and welfare parameters have, on average, kept pace with earnings.  This aligns with the Department&rsquo;s own analysis when we look at the effect of budget changes over time on the personal income tax system.  The picture as it applies internationally was addressed in detail by the ESRI in its presentation to the committee.  In our view, it would be important to explore this aspect and reflect carefully on any learnings, while remaining cognisant of the fundamental differences in approach to taxation and welfare that exist across countries.</p> <p>  In relation to the steps that might be required to create an indexation system, these would initially be likely to require policy decisions regarding the scope of the change.  Questions in this regard include whether it would involve both the tax and welfare systems; whether it would apply to all elements and supports or just a key subset; and whether the same degree of indexation would apply to both systems in any year.  Other questions include whether indexation should take place by reference to increases in wages or prices; whether the index used would be retrospective or prospective; whether, and to what extent, a facility for discretion to suspend or modify the system in any particular year would be built into the arrangements; and whether the system would be placed on a statutory footing or something less binding, for example, a set of non-statutory guidelines.</p> <p>  Were such a system to encompass both tax and welfare, it would be likely to require in advance of the annual budget close co-ordination and co-operation at the political and official levels across a number of Government Departments in order to discuss and agree matters such as the degree of any deviation from the expected extent of indexation, if the system allowed for this and, of course, the percentage index to be used.</p> <p>  Returning to the issue of the rationale for having a system of automatic indexation, a key attraction of such an approach is that it might be expected to give more certainty to beneficiaries on both the tax and welfare sides, both individuals and families, from year to year about the value of their income or take-home pay and entitlement to supports.  At the same time, as has been pointed out by contributors previously, the main drawback is that, to the extent that automatic indexation might apply, it would limit or curtail Government flexibility around the discretionary allocation or non-allocation of resources in any particular year.  This would be likely to have practical implications not only within the tax and welfare systems but also for the allocation of resources for support and incentive schemes across a wide range of other areas of government.</p> <p>  As noted earlier, the approach of successive Governments over the years has been one where automatic indexation has not applied each year and where budgetary flexibility has been retained in large measure from year to year.  However, as has also been noted, this approach has delivered results which are broadly similar to what would have been achieved if indexation to earnings growth had been in place.  Ultimately, the question of annual automatic indexation is one of political choice and preference.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their attention.  We are happy to provide further information or clarification on any point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1455" speakername="Aindrias Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022021600002#C00200"><p>I thank Mr. Lawler, Ms Behan and Mr. Cullen for the presentations and overviews provided.  Mr. Cullen answered a chunk of the questions I had in the context of the earlier contributions.  Much of the focus seems to be only on the pension.  Have other social welfare payments been examined in this context, aside from the pensions?  I refer to payments made to younger people, jobseeker's payments, the working family payment. WFP, etc.  Has all the focus in this process been on people of pension age?  Equally, in respect of side benefits, such as the fuel allowance and medical card and those qualifying thresholds, has consideration been given to indexing them as well, or is there a narrow focus on the pension rate itself?  I ask for some details on this point.  Turning to another matter, is it only the State pension being considered in regard to this process or is there also scope for making changes to semi-State pensions, such as those paid by Aer Lingus, ESB, etc?  The recipients of those pensions have been clear that they have not had any rise in several years, and their pensions are also being threatened by the impact of PRSI changes now as well.  I wonder where pensions such as those fit into the picture.</p> <p>  Turning to the taxation side, and Mr. Cullen outlined several aspects in this regard, it seems that what is being talked about is a proposal in respect of income tax for pensioners and younger people as well.  I would like some clarification on this point and where it is felt that it would be appropriate to draw a line in this regard.  In addition, to get this clear in my mind, I would also like some more detail regarding what was said about it being felt that the system, as it is working, has been yielding similar results as if there had been indexation, even though there has not been in recent years.  Is my reading of this correct?  </p></speech>

There is a commitment in the national roadmap for social inclusion to examine other social welfare payments.  The focus to date has been on State pensions, but we will be turning to other working-age payments, along the lines the Deputy spoke about.</p></speech>

They do not come under the remit of this benchmarking indexation process.  The focus has been on State pensions to date.  When we turn our attention to working-age payments, that will be a much more complex area.  There are many different rates of payment.  For example, people on jobseeker's payments are on different rates to those on invalidity pensions or on a carer's payment.  It is more complex to determine where to set the benchmark when dealing with more than one payment.</p></speech>

Many of those ancillary payments are used to target resources at groups of people who are most vulnerable, for example, in the case of the living alone allowance, and others.  There may need to be some discretion for the Government to target payments in a particular year at particular groups more at risk of poverty, for example.</p></speech>

The starting position if there were to be indexing of bands and credits is that it would apply to everyone.  On the issue of what has been achieved in the absence of having a system of automatic indexation in place, I will give a concrete example.  We have taken figures for average earnings from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, publications and looked at the years from 2014 right up to the impact of budget 2022, which was a period when the economy began to stabilise after the financial crisis.  In that time, a person on the average wage back in 2014 would have been earning around &euro;36,000.  The current equivalent average earnings figure is &euro;44,191.  The effective rate of tax on those two figures has varied slightly over that time, but not much.  It was 21.8% in 2014 and, after budget 2022, it is now 22.5%.  Therefore, it is broadly similar.  This would suggest that the tax changes we have introduced have broadly kept pace with increases in earnings over that fairly decent period of eight years.  If we look at married couples with one earner, people in that situation have done even better.  In 2014, their effective tax rate was 13.1%.  That has reduced after budget 2022 to 11.7%, and this has been largely due to the impact of the increase in the home carer tax credit over that time.  Those are just some brief examples of how the system has matched the growth in wages over that time.</p></speech>

For those who are members of the single scheme, or the single public service pension scheme, their pensions, under section 40 of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012, are updated in line with the increases in the consumer price index.  For those whose service began predating 2013, their pensions are increased in line with pay increases, where necessary, to ensure that they are equal to the pensions being awarded to the same grade of retiring staff.</p></speech>

Is that correct?  It basically just gives the Minister a table showing what it would cost if a given payment was increased by &euro;1 or &euro;2 and so forth.  Has it ever brought the issue of need into it?  This fiver for everybody is a political decision.  It is not based on the needs of people, which is what the Department is supposed to respond to.  I am surprised that it has never presented a paper to its Minister showing where inflation is and what would be required to index payments to the rate of inflation or showing where wages are at and what would be required to index payments to that.  Is Mr. Lawler telling me that such an exercise has never been carried out by the Department of Social Protection?</p></speech>

For example, at the time budget 2022 was formulated, the rate of inflation forecast was just above 2%.  We take a range of research and indicators into account when looking at changes to schemes and changes to rates.  These include data and statistics on income and living conditions and the minimum essential standard of living research produced by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  That guides and informs us as to the areas to focus on with regard to changes to schemes from one year to the next.</p></speech>

It has always been a flat rate rather than being based on need or some reference point with regard to wages or increases in the cost of living.  Now that we know where we are at this point in time, with the rate of inflation higher than 5%, by how much would working-age payments have had to increase in last year's budget just to meet the rate of inflation in wider society?</p></speech>

I know that a number of witnesses have brought up this issue over recent weeks.  If you look backwards to see what the rate of inflation was over the previous 12 months in order to use that information to forecast increases in the social welfare rates for the following year - and I am talking about inflation in prices alone and not about earnings - you will see that the rate of inflation was actually negative.  However, the forecast at budget time was the rate would be just over 2%.  For a normal working-age payment of &euro;203, an additional 2% would have been worth &euro;4.  In the subsequent period, the rate of inflation has increased to 5% or 6%.  The last forecast I saw suggested it will average at 4% over the course of the year.  If you had that information about the next few months available to you at the time the rates increased, that 5% would have equated to &euro;10 while 4% would have equated to &euro;8 for those on a jobseeker's payment.  However, that information was not available last September and October.</p></speech>

Without those increases, given where we know the rate of inflation to be now, all of those households are going to become poorer this year.  An indexed increase would have been &euro;10 but &euro;5 was given.  The value of their payment is therefore &euro;250 less over a year.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

This was again informed by research on the minimum essential standard of living.  There were also changes to the fuel allowance and to means tests.  If he is just looking at the primary rate, the Deputy is correct but, if he looks at this issue in the round, it depends on the family type and the individual circumstances.</p></speech>

I would say Mr. Lawler would accept that.</p> <p>  Where is the Department's head, and that of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with regard to indexation?  We are always hearing Ministers saying that they are indexing but, here in the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, we are hearing that they are not or, if they are, they are indexing to something in their heads because they are not indexing to either past or forecast wages or inflation.  Where is the policy going?  Mr. Lawler said there was no policy at the time and that there is none now with regard to indexation.  Is a policy being developed?  Is there a plan to develop one?  Are we going to be looking at indexation?  People have been saying that the rate of inflation may reduce and come back under 2% in the coming years or possibly even next year.  However, those increases have already been baked in.  Unless there is a negative rate of inflation, those increases are baked into the system.  Those costs are recurring.  Will Mr. Lawler give us an outline of the thinking within the Department with regard to indexation?</p></speech>

Obviously, I am not arguing against that; I support the increase in the pension, which Sinn F&eacute;in has called for.  However, to do that as a priority in light of the fact that those who are more at risk of poverty are actually in the other categories does not make any sense to me.</p></speech>

The result of that seems to have been that, as the Deputy stated, when one looks at statistics on income and living conditions, such as those in the context of the minimum essential standards of living, for example, pensioner rates of poverty tend to be lower, on average, than other groups in society.  The first thing that shows is that some level of indexation or benchmarking, even if it is informal rather than formal, seems to work in maintaining living standards.  If one looks internationally, the focus has been on pensions.  We have a commitment to look at a benchmarking and indexation approach for working-age payments.  That is in the roadmap for social inclusion and it is what we will be doing in the coming period.</p></speech>

We have been looking at benchmarking and indexation for many decades.  We now have a policy position in respect of pensions, as well as a recommendation from the pensions commission.  Working-age payment rates are far more complex.  As I stated, there are various rates of payment.  There are different groups of people in different circumstances, such as jobseekers, people with disabilities and lone parents.  Some of those payments are on different payment rates.  Several factors that need to be considered in the context of working-age payments are not as relevant when it comes to pensions.  We will start the process this year.  I do not have a conclusion date for the reasons I have outlined.  We have other commitments to examine in respect of working-age payments, such as pay-related benefit and the concept of a working-age payment which would, if implemented, change the structure of the social welfare system.</p></speech>

When Sinn F&eacute;in puts forward its alternative budget, we look at those closest to the risk of poverty.  It is not a case of &euro;5 or &euro;10 for everybody.  Lone parents are further from where they need to be.  Those with disabilities have an additional cost.  Does the Department not see that?  I know it is complex, but there is evidence that there has to be a little bit of additional support for certain cohorts of individuals.</p></speech>

If one looks at the decisions that have been made in recent years, there has been a rate increase but there are also other measures.  For example, we have increased the earnings disregard on the one-parent family payment in recent years.  We have introduced a new structure to qualified child payments, informed by the minimum essential standard of living, and increased qualified child payments more significantly for over-12s.  There have been changes to ancillary payments such as the fuel allowance.  There have been changes to the living alone allowance.  Even in the context of pensioners or people with disabilities, if they live alone, they are more at risk of poverty.  There have been many targeted increases on top of the simple rate increase.  That is where we look at the issues the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

Is it standard across Europe that pensions should be 34% of average earnings?  It is not a lot.  He stated that average earnings are &euro;44,000 at the moment.  It is not really a lot.  What is the particular rationale for that figure?  Is it just tradition?  Where does it come from?  Is there any variation across Europe in that benchmark of pensions being 34% of average earnings?  In other words, is it more or less, in general, in other countries?  Does Mr. Lawler have any sense of those comparisons?</p> <p>  On the issue of other payments, as other Deputies have noted, much of this discussion is focused on pensions and the possible indexing of pensions against inflation or wages, or a combination of the two, or other indexes, but not other payments.  If I heard Mr. Lawler correctly, he stated it is more complicated in those areas.  Is it done elsewhere?  I am not sure why he would say it is more complicated.  I take the point that there are many different types of payments, but all these welfare or pension payments are quite low and people who are on them are pretty much at the lowest levels of income possible.  I am not sure why there would be a rationale for not indexing all social welfare payments in some shape or form to ensure they retain some value or do not fall behind inflation or that a gap between those payments and average wages is not widened.  I am curious to know whether this is done internationally.  Why are we not looking at all of these payments to ensure they are indexed?  Obviously, this is a live issue, given the current inflation rates.  Certainly the &euro;5 flat rate increase introduced in the budget seems very inadequate in the face of the level of inflation and the rising cost of living we are seeing at the moment for all recipients of pensions and social welfare payments, so we need to do something to make sure these payments do not fall behind racing levels of inflation if they occur. </p> <p>  I understand the difficulty.  If it is pinned to wages and inflation is racing ahead of wages, there is a problem.  If it is pinned to inflation but not to wages, the gap between average wages and pension or social welfare payments potentially widens if wages increase ahead of inflation.</p><p>It seems some combination of both those elements would probably be the best, although I am interested in hearing an opinion on that.  I cannot see it being more complicated.  I would imagine it would be best to have all those options available to us and then have some sort of hybrid that would still be flexible enough to take into account changing circumstances.  There would be a minimum level of indexation but also discretion to deal with unusual circumstances or particularly marked changes that may leave the basic method of benchmarking inadequate in dealing with problems emerging either in terms of inflation, the cost of living or increasing gaps between social welfare and pension payments and earnings in society.  Those are my thoughts and questions.</p></speech>

He spoke about some kind of a mix between earnings and prices, with some kind of oversight for times when something unusual is happening.  That is the proposal endorsed by the Pensions Commission for State pensions.  It is exactly the mechanism described by the Deputy.  One cannot choose a benchmark that exists forever without some kind of review of effectiveness.  That is what is proposed for pensions.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that he does not see why there could not be a rationale for not indexing all social welfare payments.  He could be absolutely right and it is something we must analyse in order to see how such a system would work.  Would it be exactly the same as what is being proposed?  We do not know.  Would it be some kind of other indexation?  We do not know.  Where would the benchmark level be set?  Would the benchmark be the same for all social welfare payments or would disability payments be different from jobseeker payments, for example?</p> <p>  When we speak about complexity, it relates to the range of payments and circumstances that people are in and what they need.  There is also the fact that there are already different levels of payment for different circumstances across the system.  That is what I mean by complexity, and it will require thought.  Generally, across the system in Europe and beyond, the focus to a large extent in most countries is on pensions, and probably for the reasons I have just described relating to complexity when dealing with working age payments.  We will start to look at it this year.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked where the 34% figure came from.  This has a long history dating right back to the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986, for example.  It set a kind of nominal rate, although I cannot remember if it was &pound;50 or &pound;60 at the time.  The Pensions Board looked at it in 1998 in the context pensions and converted it to a percentage of earnings at the time.  Pension rates have largely tracked that benchmark over those years and subsequently.  As I mentioned to Deputy Pearse Doherty, if we consider poverty levels among older people on a general basis, they are lower than for other groups in society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jasmina Behan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022021600002#F00500"><p>I echo the comments of my colleagues from the Department of Social Protection.  The 34% figure has a long history, with the ESRI first calculating that the rate should range between 24% to 34% of the gross average industrial earnings.  That view was also endorsed by the national pensions policy initiative in 1998.  The benchmarking and indexation group in 2001 was divided on the view but a majority indicated a figure of 27% of gross average industrial earnings, with a minority favouring a 30% figure.  The national pensions review board continued to recommend the social welfare and pensions figure of 34% of gross average industrial earnings.  The roadmap for pensions reform 2018-2023 also put that forward.  The 34% figure is the benchmark at which the rate is initially set but once it is locked, it is about the movement, as it is linked with earnings as always being 34%.  It matters at the start what is the figure but it just moves together.  The key issue is that once the rate is set, we are basically ensuring if we go with the parameter that the pension moves at the same pace as wages.</p> <p>  To echo previous comments, the complexity in looking at all welfare payments arises because there is a multiplicity of payments.  The first question is whether all or some payments will be considered; if only some are to be considered, we need to figure out how the process interacts with the rest of the payments.  Another question is what parameter is to be used, and whether it is to be prices, wages, a double lock or other approaches.  There is a cost implication of various options that must also be considered.  There is also the consideration of how these changes in policy will affect the labour market, incentives to work, replacement rates and so on.  There is much complexity that must be considered when looking at indexation and benchmarking of all welfare payments.</p></speech>

Most countries that have some kind of indexation maintain a kind of escape clause.  We can look at what happened with wages over the past two years.  As a result of compositional movements and low earners falling out of work, the average wage was increased and we got anomalous very high wage growth.  That happened in the UK, which has a triple lock, and there was wage growth of 8%; despite the lock, it was just not possible to deliver on that.  One must maintain some kind of flexibility or escape clause to deal with those kinds of anomalous positions.</p></speech>

In the options made available to the Government now or which could be made available to the committee, Governments or anybody considering the matter coming up to a budget, how easy would it be to set out what the different options for indexation would deliver in advance of a budget?  That would leave a range of options.  Is this done elsewhere?  In other words, we would know that if wages were benchmarked in a certain way, there would be a certain outcome in the budget.  The benchmark could be against inflation or there could be a hybrid approach.  This would allow us to consider options and modelled examples.</p><p>It is a bit hard to envisage this over a long period because there are so many variables, including wages, anomalies or inflation surges.  It is about having different options for indexation, while having indexation of some sort written into the process.  I hope I am explaining my question correctly.  </p></speech>

It depends on the model one is using.  It would be straightforward to project increases in social welfare payments based on indices you have at the time, such as projected inflation or earnings for the following year.  That is a percentage, so you apply that percentage increase to the rate and come up with a number.  If the inflation forecast at budget time turned out to be what it was, which was around 2%, that would translate to an increase of around &euro;4 on the &euro;203 rate of payment or a &euro;5 increase on the pension.  That can be done.  When you are looking at things like the smoothed earnings approach or some kind of combination, it is a little more complex than that.</p></speech>

The challenge is around agreeing on the parameters for the model and considering what those would be.  For instance, even a simple thing like looking at inflation could vary depending on whether we measure over three months or year-on-year for a year, particularly at a time like this when there is an unusual type of behaviour.  That is why, as I said, to consider the policy we need to really examine how all the parameters we want to include in the model are designed in a way that is appropriate.  Those things are difficult but once we agree on the parameters the mathematics are not difficult to do.</p></speech>

This may be a question for the Department of Finance.  Does automatic indexation, even if it was something we could pause or set aside at points, help more generally with budgetary forecasting?  I am thinking in particular of the kind of budgetary forecasting in reference to demographic planning and so on.  Is it useful as a tool in that sense?</p></speech>

Ultimately all our budgetary forecasting, to some degree, comes down to future projections.  Whether we have indexation or not, we are able to calculate the cost but it is all dependent on the projections for growth, wages, etc.  I do not think that it necessarily helps in the accuracy of the budgetary forecasting because we can say what we will have or what we will not have, depending on whether we index, but there is still a bound of uncertainty over both answers because they are both running off the same underlying projection of what growth or wage growth is.</p></speech>

It remains to be seen how it would pan out in practice, to be honest.  Coming up to a budget, if there was automatic indexation, it could eat up all of the available fiscal space.  Previous contributors have spoken about indexing to prices or wages being fiscally neutral.  In theory, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, all other things being equal, that is the case.  However, for instance, it is perfectly imaginable that there could be a rate of inflation in another expenditure component that is above prices.  For example, health inflation can run quite high.  You might need greater flexibility or resources to allow for expenditure in other components that means that when the Government gets to budget day it will still be faced with a trade-off where if there is automatic indexation it will not be able to deliver on existing levels of services of health.  In theory, yes, it does give more certainty that you know what is going to happen on budget day but it is hard to see that you would not need to maintain some degree of flexibility for what you know will be the case.</p></speech>

One reason I ask this, and maybe it is a nebulous question, is that Mr. Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies was at the committee last week.  Much of the session was spent talking about when and how it was set aside and how indexation had not constrained the British Government particularly because it was quite quick to break the bounds of indexation when it felt it needed to.  It has had it since the 1970s, I think.  However, I was surprised that when asked at the end of the session if it had had an impact generally on budgetary operations, forecasting and the general operation of budgets, Mr. Johnson was very positively inclined to say that it had.  Even though it has been set aside, it had set a kind of baseline whereby everyone understood what the parameters of operation were.</p></speech>

Therefore it resulted in an unusual increase in earnings.  If you were to use the earnings figure at the time, there would have been an increase of about &euro;10.50 in the State pension which would have cost about &euro;132 million extra on top of the budget change of &euro;5 that was made.</p></speech>

I do not know if the next question is for the Department of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform or Social Protection.  If we had a smoothed earnings approach, is that something the Departments could implement themselves or would they need some sort of oversight body to engage with that process?</p></speech>

The advantage to such a body is that it would do the calculation and work out what the benchmark or price increase would result in for the following year.  It can also take other factors into account, such as the effectiveness of the benchmark to date, the impact on poverty and any particular economic circumstances that mean we should do something this year, and then make a recommendation to the Government.  It would be along the lines of the Low Pay Commission approach.  It removes the question a distance from the annual, political approach to the increase that we have at the moment.  It would do the calculation and make a recommendation to the Government.  If it was departing from the answer, it would give the reasons or the rationale for that.</p></speech>

That can be an automatic process.  The calculation is relatively straightforward once the parameters are agreed by the Government.  However, the issue arises when what the model produces as an indexation or the smooth earnings result.  If we are in those unforeseen circumstances, what happens then?  Some discretion is needed for those situations.  How that is handled is what is being proposed at the moment.  One of the recommendations of the Commission on Pensions is that there is an oversight body.  However, as I said in my opening statement, one also needs to consider whether that is adding an additional layer of administration and how costly it would be.</p></speech>

I am thinking, in particular, of the issue of prospective or retrospective modelling, whether that is prices or wages.  Do we currently gather enough data within our system to have a robust calculation of that?  Do we believe we do?  As a committee, we get lots of reports from all of the Departments.  It seems that a huge amount of data is collected, but is it the right type of data and do we have enough data to make those forecasts or models from previous quarters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jasmina Behan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022021600002#H00300"><p>I will respond and perhaps refer to my colleagues from the Department of Finance, who do modelling and forecasting, to speak to that.  On the question of whether to backcast or forecast, both approaches have errors.  The historical data are usually used as a predictor, so they are typically part of the forecasting anyway.  It is also about the fact that if we forecast and use that to calculate the rate, if the forecast proves to be wrong and there is a correction to the individual in terms of their payment, that impacts on the uncertainty.  It increases an uncertainty which, I suppose, the indexation benchmark is probably trying to remove.  In terms of whether we do, perhaps my colleagues from the Department of Finance might talk about their forecasting.</p></speech>

The forecast will almost certainly be wrong, because that is the nature of a forecast.  We cannot predict the future.  That is just one of the trade-offs that one has to live with if one decides to have the indexing based on projections.  That can go either way.  It could be that the indexation increase is larger than inflation turns out to be.  That may cause a problem for the next year.  Previous speakers have talked about how some kind of tightening can be introduced the next year to make up for it.  There may be a political economy element to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022021600002#H00500"><p>Yes, it may be politically difficult.</p></speech>

The inflation stuff is easier.  As I said, it will definitely still be wrong, but we have a clear harmonised index of consumer prices or consumer price index.  We have a clearer metric.  The wages are more complicated because there are more possible metrics that could be used.  Our own projections for wages tend to be from the very top down, because where we use wage projections is to feed into our macroeconomic forecasts.  We are looking at the aggregate level.  We use something called compensation of employees.  That is basically like the pay bill.  It has numbers in it.  The number of people at work drives that as well.  That is perhaps not as suitable for trying to maintain parity with wages.</p> <p>  Average weekly earnings is used for the benchmark.  Average weekly earnings also has data on hours in it, then there are average hourly earnings, and for the average wage, there is full-time and part-time data.  The data are there, but the wages one is more complex.</p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, the wages one is a very timely indicator of the problems that one can have with what are seemingly reliable data.  For example, because of the compositional issue that it tended to be lower earners who moved out of employment in 2020, and because those lower earners moved out of employment, the average wage went up.  Then there was an increase of something like 19% in average compensation of employees in 2020.  It then has to work out the following years when those workers come back in.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, data can still give one problems and things to deal with.  In the Irish case it is probably less of an issue in this area, but there can be revisions to the data.  Even when one is using historical data, there can be revisions to data.  The historical data versus the projection gives one that trade-off whereby perhaps one is indexing to the historical data last year or the year before when we would have perhaps had negative prices, and then there is a sudden change and there are very high prices this year.  There is no silver bullet or simple choice on it.  A trade-off is being made between different options.</p></speech>

I do not mean to put the witnesses in a difficult position, but I want to touch on the issue of whether the indexation should be statutory or in legislation, and the potential advantages and disadvantages of that.  I am working on the assumption that there would be get-out or set-aside clauses in it.  I am not talking about legislation that could in any way be constrained by that.  It is perhaps a larger issue than just this piece on indexation.  Obviously, we have talked about well-being budgets in here, which is policy and not statutory.  We can see that in other areas of the EU and, for example, in the UK, there is a Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act.  I am wondering if it is fair to ask the question.  From the various Departments' points of view, is there a difference in the implementation of something that is statutory and something that is not?</p></speech>

It would seem to me that if one puts arrangements in legislation, it is very rigid.  Before one would go down that path, one would probably need to think carefully through all the other elements of the arrangement and make sure that one has it as good as one can get it before one puts it into legislation.  That would suggest to me that perhaps, as a starting position, if one was going down this route, one might go with the non-statutory guidelines approach and suck it and see, as it were, for a period before moving to a statutory set of arrangements, which, as I said, tend to be a little bit more rigid.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Cullen does not want to commit to an answer.</p></speech>

It is possible, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to change legislation, but in practice it can be a cumbersome process, as compared with changing a set of guidelines that are non-statutory.  There is no overriding set of principles that state it should be one or the other.</p></speech>

One of the issues that was touched on in the last session with Mr. Johnson, which we had not touched on in the two previous sessions, was the issue of regulated prices.</p><p>In the UK, obviously student loans account for a large proportion of that.

I was interested that she brought up the HICP.  There was a new recommendation, I believe it was in November last year, around including house prices.  It currently includes rent and the recommendation was that it would also include the cost of home ownership.  I have formed what is perhaps an incorrect opinion over the past three sessions that a lot of the early generation of indexation started off linking it to prices, and the current thinking is that it may be more robust when linked to wages.  Given that we are experiencing huge levels of inflation with rental costs and house prices, is the HICP of particular interest?  Given Ireland's housing crisis, is the HICP a fair reflection of what is happening within our own system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jasmina Behan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022021600002#J00600"><p>I will ask a colleague from the Department of Finance to come in on the HICP piece, but I will try to answer it first.  As I mentioned in the opening statement, we moved towards the HICP and away from the CPI.  It is more in line with the EU comparison, so there is that international aspect to it.  It has always been the case that individual countries' circumstances may not fit neatly into the measurement.  There is an even greater complexity around what is measured in each case and what is appropriate to use for indexation of pensions, such as baskets of goods and so on.  The view that the HICP may be more appropriate for pensions because it excludes certain elements and might better reflect the basket of goods is one aspect to using that parameter, but other parameters can be used as well.  With regard to including house ownership, again the consideration is about who the indexation is trying to protect.  For some individuals who do not own, it might be appropriate to use a different parameter, and maybe the HICP is more appropriate.  There are pros and cons in using different indices to grow the inflation.  Perhaps my colleague Mr. McGann would have greater insight into the HICP.</p></speech>

We do not have the ability to change it.  It is required for our economic and monetary union participation and Ireland would not have the ability to move that ourselves.  The main difference that I can remember, off the top my head, was the exclusion of mortgage interest payments from HICP.  I cannot remember much more detail on that but we could provide a note to the committee on the differences between the HICP and the CPI if that would be useful.</p></speech>

I am interested because that change is being recommended.  It seems that their modelling of house prices is based on rent, which is difficult in itself.  I thank the witnesses for that and any clarity on it would be useful.  I will now bring in Deputy Ryan who has been waiting very patiently.</p></speech>

At the moment the current focus is on State pensions and the smoothed earnings approach, as the Deputy mentioned.  There is a commitment in the roadmap for social inclusion to examine a benchmarking and indexation approach for other payments such as working age payments.  As we discussed earlier, this brings in an added layer of complexity.  For example, people are in different circumstances.  Lone parents may have different needs from those of people with disabilities, who also may have different needs from those of jobseekers.  There are different rates of payment across the social welfare system for different contingencies.  All of that would have to be taken into account.  Where would the benchmark be set?  Would it be a percentage of earnings or would it be something else?  How would it be indexed?  Would everybody be indexed in the same way?  There is a commitment to look at it and we will start looking at it this year.  It does bring in an added layer of complexity, but we will examine it.</p></speech>

I tried to earwig on some of the contributions.</p> <p>  One of the things that struck me, and perhaps will have struck a lot of people, is the range of commissions, initiatives, groups, reviews, reforms and frameworks that have been put in place over the past 30 years, and even the raft of things that have happened in the last number of years.  Some people are terribly well provided for, as the finance officials will know.  There are even some semi-State public employees, and I can think of one company in particular, who are regarded as having the Rolls-Royce of pensions.  Curiously, that group is making representations to some politicians at the moment about indexation of pensions.</p> <p>  The witnesses may already have covered my question, and if so I ask that they would please forgive my ignorance about it.  Because of inflation in the last little while, and due to Covid dampening down so much consumer activity, I have been receiving representations from constituents around issues such as the home adaptation grant, and finding that the amounts available for them have not kept pace with the increased costs of construction.  Indexation does not just apply to pensions.  It clearly comes into stark relief at particular times. </p> <p>  I have previously raised the theme of future-proofing budgets in the Oireachtas Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  In the last two years we have begun to equality-proof budgets, so we should also embark on future-proofing budgets, if such a thing is possible, to ensure that spending now does not involve creating an increased burden on generations to come.  In the context of indexation, could any of the witnesses speak to that?  If we were to future-proof things, where do they see this given the demographics?  We hear about the ratio of pensioners to those who are actively involved in participating in the labour market.  This ratio will narrow in the coming years and more people will be dependent.  Clearly, indexation has implications for that.  Perhaps some of the witnesses could speak to that piece, if it has not already been covered.  It has been covered, I will get it back in the transcript.</p></speech>

I will start, and my colleagues might want to contribute afterwards.  With regard to indexation and benchmarking, the idea is to preserve the real value for people in receipt of the State contributory pension and benchmark against earnings in order to ensure that the rates for pensioners keep pace with the growth in earnings and the real value.</p> <p>  On sustainability for future generations and the impact of demographic changes, the issue has been considered by the Commission on Pensions, which examines a wide range of issues of relevance.  These issues include the State pension age, the sustainability of the funding for pensions, and the indexation of rates to preserve the value and keep the pace.  These are just some of the issues that were considered by the commission.  The Government is considering the recommendations through the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment and has referred the questions on sustainability - or meeting funding demands associated with an ageing population and demographic change - and the parameters we might need to put in place to fund that expenditure to the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  All the deliberations will be presented as a proposal to the Government, to be decided on by the end of March.  Many of the issues are being considered at present.</p></speech>

Previously, colleagues from the ESRI and the Nevin Economic Research Institute pointed out that indexing to wages is fiscally neutral in that the tax&ndash;GDP or expenditure&ndash;GDP ratio stays the same.  However, that is based on all other things being equal in the abstract and there being no other emerging pressures.  In fact, we know we have many other emerging pressures, including in respect of how Covid will play out, the structural shifts in the economy, what those shifts will mean and how Brexit will fully play out.  We do not know how these will play out.  We know we will have to put considerable sums aside to fund the green and digital transitions.  We will probably have increased health expenditure as a result of Covid.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, there are demographic changes coming.  These are among the better-known knowns.  We do not yet have a good handle on some of the factors, such as the digital transition, but we do on the ageing population and demographic pressures.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, going from having four people at work for every pensioner to two will place an unsustainable demand on the system as it stands.  Indexation to wages is fiscally neutral in the abstract but, as others have pointed out, there is an argument in favour of maintaining some flexibility because there are many other pressures coming down the line that will eat into our available resources.  I am trying not to use the phrase "fiscal space".</p></speech>

On the other hand, we hear that the population is going to rise to 6 million by 2050.  This suggests that there will be many births and much immigration, probably for labour reasons.  Is it innocent of me to ask whether the figures can be substantiated?</p> <p>  On the unknowns, as the delegates were talking, I was thinking about a move to the cost-rental model, for example.  Under this model, people might be in a position for the first time in Ireland to rent for the long term or for life.  In theory, they should have more disposable income because they will not be facing the cost of a mortgage, although we know that in some parts of Dublin the cost of a mortgage is half the cost of rent at the moment.  However, I am assuming they would have more disposable income.  Under the Vienna model and other such models, these people's rent obligations would taper off on retirement.  It would be built in that there would be a tapering-off when their income dropped and they were in receipt of the State pension.  Are considerations like these being factored in?  These are general questions.  I am not pinning them on the delegates because I would imagine they have answered more detailed ones already.  I am just doing a more general sweep.</p></speech>

The fertility rate is falling and people are living longer.  There is a compositional issue in that the proportion of the overall population working by comparison with the proportion not working is changing.  That has two effects.  First, it affects age-related expenditure because it goes up a lot more.  Second, it slows growth because a big input to growth is labour force growth.  This is lost when not as many people are coming in.  It has been a big driver of growth.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, a big unknown in this regard is migration.  Migration can feed into it.  That is difficult to forecast.  The Department published a paper on population ageing and the public finances last September.  We use EUROSTAT projections for the demographics, fertility rate, long-term growth rate in the economy, etc.  The increase in age-related expenditure will place a huge burden on the public finances.  I would be happy to send on the paper from last September, which goes into a lot of detail on all those aspects.</p></speech>

I do not mean any other kind of burden, such as a psychological burden.  What pension entitlements would many of the migrant workers who might have been here over the past 20 years have, or have taken home with them?  Are there any figures on that?</p> <p>  What percentage of those who reach retirement age continue to work?  It is a while since we have had a census but we might have a better picture this year.

I am not sure whether we have the data on migrants per se, but we will certainly be able to supply to the committee the data on people's effective retirement ages afterwards.  I do not have them to hand.</p><p>There was just one other point.  It comes back to the issue the Deputy raised on the sustainability of expenditure given the demographics.  The Department of Social Protection produces, as a legislative requirement, an actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund every five years.  That looks at projections decades ahead.  It looks, for instance, at various assumptions around migration, fertility, economic growth and mortality.  That will be published towards the end of the year.  That will give us another set of projections with more up-to-date data on the long-term impact of population ageing.</p></speech>

The census provides us with a lot of information, in terms of questions in variables that are there, that we need for modelling.  The issue is that the census is every five years and a lot of the data for modelling in terms of demographics we need every year.  Those are typically done as estimates using the labour force survey.  It would be great if we had a census every year but, of course, we cannot have it every year.  It is not so much what is in the census in terms of questions; it is that the census is every five years.  For us to do demographic modelling, that level of frequency causes issues and we have make estimates, as I said, using the labour force survey.</p></speech>

The former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, established the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  There was &euro;20 billion or &euro;22 billion in that when it came to the crash and it possibly softened the blow.  However, it is empty.  I believe in a rainy day fund and I believe in that future-proofing of public finances.  Is there a scenario in an ideal world where, if a prudent future-proofing approach was taken to issues, for example, corporation tax where we have been told for the past five or six years at the committee that we cannot rely on it and we should put aside surpluses from it, and we started managing that, that this would not become the crisis that we think it could become?  If we took a mature approach to this, will the State be well provided for in meeting the demands of pensions into the future or will it be challenging no matter what model we come up with?</p></speech>

The commission has offered a range of options of how that can be achieved looking at different elements that could contribute to that sustainability, which range from the PRSI changes, the pensions age and the concept of a permanent Exchequer contribution.  Those options of how the funding might be secured to ensure sustainability is there for the future of the pensions system are now under consideration by the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.</p></speech>

It was not with the intention of necessarily funding future pension liabilities, as the NPRF was.  It is more as a stabilisation function for potential future crashes or unusual events.</p> <p>  In terms of the corporation tax receipts, the Department has consistently said that we need to be careful about what we do with what are potentially windfall receipts and allow them to feed into the expenditure base.  We had an unhappy experience in the 2000s when we allowed taxes that were not structurally permanent to feed into the expenditure base.</p></speech>

When that fund is in surplus, State pension contributory payments are made from that surplus, and when it is not in surplus or when it is in deficit, it is subvented by the Exchequer.  For the vast majority of its life, in fact, it has been in deficit.  We have had periods where we have built up fairly large surpluses of more than &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion, but when we hit an economic crash such as we had or have the experience of Covid, it can be exhausted very quickly.  That is how it operates.</p></speech>

As members may recall, I attended a meeting of the committee a few weeks ago in December as part of the nomination process for my appointment as Ombudsman.  At that time, I spoke of my intention to use the power vested in me as Ombudsman in a targeted and effective manner with a view to ensuring that the voices of those who are more vulnerable in our society, who might otherwise be missed, are heard and responded to.  I also outlined my commitment to continuing to shine a spotlight on the issue of access to transport supports for people living with a disability.  This is an issue which has been of ongoing concern to the Office of the Ombudsman for many years, and which was championed by my predecessors in this office, both Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly and Mr. Peter Tyndall.  Therefore, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to be here with my colleague, Ms Sarah Cooney, to discuss the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  It is good to be here in person on this occasion.<br/><br/>I will start by recalling our commitments as a country in respect of access to personal transport supports.  In 2017, Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which commits all signatories to promoting, protecting and ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  Persons with disabilities, as defined in the convention, include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments, which in their interactions with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.  Lack of access to transport is one of the key barriers stopping the realisation of these fundamental rights and can lead to the economic, social and personal isolation of people living with a disability.  By contrast, access to transport for many people can be an extremely important equaliser and enabler, providing independence, and can change the lives of people living with a disability in a positive way.<br/><br/>It is within this context that in November 2021, my predecessor, Mr. Peter Tyndall, published a report entitled &ldquo;Grounded: unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes&rdquo;.  This report was the culmination of a number of investigations over a number of years into the following transport schemes: the motorised transport grant; the mobility allowance; and the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  It is the latter scheme that the committee has invited me here today to discuss, but I wish to briefly mention the other schemes.  The motorised transport grant was put in place in 1979 and the mobility allowance was put in place as far back as 1968.  They were operated by the Health Service Executive and its predecessors, to support people living with a disability to access personal transport.  The motorised transport grant was a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The mobility allowance was a payment to people living with a disability who are unable to walk or use public transport and who would benefit from being mobile by, for example, using the services of a taxi occasionally.<br/><br/>In 2012, my predecessor, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, published separate investigations into the motorised transport scheme and the mobility allowance scheme.  The investigation into the motorised transport scheme found that the manner in which the HSE interpreted the medical criteria for eligibility was unacceptably restrictive and contrary to the equal status legislation.  The investigation into the mobility allowance scheme found that this scheme was in breach of the Equal Status Act 2000 because it included an upper age limit.  In both cases the Department of Health and HSE accepted the recommendations of the investigations and committed to reviewing both schemes in light of their findings.  However, in 2013,<b></b>following these investigations, the then Government decided to close both schemes to new applicants.  At the time, this was announced as an interim measure and a replacement scheme was promised.  However, nearly nine years later, a replacement scheme is still awaited and has not been delivered.  I raise this matter in the context of our discussion today to highlight the length of time successive governments have been looking at this issue.</p><p>The closure of these schemes is also significant for our discussion today as without such schemes in place since 2013, the disabled drivers and passengers scheme has taken on more significance for people living with a disability because it is the only potential support available to them.</p><p> Before moving onto the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme itself, I want to deal briefly with access to public transport for people living with a disability.  I very much welcome all the work undertaken under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 designed to improve accessibility of public transport.  However, for some people living with a disability, public transport may not be the most appropriate or even a possible mode of daily transport.  For example, the inadequacy of access to some public transport facilities, such as the DART, is a matter of great concern to people with disabilities who endeavour to use the service.  Many journeys on public transport also require the use of other transport services, which means that any problem occurring with one of the services makes the whole journey impossible.  For example, if it is not possible to get to a train station or bus stop, then clearly such train or bus services are not accessible.  Therefore, while improving access to public transport is an important issue in its own right, I believe it is unreasonable to suggest that simply improving public transport can address the transport needs of all people with disabilities.  I am thinking particularly of people who live in rural areas, or of those who cannot get to bus stops or train stations.  In such circumstances, a car provides optimum, and often the only, mobility for many people living with a disability for whom it is the key to their quality of life.  However, often they may need to be supported to acquire or access their own personal transport whether that be through a vehicle adapted for them to drive themselves or utilise as a passenger.</p><p> While access to a car can be life changing for many people living with a disability, adapting a car can be very costly.  The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme provides a range of tax reliefs linked to the purchase and adaptation of vehicles by drivers and passengers with a disability.  They include reliefs in relation to VRT and VAT as well as exemptions from motor tax and tolls and refunds on duty paid on fuel.  In order to qualify for tax relief under the scheme, the person with a disability must have a primary medical certificate from the HSE.  A person must meet one of six medical criteria to be eligible for a primary medical certificate.  Since as far back as 2001 the Office of the Ombudsman has been receiving complaints about the excessively restrictive nature of these six criteria.  The medical criteria are that a person must: be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; or be wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; or be without both hands or without both arms; or be without one or both legs; or be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; or have the medical condition of "dwarfism" and serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  There is no doubt in my mind that these criteria are excessively restrictive.  It is clear that, the administration of this scheme, based on these restrictive criteria, has resulted in people who do not meet the criteria, but who are equally as immobile as those who do, being excluded from the scheme.  </p><p> The complaints my office receives are against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, DDMBA, an independent body set up on a statutory basis by the Department of Finance in 1990 to review applications from individuals who were unsuccessful in applying for the primary medical certificate at local HSE level.  Since 2016, 335 complaints have been received by my office against the appeal board.  My office investigated each of these complaints.  However, in most cases, we were unable to uphold the complaint against the appeal board as it had acted in accordance with the very restrictive legislation governing its activities.  However, my office clearly communicated our concern at the overly restrictive nature of the criteria by which the appeal board is bound to make a decision.</p><p>   In 2020 the Supreme Court quashed a refusal of the appeal board to grant primary medical certificates allowing the parents of two disabled children to avail of tax relief under this scheme and noted in its judgment that the problem was with the &ldquo;under inclusive nature&rdquo; of the regulations.  In essence, this meant that the HSE and appeal board could not continue with their work for a time.  The Government, in response to this judgment, introduced an amendment to the Finance Act 2020 to enshrine the existing very restrictive medical criteria in primary legislation.  This was most disappointing.  I believe a far more appropriate response would have been to revise the criteria for the scheme to take into account an individual&rsquo;s level of mobility.  I understand from officials in the Department of Finance that this was intended to be an interim measure.  However, past experience has shown that such interim measures often remain in place for far too long.  I have already cited one interim measure that has lasted for almost nine years.  I was very concerned about this and the negative impact that this has on the daily lives of people with disabilities and their families.  I note the recent resignation of the members of the appeal board and that their concerns mirror some of the concerns I have expressed here today.</p><p> It very worrying that each time a problem is identified with a scheme designed to assist people with disabilities, the response by Government has been to either discontinue the scheme without replacement, or in the case of the scheme we are discussing today, to enshrine the inequitable eligibility criteria in primary legislation.</p><p> I was pleased to see from the recent announcement in January 2022 by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that she intends to chair an interdepartmental group to examine the issues of accessible transport for persons with disabilities and to progress a review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme as a matter of priority.  However, what we need now is action.  We need to see real progress and a system of access to personal transport supports put in place that is fair and inclusive to all people living with a disability.  Another working group or action plan is not sufficient.  People who are adversely affected by this lack of access to transport need and deserve immediate and decisive action.  It is simply not acceptable that a person is confined to their home, unable to participate equally and actively in their community or at work because they are unable to access transport.</p><p> I can assure the Chair and members of the committee that I will continue to highlight this unfair and inequitable situation.  I would also ask this committee to continue to raise this issue with the Department of Finance, and across the Government, to ensure that action is taken as a priority to resolve this very serious and unfair situation.  </p><p> We thank the committee for the invitation to be here and for its time.  Ms Cooney and myself will be happy to deal with any questions or comments.</p></speech>

The Oireachtas spends a lot of time trying to think of methods by which we can encourage people out of the car onto public transport.  However, Mr. Deering is telling the committee that the most effective method of transport for people with disabilities appears to be the car.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If our public transport system was what we might want it to be then it might suit their needs.  For example, if I needed a ramp at a particular DART station today, I would have to know what time I was leaving Leinster House and book it in advance, or the problem could be the last mile I had to travel.  It might not seem much to somebody that a person's house is a mile from a train station or in a rural area, or that it is ten miles from a train station.  It is the last link that is the difficulty.  Until we have fully accessible public transport, and we are quite a distance from that, then people need personal assistance to manage their own affairs and be able to travel in a manner that is accessible to them and at a time that suits them too.</p></speech>

Another issue that has arisen is where we see that sometimes people insensitively put out things like sandwich boards, signs or other things in the way of people.  People do not think and they need to think more carefully, whether that is personally or on the part of officials or people working in those areas.  They always need to think of universal access and design.</p></speech>

The application is a tick-box exercise so one either ticks one of those boxes or not.  However, a significant number of people are equally immobile but do not tick those boxes.

We have a strange situation where almost everybody is agreed that the conditions are too restrictive.  What we ended up doing is enshrining those restrictive conditions in legislation.  We often criticise what happened in the past but as far back as 1968 there was a better scheme and the next scheme came in during 1979.  Those schemes were better.  There were flaws in them but they were simple flaws.  They were important flaws but it would have been easy to resolve them.  One of them excluded people over a certain age so all they had to do to rectify that was include those people.  Instead they withdrew the scheme.  There is now a double inequity in that some people who are on those schemes rightly continue to benefit from them but they were closed to any new applicants.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Deering to the committee for the first time in his official capacity and I welcome Ms Cooney as well.  It is fitting that Mr. Deering is picking up where his predecessor left off and one of his last official duties was that report, which makes for difficult reading.  Peter Tyndall published Grounded in November 2021 and one line that stuck out for me in it was: &ldquo;Living with a disability in Ireland in 2021 should never mean that a person is grounded in their home&rdquo;.  Unfortunately that is where far too many people are.  Unfortunately, as he was preparing to publish that report we found out that the whole Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal had resigned <i>en masse</i>, something that has not been seen in this State.  They did so after they repeatedly raised concerns with the Minister.  I have said before at this committee that I am deeply disturbed by what has happened with that scheme, why those concerns were not listened to, why we have no board of appeal and why individuals felt they were forced into this type of action.  Listening to Mr. Deering&rsquo;s opening remarks and looking at Mr. Tyndall&rsquo;s extensive work on this, it is clear this is not the first time that concerns have been falling on deaf ears.  Mr. Deering&rsquo;s predecessor wrote to the Minister for Finance in December 2014 and again in June 2017.  He also wrote to the Secretary General in January 2020 and we are still not getting the changes.  Mr. Deering said there are questions and we will hopefully raise questions with the Minister for Finance on his inaction on this.  Mr. Deering said that the restrictive criteria for this scheme have resulted in people who do not meet the criteria but who are equally immobile to those who do being excluded from the scheme.  Would this amount to discrimination under the operation of the scheme?</p></speech>

Sometimes discrimination can be justifiable if it is being said that a person has other means or reasons if there is a means test, for example.  However, it is unreasonable discrimination in that if two people have the same need and the same level of disability for a different reason, it seems reasonable that they should be treated the same.</p></speech>

I referenced direct communications with the Minister and the Department but it has been in every report published by the Ombudsman since Emily O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s period in office.  Why has all of that fallen on deaf ears?</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that we have an interdepartmental group but my experience is that if one Department takes responsibility to deliver something there is a much better chance of it being delivered.  When something involves a number of Departments it gets way too complex.  The scheme we are talking about today might have a level of complexity within it but some of the other schemes were simple.  They were administered locally and they were relatively successful, albeit there were problems with them but the problems with those schemes should have been solved.  It would have been far better if the interim solution had been to fix the schemes that were there, at least the problems this office saw in them, while a new scheme was being devised.  It was not reasonable to stop the schemes and stop anybody from applying for them while they were being perfected.  We might never have perfection but we can do an awful lot better.  Some of this has been made unnecessarily complex but it is not that complex.  Certain people have certain needs and those needs should be met.  We need to find the criteria and a fair, reasonable and equitable way of deciding who is entitled to these schemes but we are a long way from that.</p><p>I cannot give a definitive answer as to the reason for that.  It is surprising that something so fundamental and so important to people with disabilities in this era would be ongoing for nine years.  It is, to say the least, surprising and disappointing.</p></speech>

We had an announcement in January.  The story breaks that the appeal board has resigned, blaming the Minister for a lack of action, and that is followed by an announcement in regard to the establishment of an interdepartmental group to look at the issue of transport for people with disabilities, which will be chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  I am sometimes suspicious of these types of announcements but Mr. Deering has welcomed it.</p> <p>  At the time Mr. Deering's predecessor wrote to the Secretary General of the Department, the matter was before a special Cabinet committee.  It is not possible to have it dealt with any higher than a special Cabinet committee.  That was over two years ago and nothing happened.  Four years ago, a memo was brought to Cabinet in regard to a scheme and it was withdrawn.  Four years on, nothing has happened.  One would hope that something would come out of it now, but if past experience is anything to go by it does not appear there is any energy, speed or direction in regard to this.</p></speech>

We have to have hope.  We have to give the Minister the opportunity to deliver.  I mentioned in my opening statement that we can only judge the group by its actions and not further plans or statements.  It is urgently needed.  I have no reason to doubt the Minister's resolve or determination, but we will be only about to judge it by the actions.  I welcome that all of the players are at least sitting around the table.  That has to be of some benefit.</p></speech>

That is a crucial.  What came across very strongly from Mr. Deering's opening statement and his predecessor's report was that politicians cannot delay this any longer, that there needs to be speed and urgency.  As we speak, those mentioned in the report, including Tadhg, a young person in his 20s who has Down's syndrome, severe and profound autism and is non-verbal, needs this support yet he is not getting it.  He will not be approved for a primary medical certificate.  His issues were exasperated during the pandemic.  Going for a drive in the car helped him to relax and calm down but on one occasion he put his arms around the driver's neck forcing the car to come to a sudden halt.  That family needs this support to be able to adapt their car to Tadhg's needs.  The report also mentions Jack who states that just because he does not have limbs does not mean he is not disabled.  This person is in excruciating pain 24-7.  He uses a walking aid and a mobility scooter and has adapted the extension of his house to get around.  He cannot get support because he needs to have limbs yet he has the same issue as many who have limbs.</p> <p>  Has the Minister of State given Mr. Deering any indication of the timeframe within which a report with recommendations will be available.  I am conscious that the Minister of State does not sit at the Cabinet table.</p></speech>

Again, I would hope that it would be done quickly.  In regard to the case studies mentioned by the Deputy, our staff hear those stories on a daily basis.  We have had more than 300 complaints about these schemes and very little positive outcome for the people who complain to us because if the scheme does not permit them to benefit from it, there is nothing much we can do in that regard.  If people were hearing those stories first-hand and if they met these people maybe then they would understand the urgency.  Nine years is a very long time if you have no access to participate in life.  There is very considerable hardship being suffered by the individuals and their families.</p> <p>  At the time some of these schemes were closed to new applicants there were approximately 4,500 people in receipt of the benefit.  I note that 4,500 has reduced to 3,500, which means 1,000 people are no longer benefiting from the scheme.  There are people coming close to the end of their lives who need this scheme.  This all started because somebody over the age of 66 was not eligible to be in the scheme.  Where is the notion that one has to stop living and participating in society at 66 years of age?  There is a very real need.  When I met with this committee last December I made the point that we often look back and talk about the awful things that were done in the past.  I would be concerned that in the future people will look back and question how on our watch we allowed this to happen to people with a disability.  The time has come for action.  I do not, unfortunately, have a timescale in that regard.</p></speech>

Sometimes, the action is very small but it is life-changing for individuals.  In some cases, people are prisoners in their own homes, in particular those living in rural Ireland who do not have a car.  While this scheme provides VAT rebates and VRT rebates, the person still has to have the money to purchase the vehicle in the first instance.</p><p>Mr. Deering mentioned in his opening statement that many of the concerns raised by the appeal board, which resigned <i>en masse</i>, mirror some of the concerns he has expressed today.  Has he had any interaction with the former appeal board in regard to their concerns?  The Office of the Ombudsman has received hundreds of complaints in regard to this scheme.  As bad as things were previously - and we know things were not good - people had an option to appeal.  They no longer have an option to appeal.  The Minister was informed in October that the board was resigning <i>en masse.</i>Has the Ombudsman's office had any indication of when that board will be reinstated such that, as bad and as the restrictive the scheme is, there is a next step for families.</p></speech>

We would have had a lot of engagement with the chair of that board, who had mirrored our concerns around the restrictive nature of the eligibility criteria.  I do not want to speak for the board members but I think they were frustrated that they had to work within the confines of the legislation and, as I understand it, they had communicated that to the Department of Finance and others.  We would have had a constructive relationship with the board in the sense that we both understood that it was the restrictive nature of the eligibility criteria that was hampering this.  The board and others can speak for themselves.  There are many other countries and jurisdictions that would have different systems in place and different assessments of mobility.  They were the experts in the field.</p></speech>

It is great to see the work already kicking in.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and the Joint Committee on Climate Action, where this is also an area of concern.  A few of my questions are around the intersection of those areas.</p> <p>  Mr. Deering pointed to the distance that needs to be travelled in terms of public transport reform.  Part of that is that question of the last mile and the issue of storage options for transport for that last mile.  We need a really radical overhaul of our public transport system.  We need initiatives, such as "stop on request", that other countries have to address these issues.</p><p>I was also struck during the extensive discussion on electric vehicles by one other aspect of which there was no mention.  Many things have changed in these nine years since the motorised transport scheme was suspended and been in somewhat of a limbo.  One of those changes is this focus on electric vehicles.  It does not seem, however, that prioritising or supporting electrified vehicles, and those could be cars or other types of electrified vehicles for people with disabilities, has been a central part of this debate.  I would like to hear some comments on this point.</p><p> The other important thing that has happened in the last nine years is that Ireland has now ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Under the UNCRPD, it is very much the case that each individual has rights in respect of his or her needs.  I ask for a comment on whether this development also points towards the approach of the individual needs assessment which Mr. Deering has been suggesting as a new approach for the disabled drivers and passengers scheme.  Again, one of the aspects of the UNCRPD is that there cannot simply be blanket measures.  Each person is entitled to realise his or her rights.  </p><p> When people press for their rights and to improve things, it is sad that the reaction of the State is to shut things down or to go into retreat.  It is bad in respect of the context of public trust in their voice and ability to influence the system.  Therefore, it is concerning, and not only for the individuals affected.  For example, if people point to a legitimate gap in the system, the response is to roll back further.  In that regard, I ask Mr. Deering to comment on the suspension of the motorised transport scheme for nine years.  One aspect I am particularly interested in is inequality and inconsistency regarding age.  This is an issue across many of our systems for people with disabilities.  For example, we have problems in our social protection system whereby people at a certain point, namely, pension age, are just described as being "older".  In reality, their disability and related needs could then be made invisible by the system.  Does Mr. Deering believe that might have been one of the reasons, because it pointed to a wider flaw, for there having been a roll-back from addressing this issue?  I ask that because it is a clear issue.  Connected to that as well is the issue of employment.  There used to be an employment requirement, but I do not think it was often used in practice.  Should it be removed from any new scheme?  </p><p> Regarding the primary medical certificate backlog, which is an issue, we get letters every week about this matter at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  It is a major issue.  One suggestion made is that GP certification should be enough of an interim measure.  Should we, instead, be uncoupling the disabled drivers and passengers scheme from the primary medical certificate system, given the backlog and the flaws in it?  </p></speech>

What must happen is that there must be a new way of assessing people's mobility and a new certification method must be introduced.  On the backlog, it has been created, as the Senator knows, by the assessment board resigning, and, before that, by the hiatus in the context of the court.  The problem here is that even if that process were to get up and running again, most of the people applying would not qualify in any event for the scheme.  I am not sure that trying to fix that-----</p></speech>

I apologise that I was not clear.  What was I asking was should GP certification be used as an interim measure, given this situation with the primary medical certification?  My first question was on this exact point, concerning the replacement of this method with an individual assessment mechanism.  Would such an approach be more in line with the UNCRPD?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022021600002#E00400"><p>There should definitely be some kind  of individual mechanism.  We should not forget that the vast majority of these people, by virtue of finding themselves in this situation, will be interacting with the medical system, and probably at a very sophisticated level.  They will most likely be dealing with consultants and other people well capable of certifying their need in this respect.  Whether that could reach to the GP level is another matter.  An entirely different assessment system, however, is required to decide people's level of mobility.  There are systems and trusted measures of people's mobility that can be deployed more successfully than what we have now.</p> <p>  Moving to the point about linking to employment, it is fantastic that people can be in meaningful employment and have transport.  They need it for that context.  Transport, though, should not be linked to employment, because people are entitled to participate fully in society, whether that entails visiting relatives, working, volunteering or going for medical appointments.  The concept of there having to be almost some kind of economic benefit accruing from providing or assisting people with their mobility needs is an outdated one.</p> <p>  Turning to Senator Higgins's broader question on the human rights-based approach, the UNCRPD should, of course, look at the needs of the individual.  We operate on a human rights-based approach in our office in respect of examining how people have been dealt with by public bodies.  This is something we want to roll out more to public bodies.  In turn, then, we want to be asking them if they have considered particular issues in light of the UNCRPD and whether they took a human rights-based approach to how they dealt with an individual and made a decision.  I refer to this issue across the board and not just in the context of this scheme.  The question to be asked is if an individual and human rights-based approach is being taken.  I acknowledge that very often people in the public sector want or need rules surrounding everything.  Officials can sometimes experience disadvantage or negative comment when they apply their discretion, and perhaps apply it in a humane way.  Therefore, we must build into these schemes some level of discretion which officials can exercise when they are adhering to human rights-based principles and looking at individual's circumstances.</p> <p>  There is a little bit of competition or contention between the concept of looking at the individual and then designing some sort of universal scheme.  I have heard people use the expression that "we like to have the harp on something" to make things easier.  It is used to mean that people want something official and they want a document.  If we take this scheme, one of the reasons it does not work is that it involves ticking boxes.  That is no way to assess whether a person is mobile.  Therefore, I very much agree that we need to take a human rights-based approach and an individual-based one.  I acknowledge as well that there are challenges to be faced in doing that, but there are also methods by which people's mobility can be measured.</p> <p>  On the subject of electric cars, I agree.  I do not know why this topic has not featured in this discussion.  Sometimes I think the argument from an environmental point of view was made from the perspective that people should be using public transport.  If other methods of transport are available to people that complement the environment, however, then we should be encouraging them.  I am no expert on electric cars or cars and vehicles generally, but if the argument is that there are better vehicles than a standard petrol- or diesel-fuelled car, then that aspect can be taken into account in the context of any scheme and funding made available.</p></speech>

My other query concerned people being disqualified at a certain age from the scheme.  As I understand it, that was one of the key findings regarding where the motorised transport scheme was in conflict with the Equal Status Acts.  Again, the concern here is that this might be a wider issue in respect of the intersection of age and disability.  I gave the example regarding the social protection system, where people at a certain age are simply treated as being older and their disability needs are no longer recognised by the system.  I would welcome a comment from Mr. Deering on this point, if he has one.  I refer to what the response should have been when that conflict was identified and should wider consideration be given to other places where this is occurring.  Does Mr. Deering think that, instead, this context contributed to the retreat from addressing this problem?</p></speech>

I do not know, but I guess that it was not part of some bigger process at all.  I would say that somebody thought or felt that people aged over 66 do not need to go to work, to go places or to socialise.  I would like to think that we live in a different society now, where we accept that we facilitate people who want to participate in whatever part of society they want to participate in for as long as they want to do so.</p><p>I do not know but I have no evidence that it was part of a broader process of getting people of that age off certain schemes.  I believe, however, that somebody in their wisdom thought that people over a certain age did not need to participate in society, and I fundamentally disagree with that approach.</p></speech>

It is great to be here.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, so I do not normally attend the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  My colleague, Deputy Farrell, indicated that this issue was being discussed today.  It is also being discussed at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  Mr. Deering's predecessor, Mr. Peter Tyndall, was in with us - I believe it was one of his last days in office - to discuss this and the work he had done in his report, which was excellent.</p> <p>  It is alarming that the mobility allowance and the motorised grant scheme were abolished almost nine years ago.  There was something wrong with the scheme, as was highlighted in a previous report.  It was suggested to me by a Minister that it was being abused.  I do not know if that was the case or not but my feeling is that if there were issues around the scheme, they should have been sorted there and then.  At every meeting I go to with people with disabilities or their representative organisations, the issue of transport supports comes up.  The primary medical certificate criteria are far too stringent.  We know that.  Instead of the Minister for Finance dealing with that issue, he has amended a Finance Bill to slot in with the stringent criteria, which is terrible.  A review was promised a year ago, in 2021, but this still has not happened.</p> <p>  On Friday I shall accompany a person to a hearing for a primary medical certificate.  This is his third time to apply.  The person has all of his limbs but he does not have the use of all of the limbs.  Yet, he keeps being refused.  There is no way that he can use public transport because he does not have stability when he walks, and he will not be able to get onto a bus or whatever.  He needs personalised transport supports to help him get from A to B.   He had relied on his parents to do so but his mother has passed away, and his father had a severe illness and cannot do it anymore.  This is what we are seeing more and more.</p> <p>  We discussed this matter earlier in the D&aacute;il Chamber during a Private Members' motion put forward by the Regional Group.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, indicated it is under review as part of the national disability strategy but does the Ombudsman have any indication where that is or how long it will take before they put some of the schemes back in place or adjust them so that the primary medical certificate criteria will change?  Does Mr. Deering believe it is purely based on a financial reason rather than on need?  I am very conscious that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by Ireland four years ago.  We must implement it.  The optional protocol has not been ratified yet.  Is this one of the reasons?  This is not the only issue people with disabilities have to fight for.  They spend their lives fighting for the supports they need and they should not have to do that.  Is this a reason the optional protocol has not been ratified?  Does the Government know that people will take them to the EU over the issues such as the transport supports?</p></speech>

I suggested earlier that one of the reasons this has not been progressed is that it seems to be the responsibility of a number of Departments, and when that happens sometimes these things fall through.  I do not doubt the Minister's intent to resolve this, but as I said in my statement, and I will hold to it, we really need action.  People will not be able to wait for another action plan.  They must consult with the people with disabilities, but equally, those voices have been expressing themselves for a long time at this stage, as the Deputy said.  It needs a very quick consultation and a quick process but we do not have any indication as to when that will happen.  As to why the convention is not fully operational, we do not know the reason for that.  As we discussed earlier, people have individual rights.  They have these rights under the convention, but they have them in any event.  There just seems to be a lack of willingness for all of the actors to get together.  I appreciate that this is what the Minister is trying to do now, and we can only hope that it delivers.  We need it to be delivered quickly for those who need the service.</p></speech>

Again and again it has come up.  Mr. Deering mentioned in his introduction, what I would call inconsistencies, in the determination of whether a person qualified or not.  I could never understand it.  The reference to partly or wholly the loss of one or both arms.  What does that mean?  I could never understand what it meant, and nobody else could understand it either.  It was either one or the other.  The question that would arise was: if the two were gone, would that qualify?  The answer was not necessarily, but if one was gone maybe it would.  I know people who, unfortunately, were disqualified at least 30 years ago and have never qualified.  It becomes a question of rubber stamping after the appeal, and then a further appeal is just refused automatically.  It may be unfair to say that, but that is the way it was, and it is.</p> <p>  The late Mr. Martin Naughton did a lot of work for people with disabilities.  He and I had discussions that far back on this particular issue.  It is without doubt shameful that it took this long.  There is no reason in this wide earthly world one person who has a similar disability to another person, who is equally disabled, qualifies for the primary medical certificate and the other does not.  It is absolutely shameful as far as I am concerned.  I do not know whether it is a financial thing, but it sounds like a financial matter.  If it is a financial matter then it needs to be attended to on the basis that it is grossly unfair to the people who are the victims.  People with such difficulties have enough problems without further imposing more difficulty upon them.</p> <p>  Let us consider two people who have a disability, whatever that disability is.  They may not be identical.  One person might be quite upfront and anxious to take up a full place in the workplace, and be able to do that.  Another person with a similar disability may not.  They may have psychological problems or problems around confidence in their own ability, all of which must be taken into account.  It is time to put an end to the practice of disqualifying a person arbitrarily on the basis that he or she does not tick a box.  I will certainly bring this up at our parliamentary party meeting again, and hopefully as a result of the Ombudsman's deliberations and discussions, and his important intervention, it will be dealt with.  I hope so.</p> <p>  I thank members for attending and for taking a particular interest in this very important and sensitive subject.  I thank our guests or witnesses - I am not sure of the right term - for their fundamental contributions which hopefully will have the desired results.</p></speech>

The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service very much welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s deliberations on this important topic.</p> <p>  The disabled drivers and disabled passengers, DDDP, scheme operated by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners provides a range of supports towards the purchase and operation of specially constructed and adapted vehicles by disabled drivers and passengers, including tax relief on vehicle registration tax, VRT, and VAT, an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.  We flag that direct commentary on the logistics and tax implications of the scheme is not in the MABS area of expertise.  However, as an essential front-line service with a holistic approach to assisting clients with their immediate debt problems and supporting them to become financially independent in the long term, we can offer in-depth insight into the ways this scheme and related welfare supports work on the ground.  In addition, after 30 years of promoting financial inclusion for Ireland&rsquo;s most marginalised communities, MABS is in a unique position to comment on the ongoing challenges faced by persons with disabilities who access our services.  It is through this context that we position our statement and engagement with the committee today.</p> <p>  In preparation for the meeting, MABS support issued a comprehensive survey to all MABS staff and money advisers around the country, and consulted with our funder, the Citizens Information Board, CIB.  The CIB social policy team sent us collated data arising from transport and disability queries to local citizens information services, CIS, to which we also refer.</p> <p>  To start, we will list the five primary issues highlighted by local MABS services and-or CIS regarding the DDDP scheme as it currently operates.  We include examples of our clients&rsquo; lived experiences to illustrate these points.  The first issue relates to the medical criteria for the scheme.  The DDDP scheme is inaccessible for many due to the restrictive medical criteria for accessing the primary medical certificate, PMC, necessary for approval.  If an initial PMC application is rejected, an appeal may be lodged to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal.  To qualify, an applicant must satisfy at least one of six medical criteria that focus predominantly on physical disabilities, particularly a lack of limb function.  This criterion is exclusionary for persons with other disability types, including chronic illnesses, brain or neurological conditions, cardiovascular diseases and so on.  For example, a money adviser from north Dublin spoke of a client with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, who uses a wheelchair and is on oxygen.  She is unable to walk unaided or more than a few steps at once.  Her application for a PMC and subsequent appeal were denied as she was deemed to have use of her legs.</p><p> The second issue we wish to raise is the appeals process.  When operational, the primary medical certificate, PMC, appeals process requires persons to travel to Dublin for an in-person assessment.  This can often be extremely challenging, if not impossible, and costly for those clients who live far away.  A client in a local citizens information service, CIS, office lost her appeal after she was unable to travel the five-hour journey from her home to attend an assessment in Dublin.  The client lives alone and had no means of personal transport.</p><p> The third issue we want to flag is the scheme being exclusionary due to cost.  Even if their clients satisfy the physical requirements, money advisers highlighted the majority of their clients cannot access the scheme as they cannot afford the purchase of a vehicle, let alone maintenance, even with tax reliefs and rebates.  Many MABS clients with disabilities rely solely on social welfare payments to live, and face increased living costs already, in particular, for transport.  This was highlighted in the most recent report on the increased costs for persons living with disabilities in Ireland published in November last year by the Department of Social Protection.  A money adviser in Cork discussed how her clients who are wheelchair users must take taxis to medical appointments as public transport is unavailable and inaccessible.  While they can get their taxi fare reimbursed by the local community welfare office this could take up to two weeks to process.  In the interim, she has seen clients opt to go without food in order to cover these costs.</p><p> The fourth issue we want to raise is the inflexibility of the scheme.  Citizens information services identified how the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme can also be restrictive, for instance, when there is a sudden change of familial circumstances.  Family members of disabled passengers can be eligible for the scheme if they are living with, and responsible for, their transport, and own a vehicle for that reason.  However, problems arose for one CIS client with disabilities when her husband died.  He had been the driver of her specially adapted vehicle with the vehicle registration tax and VAT rebates attached.  The client&rsquo;s son-in-law was available to take over driving responsibilities but in this case the client had to explore transferring ownership of the vehicle to her son-in-law, which was not what she had wanted.</p><p> The fifth and final issue we raise is the scheme's applicability to replacing previous grants offered by the Government.  In 2013, the Government closed the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes to new applicants. The DDDP scheme, therefore, took on an increasing importance for people with disabilities.  However, the scheme, in its current guise, is not effective to provide relief to those who truly need it, in particular low-income persons.  MABS money advisers called for the return and-or replacement of the prior grants and the mobility allowance, in particular, arguing it contributed greatly to their clients&rsquo; overall health and well-being, easing financial burdens for transport and providing increased opportunities for participation and social engagement.  Since 2013, citizens information services have also repeatedly highlighted this issue and the Citizens Information Board raised this in successive pre-budget submissions.</p><p> It is important to draw connections between these points and underlying issues of financial inclusion faced by persons with disabilities.  Research from the European Disability Forum found that 38.1% of persons with disabilities in Ireland are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, a number that has grown since 2010 and is worryingly higher than the EU average of 28.7%.  MABS services work to help alleviate financial pressures for those who are struggling and we find that, particularly for clients with disabilities, there are a number of barriers to accessing available social welfare supports, including but not limited to the DDDP scheme.  This includes a lack of knowledge of rights and entitlements.  Most clients are not aware of what they are entitled to until they come to MABS and-or citizens Information services and that they have the right to appeal a decision to reject their applications for social welfare.  Also, clients with disabilities face increased difficulties with the required online applications due to digital exclusion, not owning or able to afford the necessary smart devices, lack of home broadband access, which is particularly the case in rural areas, and lower than average levels of digital literacy.</p><p> Persons with disabilities also face increased household expenses, for instance, people may have to keep warm when they are not mobile and-or they might be homebound and require continuous electricity, lighting and so on, and, therefore, are even more sensitive to rises in energy prices than the general population.  Lack of accessible public transport, in particular in rural areas, leads to the reliance on taxis and personal transport options that, for many, are simply too expensive.  Unfortunately, we would posit that challenges have exacerbated in recent months due to Covid-19 and the spike in the cost of living.  Individual actions from our clients in terms of budgeting and entitlement maximisation are becoming insufficient in the face of insurmountable structural barriers.</p><p> We would list a number of direct actions to support the increased financial inclusion of persons with disabilities and, in turn, importantly, combat exclusion. They include the following.  The extension of employment supports and awareness of supports to enable those with a disability to find meaningful employment if they so choose.  This involves allowing retention of the medical card solely for medical need if working and regardless of income level.  There is a need to provide a savings incentive scheme for all on social welfare, including those with disabilities; to support the training of front-line staff to assist those with disabilities with specialised needs, including post offices, banks, credit unions and public services; to enhance educational and financial literacy incentives, for example, fully funded third level courses with extra supports that have occupational outcomes; the provision and long-term accessibility of non-fee and basic bank accounts with preferential overdraft and loan rates; and available interest-free loans for capital spends such as housing adaptation, equipment purchases, vehicle adaptation, disability aids and so on.</p><p> We strongly support the efforts of this committee to examine the DDDP scheme and further promote the full participation and financial inclusion of persons with disabilities.  We look forward to discussing these matters further.</p></speech>

It spells out many of the challenges people in society face every day but people with disabilities face those challenges at a higher rate.</p> <p>  Dr. Lajoie mentioned that the qualifying criteria for the primary medical certificate, as has been discussed many times, are extremely stringent.  That is why the medical appeals board resigned.  The criteria do not include people who suffer chronic illness or pain or people with neurological diseases.  It needs to be completely reviewed and the criteria changed to reflect where we are now.  We passed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and we need to implement it.</p> <p>  Transport is important for people with disabilities to be able to access work, visit family, go shopping and to do everything everybody else in society is able to do.  People with disabilities should be able to do that without having to fight all the time for their rights.  Would a large number of MABS clients be disabled?  Of those, how many would cite transport costs as being a major problem?  From talking to people, I know people who live in rural areas, in particular, have no access to public transport and even if they have, sometimes it is not accessible for them depending on the nature of the disability.</p> <p>  People have told me that when they telephone to book a wheelchair accessible taxi they cannot get one in many areas.  Many of them are contracted to the HSE and while there are some available, and they are usually dearer to book than the regular taxi most of us can use, people find it difficult to access them.  Is that an issue raised regularly with MABS?  We have one of the highest rates of poverty among our disabled population in Europe and also one of the highest rates of unemployment.  Obviously, the two are directly connected.  While accessible transport may not only be needed for people with disabilities to be able to get to and from work, the lack of it may be an impediment to them taking up work.  Has MABS any hopes these schemes will be reviewed, that the criteria will be addressed and the other schemes suspended in 2013 will be brought back into line?</p></speech>

In the responses to the survey we issued to the local services I was struck by the number of people working in rural areas such as Sligo, Donegal and Mayo who highlighted over and over again the importance of these types of supports to allow their clients with disabilities to access meaningful transport.  One of the issues for clients is they must have some money up front in order to access the service.  They must be able to afford a car in the first instance to get access to this specific scheme, which is a marked difference from the prior mobility allowance, which was a monthly payment.</p> <p>  There are still a number of people participating in that scheme.  The Government closed that scheme to new applications in 2013 but we now have a two-tier system.  A number of MABS clients would still be participating in the former scheme and a number who would have been eligible under former circumstances have been denied access to that scheme for a number of years.  I know citizens information services have faced the same issues we have faced.</p><p>It is very important, when tackling it from that perspective, to consider whether the onus is on the individual to have access to disposable income in order to purchase a vehicle in the first instance or if we can do more to help that person from the other side of things.  Would a one-off set payment, such as a mobility allowance, allow for that?</p><p> In respect of the data on our clients, we do not specifically track data on the number of persons with disabilities we have, which is why it was very important for us, in preparation for this meeting, to speak to money advisers and those on the coalface regarding this engagement with the committee in order to understand their experiences.  One of the things that came back was that the clients with disabilities we work with are overwhelmingly reliant on the disability allowance and related supports as their number one source of income.  If they are in employment, it is only for a few hours a week to supplement that income.  As we know, the disability allowance is a very important measure.  However, if someone is relying just on that to live, his or her income is very tight when it comes to access to additional disposable income for many things, such as participating in public life, social engagements and all of that.  That is something we see.</p></speech>

The kinds of issues that come up all the time, especially in rural areas, are access to transport and the additional costs of transport, even to get to MABS appointments.  MABS has outreach services in many counties, which is great.  We are bringing the service to the client as opposed to bringing the client to the service, but people with disabilities, in particular, still have additional costs, especially as regards transport and communications, which Dr. Lajoie outlined.  Due to the lack of rural public transport, the cost of taxis is coming up as an issue in our research and, as the Deputy said, the additional cost of taxis for disabled people.</p></speech>

That is a major problem right across society but especially for parents when they realise their child has an additional need - where do they go for help and how do they get it?  It goes right on through.  People are not told of their rights.  Citizens Information does wonderful work in informing people, but not everybody thinks of going to that body to get information.  They should not have to go looking for it.  Information should be provided to people on what their rights are in respect of different services, payments and so forth.  Much work needs to be done to assist people with disabilities instead of them having to fight for their rights on a constant basis, which they are tired of doing at this stage.</p></speech>

Something that again struck us as we were preparing for this meeting was the number of money advisers we spoke with who told us that people are not aware they can appeal decisions when they are initially rejected.  We found some statistics from the Department of Social Protection on the number of initial applicants for disability allowance.  The Department rejects more than half of first applicants; those are the statistics from 2021.  Some 13,989 applications for disability allowance were turned down, while 13,298 of processed claims were granted last year.  Many people are not aware they have the right to challenge or appeal those decisions.  They will take that notice, or put that letter in the bin, forget about it and go back on jobseeker's, for example.  Those numbers are also conflated so we might not get an accurate picture of the social welfare supports and who needs what.</p> <p>  In cases where decisions are appealed, for more than half there is a change in that decision.  When people have access to an appeals system, they can get the supports.  That is something our advisers flagged over and over; helping people to know and understand they have the right of appeal when a decision comes in.  They might not get on the provisional allowance from the get-go, but they can appeal that decision and take it further.  It is pretty significant they have to do that in the first place, but it is great they are coming to our services and we can provide that support.  </p></speech>

Generally, when we assist a person to appeal, that individual wins the appeal.  It is unfortunate people are not just granted what they deserve at the outset.</p></speech>

I commend MABS on the crucial work it does in assisting individuals in particularly difficult times during the pandemic and as we deal with the cost-of-living crisis.  Today, we are focusing on those with disabilities and the additional financial burdens that can be placed on individuals as a result of the discontinuation of a number of schemes.  Most of us argue that the disabled drivers and passengers scheme is not fit for purpose and excludes many individuals.  We know that six criteria apply to that scheme, where someone has to tick a box.  It is really asking disabled people to fit into this little square box and if they do not they are grounded.  In some cases, it means people cannot leave their homes to go to the shops or the cinema, or cannot visit a neighbour, because that is not possible for those living in a rural community.</p> <p>  Even if the criteria were changed to look at the issues, and to be more flexible in respect of mobility issues, what is the MABS view on how that would address the problem?  I raise this because MABS representatives have previously raised the point that even if more people are eligible for the scheme, they still would have to be able to purchase a car.  I am sure many of the individuals MABS deals with are not in that position.  I would like to hear the representatives' views on that because while it would be absolutely fantastic if the criteria were changed and we had the medical appeals board up and running, there is a danger we are likely to still have a large number of people with disabilities excluded from mobility because those concerned cannot afford the &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 to purchase a vehicle.  </p> <p>  I was thinking as I came to today's meeting of the perverseness of this year in that people who have money are being given &euro;5,000 of taxpayers' money.  People who have disabilities and cannot leave their houses are paying taxes while that &euro;5,000 is going to people who have money and can afford a &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 electric vehicle.  Yet, &euro;5,000 is not being made available to those people with a disability who are not looking for flashy new cars, but just want to be able to get out of the house to go to church or visit a neighbour or whatever.  I would welcome the views of MABS on that. </p></speech>

As the Deputy said, fairly clearly, it is about making those kind of incentives available to people with disabilities to avail of grants to purchase these kind of vehicles.  Dr. Lajoie also has some figures on the number of people with disabilities who are not in the workforce, which are pretty stark.  Lack of transport is one reason they are not in the workforce, and lack of affordability is the reason for the lack of transport.  It is certainly a challenge for policymakers and legislators to invert that and try to incentivise people with disabilities to get into the workforce, if they can.  We are well behind the rest of Europe in trying to help people with disabilities to improve their circumstances, financially and socially.  We all know people, some of whom are very well known, with disabilities who make a significant contribution to their communities.</p><p>They are just great role models.  I am sure there are others who could make equally good contributions were they incentivised to do so.</p></speech>

I was very taken with what Mr. Deering said.  I completely agree with this.  If people knew their names and faces and if it was humanised as opposed to being a matter of dealing with schemes that have complicated names, statutory instruments and all the rest, it would be better.  This is about Jack who is sitting at home and Mary who has mobility issues.  Yes, she has two legs but she is in a wheelchair and, therefore, cannot avail of this support.  It is a case of what that means for Mary, Jack and thousands of people like them.  MABS carried out a survey relating to its experience regarding its clients.  How would it characterise the impact of not having these supports based on its survey?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Amie Lajoie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022021600002#K00300"><p>It is quite bleak.  The pandemic was an incredibly difficult time for all of us to be isolated at home but it was particularly difficult for certain people who could not even get out for a walk which we were all trying to do.  Part of the difficulty with the State's approach to people with disabilities is that one-dimensional lens.  It is about not understanding that this is a diverse group of people with many different needs.  The issue is quite nuanced.  The requirements for inclusion in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme and the focus on the primary medical certificate only focus on really restricted physical disabilities so it is a really outdated model.  With the introduction of the human rights legislation and the work of advocacy and support groups for people with disabilities in Ireland, we must combat that.  It is something we talk about within our services.  It includes proper language for discussing people with disabilities, making sure we using the right terminology and being sensitive to all of these things.  There is no reason not to do it.  All of us could be doing better.</p></speech>

The person becomes a client like any other client of MABS because he or she is getting a face-to-face service.  I am sure the Deputy knows there are three MABS services in his county of Donegal.  In larger counties like Kerry, there are two but there are outreach services in family resource centres.  We like to think this face-to-face service complements what our funder Citizens Information provides via <i>citizensinformation.ie</i>or citizens information centres.  They are rooted in communities.  We think we provide a good offering to our communities because we are rooted and a have presence in them.  To go off on a slight tangent, you could make the claim that anybody who comes to MABS is disabled in some form because he or she is financially stressed.  They were previously people of huge capacity in some cases and a lot of capacity in others.  They have been disabled so to speak by their circumstances.  We saw it after the crash and we see it in mortgage arrears and unsecured debt.  People are effectively disabled when they come to MABS and our job is to work with them on income maximisation and to try to make them financially independent again.  In respect of financial inclusion for people with disabilities, the fact that we are present and rooted in communities is a great help in that regard.</p></speech>

Family resource centres are hugely important in that respect.  They would probably be the main ones.  Credit unions have made their premises available.  We will also do home visits, particularly in the case of people with disabilities.</p></speech>

That woman would not even be able to make an appeal today because the board has resigned <i>en masse </i>because of the inaction of the Minister and Government.  It is a shocking exclusion.  I do not think I have ever met anybody who is not generous or does not believe we need to do more for people with disabilities yet governments have allowed nine years to pass without any new scheme being brought forward to replace the one that was suspended.  An entire board has now resigned, which I assume is not a simple decision, because it believes the Minister has not done enough or is not speedy enough.  Based on the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service's understanding of its clients, are we seeing people like this individual, who is in a wheelchair and does not have access to transport?  I assume some people will make cuts elsewhere because it is such an important thing.  If there is a family there, people will rally round because the public and families are good.  How can anybody live with this situation where you cannot go outside your home because you do not have a car that is wheelchair-equipped?  Are people in this situation in 2022?  Are they grounded?  Are they prisoners in their own homes to a certain degree because they cannot afford to do these modifications themselves and do not have the grants that used to be there in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s?  I find it bizarre.</p></speech>

The case involved a couple.  The man's wife was getting older and he could no longer lift her in her wheelchair into his vehicle because he was elderly, which is why they were looking for increased support.  That was what he had been doing previously - trying to find ways to use his current vehicle.  The primary medical certificate and those six requirements are not just for this scheme and other schemes.  I believe they also apply to the disabled parking permit.  I spoke to another adviser who has several clients waiting.  I think there are more than 450 appeals waiting to be processed that are not being processed because the board is no longer functioning.  These people are just waiting to get access to disabled parking spaces near their homes so that when their carers arrive, they have a place to park in what is quite a busy estate.  Right now, they must double park just so the carers can get into the home.</p><p>There are many things going on now and our fear was that the situation would continue to get worse as long as there continued to be no action on this really important matter.  It is a group that is already facing extreme challenges and increased costs of living.  It is further exacerbating those challenges for a really marginalised part of the population, which is quite concerning.</p></speech>

There were reviews and a Cabinet subcommittee set up two years ago.  The Minister for Finance was doing a review last January; I do not know if it is still going on or whatever.  A year on from that, in January, there is another review and a group being pulled together by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Anne Rabbitte.  In 2013 we were told this would be reviewed and there would be a solution.  That was said to us numerous times as parliamentarians across the political divide who were putting these questions.  A memo went to the Cabinet about a new scheme four years ago but it was pulled and there is nothing there now.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any insight into what is actually happening?  Is MABS involved with any of the discussions on what is happening here and now?  If we get another big news story we will get another review, which would not be good.  It is appalling.  We have to put a face on this and know the person down the road who cannot leave the house without that type of support.  We must put a face and name on it.  Sometimes politics can be too unemotional but this should not be; there should be outrage and this should not go on any longer.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any insight into what is happening and the length of the review that was announced last month?  Is MABS involved or being consulted at all?  I thank the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>

Having said that, Dr. Lajoie and I work for MABS Support and there are ten MABS companies.  There is our company, National Traveller MABS and eight regional companies.  They take in north and south Leinster, north and south Munster, south Connacht, north Connacht and Ulster and then Dublin, which unlike the GAA is split in half along north and south.  I am not sure if regional managers have been approached but I suppose it has only been recently announced.  That may be the case and I am just not aware of it.  It is certainly something I am sure is relevant to MABS and the Citizens Information Board because we have a social policy function.</p> <p>  Dr. Lajoie has only just joined us and we are delighted about it because we now have a specialist on social policy working with us in MABS Support.  Dr. Lajoie's providing of social policy is a dedicated function in MABS Support for the whole of the MABS service.  We also have a new financial inclusion executive and this role was in a previous iteration of MABS Support called MABS National Development.  Anyway, it is the same crew and we have a guy called Mr. Joe Nevin who worked as a money adviser in Sligo MABS for approximately 13 years before he was paroled to us.  Mr. Nevin and Dr. Lajoie started in November.</p> <p>  As I said, we have the MABS services in regional companies and the National Traveller MABS, and these are rooted in communities.  We have issues that are coming up there and Dr. Lajoie has mentioned some of these, including the COPD case.  We also have a "macro" view, for want of a better word, and we can channel those matters coming up through this funnel beside me.  I've insulted her before and that is just another example of it.  We are in a very good position now and if we are asked, we would like to contribute.</p></speech>

There is the wider issue where no appeals are possible currently because of the inappropriateness of the assessment system.  I was also struck that a client in a local Citizens Information Services office lost an appeal because the person was unable to travel the five hours to attend the assessment in Dublin.  The lack of funding and transport upfront is getting in the way of people being able to appeal or seek that access.</p> <p>  I was also struck by Dr. Lajoie's comment about the number of people who do not take appeals.  We know many appeals are successful when they take them.  I sit on the disability matters committee as well and there is a frustrated sense sometimes that refusals were happening at an early point almost to wear down people with bureaucracy, with people feeling daunted by a delay in access.  They say that justice delayed is justice denied and there seems to be an element of that in people with a disability accessing entitlements.</p> <p>  In that regard I also pick up on the comment made about the importance of the local centres.  In addition to the really good information on the Citizens Information website, will the witnesses speak to having local offices?  There was mention of the two offices in Kerry and the different offices in different counties.  People can access these offices in order to help them to navigate what can sometimes seem like quite a hostile and forbidding bureaucratic system.  Will they comment on that local support?</p> <p>  There are one or two other issues.  We have talked about the interim period in which there is no appeals mechanism or individualised service.  There have been two developments in the past couple of years.  One is the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the effect on rights of people with a disability, and the fact that people have individual rights to participation in society, for example.  There is a little bit more of a robust legal right now that the convention has been ratified.  Will the witnesses comment on the extent to which people are becoming aware of that and how they think those new or strengthened rights tools might be used?</p> <p>  I was really struck by the number of areas where the need for greater financial inclusion was identified for people with a disability.  Perhaps adding to that we could consider the case of the woman who was asked to transfer the vehicle and financial independence.  Will the witnesses comment on that matter of financial independence as well as financial support and inclusion?</p> <p>  There was also the cost of disability report that has finally been published.  Is that something MABS has engaged with?  Are some of the proposals in today's presentation related to the issues that arose in that cost of disability report from Indecon?  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, even if we look at the ratification process of the UNCRPD, Ireland was the last EU member state to do that ratification, which says a lot.  It took until 2018 for it to be done when it was originally proposed in 2006.  I hope it has at least given those who work on the ground with people in communities a different and specific language of engagement in how to categorise what is going on in terms of a rights-based approach, which is very useful.</p><p>Even when we were having the preliminary discussions for our statement to the committee we heard some of that.  There was acknowledgement and recognition that there is now this international framework.  There is now a national framework because there was a strategy - I think it was last year - that has a specific provision in it focused on mobility and transport.  It is hopefully going to be able to allow those of us working in this space to better articulate what is going on and to better push for the kind of normative, legislative and policy change needed to allocate further resources in this area and better support this community.</p><p> I might comment on the Indecon report because it was something we highlighted and looked at.  While our statement centred the personal experiences and testimonies of the advisers and the CIS that engaged with us, it very much echoed what was found in this report, especially about the cost of transport and where persons with disabilities are not getting State support.  That was something interesting that was in the Indecon report.  For example, most are getting State support for something like public transport costs, if you are somebody who lives in an area where you have access to public transport.  Of those who took the Indecon survey, 51% said that is where State help was given to them but of course that is in and of itself exclusionary of everyone else not in an area where they can access public transport.  However, the extra costs incurred by the participants in that survey were only 15%.  That is a very small amount versus the 39% extra cost for private transport whereas the only State help given for private transport costs was 16%.  There are, therefore, significant gaps.  That further augments what we found in our preparations for this and what the money advisers are seeing with respect to the additional costs and burdens placed on persons with disabilities.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned in particular the cost of taxis and how if you are on disability allowance you can get that.  A lot of the time it is medical appointments.  That is what came up over and over again.  It is multiple medical appointments and some of them are very time-sensitive.  If you have chronic pain and live somewhere where you cannot access public transport, a taxi is your mode of transport.  You can collect a receipt and get that reimbursed in time but in that time period people might make choices to cover that cost.  For example, one adviser said people might opt to go without food or cut back on their food budget in order to cover that taxi cost to their medical appointment.  It is quite stark that people are making those decisions.  Mr. O'Brien might want to tackle the financial independence piece.</p></speech>

It is there.  It is in use.  It is a very good assistance to people on the ground, including obviously people with disabilities who need it, and that is what is funding the transport costs.  We hear about it in times of somewhat crisis.  It would obviously be well-known to MABS because, as I said earlier, part of our remit is to maximise our clients' income, so if they are not getting the social welfare entitlements they are entitled to, we would be steering them in that direction.  In many areas of the country, there has traditionally been a strong relationship between MABS and the community welfare officers.  I have a sense that maybe the whole area of ENPs could do with a bit of highlighting to people with disabilities and other clients of MABS.  We have had very successful collaborations with the community welfare service in the past, I am sure we do at present and, hopefully, we will have into the future.  It is certainly something we tell our clients about.</p> <p>  To go back to what was mentioned earlier to stress it again, we have very strong ties in the communities.  We have the outreach services.  We can meet people, especially people with disabilities, in their homes.  We have very good relations with other, we will say, NGOs such as St. Vincent de Paul as well, in order to help people maximise income and avail of services that are there to help them improve their financial situation.  MABS, in having such a presence on the ground, has been successful and I am sure we will continue to be successful in that regard.</p></speech>

I was just so struck by that woman who clearly needs support with transport as she could not even fund transport to her appeal.  The emergency needs payment is one mechanism.  Dr.  Lajoie also mentioned the idea of interest-free loans.  Will she expand a little on that as an idea?  There is that concern Deputy Doherty raised that it is almost a wealth transfer.  Those who are most in need do not have the capital to access schemes and adaptation supports.  Within that, I am thinking of vehicle adaptation but also housing adaptation.</p> <p>  There are two other issues that have come up a lot and I wonder if MABS is finding them as a pattern in its work.  One is the idea around appropriate, adapted electric vehicles and recognising disability needs within those schemes, or even retrofitting and building adaptation needs into retrofitting schemes.  Are enough of these new green schemes that are coming on stream being designed in a way that is going to support people with a disability to avail of, and fully engage with, them rather than us having to go back and almost retrofit those schemes, so they work for people with a disability in the future?  Is that something MABS has found to be an issue?  Does that fit in with the interest-free loan issue as well?</p></speech>

It was before my time but something I looked at before joining.  It included looking at the likes of community banking schemes or saving initiatives rooted in the community to give people an opportunity to access, or to become familiar with different skills within the remit of financial literacy that are suitable to them, versus trying to get people into the services that currently exist.  There initiatives out there.  For example, members may have heard of the It Makes Sense loan scheme with credit unions or the personal micro credit scheme.  That is an affordable credit option that was rolled out I think around seven years and that is still being incorporated in different areas of the country.  That is a low-level interest rate of about 12.5% for people who are on social welfare, so they can access that.  However, there are a number of problems.  On the way credit works in general, as Deputy Doherty and Senator Higgins said, our whole financial system is set up in a way that banks do not offer the type of credit or loans people on low incomes need.  They would be short-term, low-level loans for amounts that are usually for not very high amounts that people can access immediately and that are inexpensive.  It tends to be that the less you borrow, the more you must pay back in interest, compound interest and all that.  That is where that recommendation comes from, that is, when we see a spend like this.  These services are not elective for many people.  It is very much a necessity that the person adapts his or her home to better meet his or her needs as a person with disabilities who has specific needs.</p><p>It would be quite helpful if those types of loans were available.  Something like that, which could be backed up by a broader public initiative and local authorities, would be useful, particularly for the more marginalised groups.</p></speech>

So many of the schemes we have are delivered through tax reliefs.  If people are under a certain threshold, they are not really benefiting from them.</p> <p>  My last question concerns an issue I raised with the Ombudsman, namely, the intersection on age and disability.  A concern raised in the past, when I was a member of the then Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, was that once people are in that older age group when they reach pension age their disability needs and some of their access to disability supports and schemes seem to be curtailed.  As we heard, that was one of the reasons the mobility allowance scheme was found to be out of sync with the Equal Status Act.  Is that a frustration or an issue that has been raised with the witnesses through their offices?  Is it the case that people who are over the age 65 or 66 and who are trying to access disability supports are finding themselves instead rooted into general age-related supports that do not address disabilities?  Is that an issue that has been raised?</p></speech>

When people with disabilities come to MABS, we will look at their complete budget, including income versus expenditure, etc.  Their capacity to afford a loan will be laid out in front of them.  They may have the capacity to afford a loan.  Of course, I would advocate interest-free loans for those people.  Why should people pay a poverty premium?  I hate using that phrase.  Even the 12.5% interest rate on the It Makes Sense loans could certainly be looked at in terms of a subsidy.  Lenders look at risk; that is their job.  Certainly, just to make the point again, some form of loan guarantee scheme or a central fund for people with disabilities who need transport could be looked at.  If they come to MABS, they know that they will get a good heads-up on what their affordability is.  For those who can afford it, something like an interest-free loan scheme, coupled with a guarantee would be-----</p></speech>

I do not know if the witnesses have been following it.  As Mr. O'Brien said, the idea is that there is an extra cost.  For example, the good boots might cost &euro;50 and last a lifetime, but everybody is buying &euro;10 boots because they cannot afford that &euro;50.  It is the idea of not having capital carrying a financial penalty.  They have been looking at the Vimes Boots Index in the UK.  It is something we should be looking at, whether it is through a loan guarantee scheme, microcredit or capital grants that are more strategically targeted.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee and the members for attending in person and online.  The witnesses mentioned exceptional needs payments and the importance of them.  They could be utilised to a greater extent than they have been in the past.  There is a tendency for us all to presume that because we spent a lot of money on Covid, we can continue to do that.  That is not going to happen, unless we want to go back to where we were in 2007: bankrupt.  That would not be to the advantage of anybody.  Therefore, we must proceed cautiously, carefully and prudently.  We have to address the issues of people with disabilities and recognise people with disabilities.  Again, the late Martin Naughton comes to mind.  On the question of isolation, we all learned a bit about isolation in the course of the pandemic.  It came home to us all.  It applies to people with disabilities on an ongoing and daily basis, 365 days a year.  It affects them in different ways.  It is a terrible position to be in to be dependent on all around you for the simple things that other people take for granted.</p> <p>  I note, for instance, what we call the housing adaptation grant.  There was also a disabled person's grant.  Invariably, there is a shortfall.  I cannot understand why there is a shortfall.  I have been dealing with a case for the last six months where a certain amount of money was awarded.  How they came to that amount of money, I do not know.  The case has been appealed and appealed.  The point is that since the decision was made, prices have gone up immeasurably, so it automatically follows that there needs to be a re-evaluation of the award.  I am not saying that we have the answer.  We have the answer to some things that need to be addressed.  We should take the steps required.  I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee and for making their feelings and responses known.  We greatly appreciate that.</p></speech>

This is important because it can cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  For the purposes of the Official Report, I have been requested to identify members when they are called to speak.  Members are requested to remove their face coverings when speaking to ensure their contributions are recorded adequately before replacing their face coverings.</p> <p>  I welcome to our meeting this morning members and viewers who may be watching the proceedings on Oireachtas TV.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  The D&aacute;il has ordered that the Revised Estimates for the public services in respect of the following Vote be referred to this select committee for consideration: Vote 37 - Social Protection.  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the Minister for Social Protection and for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Heather Humphreys, an tAire St&aacute;it, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and their officials to this meeting.  Members have received the briefing documentation provided by the Department and supplementary briefings from the secretariat, which have been circulated in advance.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Revised Estimate and the performance information regarding the outputs and impacts of the programme expenditure.  The programme-based structure of the Estimates should allow the committee to focus on what the Department has committed to achieving in terms of actual outputs and outcomes, to consider whether the performance targets included in the Estimate are a sufficiently complete description of the services provided by the Department, whether those targets strike the right balance in terms of the needs of our society, whether the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services, and whether these allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.  The gross allocation for Vote 37 in 2022 will now be &euro;23.35 billion.  The Further Revised Estimate for 2022, published in December 2021, shows a reduction of &euro;6.9 billion on the 2021 provision outturn, which was &euro;30.3 billion.</p> <p>  I now call the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

As we face into 2022, we must be conscious of how far we have travelled in overcoming the challenges that Covid-19 presented both for society and the economy, as well as for our people.  We have experienced and dealt with waves of lockdowns and easing of public health restrictions since March 2020, which impacted all of us.  We did this by developing and delivering innovative approaches to mitigate as far as possible the impact of Covid on people's lives.  My Department played a critical role in supporting workers and their employers who were severely affected by Covid-19.  The roll-out of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for workers whose jobs were in cold storage during lockdown and the provision of funding to the Revenue Commissioners to support employers through the employment wage subsidy scheme ensured individuals, businesses and the economy generally could withstand the impact of restrictions.</p> <p>  In recognition of the need to ease the financial impact of Covid on the most vulnerable, measures such as flexibility in rent supplement and the Covid illness benefit were also introduced.  The Government's announcement on 21 January 2022 of the lifting of most public health restrictions, allowing virtually all elements of society to reopen, is an indication we have moved into a new phase.  The Revised Estimates, which the committee is to consider today, reflects the start of this new phase as we emerge from almost two years of a very dynamic and volatile environment into what we hope will be a more stable base for continuing to develop our social protection system.</p> <p>  Projected spending for the Department in 2022 is &euro;23.3 billion, compared with an estimated outturn for 2021 of &euro;30.3 billion.  It should be borne in mind that spending in 2021 includes &euro;8.5 billion directly related to Covid, comprising &euro;4 billion for the PUP and &euro;4.5 billion for the employment wage subsidy scheme.  The provision of Covid measures in the 2022 Estimate is approximately &euro;700 million, reflecting the fact that in 2022, my Department will return to focusing more on its traditional schemes and services.</p> <p>  As members know, the work of the Department is broad in scope, supporting people throughout the life cycle, from the payment of child benefit to the provision of income support when people reach pension age.  The Department's expenditure, at &euro;23.3 billion for 2022, is still one of the largest of any Department, representing more than one third of gross current Government expenditure.  With this level of expenditure, we must ensure our social protection system is properly structured and provides support when people need it most.  As demonstrated by our response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we also strive to ensure the system is flexible enough to deal with changes in the economy and society so that we can respond to challenges when they emerge.</p> <p>  The projected 2022 expenditure of &euro;23.3 billion represents a normalisation of the pattern of social protection spending, but it is a new normal and a higher level of expenditure, incorporating budget day measures valued at &euro;600 million on a full-year basis.  This was the largest social welfare budget package in 14 years and included across the board increases for all welfare recipients at the same time as continuing the practice of recent years of implementing targeted measures to help the most vulnerable in our communities.  Those measures include increases in the living alone allowance, qualified child payments and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance; the expansion of the hot school meals programme; improvements in income disregard for carers; and increases in the wage subsidy scheme for people with disabilities, to name just a few.  These measures are reflected in the expenditure subheads presented today.</p> <p>  The biggest single block of expenditure in 2022 will be on pensions, which will amount to more than &euro;9.1 billion or 39% of overall expenditure.  Thankfully, people are living longer lives but that, of course, means an increasing proportion of the Department's expenditure is now providing income support for people in their older years.  Expenditure on illness, disability and carer's payment amounts to &euro;4.9 billion in 2022, representing 21% of expenditure.</p> <p>  With the phasing out in 2022 of the PUP, we will see a reduction in expenditure on working-age income support schemes.  Working-age income supports will account for nearly 16% of expenditure in 2022, at &euro;3.65 billion.  This includes payments for jobseekers, one-parent families, maternity and paternity payments, and supplementary welfare allowance.  Expenditure on employment supports continues to make a provision for the employment wage subsidy scheme, albeit at a significantly lower level.  It also includes community employment, back-to-education allowance, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme and the various employment and activation programmes.  Employment supports expenditure amounts to &euro;1.5 billion this year or 6.3% of my Department's spending.</p><p>Expenditure on children and families will account for over 11% of expenditure, or &euro;2.6 billion, of which over &euro;2 billion will be spent on child benefit and &euro;350 million on the working family payment.  Expenditure on supplementary payments like rent supplement and the fuel allowance is &euro;907 million, or nearly 4%, of 2022 expenditure.</p><p> The live register at the end of January 2022 stood at just under 163,000, taking account of over 80,000 who received a pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in that week.  The total number of workers in receipt of unemployment-related payments stood at 243,000.  My Department will continue to work in 2022 to encourage the movement from unemployment to employment through our activation services and employment programmes, and meeting our commitments under the Pathways to Work initiative.</p><p> The broad overview I have presented of social protection expenditure is developed in detail in the briefing material provided to the committee.  I am sure the committee will agree it is a very comprehensive analysis of 2022 expenditure on one of the largest and most complex Estimates of expenditure.  There is little doubt that 2022 will bring challenges for social protection spending, including evaluating how changes in the economy are impacting those most at risk of poverty.  My Department has demonstrated its ability and flexibility to effectively support the most vulnerable, as evidenced in the last few years in particular, without which we would have seen a society where poverty and social exclusion increased.  Due to the measures we have taken, incomes were protected, the risk-of-poverty rates fell and inequality reduced.</p><p> The recent Government announcement of the &euro;500 million package of measures to mitigate the increasing cost of living is a further indication of our commitment to respond immediately to the needs of our citizens.  As part of that package, an additional &euro;125 lump sum will be paid to fuel allowance recipients next month and the Government also agreed to the earlier introduction of the &euro;10 increase in working family thresholds.  Both measures combined represent additional social protection spending of &euro;53 million in 2022.  The combination of the other cost of living measures and the significant improvements introduced in budget 2022 will provide further support to many vulnerable households faced with higher costs this year.  The measures taken in response to Covid and increased living costs show our determination to protect and continue the progress we have made in the face of challenges, and the Estimates presented to date reflect this determination.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the committee's views and welcome any questions members have for myself or for the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien.</p></speech>

We will now consider the Vote, programme by programme, as per the briefing documents that have been circulated to members.  The first programme is administration.  On that, I know the Government has set a target, and the Minister has set a target within her Department, of ensuring that one fifth of staff can work remotely.  She might give us an update on whether her Department achieved that target by the end of 2021, given it was the target set out by the Government.  She might also clarify if those who are working remotely are doing so now on a permanent basis or is this still a temporary measure under Covid-19.</p></speech>

About 50% of the staff were working from home and the other 50% were in the offices because, obviously, the nature of the service we provide meant people had to come in.  The HR department continues to engage with staff because there is a policy and we want to find the solution that works both for the Department and the staff.  There are ongoing discussions.  As the Chairman can appreciate, this takes a bit of time but we are working on it.</p></speech>

With regard to the move from the pandemic unemployment payment to jobseeker's payment, which is set for the end of March, can the Minister explain what that will mean for those on PUP when they move onto the jobseeker's payment?  Will they be engaged with as regards job activation or have they been engaged with already?  Do we know why PUP numbers remain fairly high?  Has there been any level of engagement with participants?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#B00800"><p>We have been engaging with all of the PUP recipients, particularly those who went onto PUP prior to it being reopened in December of last year.  We have contacted every single one of them and offered them our services.  Some of them at the time were waiting for their sectors to reopen and some were waiting because their jobs had not come back.  We have engaged with them and we continue to do that.  Every week, the number on the PUP continues to reduce, and it went down a further 7,000 this week.  That means the economy is now opening and people are getting back to work.  We are continually engaging with them and giving them all the supports we can to help them get back into employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#B00900"><p>To build from Deputy Kerrane&rsquo;s question, I want to raise a question that I have asked at previous meetings of the committee.  Have we information on who remains on the pandemic unemployment payment and what sectors are most affected?  If we have that information, do we have a specific plan?  For example, if we know it concerns people within hospitality or the arts, do we have specifics as to how we are going to move people off that?</p> <p>  I will trust the Chair to steer me back if I stray into the wrong programme, so he can get his cattle prod ready.  I want to ask about the large increase in basic supplementary welfare allowance payments, given some 30% is listed.  I want to ask that more general question of whether we are seeing the rise in the cost of living feeding through into people looking for supplementary allowance welfare payments, and whether we have a plan for that going forward or whether we think the package that was announced last week is sufficient.</p> <p>  There is a welcome increase in paternity and parent's benefit.  Do we believe we are successful in the take-up of that payment?  I know, anecdotally, that it has been culturally more difficult for men to take paternity leave, which they absolutely should as it is an incredibly important thing to do.  Are we being successful in that, in the Minister's opinion?</p> <p>  In terms of redundancy and insolvency payments, I have a feeling this will be a big issue.  Many businesses were kept on a lifeline over the course of Covid.  Are we seeing a large number of insolvencies coming through in a bunched way?  We would have expected, over the last two years, that a certain number of insolvencies would pass through the system but many of those were put on hold because of the supports that were put in place for Covid.  Do we expect a large number of those to come into the system over the next couple of months?  Are we prepared for that and do we have a plan for dealing with it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#C00100"><p>I have some figures on the basic supplementary allowance.  My apologies; the first question was on the PUP so I will begin with that.  The amount paid in PUP this week was &euro;15.2 million.  I can provide the committee with a full sheet giving a detailed breakdown of who is on the payment from the different sectors.  The main sector is accommodation and food services, in which the number of payments is 12,326.  That is followed by wholesale and retail, with 9,647 payments.  Payments in administrative and support service activities stand at 6,776.  That gives an idea of the different sectors in which people are unemployed and still on the PUP.</p> <p>  On the exceptional needs or supplementary welfare allowance, the Government announced a package last week to help people experiencing difficulties with the cost of living.  As members know, the Department agreed to pay a &euro;125 payment to those in receipt of the fuel allowance.  The supplementary welfare allowance is available for those who need support.  I take this opportunity to encourage everybody who is experiencing difficulty and needs help to contact his or her community welfare officer.  People can do that by phone or they can arrange for an officer to call to their house or meet them face to face.  If people are having problems, they should contact their community welfare officer.  We have put community welfare officers on notice to inform people who may call to them that those supports are available.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the essential needs payments.  There has been a steady decline in the number of essential needs payments paid to customers each month in the period from November 2019 to date.  In December 2019, 7,935 essential needs payments were paid.  In January 2022, the number of such payments was 3,596.  The anticipated increase in demand for essential needs payments did not materialise.  Arising from the cost-of-living increases, officers administering the scheme have been advised that for individuals and households dependent on income support payments from the Department or those working on low incomes, or both, the increased cost of living due to inflation and rising energy costs may present a significant financial challenge and it is likely many may seek additional financial support under the supplementary welfare allowance schemes to assist in meeting the increased costs of daily life.  Our community welfare officers are on notice and are there to help.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about parent's benefit.  Policy in respect of that benefit and parent's leave resides in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We increased that by a further two weeks in the budget.  On the take-up of parent's benefit, we reckon that about 30,000 people are benefiting.  We have increased its duration from five to seven weeks for parents of children under two years of age.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned companies that have been on business supports and may not survive and asked what we are doing in that regard.  We provide the pathways to work programme and many different supports to help people get back to other work.  We have been working in conjunction with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on upskilling and retraining.  All those supports are available to help people get back into the workplace.</p></speech>

This is hugely significant for the network.  I understand initially it will apply to new jobseekers followed by others.  Will the Minister give an overview and update on how that is going?</p></speech>

The changes will apply initially to all new jobseeker applications before being extended to other jobseekers over the coming months.  When the public health restrictions were introduced in 2020 people in receipt of social welfare were given the option of being paid into a bank account.  This was an exceptional measure to help reduce the spread of the virus and ensure people could comply with social distancing guidelines.  I and my officials have been in discussions with An Post and the Irish Postmasters' Union.  This move will have benefits for both my Department and the post office network because we will have more people going into post offices.</p> <p>  We are all aware of the challenges facing post offices.  I recognise the wonderful work they did during the pandemic because their doors were open all the time.  Many postmistresses and postmasters went beyond the call of duty in delivering food and groceries to families and older people who were not able to come into shops for whatever reason.  I acknowledge the role they played in their communities.  All members have been asking how we can support our post offices and we have discussed the matter at length on many occasions.  I was delighted, therefore, that we were able to introduce this measure.  I also thank members for the support they have given in helping me to do that.</p></speech>

Many people in low-paid jobs and on fixed incomes, including social welfare payments, are going really feel the pinch.  Community welfare officers used to be based in the HSE and in the community.  They were then moved into the Department of Social Protection and Intreo offices, so they are a fair distance from the community now.  Many people do not even know they can approach community officers if they are really stuck with a bill or whatever.  I would like to hear the Minister's insight into that.  Is there a specific amount of money allocated to the community welfare offices to deal with exceptional needs or are they still dealt with on a case-by-case basis?  Are community welfare officers restricted in what they can allocate moneys for?  Given the situation we are in, should those officers not be closer to the community, perhaps based in the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, or a similar body, to improve access to exceptional needs payments?  My experience from my constituency office is that many people are trying to get through to the Intreo offices and finding it impossible to do so.</p><p>The telephone repeatedly rings out.  One person was an hour on the telephone and gave up.  This particular area could play a crucial role in supporting people who are really stuck with regard to paying bills and paying for food, medical needs and the like.  I hope I will hear from the Minister about setting up an emergency fund, which I believe the Government was talking about at one stage but did not come through with.  Hardship and emergency funds should be delivered by community welfare officers in the community so people can access them more easily.  What is the Minister's opinion on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#D00200"><p>The supplementary welfare allowance is the fund or the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  It is a demand-led scheme so there is no limit on it.  People get it as they need it.  It provides once-off and regular support to those on low incomes having difficulty meeting household costs.  In 2021, the Department paid &euro;42.7 million in urgent and exceptional needs payments in respect of 55,000 claims.  Approximately 92,200 payments were made in 2019 and 67,600 payments were made in 2020.  It is there and it is available.  I also commend the work of the community welfare officers.  We all know them well in our constituencies.  They provide an excellent service.  They help people when they need it and they are only a telephone call away.</p> <p>  I am sorry there was a bad experience where somebody could not get through to the community welfare office, but if people call into the local Intreo office or email them they will be able to make contact with them.  There are three ways to do it.  The telephone is probably the easiest way.  There is also the in-person way and the officers will do house visits if necessary.  I know they were in the HSE and that they moved to the Department of Social Protection.  We want to support that service because it is essential.  It is important that it continues and that it is there to provide help to people.</p> <p>  In terms of the details, we gave an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125.  That will be paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance.  It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March, at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.  The lump sum payment, in addition to the measures announced in budget 2022, will mean that low-income households will get an increase of 41% this fuel allowance season compared to the previous season.  A further measure to help with energy costs is the energy credit of &euro;200 to be applied to electricity accounts for all householders.  The introduction of the &euro;10 increase to the weekly income threshold of the working family payment will be brought forward to early April this year.  It was supposed to apply in June so we have brought it forward.  For those on low wages in receipt of more than a minimum payment on the working family payment the &euro;10 increase in all earnings thresholds will result in an increased payment of &euro;6. All these measures are in addition to the wide-sweeping measures in budget 2022, which was the largest social welfare budget in 14 years.  Not only did we do an across-the-board increase of &euro;5, we also did the targeted measures in the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance and the qualified child payments among a number of other payments.</p> <p>  We would always like to do more.  We make these decisions and the pot of funds is limited.  We do not have an endless pot.  However, we continue to try to target it at those most vulnerable and most in need.</p></speech>

When they were with the HSE many of the community welfare officers knew the people in the area and people knew who to go to if they were in difficulty.  That has been pulled back to the Intreo offices.  It is another step in that direction.  I hope they will not be pulled even further out of the community in the future, and I hope that is not on the agenda.  If the Minister is not going to do that aspect of it, can she run an advertisement campaign on the radio or the like to inform people that if they are really in need there is somewhere they can go, and give the information on how to do that?  Many people are facing situations where they do not see a way out and they need that support.</p></speech>

We do not want to take anybody out of the community.  It is a case of people using services in a different way now, so we have to try to respond to the needs of the customers who use the service.  There is a telephone line and much of the time one can get what one needs over the telephone, and the assessment and the payment can be made.  It can be done electronically.  Those who do not want to use that can go to the Intreo offices.  I am not sure if this is across the country but I know that community welfare officers go to some clinics.  Again, we want to make sure that people get help when they need it.  That is the most important thing.  We will be running an awareness campaign.  I encourage the members of the committee to join me in making people aware that those supports are available.  We want to make sure that those who are in need of help get the help they want.</p></speech>

Regarding the exceptional needs payment, does she have a statistic for the number of people who have been rejected by the community welfare officer for a payment?  What proportion of people are successful in getting an exceptional needs payment and what proportion have been rejected?  Second, why is there no appeals process directly to the community welfare officer on a rejection?  One has to go to another department to appeal it.  It appears to be the only payment that does not have an appeals process.</p> <p>  The second issue is the return to signing on at post offices.  I am looking at a newspaper headline that I find extremely objectionable, "Return to 'signing on' at post offices to reduce welfare fraud".  The article quotes the Minister in this regard, saying that one of reasons was to increase footfall in the post offices and the other was to reduce fraud.  Are there any other circumstances where people are getting payments from the State where the reason the payments have been brought back to a physical premises is on the basis of fraud?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#D00600"><p>I will refer to the issue of the post office.  What we are doing is returning to the system that was in place prior to Covid-19.  It has always been the case that jobseekers, prior to Covid-19, collected their payments in the post office.  This is about supporting the post office network, which is an integral part of the community throughout the country.  It is not just post offices in rural areas, but also post offices in the inner city.  I spoke to a postmaster in the inner city and he outlined the need to support the post offices and increase the footfall to make sure they continue to be viable into the future.  I met with the Irish Postmasters' Union and An Post and they were very clear that the loss of footfall for these payments was having a severe impact on post offices, both rural and urban.  Deputies on all sides of the House have called on the Government to put more services into the post offices.  Here is an example of that happening.</p><p>As I said before, the postmasters and the postmistresses do great work the length and breadth of this country.  As Minister for Social Protection and as Minister for Rural and Community Development, I want to support them.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton is working to look at what other services can be provided via the post office network.  I am happy to work with her on that.  We know from the past, and the Deputy knows it himself, that if you do not use the services, you lose them.  This was an opportunity to put some services into the post offices.  I believe it was the right thing to do.  If there are some people out there who, for whatever particular reason, cannot attend the post office they should contact their local Intreo office.  We will deal with them individually.</p><p> I have outlined what is available under the essential needs payment.  We pay 4,000 to 5,000 essential needs payments per month across a range of categories, including heating, clothing, housing and funeral bills.  The level of essential needs payments was lower than usual during the pandemic.  It is usually closer to 8,000 per month.  Therefore, it has been lower.  However, it is available.  While we do not have the numbers of rejections, it is fair to say that most community welfare officers do a very good job.  They understand the needs of the people who come into them.  There is a review mechanism built into the system.  There is another higher grade officer who deals with any reviews or any appeals people might have.  We have a process in place whereby a decision can be reviewed if people are not happy with the outcome.</p></speech>

I did not ask about the post offices.  I asked about the specific reference the Minister made relating to the two reasons.  I did not ask about the post office one; I asked about the fraud one.  Are there any other circumstances where a social welfare payment or any other payment that is made is included in a press release, which in this case states that one of the two reasons signing on at the post office was brought back related to fraud.  It demonises people who are on social welfare payments.  One of the two specific reasons given for bringing back signing on in the post office was to increase footfall in post offices, which I have no problem with, but that is not the one I asked.  The specific question was around fraud and the use of language in the context of bringing people back into post offices, where it specifically quotes the Minister in relation to those two reasons, one of which is fraud.</p> <p>  Will the Minister provide us with the statistics of the rejection of claims for the essential needs payment?  Is that statistic or figure available?  Again, there is no appeals system directly to the essential needs department.  A rejection has to be appealed to another department.</p></speech>

As I said, a person can appeal to another department if he or she is not happy with the outcome.  Rather than going back to the same person, he or she can appeal to another higher grade officer who deals with that.</p> <p>  I will go back to the issue of the post offices.  Just to be very clear here, we have a control system within the Department of Social Protection.  I am sure the Deputy is well aware there were some very high-profile cases where people had been claiming social welfare while not living in the country.  If a person has to present at the post office, that means he or she has to be in the country.  The vast majority of people who get social welfare payments deserve them.  That is a fact.  There are those, and we saw a case in the news only last night, who claim social welfare to which they are not entitled or who claim it on behalf of others when they should not be doing so.  We have a control unit and we crack down on that because this is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We have to be conscious of that.  I would say once again that the vast majority of people, and there are many of them, who receive social payments are well entitled to them and deserve every penny that they get.  I just wish to be clear on that and I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#E00400"><p>On the essential needs payment, one of the challenges, in my experience of how it has changed over the years, is that the welfare officers, as they used to be called, used to have huge discretion to help a person if there was poverty, and it was not on the basis of a means test.  That meant they could a family who had income coming into the house, which may have been a reasonably good income, but where there were serious addiction problems that meant partners and children were losing out greatly and were absolutely stuck for cash.</p> <p>  I was there when the change took place.  It was always funded by social welfare, but the administration used the HSE.  When it came into the Department, I was assured that would not change and the local community welfare officers would be left as they were.  For example, in our case in Connemara, we had somebody who was based in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, An Cloch&aacute;n, and in north Connemara.  The reality was it was all retreated into the main social welfare offices.  It meant people had to go 30 or 40 miles, in some cases, to access it.</p> <p>  The second thing is, the community welfare officers used to go around and do clinics in local health centres.  I know the world has changed, but for the most vulnerable it has not changed as much as it might have for some of us, and we have to take this into account.</p> <p>  My experience of essential needs payments at the moment is twofold.  One is that a person gets an essential needs payment on a means-tested basis if he or she is waiting for a payment to come through.  If he or she is waiting for invalidity pension, disability allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to come through, that person can apply for an essential needs payment.  In that case, of course, when he or she gets the payment, they claw back the amount that had been paid on the supplementary welfare system.  It is therefore very hard to see what were the discretionary extra payments because of severe hardship.</p> <p>  Second, will the Minister confirm that people have to fill a form, which I think is eight pages in length - basically a means test like would have to be done for any social welfare scheme - to get the essential needs payments now?  I do not think it is the way it used to be.  It is very hard to drill into the figures, because when you ask for figures from the Department, it mixes various things.  We are told it does not have the heading of the old-fashioned essential needs payment, that is, somebody who may have an income but has a circumstance that means he or she literally has no money.  It was a great safety net to prevent poverty.  I think the Department thought it was a little bit expensive; I do not think it was.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  A second, bigger and wider question in terms of big policy, the other one being a change that could be made quite simply by going back to the people to make sure there is a safety net there that, irrespective of circumstance, just measures up the circumstances and makes a payment, is whether there is any work ongoing on a policy basis to change radically the supports for working-age recipients?  I understood ten or fifteen years ago this work was ongoing and they were looking at introducing a uniform, universal working-age payment.  Then there was the debate, for which I have great sympathy, about a universal basic payment and integrating the social welfare system with the tax system so that there would be a clear, coherent interface and not two systems working at odds with each other.</p> <p>  The situation at the moment is there are many crinkles in the system.  There are a lot of anomalies.  More importantly, there are massive disincentives to work.  The Minister knows my hang-up on this.  If you are self-employed, it is a 100% disincentive to work.  If you are a farmer, it is 70%.  Let us take another case that is quite common, where one person in a couple is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  If the partner has get up and go and gets part-time work, there is a penalty, effectively a tax.  Let us call it tax, although if I called it a tax, there would be uproar, but when it is only a social welfare clawback, it does not seem to hurt the State's thinking quite as much.</p><p>When it is only a social welfare clawback, it does not seem to hurt the State's thinking quite as much.  It is amazing.  It is the old Victorian attitude.  Our social welfare system was a hotchpotch created over 100 years.</p><p> I will give a few examples.  For a couple on jobseeker's allowance where the dependent adult takes up work and gets &euro;150 per week, the jobseeker's payment is reduced by &euro;54, effectively a 33% penalty or tax on the jobseeker's allowance or family income.  If the income goes to &euro;200, the clawback becomes &euro;84, which is effectively a 42% tax, not to mind that at this stage one runs into USC costs.  If the income goes to &euro;300, the clawback or tax becomes 48% or &euro;144.  People talk about incentives to work and encouraging people.  We all know that if someone on a basic income, which jobseeker's allowance should be, could raise the family income by &euro;300, it would do an awful lot to eliminate poverty and create great incentive.  At the present rate, one is taxed at 48%, higher than the highest rate of tax in this country, and is also subject on that income to USC, because 50 times 300 is over 13,000 so there is no exemption.  There is no tax rate in the country that is 48%, except this tax in these circumstances.</p><p> It is time we thought it all out again, rather than just tinkering with it, going through the Estimates and looking at how many euro are here and there.  Is there high level work or did they suspend the work that was going on many years ago to look at the issue so there would be an interface between tax and the social welfare system that would be coherent and mean that people were not running into poverty traps that hit many of them as they try to get out of poverty and improve themselves?</p></speech>

The issue of the incentive to work in relation to tax and the social welfare system is something the Deputy has great knowledge of and keen interest in.  I have met him concerning a number of suggestions he has put forward.  My officials are working on those, particularly in relation to the means test.  I was delighted to be able to make some changes to the means test, particularly for carers, in the last budget.  It is in the programme for Government that we are committed to a universal working age payment.  My officials are working on that.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we should have a system wherein people are incentivised to go back to work if for no other reasons than going to work is good for mental health and helps bring people out of poverty.  The more we can do to get people back into work the better for our society.  We have huge demand in the labour market at the minute.  Pathways to Work will help us in all the different ways we have in that strategy of getting people back into the workforce and giving them the confidence to go back.  For those who have been out of it for some time, it can be daunting.  The Department wants to help people there. </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the first &euro;100 of the spouse's income from employment being disregarded.  The Department has committed to preparing a paper on options to modify the jobseeker's allowance payment by using Revenue real-time earnings data to adjust payment levels in line with the person's weekly earning to guarantee a basic income floor and ensure that, in all cases, a person's income increases when he or she works.  We can do that and have that real-time contact with Revenue.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the essential needs payment.  The community welfare officers continue to look at the circumstances of each case.  Every case is different and those officers use their discretion when making payments to people in need.  They are not confined and have that discretion.  We have told them to expect people to come in because they are faced with higher fuel costs and such bills.  We encourage people to visit the community welfare officer if they have problems in that area.  On essential needs applications, we are reviewing all the supplementary welfare allowance applications forms and trying to make them more customer-friendly, and rightly so.  I thank the Deputy for his questions.</p></speech>

One is on exceptional needs, which has been discussed.  That is a more important payment now, given that it is being relied on around high energy costs.  I have raised it with the Minister before.  I cannot understand why we cannot collect the data.  I am not accusing, saying community welfare officers are not doing their job or that there are any issues there, but it would be important to collect the data on the number of people seeking payments under exceptional needs and the numbers that are and are not getting them.  We collect data across the Department of Social Protection on almost everything and I ask the Minister to reconsider that.</p> <p>  Typically, those in full-time work over 30 hours per week cannot access exceptional needs payment.  There is an issue there, particularly when it comes to energy costs.  Those who receive the fuel allowance will see a gain in early March, which is welcome.  All others, particularly workers, will not be able to access that support.  Aside from the &euro;200 electricity credit, those workers have no assistance when it comes to heating and do not have assistance through the exceptional needs payment.  Will there be flexibility regarding that element of exceptional needs?</p> <p>  I did not realise this came under it and it is not something I have dealt with before but an issue has been raised with me on the deserted wife's benefit and access to fuel allowance.  I know deserted wife's benefit is a closed scheme but someone on that is allowed to earn &euro;120 on top of it and receive the fuel allowance; someone on the State pension can also earn &euro;120 and access the fuel allowance.  There is a difference because someone on the State pension is on a higher amount.  If you are on deserted wife's benefit at about &euro;213, when you earn that &euro;120, it is a lesser amount than those on the State pension who can earn &euro;120.  I have emailed the Minister on the matter.  I know it is not straightforward but I ask that she look at that.  Those on deserted wife's benefit should be able to earn the same amount as those on the State pension and access fuel allowance.  It is an important payment for them and their households.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

I will look at the deserted wife's benefit that she has raised.  On the fuel allowance, two pensioners over age 66 can receive up to &euro;600 per week and qualify for that allowance; a couple under 66 can receive an income of &euro;542 per week and qualify for it.  I take the Deputy's point on deserted wife's benefit.  The scheme has been closed and it is a smaller number of people.  I will look at that.</p> <p>  Going back to the urgent needs payments, it can be made.</p><p>My officials here have told community welfare officers to look at this.  We can provide flexibility because if there are exceptional or urgent needs payments, nobody wants to see anybody going without.  That is the bottom line.  We are here to help people and are doing that across the length and breadth of the country.  If there is any particular case where it is felt that somebody did not get what he or she was entitled to, if it is brought to my attention I will be happy to look into it.  We will certainly do everything we can because I know there are challenges out there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#G00200"><p>I do not believe that in principle there is a reluctance in the Department to facilitate supplementary welfare supports.  I know the Minister is committed to ensuring this is as flexible as possible but the reality on the ground is different.  The first thing I would ask her to do as a matter of urgency is to have a remote meeting with every community welfare officer in the country to relay to each and every one of them that they need to be as flexible as possible regarding financial supports for families that are struggling.  The difficulty is that we as Members of the Oireachtas are finding individual cases where people are being denied supports and there is no measure to reflect that in the statistics provided by the Department.  The fact is that if any community welfare officer deviates from the means-tested support, that has to be accounted for separately within the Department.  We are asking for this information to be directly collated and provided to the Oireachtas.  The Minister needs to relay to each community welfare officer in the country that this is being measured.</p> <p>  There should be adequate income going into every household.  That is the objective behind the social welfare system.  We can talk all day about whether that is adequate or about anomalies.  The reality, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has noted, is that there are addiction issues in households where there is allegedly sufficient income going into that household.  We have all come across cases of coercive control where there is sufficient income going into the house but the mother and children are not the ones receiving that money.  We see it with regard to domestic abuse.  If the Government is clearly stating that it wants to take a different approach to gender-based violence, it must start with flexibility regarding this payment.  It is not just about a different approach being taken by community welfare officers.  I can give the Minister examples of the very worthwhile system she has put in place regarding the rent allowance scheme for victims of domestic violence where that has been denied by community welfare officers because they were not aware of the scheme.  If they are not aware of the something very basic like that, my concern is that some of them will not be aware of the comments the Minister is making about the flexible approach that should be taken with exceptional needs payments.</p> <p>  We need community welfare officers to go back out into local communities.  It is pointless to expect a family with no access to money to do a round trip of between 50 and 80 miles to get to a community welfare officer - they do not have the money to put petrol in the car to get there in the first place.  If there are issues relating to coercive control, a person will not have access to the information to fill out the six-page form.  That person may not have access to a phone to make that call in the first place.  Community welfare officers need to take a far more flexible approach.  I ask the Minister to have a remote meeting with every community welfare officer in the country before the end of this month and clearly convey to them her priority and that of Government and every Member of the Oireachtas.  </p></speech>

All community welfare officers have been notified that more people may not be able to meet their costs and that decisions need to take all circumstances into account.  This has been relayed.  As the Chairman well knows, my job as Minister involves setting policy.  It is the job of the Executive and staff to implement that policy.  I have been very clear today that community welfare officers are there to support people in administering the supplementary welfare allowance and exceptional needs payments.  That is their job.  We are here to help people when they need it.  There will always be specific cases where somebody is not happy with the outcome.  There is a system whereby it can be reviewed and I give Deputies a commitment that if they have specific cases, they should bring them to my attention and I will speak to them about them.  I am very clear here today that all community welfare officers have been notified and that decisions need to take account of all circumstances.  I do not know of any but there may be some out there.  The vast majority of community welfare officers are doing a good job on the ground.  I know they are in contact with MABS.  If they pick up the phone, MABS can get in contact with them.  I do not think I have yet found a case where a community welfare officer did not take on board the recommendation of MABS.  I have been dealing with MABS through the credit union and with community welfare officers for a very long time.  All officials with whom I have been in contact have been officials of the highest integrity who are there to help people.  I want that to continue.</p></speech>

I am, therefore, unable to answer specific questions about any matters pertaining to the procurement process.  The deadline for tenders is 21 March.  My Department has amended phase 2 to take into account many of the issues raised following phase 1.  Changes have been made to the evaluation criteria with more marks awarded to social value.  Other changes include increased minimum referrals, up-front payments and a reduction in reference contracts and turnover requirements.  As we all know, the legal advice is clear.  I have advised the committee and the D&aacute;il.  I have no choice but to have an open and competitive procurement process for employment services and my Department must comply with its legal obligations.  We are procuring a new local area employment service in two distinct phases.  Phase 1 is the process for procuring new employment services and involves seven counties in the midlands and the north west without a local employment service.  Contracts were signed last December and services are in the process of being mobilised.  Phase 2 has commenced.  We published the request for tender in December.  It involves 17 lots covering 19 counties.  The closing date for tenders is 21 March.</p><p>That provides additional time for organisations to work collaboratively together.  Services for this phase are due to begin in July 2022.  The evaluation of bids for both phases is based on the quality of service offered and an organisation's ability to work with a range of local partners and stakeholder networks in the best interest of their clients.</p><p> I am aware of media reports referring to the potential involvement of certain multinational companies.  Obviously, I cannot comment on potential bids in what is a live procurement process.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that 80% of the award criteria marks in the local employment service requests for tender are dependent on the quality of the service, community linkages, and impact on social value.  I am confident community-based providers who work collaboratively and submit high-quality competitive bids will be in a strong competitive position to secure a contract under phase 2.  This "quality first" approach will ensure that, as we expand employment services throughout the State, we retain a focus on providing the best possible service to the long-term unemployed.  Our priority is to provide the service to the customer.</p><p> I know some people are concerned that there will be a loss of community focus.  That is not my intention nor my Department's intention.  I instructed my officials that these employment services must have a strong local focus, and this will be evaluated as part of the tender evaluation process.  I am pleased the RFT reflected these instructions.  I wanted to make sure that community focus was there.  I have responsibility for all communities across the State.  Currently, there are no local employment services in 14 counties and only partial coverage in some of the other counties, such as Galway and Wicklow.  By summertime, I expect all 26 counties to have an appropriate service for the long-term unemployed.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I hope I answered all the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

It is, of course, welcome to see increases in expenditure for 2022 across the board.  They are very important.  A commitment was made late last year when the changes to the community employment scheme, CES, and rural social scheme, RSS, were announced, one of which was a significant increase in referrals.  I understand the Department will look at how it can ramp up referrals across those three important schemes, which are particularly important in rural areas for rural services.  I understand a review of the rural social scheme is to take place this year.  I would like an update on that because it is very important.</p> <p>  I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been out on the ground and has met with people - I have seen that myself online - and that is important.  Many of the tweaks and changes that are needed particularly in regard to the RSS and T&uacute;s could be made by simply engaging with the co-ordinators and the supervisors without a long drawn-out review.  I appreciate the RSS will be reviewed.  That needs to be done in a timely manner.  I ask that an update be given on that.</p> <p>  I raised the issue of the referrals many times.  The last time I raised this, there were 1,900 community employment scheme vacancies online.  I am looking at the details online now and they state there are 2,967 community employment scheme places available.  This referrals issue is at crisis point when there nearly 3,000 CE vacancies.  This needs to be looked at.  Further to what was announced on referrals, will the Minister give an update on how that will work and how they will be significantly raised, because this is urgent?  She knows the jobs that are advertised for the community employment scheme and how important they are to services, in particular, in our communities.</p> <p>  As to the six-year rule, the impact of that has not been seen yet, but there will be an impact.  I know this issue has also been raised with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, by those on the ground.  It is an issue that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  My position on local employment services and jobs clubs is well known.  I want to make the following point because the Minister and others have repeatedly said the legal advice leaves them with no choice.  That is fine.  If we take that as being read, that is fine.  But there was no legal advice on changing the model, and that is the problem.  I do not care about how it is procured or that it was necessary.  The model was a community-based not-for-profit model.  If there were issues in some local employment services or jobs clubs, and they were not meeting the targets they should have been meeting, that could have been looked at.  They could have been spoken to and changes could have been made.</p> <p>  There was a commitment in the programme for Government to extend the job activation, including local employment services, and that could have been done without totally changing the model.  We have seen what happens when profit is involved and private companies come in.  We have seen it with JobPath, with a success rate of 6.8% as regards people gaining employment that lasts for one year.  That has been at a massive cost, more than &euro;250 million of taxpayers' money, for a success rate of 6.8%.  It makes no sense.  I know companies like JobPath are and will be procuring for these new services, and I would love to see their community linkages.  As I said before, what is happening is a big mistake.  I believe we will look back on it and wish we had done it differently.</p> <p>  I refer to redundancy for people in jobs clubs and local employment services who do not want to move to the private for-profit model.  Some of them have given 20 to 25 years of service and they deserve better than the redundancy available through the State.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  These people have given so much to their communities over many years and they deserve better as regards redundancy if they decide to leave.</p></speech>

As to JobPath, some 324,000 customers have engaged with the service.  The average cost per participant is &euro;873, excluding VAT.  A total of 69,000 people found full-time employment.  The fees are paid when an individual gains and sustains employment.  The local employment service request for tender is a completely different contract.  It is totally different to JobPath.</p> <p>  I know some people do not like the JobPath model.  I have spoken to our advisors on the Labour Market Advisory Council and they have said that JobPath works.  In a recent report by the OECD, in January 2022, it reiterated the point that JobPath led to a higher employment and earning outcomes for those who engaged with the service.  We are not going to agree on everything.  This is one area in which we believe we get results.  It is important to help people get back into the workplace, more so now than ever.</p> <p>  The Department has undertaken extensive reviews of the JobPath service.  It has been the subject of independent customer reviews, and econometric reviews and analysis by the OECD and the Comptroller and Auditor General, and it was consistently found to perform at a high level.  However, I continue to review all our employment service provisions, including JobPath.  As the Deputy knows, JobPath services finish at the end of June.</p> <p>  The legal advice was clear in that we had to put the local employment services out to tender through public procurement.  I did not have a choice; I had to do that.  We have engaged extensively with stakeholders during that period.  The request for tenders has been made at this stage, therefore, I cannot say any more on that.  I will hand over to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, who will speak about the community employment schemes and T&uacute;s.</p></speech>

On the initial question on community employment scheme vacancies and referrals, it is probably worth reiterating the changes that were made just before Christmas because they have made a very significant impact.  The CE baseline year was increased from 2007 to 2014.  That baseline will be maintained at seven years behind the current year into the future.  That will have a significant impact on people&rsquo;s ability to stay on CE schemes if they so wish.</p> <p>  The service support stream has also been expanded significantly.  When people turn 60 rather than 62, they can continue on a CE scheme until State pension age.  There was previously a cap on that number which we have also removed.  These two changes will certainly remove the worry of many regarding CE schemes nationally.  In addition, for a transitionary period, we have provided that in exceptional circumstances, where a CE vacancy is on the horizon and it is proving difficult to find a replacement, and for a temporary period the person can stay on the placement if he or she so wishes.  That is particularly important for key essential services in which CE schemes are involved.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to a number of vacancies.  It is important to keep in the mix that if we compare the current number of CE participants with the number in pre-Covid times, they are very similar.  Many of the vacancy numbers the Deputy cited are connected to the fact that we introduced 3,000 additional places as part of the July jobs stimulus package.  Some of these have been filled.  On referral rates, the activation service ramped up significantly in the autumn of last year.  Referral rates shot up in September and October.  The number of CE referrals at the end of January was 2,896, which is significant, although obviously not all of them are accepted.  We would like to see a higher level of acceptance among the CE referrals we make as part of the changes, acknowledging also that they need to be appropriate referrals.  </p> <p>  While the position has stabilised now in respect of CE numbers, it should be noted that there will be a large number of exits in the 12-month period from April this year until May next year.</p> <p>  The rural social scheme is a fantastic scheme.  I have visited a number of projects on the ground in the past number of weeks.  It has great potential.  I was in the Mayo area last week looking at how the scheme can also actually play a significant role in the Government&rsquo;s commitments on the protection of biodiversity, climate action and environmental protection.  There were some significant changes in that regard in the budget.  To qualify for the rural social scheme, applicants need to be on the farm assist payment.  We have opened up a range of other agri-environment schemes that will allow for a greater income disregard in the qualifications for the farm assist payment.  If, for example, farmers are interested or involved in the agri-forestry scheme, the ash dieback scheme or other approved schemes, and a range of other schemes, the income disregard will be increased if they apply for the farm assist payment.  That should open up the scheme.  </p> <p>  With that in mind, we have allocated an additional budget for a potential increase in the number of applications for farm assist payments.  Consequently, as I have said, these changes will not come into force until June.  We will not initiate a review process until we see what the impact of those changes will be.  From my point of view, I am considering what a review might look like.  I will also look at the opportunities for rural social schemes as they a play key role, particularly in some of the rural counties.</p> <p>  We have regular operational reform meetings which the Minister and I attend to get feedback from the ground on issues with community employment schemes, T&uacute;s and the RSS.  The next meeting will be held in the coming weeks.  We keep abreast of the issues that regularly arise in the programmes on the ground and also make on-site visits.</p> <p>  I believe I have addressed the majority of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.  If not, I ask her to let me know.</p></speech>

It has been well made by Deputies Carey and Kerrane and I broadly agree with them.  I have the same concern that we are marketising social services.  I fully accept and take the Minister at her word on the legal advice she received but this is a concern for the future.  It is welcome that this committee has taken an ongoing watching brief in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Kerrane beat me to the RSS issue as well.  One thing that jumped out at me, which the Minister of State mentioned, is the ecological services the scheme can provide.  One of the other measures listed is energy conservation work for older people and those at risk of poverty.  That especially jumped out at me given the retrofitting announcement made during the week, in particular, with regard to smaller interventions that are now 80% grant-aided.  These include measures such as attic insulation, which might not require the same level of qualification as is required to do a full deep retrofit.  I know that sourcing contractors for that kind of small-scale work will be one of the challenges facing the retrofitting scheme.  It jumped out at me, therefore, that this is an opportunity.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, will comment.</p> <p>  On the back to education allowance, it is very welcome that funding is close to doubling.  Will the Minister provide more detail on where the people availing of the allowance are going?  What courses are they attending and what is the planned outcome from those courses?  Are we taking an active role in directing people towards specific courses or are we taking the view that all back to education is good?  There is probably a middle ground to be found in that respect.  We know there are skills shortages in particular areas.  It would be interesting to see the Department directing people towards courses where we know those skills shortages are.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to comment briefly on the work placement experience programme, which was announced as part of the July jobs stimulus package.  It is a very welcome move.  Is it receiving the level of employer interest we need to ensure take-up of the programme?  Have safeguards been put in place to ensure we do not undercut the pay and conditions of other staff through the workplace experience programme?  Do we have the necessary safeguarding in place?  I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

I will give some further reassurances on the local area employment services.  I hear the Deputies comments and I am taking them on board.  We have been down this road a few times and the legal advice from the Attorney General is very clear.  These services have to go to tender.  In the first phase, community organisations won out in two of the three areas i which they submitted bids.  That shows clearly that community organisations can win these contracts.  As the Deputies will know, the requests for tenders for phase 2 were published in December.  Following feedback from the sector, a number of changes were made in the requests for tender, including increasing the marks awarded for quality to 80% and reducing the cost to 20% from 25% in phase 1.  There is also a minimum cost component in the request for tender below which no bids are accepted.  This dilutes the significance of the cost element in the request for tender.  We have now done that.</p> <p>  The tender for phase 2 also contains significant increases in the minimum annual referral numbers.  These are all issues that members have raised with me.  The requirements for reference contracts and minimum turnover have also been reduced.  The number of lots has been increased under phase 2 based on feedback.  Between phase 1 and phase 2, the total number of lots is now 21.  The lots and the geographic areas are now much smaller, with many of them mirroring D&aacute;il constituencies or the areas covered by education and training boards, ETBs.  For example, we have Cavan-Monaghan, Louth-Meath and Carlow-Kilkenny.</p><p>It is no longer a regional service, which is why it is now called the local area employment service.</p><p> The Department has also extended the period for parties to make a submission to the request for tender.  The deadline is 29 March.  This was done at was at the request of stakeholders to give them additional time to work collaboratively on submitting joint bids.  Many in the sector have welcomed these changes.  In my opinion, the existing providers are in an excellent position to bid successfully for the new local area employment service.  As I said, 80% of evaluation marks will be awarded based on quality community linkages and social value.  I know there are concerns and I reassure Deputies that I have taken them on board and incorporated many of them in phase 2.  </p><p> There was a question on the workplace experience programme.  Covid meant the take-up of the programme was not as great as we had expected.  Obviously, many sectors were just trying to keep going during Covid and did not take up the offer.  I had intended to hold road shows around the country to create awareness so that employers and people looking for work could be connected.  We anticipate that participation in the programme will continue to increase over the coming months.  Public sector bodies will be invited to support the programme.</p><p> The Department commenced a public information campaign designed to inform employers, business owners and jobseekers about the work placement experience programme.  I intend to go around the country and I would be happy for Deputies to join me at any of the events we will hold, if I am in their area, to raise awareness.  We want to connect people who are looking for work with those who want workers.  There are different incentives both to employers and those who are currently on jobseeker's payments who will get extra money for availing of these programmes.  I would like to think there will be a keen interest in that in the coming months.  I think I have covered all the questions.  I will pass over to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

There is certainly potential for the RSS to be involved in community-based retrofitting projects.  It needs that community-based link.  However, the big potential in retrofitting could be in community employment because it has a training element whereas RSS does not.  There were to be four ETB centres of excellence in retrofitting around the country.  I think they are all established now.  Some of the retrofitting proposed in the Government's plan published last week is shallow retrofitting.  People can be trained in that in relatively short courses.  There is potential for community employment participants to take retrofitting courses that can be undertaken in a relatively short period and ultimately go into employment, which is a big aim of community employment schemes.</p></speech>

The back to education allowance scheme is a second chance education support for jobseekers and people currently in receipt of the qualifying social welfare payments to undertake full-time second or third level education courses and retain access to the welfare payment.  The scheme's main objective is to raise the education and skill levels of the unemployed individuals to help them to progress from unemployment to employment.  The qualifying period for the second level option is three months and the qualifying period for third level courses is nine months prior to the date of the commencement of the course.  We have waived that period for those in receipt of the PUP who can avail of the back to education scheme to commence a new course of education.  Unlike existing social welfare recipients, no qualifying period is required.  They can go straight in and apply for a back to education payment.</p> <p>  The Department had a provision of &euro;96.5 million for 2021.  That has been increased to &euro;105.4 million for 2022.  This represents a considerable investment in supporting participants to acquire the necessary education and skills to re-enter the labour market.  The total number of scheme recipients, as at 31 December 2021, was 5,545.  The recipients are broken down into 4,300 on jobseeker's allowance, 450 on jobseeker's benefit and 800 based on other qualifying Department of Social Protection payments.  Currently, 86% of total recipients had been on jobseeker's supports previously.  As part of the Government's pathways to work strategy, there is a commitment to increase participation and funding under the scheme to 7,000 people.</p> <p>  The back to education scheme was originally intended for people who might not have completed secondary education and wanted to get back to work.  I do not know what sectors the participants are going into.  I do not have that information.  I hope that information is helpful.</p></speech>

The other issue is the privatisation of fundamental services.  I have serious concerns about that trend over the last 20 or 30 years.</p> <p>  I have been on a hobby horse for a long time.  I still find we are up against the same reluctance to change based on old attitudes and for no rational reason.  I really welcome the changes in community employment and the easing of conditions around staying on the schemes.  However, I still cannot get my head around how, on a big policy issue, the State believes it has to ration the right of people who are unemployed and getting a payment to make a contribution to the State through the provision of services.</p> <p>  Let us start with the RSS.  Only about 5,000 farmers are on RSS.  I cannot understand why all those who wish to go on the RSS cannot be accommodated.  We could not get a tsunami of applications.  That would not happen because some farmers are on farm assist and will not go on the RSS for whatever reason.  Instead, we went backwards.  At least, when people went on the scheme previously, they could stay on it because it is not an activation scheme.  Now there is a six-year cap, which I know was introduced before the Minister's time.</p> <p>  I have no doubt that if we were to create useful occupation for everybody who is eligible - I am obviously talking about eligible people - the advantages would outweigh any cost.  The cost is the difference between people being on the scheme and getting a little extra in wage and supervision costs etc. and paying them out money on the basis that they do not actively engage in part-time employment, on penalty of very serious means tests.  That is the cost.  It is quite modest.  I think the cost was calculated for T&uacute;s, which is a cheaper scheme than community employment, at about &euro;5,000 per participant per annum.  What is the upside?  Let us look first at the health service.</p><p>It is well recognised in the Department - very good evidence is available on the matter - that people who are forcibly unemployed suffer much higher morbidity and mortality, go to the doctor more often and take more medicines.  More importantly, however, there is also evidence that when people get employment there is a 99% improvement in the medical conditions they have that are caused by forced idleness.  We all know the social cost of forced idleness to the Department, but the problem lies probably in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, where there is a deeply inset mindset that it would be just too radical by half to suggest that it would be much better if everybody on jobseeker's allowance long term, that is, for over a year, in other words those eligible for a scheme, were able to engage for a very modest amount of money, if they so wished, in providing services in their communities.  It is a matter of measuring up the invisible costs in health, well-being and family issues.  For example, we know that people who are unemployed smoke more cigarettes.  That is a health issue.  Then there are all the other issues when people are cooped up with no money.  It is a matter of weighing all those invisible costs, which are nonetheless huge costs on society.  We are also damaging people's well-being, all because we somehow cannot find the money, even though there are useful things that could be done in the community to improve community life.  I do not believe it would cost any money in net terms if those things were done.</p><p> We need to start thinking big, breaking down the walls that have been there for a long time.  One of the reasons the rural social scheme got transferred into the Department with responsibility for social welfare is a syndrome the Minister of State is probably aware of.  He knows what happens when one Department goes for money.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will look at the cost to that Department.  However, when schemes come under two different Departments, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform never looks at the saving to be made to the other Department.  Then there is bailiwicking between the Departments.  Therefore, the reason all these schemes got transferred into one Department in 2010 was that at least there is a stop to the internecine strife between Departments, as if they were defending some great empire they had protected against another empire, that being another Department, when that was all meant to be subject to one Government.  The Minister of State knows this and has seen the system fight like tigers to preserve what little they have to preserve.</p><p> There is a reason the rural social scheme comes under one Department.  Previously, there was not that problem because there was only a transfer between two subheads.  In the case of the Minister of State's Department, all that would happen if enough scheme places were created for those who wanted them - I am not talking about workfare; I am talking about those who want places on the scheme - would be that the Department would have to take some money out of its jobseeker's allowance budget, put it into the community schemes budget, which is what we are debating now, and come up with a little extra money.  That would save on health costs, well-being costs and social welfare costs under other headings.</p></speech>

We have almost 400 vacancies on the scheme.  We will look at the six-year cap as part of the review.  The RSS is an optional scheme.  It is important to say again that we have more places than we can fill at the moment.  I am interested in seeing how we can broaden out the scheme and get more people involved because, from my knowledge of it to date, it is an income support measure as well as very much a social inclusion and community development measure.  It has real, positive impacts on people's lives, particularly in isolated rural communities.  They have the opportunity to get involved in group work and community work in the community and engage with communities where social isolation is a big problem.  My understanding of the rural social scheme is that if one is part-time farming, that is, underemployed in farming, the scheme will facilitate community work as well.  I do not necessarily see this as being penalised for doing additional part-time work because my understanding is that most participants will have some part-time work on the farm and then will do other part-time work in the community under the rural social scheme.  However, I take the Deputy's broader points about the health, well-being and family issues on which engagement in schemes like this can have a positive impact.  We will think broadly about the review of the rural social scheme later this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#L00300"><p>I will make one brief point.  I am not surprised the Department is finding it hard to get people onto the rural social scheme at the moment.  A change was made when the six-year cap was brought in.  That cap, judging from what the Minister of State says, is now totally unnecessary because the Department does not have an over-demand for places, which was the argument in favour of the cap, that is, to create churn.  However, it also created uncertainty for people in their lives.</p> <p>  The reason there is no demand for the scheme is quite simple.  Initially, when one went on the scheme, as long as one qualified one got the payment because one was doing 19 and a half hours' work.  One got the full basic rate for oneself, for one's partner if one had a partner and if he or she was a dependent adult, and for the children.  Then the Department changed the scheme.  This affects people with partners; it does not affect single people.</p> <p>  The Department told people they would get the basic rate of &euro;203.  If, however, one has a dependent adult or a dependent child, the only benefit of going on the scheme is the top-up of payment of something over &euro;20 a week.  So people on the scheme do 19 and a half hours' work for a &euro;20 payment.  When they take up employment, even on this scheme, the Department claws the whole thing back off them.  If they earn &euro;100 a week on their farm, which is not a huge farm income, the Department effectively takes &euro;80 off the payment.  That is all it pays them, net.</p> <p>  Who is going to work 19 and a half hours a week for &euro;20?  There was a huge demand for the scheme before that because these are farmers who, no matter what they do with their land, will never be independent of some other off-farm income.  That is just a fact.  Before that, once people qualified, they got the full payment for the 19 and a half hours and got free of the means test that bedevilled them under the farm assist in respect of the claw-back of 70%.  I suggest that the Minister gets out the rules as they were originally written and the changes that were made and looks at them.  I think that was in 2016.  I will sit down with him anytime and go through that with him - because the first rules did not happen by coincidence or chance - and I think he will see that it is totally unattractive to go onto the RSS if one has a partner or dependent children.</p></speech>

There will be further incentives come June with the income disregards in respect of the other agri-environment schemes.  We will see what impact that will have.  However, incentivisation has to be part of the mix when we are looking at this in the broader review later this year.  I would be glad to sit down with the Deputy and to discuss his perspectives in more detail.</p></speech>

We will leave it there, however.  I look forward to meeting the Minister of State to go through the detail and to give him real-life cases of how this thing works as just a total switch-off for people.  Nobody is going to work 19 and half hours for &euro;22.</p></speech>

With the discretion of the committee, I will come in before other members because I have to go into the D&aacute;il in a few minutes to speak about people with disabilities.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two issues with the Minister.  The first is one I raised during the passage of the social protection legislation before Christmas and relates to the half-rate carer's allowance, specifically people who are in receipt of the State contributory pension and who receive the half-rate carer's allowance.</p><p>They are denied access to the fuel allowance scheme.</p><p> There is an anomaly within the social welfare code that discriminates against that cohort of people.  If that person was in receipt of a non-contributory State pension, along with the half-rate carer's allowance, he or she would receive the fuel allowance.  Even though these people's only income is from the State, since it happens to be a State contributory pension, they are denied access to the fuel allowance because the half-rate carer's allowance is, bizarrely, considered additional income.  The Minister gave a commitment in December that she would look at this anomaly.  Will she provide an update to the committee on that?</p><p> I flagged the issue of long Covid with the Minister's officials in advance.  We are talking about the enhanced illness benefit payment for people who are diagnosed with Covid.  The Oireachtas Library &amp;amp; Research Service produced a paper, which I commissioned, that has indicated there are 114,500 people in Ireland today with long Covid and rising.  This has a huge potential cost to the Minister's Department with regard to illness benefit and disability allowance claims, as well as an impact on workforce participation.</p><p> Long Covid has a disproportionate impact on women and people in their middle age.  We know, historically, that it is much harder to integrate people from those cohorts back in to the workforce after prolonged periods of absence from employment.  Based on figures the Minister's Department provided to me through a reply to parliamentary question, in September 2021, 767 people who had Covid for in excess of ten weeks, that is, people who had Covid symptoms for a considerable period of time, were in receipt of the enhanced illness benefit payment for an extended period.</p><p> Those figures have gone up, in the five months from September until now, to 4,314 receiving that payment on a long-term basis.  In the space of five months, the people who have been receiving the enhanced illness benefit payment for an extended period has gone up 562%.  That is before we have seen the impact of the Omicron variant, which will have a further significant impact on those claim numbers.  We face an avalanche of claims due to long Covid, even based on the Minister's statistics.</p><p> What measures are being taken by the Department to try to manage this to work with that cohort or people and assist them by providing supports and it is hoped, getting them back into work, either on a part-time or full-time basis, as quickly as possible?  If the Minister could address those two issues, I would appreciate it. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#M00200"><p>The reason we introduced the enhanced illness benefit was to prevent transmission.  We wanted people to stay at home and isolate, rather than go into work.  For that reason, we gave them an enhanced payment, which meant they had financial supports while they were not at work.  That was the primary reason for bringing in the enhanced illness benefit.  In terms of those who are ill beyond ten weeks, the standard illness benefit may be paid for an extended period based on the person's continued eligibility.  This is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.</p> <p>  It would be very difficult to pluck out Covid and I understand those who are suffering from it, but there are others who have other illnesses that last beyond ten weeks.  How can one say that Covid is having more of an impact on them than any other illness they may, unfortunately, get?  Some 1% of the enhanced illness benefit claims have reached the ten-week threshold.  We have paid out a significant amount on that and it was right and proper that we did so.  However, just 1% of the claims have reached the ten-week threshold.</p> <p>  There are numbers there, but to isolate them and treat them differently to other people who have other long-term illnesses would create an inequity.  That is the position.  Most people who are still recovering from Covid after ten weeks will transfer to the standard illness benefit.  If they do not meet the contribution criteria for this payment, they can apply for disability allowance, subject to a means test.  Some will not be eligible as the usual qualifying conditions were relaxed due to public health concerns.  People with a serious level of ill health where it can be expected to be permanent or to last a long time can apply for invalidity pension, subject to the contribution requirements.</p> <p>  I will move on to the half-rate carer's and fuel allowances.  I meet carers all the time, both in my constituency and through the carer organisations.  One of my priorities since becoming the Minister for Social Protection is to do whatever I can to support our carers.  The Deputy and I know well the huge work they do.  In budget 2021, as the Deputy is aware, I increased the carer's support grant to &euro;1,850.  It is at its highest level ever.  This year, I increased the weekly carer's allowance payment by &euro;5.</p> <p>  Most importantly, I brought in significant changes to the means test.  The Cathaoirleach raised that with me on a number of occasions.  He made some very valid points and I was delighted to be the first Minister in 14 years to do anything about the means test for carer's allowance.  It was something I was very passionate about.  That change means that all carers currently on reduced rate of payment will see their payment increase from next June.  It will also mean that tens of thousands of carers who did not qualify up to this point, due to the income thresholds, will now qualify for the payment.</p> <p>  The increase in the income disregard for a couple was also raised with me by the Cathaoirleach.  I wanted to improve on it because I was aware of many cases where a partner, usually a mother, might have to give her job up to care for a sick child.  However, because the husband was working or they had some savings, they did not qualify.  As a result of these changes I am making, a couple can earn up to &euro;750 per week and the first &euro;50,000 in savings will not be counted in the means test.  The family carers have welcomed that.</p> <p>  The Cathaoirleach asked about the half-rate carer's allowance and the fuel allowance.  We are working on a report on those.  As soon as we get that finished, we will publish it and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important to note that since 2013, the payment of half-rate carer's allowance does not automatically preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a qualifying, non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer's allowance, they are deemed to satisfy the means test and the fuel allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.</p> <p>  If a person is in receipt of a qualifying contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer's allowance, the value of the half-rate carer's allowance will be assessed in the means test for fuel allowance.  Half-rate carer's allowance, which is the same as &euro;131 for anybody aged 66 or over, is paid in addition to many social welfare payments at a rate significantly more than the weekly rate of the fuel allowance, which is payable at &euro;33.  However, I am committed to looking at this.  A report is being drawn up on it and when I get that report, it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

That is before we have had the impact of the Omicron variant, which is going to drive these figures significantly in excess of that level.  The point I make is that, as a country, we cannot ignore what we are about to experience.  We cannot ignore people with a disability, but this is something that is coming at us like a juggernaut.  We are getting a heads-up in relation to it, and we cannot be seen to sit on our hands regarding it.</p></speech>

She spoke about Covid demonstrating how flexible the social protection system can be.  I wish to raise one issue concerning those on illness benefit accessing the fuel allowance.  We know it is not a qualifying payment.  I will give an example of a gentleman who was in touch with me, who has a terminal illness.  He is on illness benefit.  I know he can go on to a longer term payment and then qualify for the fuel allowance, but rather than putting that on him, I am wondering about flexibility within the system.  I know that for a lot of these payments it is very black and white, but is it possible for sections within the Department to consider giving the fuel allowance to recipients of illness benefit where they are terminally ill?  I know it is difficult to pick between one illness and another for people who are on illness benefit because it varies so much but where the illness is terminal, would recipients be able to access the fuel allowance?  Is there any flexibility in regard to that or could it be looked at?</p> <p>  I also wish to raise the issue of accessing illness benefit for people who are in receipt of a widow's pension and are working.  They are working and paying PRSI.  I have two cases of women - it is typically women - with children who got Covid, and they could not get the Covid illness benefit payment, or any illness benefit.  They are widows and they are entitled to their widow's pension given the circumstances, but they are working and paying PRSI, and I do not think they should be locked out of illness benefit, which is a short-term payment.  There are not many such cases, but in a case I had where a woman with young children got sick with Covid, she could not get the payment.  I have raised this with the Minister previously, but I ask her again.  They have an entitlement to a widow's pension, which is right and proper, but they should not be locked out of something like illness benefit.  I do not think it would cost a lot of money as it would only arise in certain cases.  I want to raise that with the Minister again.</p> <p>  I previously raised the new basic income pilot scheme for artists with the Minister.  I appreciate that it is a matter for the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, but the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has an input in terms of those artists who are in receipt of a disability allowance or the blind pension.  If they choose to move on to the income support, they should not lose their disability allowance or blind pension.  However, we are going to put them in a very difficult position if they cannot sign up to the new pilot scheme, as artists, because they are afraid of losing their disability allowance or blind pension.  This needs to be worked out while the scheme is being developed rather than having it arise when the scheme is up and running and people with disabilities are locked out of it.  That would not be fair or proper.  In fact, it would be discriminatory.  It is being put the to the Minister now and I have raised it with her previously.  I am sure others have also raised it.  We must make sure that the new pilot scheme for artists is open to those artists in receipt of disability allowance and that they do not lose the likes of a medical card, a place on a social housing list or a disability allowance or blind pension, in the case of the payments for which the Minister is responsible.  We must make sure that is in place for the pilot scheme before it is rolled out.</p></speech>

Work is ongoing on the disability allowance, the blind pension and the basic income for artists.  There is a principle in social protection, and this applies to the widow's pension and illness benefit.  The principle is that a person gets one payment.  Our job in the Department is always to keep people out of poverty and to provide supports when they need it.  We do not pay two supports.  During the pandemic, retired people who were receiving a pension could not get the PUP, even though they were working.  The principle on which that is based is that we do not give two social welfare payments.</p> <p>  Deputy Kerrane raised the case of a person who is terminally ill seeking the fuel allowance.  I will look at that if she sends me the details of the case.</p> <p>  The principle of not getting two payments applies to illness benefit in the same way as the widow's pension, but if a person is in hardship the case will be considered.  Deputy Kerrane should send the details of the case to me.</p> <p>  I will ask the officials to look at the issues the Deputy raises on the pilot scheme for artists.  It is being worked on currently and there is consultation between the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media and my Department.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is driving the initiative.  I did try to introduce something for artists when I was Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It was art assist and it was based on the same principle as the farm assist payment.  We made up the difference when a person was not working.  The scheme the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media is examining now is an enhanced one and my Department is happy to work with her to see how we can help artists that contribute significantly to society and to our culture and identity.  It is important to do that, as we missed live performance and all the wonderful entertainment we receive in this country so much during Covid.  I am happy to look at that.  I hope that is okay.</p></speech>

It reminds me of the day I asked someone about somebody that we knew.  He said: "The kind of guy he is, if you were down in a hole, he would pull you out, but if you went up a ladder, you were getting above yourself and he would pull you down."  The Department of Social Protection seems to work on that principle.  There is no question that if you are down in a hole, it will pull you out, but if you start climbing the ladder, it will pull you down pretty fast as well.  There is that type of attitude there and we must move on from it.  Despite what some people believe, people who are dependent on social welfare have very constrained lives generally.  If you are totally dependent on social welfare, you live under a lot of rules and it is fairly constrained income.</p> <p>  I have a question on disability.  I am trying to focus today on high-level questions because it is important that we start thinking deeply about the architecture of the system we have.  The Minister is familiar with the partial capacity scheme.  That introduced a new idea; that we differentiate between people with a profound disability, a severe disability, a moderate disability and a mild disability.  The idea was that we would be a bit more generous to those at the profound end of the scale.  In that case, it relates to invalidity pension and disability allowance, and a person can go to work and keep the payment.  One of the big challenges we face is that the cost of disability is never taken into account.  For people with profound or severe disabilities, or what the Department would term moderate disabilities, there is an increasing scale of costs as we go up the ladder.  I know there were tentative ideas in the Department at one stage about creating a tiered scale of disability and invalidity payments that would pay more to people in the profound band and slightly less to those in the subsequent bands, and that those in the mild band would get the basic income that is currently available.  A person would get more for a moderate disability, more again for a severe disability and more again for a profound disability.</p><p>This would be a very humane response to disability.  It would stop the issue that worries the Department whereby if it increases the disability rate much above the unemployment payments, there might be migration.  They would not get that extra bit over and above what is available now unless they had a moderate, severe or profound disability.  Is there high-level policy debate in the Department looking at this issue and thinking about it?</p><p> This morning I received an email from somebody who makes a valid point.  It was from somebody who has a child with multiple disabilities.  This case involves a husband who is working and a wife who is a full-time carer getting carer's allowance.  At present there are enormous energy costs involved with all the equipment the child is on constantly.  The family is over the threshold.  This means no matter how severe the disability is and how much it costs to care for the child, the family receives the standard rate of payment.  The family has too high an income to receive an essential payment for increased energy costs.  I do not know how much the husband earns at present but let us say it is &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000.  For people who must pay a mortgage such an income means they are still in fairly constrained circumstances.  We need to look at the situation of the cost of disability on a graded basis.  Are there high-level talks about reform of this system rather than just tinkering at the edges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#O00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy.  On 7 December we published a report on the cost of disability carried out by Indecon.  I brought the report to Cabinet.  We have referred it to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  This group is responsible for monitoring the key framework for policy and action to address the needs of people with disabilities in Ireland.  The group will consider the actions and what the Government needs to do.  This needs to be across government.  We also need to look at other issues such as housing, health, education and transport costs.  There are a number of areas.  It is clear we have to find the right response to all of the issues.  The report that Indecon has prepared is very comprehensive.  It looked at all of the aspects of disability.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right when he says that at present there is a flat-rate disability payment of &euro;280 regardless of whether people have a mild, moderate or profound disability.  From a social protection perspective, one of the recommendations in the report is a payment linked to disability.  Some people with a mild disability could do some work.  Other people who have a profound disability cannot work.  We need to look at issues such as whether the payment should be graduated.</p> <p>  Good work is being done on trying to help people with disabilities to get into the workforce.  We have the Ability programme, which is EU funded.  It was due to end last year.  I met those involved in the programme and heard first-hand from them the very good work they do on the ground in helping younger and older people have an opportunity to make a contribution to society in many different ways and get back into work in whatever form or career they want to pursue.  We were able to allocate money from the Dormant Accounts Fund to keep the programme going.  It really is a good programme.  We also have EmployAbility in the Department.  It helps people with one-to-one contact and connection between an employer and employee.  It works very well.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point.  I am on the same page as him.  The Government and the Cabinet are committed to dealing with this issue to improve the situation of those with disabilities.  This is particularly with regard to cases such as the one the Deputy spoke about, where parents have children with profound disabilities.  It is a very difficult place for people to find themselves.  I thank the Deputy for the question.</p></speech>

It is estimated the Social Insurance Fund will be back in surplus this year.  In the debate on pensions we have to take several things into account.  No doubt the Commission on Pensions report was raised.  The issue is a financial one.  We already put a lot of Exchequer funds into welfare and quite rightly.  The idea that straight Exchequer funds and non-PRSI funds would not go into welfare is unthinkable.  The whole system would collapse tomorrow morning if that happened.</p> <p>  Auto-enrolment is due to be introduced.  Will this be taken out of the Social Insurance Fund or will it be Exchequer funding?  I keep asking questions but nobody seems to want to know.  This has a huge bearing on the choices we will make about putting money into caring for the elderly.  Do we put it in a private scheme where the biggest contribution will go to those who are better off or do we put it into keeping the pension age as it is?  Can we get some sense of this?  I understand one third of the money for auto-enrolment is to come from the Exchequer.  Will this come from the Social Insurance Fund or Exchequer funding?  How much is it likely to be?  We know how much it will cost per annum to keep the pension age at 66.  I have asked parliamentary questions and we do not seem to get any answer on an estimate of how much auto-enrolment will cost in various scenarios.  The Department has this information.</p></speech>

The issue of auto-enrolment is at an advanced stage.  I have brought proposals to a Cabinet subcommittee and I intend to bring final proposals to the Government very shortly.  As the Deputy knows, the programme for Government commits to introducing a pension automatic enrolment system.  It is a priority for me.  I want to see this introduced.  Only 35% of private sector employees have a pension.  The fear is that when they reach retirement they will have a reduction in living standards.  I will bring proposals to the Government or Cabinet very shortly to finalise the design of the auto-enrolment.</p><p>I can give some information on it.  We will seek to gradually deliver an auto-enrolment system based on following principles: a phased roll-out over a decade of the contributions made by workers and employers; matching contributions by both workers and employers; and the State to top up these contributions.  It will not come from the Social Insurance Fund because that is the fund into which workers make PRSI contributions.  There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out.  Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from and a charges cap will be imposed on pension providers.</p><p> My Department has finalised a proposal for Government on the overall design of the scheme and, as I said, I intend to bring that for approval very soon.  Once the final design is agreed, it is intended that the necessary legislative organisation and process structures for implementation will follow over the course of this year and next year.  They were set out in the economic recovery plan in 2021.  That is the plan on the auto-enrolment.  There is no doubt that Covid has delayed it but it is my intention to bring it forward very soon.</p><p> We committed in the programme for Government that we would establish an independent expert Commission on Pensions, which is what we did.  It was chaired by Ms Josephine Feehily.  The commission worked very hard for six months, as the Deputy knows.  Its countless meetings produced for Government a very detailed and in-depth report and recommendations.  It was based on a lot of data.  There were economists, academics, pension experts, union representatives, youth representatives and representatives of older people.  I took that report to Government last October.  The joint committee has published its report on the future of pensions.  The Commission on Taxation and Welfare is due to come back with its views by the end of February.  </p><p> We will then look at all of this in the round and, through the Cabinet committee on economy recovery and investment, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, the three party leaders and I will plot a way forward.  The intention is that we will bring a full response and implementation plan to the Commission on Pension's recommendations to Government for approval by the end of March.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are some very difficult decisions to be made and this Government needs to make those decisions.  We need to push on with auto-enrolment and make decisions on the sustainability of the pension system.  The social welfare code is the bedrock of the pension system and we need to look at it.  There are four and a half people working at the minute for every pensioner.  By 2050, there will only be two people working for every one pensioner.  Therefore, the system we have is not sustainable and there is no getting away from that.  It is not a problem unique to Ireland.  Countries all over the world are grappling with the same issue.  As I said, there are some difficult decisions to be made and, as a Government, we will do that.  At the end of the day, the interest of our citizens is our priority in making those decisions and ensuring they are to their benefit.</p></speech>

I would look at this simplistically enough.  The State has only a finite amount of money.  I am one of those people who actually believes that it is finite.  In the longer term, the Government can only spend what it brings in.</p> <p>  It seems that something that has not been taken into account is that, on one hand, the Minister is saying that people, many of whom will not be fit to work after the age of 66, will come to the age and hit a wall because they will only be in receipt of the working age payment up to age 68, while on the other, the State will be able to fund in the same year money into an auto-enrolment system which, by its nature, will benefit those with a higher income more than those with a lower income, straight out of the Exchequer, as the Minister just said.</p> <p>  If she gave me a choice of what to do with the money, the first thing I would do is pay the people aged between 66 and 68 and put a caveat on that.  Then if there was money still in the pot, which has had a finite amount paid into it, it should be put into auto-enrolment.  </p> <p>  There is one caveat, but the commission disregarded it completely.  There was the principle of the transition pension.  Perhaps there is an argument for saying that if a person comes to the age of 66 and still earns a lot of money and  continues to work after their 66th birthday, he or she could not claim the contributory pension, as he or she could not with the transition pension long ago.   If a person is earning a few hundred euro per week, let him or her off.  However, if a person is on &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000,  &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000, &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000, he or she could not claim and I would have no problem with that.  However, funny enough, the commission totally banged that one on the head.  If the Minister came back with a hybrid, I would say that is fair enough.  However, many people will not be able to work after 66 because of mental health issues, burnout issues or physical issues.  </p> <p>  These debates are not detached from each other.  As the Minister always reminds us, there is a finite amount of money, and choices have to be made.  We seem to be saying that we giveth 20 years hence with one hand but we taketh with the other hand, and I just do not get it.  That is just my view and I wanted to put that view on the record of the House because there has been some rather ill-informed commentary in some of the media where people have not read what the committee did or why it did it.  We were able to take a wider lens than the commission.  The commission's terms of reference were totally constrained and I accept that it was not within its remit to take some of these issues into account.  However, it is within the remit of Government and the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I am not in a position to say what recommendations the Government will accept or otherwise.  This will be a whole-of-government decision.  There will be many discussions and, at the end of the day, we have to make the decisions that are fair and make sure the State pension, which is the bedrock of the system at the minute, continues.  I always say that when I retire, the person who retires 30 or 40 years after me should get the same benefits I get.  It is about how when the young people of today have reached retirement age, we have not pulled that ladder up after us and left nothing for them.  The Deputy used the analogy of the ladder earlier on.  There are difficult decisions but we will work our way through this and, hopefully, we reach the right decisions at the end of the day.</p></speech>

I accept and know how performance targets are established by the management board to measure performance within the Department, but, as a committee, we have a responsibility to monitor the ongoing spending within the Department on an annual basis.  The most effective tool for us to do that is through the departmental performance targets.  As the Minister is aware, we set out, in our pre-budget submission, issues relating to departmental performance and the need to modernise and update those performance targets.  I accept that the performance targets have been pretty much historic targets from year to year in terms of the number of payments issued, and so forth.  However, the difficulty is that we, as a committee, believe that they do not effectively drive the type of change that we believe is needed in terms of the delivery within the Department.  That is not taking from that fact that we all find, in our day-to-day dealings with the Department, that it is very responsive to the needs to individuals, but I think more can be done to try and improve the processing time for applications.  The difficulty is that when payments are delayed for people, it causes financial hardship.</p> <p>  We spoke earlier about the exceptional needs payment.  That is available to some people.  It is not available to others for various reasons.  Nevertheless, it does cause financial hardship for people.  There are mechanisms that can be used to speed up these applications within the confines of the challenges that are there in terms of making sure that there is proper scrutiny of every application.  I will provide the example of the time, previously, when there were ongoing issues with the domiciliary care allowance.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was the Minister in charge at the time.  That application form was radically transformed to facilitate parents of children who were on the autism spectrum.  That made a significant difference in the volume of applications that went for review and subsequently went for appeal at the time.  The committee has highlighted specifically one area in its report, namely, common errors that are made in application forms.  As public representatives, we all know that one of the biggest mistakes that many people make is they fail to sign the application form.  If the Department was to make the public aware of where particular applications fall down on a regular basis in order that they could be addressed by people in advance of submitting their applications, it would help to speed that up.  Again, in terms of when applications are granted on review, there are commonalities in terms of why they are granted on review.  If they were compiled and made available, it would help to streamline the application process.</p> <p>  The committee feels that the targets that are there at the moment need to be modernised and updated.  We would like an update from the Minister on that.  If not today, she might come back to us at a later date.  We are also anxious to have a meeting with the senior officials to go through this particular aspect of the programme.  We feel that it can help to improve the operation of the Department and the oversight by senior management of the Department, as well as bringing an extra layer of accountability that is required by this committee and the Oireachtas because of the size of the budget that we are dealing with on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>  It is important that we look at ways of how we can have measurables that drive the type of dynamic change that we need to see happening across the Department of Social Protection.  The committee made reference, for example, to the working family payment.  Earlier today, the committee spoke about the exceptional needs payment.  Again, if the outcomes of applications for non-means-tested exceptional needs payment were compiled, including those that were granted and those that were refused, that would give the committee sight of what is happening with that, and perhaps endorse the approach that has been taken and articulated by the Minister today and address any inadequacies that we, as individual public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas, are identifying across our constituencies.  If the Minister is unable to respond, perhaps she will reflect on the points I have raised.  It is an issue that the committee would like to deal with in more detail with the officials in the near future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2022021600002#Q00400"><p>My Department has already implemented a review process whereby performance metrics are formally reviewed on an annual basis and amended as appropriate.  We review our performance on a monthly basis when I meet with the management team.  If there are any issues that Deputies have brought to my attention or I have seen in my own constituency, I certainly raise them.  I have seen many cases where there have perhaps been longer delays or backlogs have developed for whatever reason, and we have redeployed resources as necessary.  I must say that I am very proud to head up a department of social protection that is agile and flexible.  When it comes to redeploying resources in certain areas in order to resolve problems that may arise, they do it quickly.  It is not always the case across Government that there is that level of agility and responding so quickly to the demands of the customers.  Ours is a very customer-based Department, where the needs of our clients and people come first.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the issue of appeals.  We recently appointed two deputy chief appeals officers.  I passed legislation to do that.  We have the chief appeals officer and two deputies now.  The legislation is such that the chief appeals officer determines the decision if the appeal goes up the line.  The chief appeals officer had to do a great deal of work, so we have two new deputy appeals officers in place to help speed that up. </p> <p>  The Chairman suggested that the Department highlight the mistakes made in applications.  I know that it does not suit everybody, but if you make your application online, there is less chance that you will make some of those mistakes and the process is probably more streamlined.  In the case of applications for benefits with a medical component, sometimes the information required is not provided in the first application.  We know, from our own offices, that it may be that a person is applying for a benefit that is related to medical condition, and a letter is sent off with the application that is very vague and does not give the details needed.  We send the applicant back to the doctor to get a more detailed letter because when they tell you what is wrong with them, we tell them that it is not included in the letter and a decision cannot be made on the basis of the information included in the letter.   The applicant is asked to supply further information and in the majority of cases, the application is processed.  The Chairman is right that these are the sort of things that we need to tell people.  We must tell them to supply the right information in the first place to speed up the application.</p> <p>  The committee has recommended that all social welfare appeals be processed within a 12-week timeframe.  We have that down to a 12.9-week timeframe.  Sometimes things happen.  That is the current average.  Where we find that there are issues that lead to delays, we redeploy resources very quickly.  I think I have covered most of the Chairman's points.  If there is anything else, I am happy to come back to the committee.</p></speech>

In fairness, as correctly stated by the Minister, when issues are brought to the Department's attention it is very customer-focused in trying to address them.  She is also correct in saying that many of the issues brought forward by Members of the Oireachtas are customer-focused issues.  The difficulty is that we have a responsibility to monitor the spend and to ensure that the targets in terms of policy are delivered.  We cannot do that in terms of the measurables we have visibility of today.  Information on the number of people who are paid a benefit on a weekly or monthly basis provides very little indepth information to us about what is actually going on in the Department in terms of meeting overall policy objectives.  For example, an issue for Government in terms of policy is that of former carers transitioning back into the workforce when they are no longer in receipt of carer's benefit or carer's allowance.  That is a policy objective of Government but there is no measurable there of the number of former carers who are coming off jobseeker's allowance payments.  We all accept that one of the largest cohorts of people in receipt of social welfare payments in terms of poverty is the one-parent family yet there is no measurable in the performance indicators on that.  </p><p> An issue that has been brought up consistently by members in committee is the use of employment services to get people back into long-term sustainable employment.  A lot of the criticism of the employment services has been around whether the tender will provide long-term sustainable employment for people.  Again, there is no measurable in that regard.  The point being made by the committee is that we need a broader look in terms of the performance indicators within the Department.  The Minister and Minister of State are answering members' questions today, but the reality is the performance indicators are developed by management.  They are presented here as a key part of our consideration of the Revised Estimate, but it is impossible for us to make a determination based on what is in this performance indicators.  That is why the committee has made its recommendation.  We have asked for direct engagement with the Department on the design of a set of performance indicators that meet the Department's need but also meet the need of this committee and the Oireachtas in terms of scrutiny.  Ultimately, we all want the same thing.  None of us want to see this particular Vote being discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts following a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That ultimately is our primary objective in relation to this.  </p><p> I ask that the Minister would reflect on the comments we have made here today.  We will be asking the officials to come in to engage with us further on this.  The Minister might give consideration to the issues raised in advance of a meeting.</p></speech>

I have made changes in the Department based on suggestions that have come from the committee.  At the end of the day, we all want to make sure that citizens are looked after and that the purpose of all of the payments in regard to all of the supports we provide are to help people.</p> <p>  I am happy to consider what was proposed by the Chairman in regard to the performance indicators.  I am very keen that we meet those targets.  I am sure my officials will have no problem meeting with the committee to go into them in more detail.</p></speech>

This is to commit in black and white in primary legislation to bringing forward legislation within six months of the passing of this Bill to deal with the substantive issues regarding marine casualty investigation.</p> <p>  I have also tabled an amendment on the publication of the Clinch report, which should have been made available to the committee.

We are trying to get a cast-iron guarantee from the Minister and the Department that the commitments he has made verbally would be delivered upon.  We know the context of this debate.  It came up during pre-legislative scrutiny.  We all know this is a technical Bill to deal with a specific issue arising out of a European judgment.  We all appreciate that.</p> <p>  Committee members now have available to us the Lacey report which was published in 2010.  It made specific recommendations on how we deal with the totality of the deficiencies in marine casualty investigations.  It made proposals and the publication of the heads of the Bill for a multimodal accident investigation office.  We had these proposals.  We know the Department had them in 2010.  We know there were clear indications in the Department and other quarters that we were at risk of running into difficulties because of our emerging European obligations.  Despite this we walked straight into difficulties and we are where we are with the Bill before us.</p> <p>  We should not have needed to be here with the Bill.  Had we acted on the Lacey report and other advice, at the time and in the meantime, we should not have had to be at this point with this Bill.  As a result of this and related to it there are deep concerns, which I share, that we will not get larger follow-on legislation and action to deal with the wide range of issues regarding marine casualty investigation.</p><p>The purpose of the four amendments I tabled is to get that cast iron guarantee from the Minister and the Department.  My fear is that without it we will have drift in terms of the enactment of this legislation or any future legislation such that a number of years down the line we will be no further on in terms of the practical delivery of world class marine casualty investigations.  That is the sum total of it.  I appreciate that the amendments have been ruled out of order.  I am frustrated but I understand the process.  From my perspective, I would have severe reservations around supporting this legislation unless I had very a firm guarantee that it is only an important first step in a process of reform within the marine casualty investigation area.  I hope that captures my position on it and that people understand it.  I understand that this is technical legislation and that it is time dependent.  I support that element of it.  Without a commitment on the broader suite of reforms, however, it will be very difficult for me to support this legislation.</p></speech>

This committee has undertaken a lot of work in this area over recent months.  It sought pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, but the Marine Casualty Investigation Board and the Department repeatedly stated that this was technical, time-sensitive legislation and there was a need to expedite matters and so, reluctantly, we agreed to allow things to move apace.  We did not fully agree with it, but we recognised that the legislation needed to progress quickly.  As I said, we reluctantly agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny, but it is important to note that that waiver had important conditionality built into it.  We demanded that the Department would make publicly available the Clinch report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022021600002#C00600"><p>We agreed to accelerate matters based on what the Department had advised but we also, on several occasions, insisted that the Clinch report would be made fully available to each member of the committee.  One cannot blindly pursue particular legislation and ignore a document that has very important information within it to which, as of yet, I am not privy.</p> <p>  We demanded that the Department would make public the Clinch report, which was drafted by Captain Steve Clinch of the UK based Clinchmaritime Limited.  It is important to note that this report was a Government-funded independent review of Ireland's maritime casualty investigation structures and its aim were to address the current organisational structures of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, to set out recommendations and suggestions that we could embody in law to ensure we are fully compliant with our EU obligations and that we would have a robust and properly resourced marine casualty capacity in Ireland.  The committee would like to know why this important report is not in the public domain.  It is essential that we would be privy to it and that it would inform decision-making in this committee and in the wider Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand that one of the key recommendations in the report, which, as I said, I have not had sight of, is the establishment of a full-time professional unit to investigate marine casualties.  The current structure in Ireland is a part-time investigation board staffed by part-time investigators.  In order to properly provide for marine investigations in Ireland, surely we need to know the full content of the Clinch report and its recommendations.</p> <p>  Marine casualty investigation is the very poor relation of air and rail accident investigation in this country.  Taking 2019 as a base year, the air accident investigation unit, which is a full-time unit, had an operational budget of &euro;750,000 and the rail investigation unit, also a full-time unit, had an operational budget of &euro;350,000.  That same year, in which six lives were lost in Irish territorial waters, the part-time Marine Casualty Investigation Board had a paltry budget of just &euro;27,000.  I live in a coastal county where, thankfully, we have not had a major aircraft incident in recent years, although we have had some slight incidents involving aircraft crashing.  We also have not, thankfully, had a rail accident of great significance.  Every year there are lives lost at sea, however.  We need to have a robust investigations board to investigate in that regard.  That does not exist currently.  The report that would identify the shortcomings has not been circulated.</p> <p>  Following my contribution, I have to leave this meeting in order to attend another.  Before doing so, I would like to reference the Marine Hazards Limited report, which dealt with the 2016 accident off the coast of Kilkee, County Clare, in which Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas, a Coast Guard volunteer, lost her life.  She was a fantastic woman.  She gave her life trying to rescue and look after others.  There are deficiencies in terms of investigation that need to be of guidance to us as we try to prepare robust legislation.  I would like to pay tribute as, I am sure, would many here today, to Michael Kingston.  We get briefs from Departments and from everywhere and anywhere.  Michael Kingston has been hugely invested in this legislation and in guiding and informing us.  I want to pay tribute to him on the record.</p> <p>  It is essential the Clinch report is circulated.  This is not tiddlywinks.  These are lives.  In the context of legislation relating to safety, we need the guiding report, that is, the Clinch report, available to each and every one of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022021600002#C00700"><p>Prior to this meeting there was a private meeting of the committee with the Minister at which there was very open debate.  At that meeting, the Minister gave an assurance that he would make a public statement today to confirm that the Clinch report would be published, that the findings and recommendations set out in that report would be implemented with in the lifetime of this Government and that substantial work will be done this year.  It is very disappointing that to date the Clinch report has not been published.  It is with the Department since July 2021.  Work on it began last March.  On foot of a recommendation of this committee, Captain Clinch was asked to compile this report.  What are being cited are legal issues.</p> <p>  A series of different reports have recommended a fundamental reform of this area.  The first report was in 1988.  It was followed by the R&oacute;is&iacute;n Lacey report in 2010, of which I and other members of the Oireachtas have received copies.  I received mine in the past number of days.  It is a frightening read in terms of what is being sought by us and people vested in this area.  That report has identified the need for independence, competence and a full-time investigation unit.  The Bill before us does not address any of those issues, which is really disappointing.</p> <p>  The committee undertook in-depth pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill last January, during which we heard expert opinion from the maritime lawyer, Mr. Michael Kingston and also from Mr. Ciaran McCarthy.  There is compelling evidence that we are not up to scratch in this country in terms of this area.  Why are we not implementing reports drafted in good faith by people who were employed by the State?  The Clinch report is the third of these reports.  I do not know what we are at.  This committee would be better served if the Clinch report was published.  We should hold off on this legislation and implement the recommendations of the Clinch report.  If we did so, we could then move forward with a substantive Bill.</p><p>I take the Minister on good faith.  He said to us at that meeting a couple of weeks ago that he would make a public statement and that he would confirm in the Houses of the Oireachtas that he is determined to publish the Clinch report and implement the recommendations.  I call on him to do that today.  </p></speech>

As Deputy Carey said, I am happy to repeat what we said in private session but first it is important that we get this legislation through quickly.  This whole issue is about minimising risk, learning from previous accidents in order that we save lives, but time and speed are of importance.  If we are not quick then we run the risk of not having a proper investigation process that could be required with real urgency.  I am keen that we get this through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad as soon as possible.  As soon as the President's signature is dry on the parchment for a final Act, we will put in place the provisions of this very technical Bill to give us full complement and strength within the existing Marine Casualty Investigation Board and in doing that, comply with European law and regulations.  That is the most important thing we need to do.  Also, we agreed that we will publish, subject to legal sign-off.  We have to follow legal advice.  As the Clinch report was commissioned on the back of the Department's initiative, it is very much in our interest that it would be published and acted on.  I am happy to commit here to doing exactly that.  Central to that, as Deputies Carey, O'Rourke and Cathal Crowe and others have said, is that we look at a new structure and a new system, including the full-time independent investigation unit.  What I said in private session is that we expect the publication of the Clinch report at the end of quarter 1 and that is still the timeline, subject to the Office of the Attorney General and others signing off on it.  What I also said was that this year, we will develop and deliver that wider legislation.  My intention is to go to Cabinet in the coming weeks on the First Stage process with the broad intent, the policy approach.</p></speech>

It reflects the private meeting we had.  To provide the level of assurance, because there will be some scepticism from people who follow this closely, who will point to reports from 1998 and 2010 that were clear about the need for a new departure and a change in the direction of travel, as that did not happen.  Whether it is a reflection on the Minister or the Department or the system or whatever it is, that progress was never made.  What greater assurance can the Minister provide to those who are watching this closely that he will deliver on those commitments he has made?  Is there scope for him to bring forward amendments that might, in primary legislation, provide such assurance?  If it is not primary legislation, what other way, outside of his statements here today, can provide assurance to people?  I implore the Minister and the Department to engage with those stakeholders right throughout this process.  As Deputies Carey and Cathal Crowe have said, they have been absolutely expert witnesses and a huge resource and benefit to us as Deputies and as a committee.  I raise that matter of that extra assurance with the Minister.  I can see how people might refer to 1998, 2010 and a Clinch report we have not seen and say that what needs to be happening here should be absolutely black and white but it is not happening.  How can we be assured that what the Minister is saying now will actually come to fruition and that in six months' time we are not told something has come from left field and disrupted everything he has laid out there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-16a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022021600002#D01600"><p>There is a fear that the Minister will not honour what he is saying here.  I am not blaming him but this has happened before, in 1998 and 2010.  Even the Roisin Lacey report has not been published officially.  Perhaps he might give a commitment in regard to that, today.  On Second Stage of this Bill, reference was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Naughten, to that particular piece of work that was asked to be done by the Department but it was never published.  Here we are in 2022 and we have a commitment, and I do not doubt the Minister's commitment, but I would like if he could give us a bit more reassurance and more comfort.  I buy this Clinch report being published by quarter 1, but that is underlined on legal grounds.  I do not know what the issue is, legally.  Maybe the Minister cannot say, but legal issues tend to go on and on.  As this whole issue has not been dealt with over three or four decades, it is high time it was dealt with.  I would like to get some assurance from the Minister today in that regard, and he has given it, but perhaps he could nail it down even further.  I also agree with Deputy O'Rourke on engaging with the stakeholders.  They have been truly magnificent in their efforts, educating the committee in this field and the deficiencies that exist there.  This might be a niche area but it is an incredibly important area.  We are an island nation and we need to have a fit-for-purpose marine casualty investigation unit and sadly, we do not have that.  If we do not properly investigate problems we do not find out what the problem is, and that problem continues to happen, again and again.  That is why we are asking for these assurances.  I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides but if he could give us a bit more in regard to timelines, that would be great.</p></speech>

Are there benchmarks along the cycle we want to ensure are hit?  The Minister has given an overview, but perhaps he might touch on engagement with stakeholders and whether he feels certain the Clinch report will be published.  I ask the Minister to provide more detail on that.</p></speech>

The Department commissioned it and wants to see it published by the end of this first quarter.  In the second quarter shortly thereafter, subject to Government agreement - if Government does not agree, I will have to come back to the committee and inform it that the Government has not agreed - my intention is to bring a policy proposal to Government within the coming few weeks.  Then there will be the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill, and my main intention is for that to come back to this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny and, subject to that being done in a timely manner, for us to get it legislated this year.  That is on the record as to what I am looking to do.  If there is any reason that is not possible, be it a Government decision or legal advice, I will come to the committee straight away.  However, I expect Government approval and I am hopeful we can overcome the legal issues.  If that is not delivered, by all means the committee should hold me to account on it.</p></speech>
