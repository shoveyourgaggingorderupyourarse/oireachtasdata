I wish him well in his appointment and look forward to working with him in the period ahead.  His statement has been circulated to members and I invite him to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chair and look forward to working with him and the committee members in the term ahead.  I thank the Chairman for the invitation to speak here on Parts 4 and 5 of the omnibus Brexit Bill.  I am joined by Ms Fiona O'Dea who is a principal officer in the Department's unit that has responsibility for company law.  As members will be aware, the briefing is a substitute for the pre-legislative scrutiny process for this Bill and I thank the committee for facilitating all of this.  </p><p>I will speak to the two Parts of the Bill that relate to my Department.  Part 4, while short and technical, nevertheless forms an important part of Ireland's response to the UK's decision to leave the EU.  It amends the Companies Act 2014 to facilitate the migration of Irish securities from their current central security depository, Euroclear UK &amp;amp; Ireland, to the Euroclear Bank after Brexit.  The central securities depositories are specialist financial institutions that hold securities and facilitate trading between market operators.  They are a vital and systemic part of the financial market infrastructure.</p><p>Due to the close historic links between the Dublin and London Stock Exchanges the Irish market currently relies on central securities depositories based in the UK, which operate the CREST settlement system.  Once the UK becomes a third country, the central securities depositories will no longer be able to passport its services from the UK into Ireland.  As a result, Euronext Dublin, formerly the Irish Stock Exchange, announced in October 2018, its intention to transfer the settlement of trades in Irish equities and other exchange-traded instruments from CREST to Euroclear Bank, which is a central securities depository based in Belgium.  Recognising the time and complexity involved in such a transition, the European Commission granted, in December 2018, equivalence to UK central securities depositories until the end of March 2021 in the event of a hard Brexit.</p><p>The Migration of Participating Securities Bill 2019, commenced earlier this year by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, allows for an orderly migration <i>en bloc</i>of all Irish securities held in the UK system to the new system ahead of the 31 March 2020 deadline.  While the 2019 Act provides a once-off mechanism for companies to transfer their listed securities from CREST to the Euroclear Bank, Part 4 of this Bill provides for miscellaneous amendments to the Companies Act 2014 to ensure the successful functioning of the model post-migration.  </p><p>A successful migration and functioning security system after Brexit, enabled by statutory provision, is imperative.  In the absence of a successful migration it would not be possible to trade Irish shares once the European Commission's temporary equivalence decision expires in March 2021.  While the 2019 Act takes care of the immediate risks, any ongoing issues with the functioning of the system would have a significant impact on Irish listed companies and damage Ireland's reputation as a world-class location for financial services.  In addition, the ongoing collection of stamp duty on Irish trade, which totalled &euro;380 million in 2019, could be impacted.</p><p>Part 5 provides for a small technical amendment to section 10(2) of the Employment Permits Act 2006 to avoid disruption for business when the Brexit transition period ends.  Approximately 45,000 UK nationals are employed in Ireland.  The employment permits regime is governed by the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended.  It contains a number of protections for domestic and European economic area labour markets.  Among the safeguards is the 50:50 rule, which requires that employers seeking to hire non-EEA nationals on an employment permit have sourced at least 50% of their workforce from Ireland, the EEA or the Swiss Confederation.  This policy underpins the Government's employment creation objectives by requiring employers in the State to hire, in a balanced manner, from the domestic labour market.  As the legislation is currently drafted, UK citizens are included under the EEA figures.</p><p>When the Brexit transition period ends, under the terms of the common travel area, UK citizens will not be required to obtain an employment permit to work in Ireland.  The same will apply to Irish citizens working in the UK.  However, under the Employment Permits Act, as currently drafted, when the transition period ends UK citizens will fall outside the EEA category for the purposes of the 50:50 rule.  This would give rise to a considerable disruption for companies which are applying for new employment permits and companies applying for employment permit renewals because they may not satisfy the 50:50 rule if they are unable to include UK citizens, who are employees, as they can at present.  </p><p>To avoid disruption for business, Part 5 provides for an amendment to section 10(2) of the Employment Permits Act 2006 to facilitate the continued inclusion of UK citizens in the employee count, and this needs to be in place when the Brexit transition period ends.  The proposed amendments to the Companies Act and the Employment Permits Act are just one technical part of the Government's wider work to ensure business is Brexit-ready regardless of the EU-UK future partnership negotiations.</p><p>I am happy to answer any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

Deputies O'Reilly and Bruton have indicated a wish to comment and others may do so.  As Deputy O'Reilly was the first to indicate, she will commence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#B00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for being with us.  I wish to apologise because I must leave soon to go to the Convention Centre but I will do my best to listen to the recording of the debate.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the amendments concerning the issuance of certificates.  The sections allow for the disapplying sections of the Companies Act and then the insertion of a new section of the Companies Act.  Regarding the issuance of certificates, will there be an external and public record of securities transferred under this legislation beyond the record held by Euroclear UK &amp;amp; Ireland, where the securities are migrating from, and Euroclear Bank in Belgium, where the securities are migrating, to be deposited?  If so, where will the records be held?  Will they be publicly available?</p> <p>  On page 20, Part 4, relating to section 1087(e), (f) and (g), I want to clarify a few points.  I understand these sections allow the securities to be transferred to the Euroclear Bank in Belgium and the sections, in question, are to ensure that the transfer of securities operates as quickly and as smoothly as possible.  Sections 1087(e) and (f) make substantial changes to the primary legislation mentioned.  As referenced in the explanatory note of the general scheme for these sections, similar changes were made to British law in 2001 and 1996.  Perhaps there is already existing evidence that there would be no unintended consequences with these changes.  Has the Department considered monitoring the operation of these sections, on a short-term basis, to ensure that the changes will have the desired and proposed effect?</p> <p>  My final broad questions are on workers and work permits and concern Part 5, page 20, head 51, the restriction on granting of employment permits.  Given the volatile nature of the British withdrawal from the European Union, and I do not think anyone will dispute my description, has the Department concerns that previously agreed aspects of the withdrawal, namely, the equitable arrangement whereby Irish workers in Britain will not have to obtain a work permit, could be reneged on by the British Government?  If so, what is the view of the Minister of State and the Department if that event occurs given the somewhat chaotic nature of the withdrawal thus far?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00100"><p>The first two questions are very technical.  If it is okay with Deputy O'Reilly, I will revert to her on them because the purpose of this meeting is to provide a broad overview.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00200"><p>That is perfect.  That is understood.  I appreciate that they are technical.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00300"><p>In response to the third question, everybody has concerns about how the UK has performed in terms of an agreement it signed in the past 12 months.  However, we must remember that the common travel area long predates membership of the EU and there has always been an understanding between Ireland and the UK on reciprocal rights.  I have no reason to think that would not continue in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00400"><p>I am not being argumentative, but is it the case that the Minister of State has not thought about a response because he does not think Britain will decide to walk away from the agreement, or does he have a response but it is not relevant at this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00500"><p>Obviously, if the British did decide to renege on the agreement, we would have to look at it.  Given the historical arrangements between the UK and Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the common travel area, however, I do not envisage that being an issue.  I will undertake to look into the matter further and perhaps to consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, who is the chief negotiator from the Irish perspective, on where we would go to from there if that were to happen but my personal view is that I do not envisage it being an issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00600"><p>We cannot rule out the possibility, and given the volatility of the situation, belts, braces and baler twine might be the order of the day.  I urge the Minister of State to measure twice, cut once and check, check and check again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00700"><p>It is fair to say that the common travel area precedes the European Union and, as such, hopefully it is not threatened by Britain's decision to withdraw from the Union.  That gives it a separate status and that has been recognised by all sides.</p> <p>  On the question of financial institutions and the permit arrangement that now has to be switched from the UK to Europe, which I welcome, are there different grades of financial alignment between the UK and the EU that might emerge and could create additional need for provisions?  One of the issues that is not finally nailed down is how our financial services in the UK passport, or whatever the term is, into Europe.  To some degree, that remains an issue on the table in terms of nothing being agreed until everything is agreed.  I speak in terms of contingency planning.  Obviously, a high level of integration would presumably be best for us, but do we have to consider different contingencies in this area and do we know how that might impact on Irish security markets and the capacity of Irish companies to raise money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00800"><p>I understand that primary responsibility in that regard lies with the Minister for Finance.  If more changes are needed to the Companies Act to facilitate this, they will be made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020100700002#C00900"><p>Does anyone else wish to come in on this section?  As nobody has indicated, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and his official for attending.  I also thank members for their comments on the common trade area, which is crucially important to people in this country and to people in England.  I have family members in England, many whom consider themselves to be Irish and others who consider themselves to be English.  Some of them have Irish passports and some of them have English passports.  My wife is English.  It is crucial that we emphasise how important the issue is.  I think that view is shared by people in England as well.</p> <p>  That concludes our consideration of the matter before us.  If there is no other business members wish to raise, we will adjourn proceedings and resume in private session at 12 noon on Tuesday, 13 October.  I thank everybody for their attendance and co-operation.</p></speech>

I will certainly be there if required.  I look forward to working with the rest of the committee as well.  Judging by the contributions last week, we all have a common purpose and desire to drive forward the work of this incredibly important first-time Joint Committee on Climate Action.  I thank members for their support and look forward to the months and years ahead.</p></speech>

Mr. Close is appearing remotely from inside the Leinster House complex.  Mr. Close, the format of the meeting is that you will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by a question and answer session.  Before we begin I draw your attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise Mr. Close that any submission or opening statements he has made to the committee will be published to the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>On the subject of mobile phones, I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system here and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  Television coverage and web streaming will also be adversely affected.</p><p>I invite Mr. Close to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

New legislation is required to underpin these readiness measures and I would like to thank the committee for creating this early opportunity to discuss the legislation.  As members may recall, last year the Brexit omnibus Act was enacted.  It sought to provide contingency measures to address issues arising out of a no-deal, cliff edge scenario.  As the withdrawal agreement was concluded, the majority of the provisions in the 2019 Act cannot be commenced.  By contrast, the proposed 2020 Bill is intended to deal with permanent change that will arise at the end of the transition period.  It forms a vital part of our national Brexit readiness preparations.  The legislation aims to address the wide range of complex issues that could arise for citizens and businesses post transition.  It will seek to protect citizens and consumers, facilitate the sound functioning of key sectors and ensure our businesses are not disadvantaged.  The Bill is also intended to support aspects of the common travel area and North-South co-operation.  It is expected that the final version of the Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas later in the autumn.  I am happy to engage with the committee in progressing this legislation and minimising uncertainty for business and citizens.</p> <p>  Part 6 of the Bill concerns arrangements in respect of fluorinated greenhouse gases, F-gases.  This Part will address the issue of certification for individuals who work with fluorinated greenhouse gases in their activities in critical sectors such as refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pumps, mobile air conditioning, fire suppression, solvents and electrical switch gear.  The current arrangements, whereby mutual recognition of technical qualifications and certifications from UK institutions in the area of F-gases applying across the EU, will cease at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.  The Government has had a recertification scheme in place since July 2019 to enable individuals and companies with UK F-gases certificates to avail of a free-of-charge process to receive an Irish, EU 27 certificate to enable them to continue to operate in the EU including Ireland.  Significant communications activity has been undertaken to raise awareness of the scheme.  Up to 27 September 2020, 2,883 individuals have applied for recertification with 2,860 of these applications having been processed.  It is difficult to get firm figures given the nature of the sector but it is estimated that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 affected individuals.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the success of the recertification scheme, there remains a risk that a cohort of currently UK-certified individuals will not be aware of or engage with the recertification scheme until the conclusion of the transition period, when the current recertification scheme will expire in line with mutual recognition.  This would require these individuals to retrain.  Given the critical nature of the sectors involved, it is proposed to afford a further extended period beyond the end of the transition period to enable these individuals to recertify.  Part 6 of the 2020 Brexit omnibus Bill therefore includes provisions similar in nature to that included in the 2019 Brexit omnibus Act to afford these individuals a further six months' validity on their existing UK certificate to continue to operate.  It also affords them the first four months of this six-month period to apply to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to receive an Irish certificate enabling them to continue to operate in Ireland and across the EU.  We propose that these provisions will support continuity of service in these critical sectors in addition to protecting employment and individual livelihoods.  We would be happy to discuss any questions committee members may have in order to provide further clarity on the application of this Part.</p></speech>

He raised two issues.  He said that there is the certification of the UK institutions in the area of F-gases and also referred to the free-of-charge process to convert to the Irish, EU certificate.  Is there any difference between the two certifications?  What volume of applications has Mr. Close seen to date for the Irish certification?</p></speech>

When they exchange that for an Irish certificate, they will be able to get an EU 27 certificate which will survive after the end of the transition period.  They will have the same certification level as they have today but it will be enduring after the end of the transition period.  The UK certificate will not endure because mutual recognition will expire.  We have seen 2,883 applications as of last week.  The vast majority, 2,860 applications, have been processed at this time.</p></speech>

How long would it take for an individual to retrain if they have missed all of those deadlines? On the 13th point in the document, stating that the period is going to be extended further beyond the end of the transition period to enable those individuals to rectify it because they missed it in the first instance, is that going to be the six-month extension Mr. Close mentioned?  If they fail to rectify it within that timeframe having been given plenty of time, how is it envisaged to communicate to the same individuals about the extension period that they have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Errol Close" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020100700002#B00700"><p>The training timeframe will depend on the type of certificate they hold in their hands at present.  It can take from a matter of days to weeks to retrain.  In some instances people have undertaken these training exercises as part of an overall apprentice scheme.  They will not need to go back and do the full course.  We are probably talking about a week to two weeks, depending on the type of certificate they hold.  There would be an additional cost associated with that as well.  In terms of the extension, the Senator is quite correct.  It is for the six-month period that I stipulated.  They need to have a valid UK certificate immediately prior to the end of the transition period, that is, by the end of this year.  They have six months' further validity under the proposed primary legislation to continue to operate in the sector and the first four months of that period to apply to the EPA.  The reason for the difference between the four and six months is that two months allows the EPA the turnaround time to process any certificates it gets in the first four months, before the end of the six-month validity period.</p></speech>

I am thinking particularly of people with these skills who may be working on a cross-Border basis.  Mr. Close mentioned that there are very few days left and we anticipate that this Brexit Bill is going to be coming through the Oireachtas very rapidly, judging from previous legislation.  I hope it will not proceed too rapidly to allow discussion.  This is a very specific measure in potentially a longer-term timeframe than the Bill that was before us last year.  What other environmental equivalence measures might be considered in looking to anticipate climate and other targets?</p><p>How do we ensure there will be measures in the Bill around environmental regulation across other sectors, will those measures be in the Bill or will there even be a mechanism in the Bill for the future consideration of those?  I know there are a lot of sectors where there are high environmental regulation standards and there may be concerns around any undercutting or undermining of that in the medium term.  I do not know if that will be in the Bill so I apologise if that is not relevant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Errol Close" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020100700002#C00200"><p>I will take the first of the Senator's two questions.  My understanding is that the UK will continue to recognise EU certificates.  People who have Irish or EU 27 certificates will be able to continue to operate in the UK.  The other important point to note is that when recertify they are allowed to retain their UK certificates so they do not have to surrender that.  They will have both a UK certificate and a new Irish or EU 27 certificate.</p> <p>  The Senator was talking about cross-Border matters and it is important to note that under the Northern Ireland protocol, the F-Gas regulation will continue to apply in Northern Ireland.  People who, for example, are going back and forward in their daily business carrying these gasses will be able to move across the Border and their certificates will be recognised in the North under the Northern Ireland protocol and the F-Gas regulation on an enduring basis.</p> <p>  The broader omnibus Bill provisions are the only part that are relevant to my Department.  There are no other environmental or climate related parts from my perspective.  This is considered on an ongoing basis with regard to the potential need for secondary legislation and that may arise between now and the end of the year.  The other part is to watch the ongoing negotiations and a component of that is the level playing field.  That will have a bearing to a certain extent on environmental alignment between the EU and the UK on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

The last meeting was held in private session on Monday morning and one item which was discussed was the election of a Vice Chairman.  Deputy Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh was deemed elected and I congratulate him and look forward to working with him.</p><p>I welcome the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  She is accompanied by her officials Ms Dearbh&aacute;il Nic Giolla Mhic&iacute;l, principal officer, and Mr. Henry Fottrell, assistant principal officer.  The Minister must leave at 9.45 a.m. to attend business in the D&aacute;il at the Convention Centre, at which stage Mr. Fottrell will participate.  </p><p>The committee has invited the Minister before it to discuss the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020 as it is clear that these matters are of huge significance as we are just over 2,000 hours away from the end of the Brexit transition period and subsequent withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  </p><p>Ireland and the United Kingdom have had a long history of reciprocal co-operation regarding social security and on many other matters.  These arrangements are the bedrock of relations between our two states.  This relationship of mutual benefit and co-operation serves both Irish and British people extremely well.  From January we must continue to develop and deepen that overarching relationship.  However, amid the uncertainty of Brexit all eventualities must be planned for.  These are important concerns which impact upon the lives of people on an everyday basis and all aspects of our economy and society.  I thank the Minister for being with us. </p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of evidence they are required to give to a committee.

This is my first appearance before the committee and I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the Chairman on his appointment and to say that I look forward to working with him and all the members in the time ahead in my role as Minister with responsibility for social protection and rural and community development.  It is a broad brief but I think there are great synergies between the two Departments.  Together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, I want to work with the committee.  We do not have a monopoly on good ideas and while I know we will not always agree on everything I hope we will be able to work constructively with the committee to progress proposals which will deliver real benefits for people across the country.</p><p>I have Private Members' business in the D&aacute;il at 10 a.m. so it will be a short visit this morning but I understand I will be back next week and the following week on the Revised Estimates for both Departments and that will allow for more detailed discussion on the wider aspects of both briefs.</p><p>Coming back to the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020, there are now just 85 days remaining until 31 December.The Government and the EU remain steadfast in our efforts to secure a negotiated outcome on the future relationship with the UK.  However, we have been planning for all scenarios.</p><p>To underpin the readiness measures required at the end of the transition period, the Government approved the preparation of a scheme for the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020, known as the 2020 Brexit omnibus Bill.  Many of the provisions reflect the legislation enacted before the original expected Brexit date of 29 March 2019.  The Bill underlines the common travel area arrangements formalised in a memorandum of understanding signed by both Governments on 8 May 2019 and ensures the rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens which remain under this long-standing agreement.</p><p>The overarching aim of this legislation is to address the wide range of complex issues that could arise for citizens and businesses post transition.  Parts 14 and 15 of the Bill fall within my remit and I will outline each of these in turn.</p><p>I will first speak to Part 14.A key area of concern is the impact of Brexit on those current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance, which includes pensions and social assistance, being means tested schemes linked to residency rights, and child benefit between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.</p><p>Part 14 sets out the amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 in order to maintain the <i>status quo </i>under the common travel area arrangements, which build on work already completed by the Department, which has resulted in a new agreement on social security with the UK.  This was possible due to the unique nature of the common travel area and the associated rights and privileges which it provides and will continue to provide for Irish and British citizens in each other&rsquo;s countries.  This agreement was signed 1 February 2019 and passed through the necessary parliamentary ratification processes in both Ireland and the UK during March 2019.  Under the terms of the agreement existing arrangements with regard to recognition of and access to, social insurance entitlements will be maintained in both jurisdictions.  This means that the rights of Irish citizens living in Ireland to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in the UK and to access social insurance payments if resident in the UK are protected and maintained.</p><p>There are approximately 132,000 people in receipt of a UK state pension living in this country and approximately 1,000 people receiving child benefit payments from the UK for children residing in Ireland.  There are 27,100 people residing in the UK who are in receipt of a contributory State pension from Ireland.  Just over 900 people residing in the UK are in receipt of full rate child benefit payments from this Department.  These payments are in respect of 1,950 children, 97% of whom reside in Northern Ireland.  A further 920 people residing in the UK are in receipt of child benefit supplement payments, in respect of 2,015 children, 98% of whom reside in Northern Ireland.  The work undertaken to date is to ensure the continuation of these payments.  </p><p>The provisions of Part 14 are as follows: to allow for the Minister to make an order to provide for the implementation of a signed agreement which has not yet been ratified; and to enable the Department to continue to share data with UK operators for the purposes of the recovery of benefits and assistance arrangements.  This will ensure that specified benefits paid to an injured person by my Department following an accident can be recouped from a UK based compensator, just as before; and provides for other technical amendments to insert specific references to the UK into a number of sections of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 which include references to EU payments.</p><p>Specifically, these ensure the continuation of the existing arrangements in the case of persons receiving an invalidity pension from Ireland who become entitled to a UK state retirement pension; the continuation of the recoupment of supplementary welfare allowances paid by my Department to persons awaiting UK payments; and that island allowances can continue to be paid to persons who rely on an equivalent primary UK payment to support their entitlement.  In addition, UK child benefit will continue to be disregarded in the means test for social assistance schemes.  </p><p> Part 15 of the Bill amends the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984 which provides for the insolvency payments scheme.  The scheme covers wage-related entitlements of employees who are employed in Ireland by an employer who has become insolvent in Ireland or another EU member state.  After the end of the transition period, employers in a state of insolvency under the laws of the UK will not fall within the scope of the Act.  That means employees of those employers, who work and pay their social insurance in Ireland, would no longer be covered by the protections set out in the Act unless the amendments set out in this part of the Bill are made.</p><p> The amendments in this part of the Bill are to ensure those employees will continue to be covered by the scheme after Brexit.  The amendments in this part provide for updates to existing definitions in respect of employees employed, or habitually employed, in Ireland and whose employers are made insolvent under the laws of the UK so that they continue to be covered by the scheme, technical matters concerning the date of the insolvency and the amounts certified by the actuary and that the Minister may, by regulation, provide for the transfer of data to the UK for the purpose of carrying out the functions of the Act.</p><p> Given the economic uncertainties which may prevail if no deal is reached in the future relationship negotiations, and indeed in the current Covid-19 scenario, it is vital that we continue to provide this protection to workers in Ireland and that is why these amendments are being introduced.</p><p> This legislation is an essential part of the whole-of-Government preparations for Brexit.  I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for allowing me to outline my Department&rsquo;s legislative planning.  I appreciate the co-operation of this committee, and its support, to ensure that we can get this Bill enacted by 31 December.  I thank everyone for their attention and I am happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

The Minister has provided us with a detailed Bill, but do I take it that its objective is, quite simply, to retain the <i>status quo</i>?  I refer to the system of arrangements we have had in the context of the European Union now continuing in respect of our relationship with the UK, both Northern Ireland and the island of Britain.  I ask the Minister to outline to us how many countries we have bilateral social welfare arrangements with outside of the European Union.  Many people do not understand that there are many countries around the world where they can build up contributions and then use them here for their pension entitlements.  Will the Minister also explain the difference between Regulation EC 883/2004 and these bilateral arrangements?  Is there a big difference between our arrangements with the European Union and our arrangements with the rest of the world, including, for example, America and Australia?</p><p>My time is short, so I will make one final comment.  In the context of Brexit, we were told that planes would not fly and many other things.  Now, however, when we are coming to the edge of the cliff, we have found that life will go on with or without an agreement on Brexit.  We all hope that there will be agreement, but life will go on regardless and we will have to make arrangements in that context.  I am glad that this aspect is going to be absolutely seamless for those in receipt of social welfare.  I state that because every one of us, particularly in the west of Ireland, is used to a mix of contributions, with America and the UK being the two major countries involved.  </p><p>The only complaint I have concerns the bad service which the Minister's Department seems to experience in getting the details of people's contribution records when those are sought from the United Kingdom to supplement records here.  That has nothing to do with the Minister's Department, but during the negotiations with her British counterpart I hope that the Minister will raise this issue.  In this day of computers, it should be possible to be able to transfer a record within 24 hours.  It often takes months to get those records now and that not is not fair to people who are entitled to benefits.</p></speech>

This legislation is to ensure that the <i>status quo</i>remains and that everything happening between Ireland and the UK will continue to happen after Brexit.  That is the most important aspect.  What we are dealing with now is the back end of the work to ensure that people on the ground can continue to receive their payments and benefits seamlessly.  That is the purpose of this Bill.</p><p>Arrangements with the EU are more comprehensive than other bilateral agreements, including, for example, with the USA.  The arrangements we have with the UK mirror those with the EU.  I do not have a figure for the number of bilateral agreements that we have and I will have to respond later to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v with an answer.  I honestly do not know how many we have-----</p></speech>

It is certainly worth letting people know about this issue.  Regarding the delays in getting information from the UK, such as social insurance contributions, I understand that is an issue and I am aware of the problem.  We will ask the UK authorities, in this age of modern technology, if they could pass over those records more quickly.  It is annoying for people waiting for payments to have to wait for that information from the UK.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Minister has been clear in stating that the <i>status quo</i>will remain regarding social welfare payments.  Regarding the secondary payment, the winter fuel payment, which many people living here receive - it is the English version of the fuel allowance - I want to make sure that will be protected.  Turning to the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984, I understand that the Minister is stating that Irish employees left redundant by an English company based here will be covered by the insolvency payments scheme.  I assume that the onus of paying for that will fall on the Irish authorities</p></speech>

We want to ensure, therefore, that staff working and paying their PRSI contributions here will get their full entitlements under our legislation.  That is why we are ensuring that we have this agreement and that commitments will have to be honoured.  Staff who work in this country, however, will get benefits from our redundancy payments.</p></speech>

All workers' rights have been protected under the extension.  If a worker went to work somewhere else and was subsequently made redundant, then the workers' rights are protected even though it was extended.  It has been extended now to November, although I do not have the date off the top of my head.

It is a tax-free lump sum payment to eligible people to help towards their winter heating costs.  It is a lump sum payment between &pound;100 and &pound;300.  In most cases, it is paid automatically between November and December.  As of winter 2012-13, people who live in the EEA or Switzerland who have a genuine and sufficient link to the UK are potentially eligible to receive the winter fuel payment regardless of whether they previously had entitlement to it while living in the UK.  This change occurred following a 2011 European Court of Justice ruling.  Before 2012-13 only people who had entitlement to the winter fuel payment prior to moving overseas were eligible.  The Department in the UK published statistics to show that in winter 2017-18 a total of 78% of the winter fuel payments made to EEA countries and Switzerland were made to people living in the Republic of Ireland.  This amounted to approximately 31,200 payments.  As I understand it, that payment will continue.</p></speech>

I wish to express my support for this legislation.  It is important that the <i>status quo </i>is maintained and that we enjoy equal rights between Irish people and UK citizens.

It was useful.  It has clearly been underpinned by a great amount of work by the Department.  The one comment or question I have is about the principal of reciprocity or the reciprocal arrangement.  A great deal has been happening with Brexit and we have seen ample preparation on the European and Irish sides.  This has not always been reflected on the UK side.  A significant amount of work has gone in here to ensure we are well provided for in terms of the social welfare arrangements.  Is the Minister happy that the same amount of work and preparation is taking place on the UK side so that Irish citizens living in the UK will be similarly protected as we get to the far side of Brexit?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I look forward to working with him and the rest of the committee.</p> <p>  To be fair, in this case we have had a good deal of toing and froing between the UK authorities and us in reaching this agreement.  We have agreed the convention with the UK.  These provisions are to ensure that we can operate the agreement, which we call the convention, regardless of what happens.  In fairness to those responsible in the UK, they have been co-operative with us.  I remember my predecessor, Senator Regina Doherty, saying that when our officials were working with their counterparts prior to getting the whole agreement together, they had been co-operative.  They agreed the common travel area before any withdrawal agreement was in place and they were happy to come with this.  I am satisfied that Irish citizens living in the UK should get all the payments to which they are entitled.</p></speech>

One relates to people who are on the southern side of the Border but living in the North and their social welfare payments.  How will that work post Brexit?</p> <p>  Head 15 provides for the Minister to provide for transfer of data to the UK by regulation for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the Act.  The data would be exchanged by relevant officers and so on.  What type of data would be transferred from the South to Britain and the North?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-07a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020100700002#C01100"><p>The type of data we are talking about are social insurance records.  The provision would allow the payment of the necessary benefits that people are entitled to.  Initially we had thought we would need a data protection change but we did not as it relates to the law enforcement directive, which has its own data protection requirements.  We can make this agreement through an exchange of letters.  The purpose is so that we can have recovery of benefits and assistance.  Furthermore, where, for example, someone receives a benefit and gets a claim from an insurance company and the insurance company is based in the UK, then we can get that information if we need it.  That is the purpose of it.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly asked about Northern Ireland.  I said earlier that approximately 98% of some of the payments go to people who are resident in Northern Ireland and working here.  We are satisfied that with this arrangement the people in Northern Ireland will get all the benefits to which they are entitled.  That was probably the overriding issue because that is where most of them go and we want to ensure they get all their entitlements.</p></speech>

I am deeply concerned.  What protections do we have to ensure any data or that type of information being passed over on individuals from the Twenty-six Counties do not get into the hands of the British state security services?</p></speech>

We are satisfied that the purpose of the data relating to Part 15 of the Act concerns the insolvency payments scheme.  For example, authorities would need to know the hours worked and the wages.  We need certain information to make the necessary payments.  I am sure those on the other side need certain information so that workers will get their entitlements.  I am satisfied that the data will be used for the purpose for which they are intended.</p></speech>

I have three brief questions.  Has the Bill to be passed by a certain date?  Is there urgency on the date for the Bill to be passed and to go through all Stages in both Houses?  We have discussed reciprocal arrangements.  If the date of the pension age changes in Ireland, will this Bill have any effect?  Does it cover that aspect of it?  Will it have consequences for people if the age changes from 66 to 67 or 68 years?</p> <p>  The Minister said that the provision in the Bill relating to the memorandum of understanding on fraud control is not required now.  Why is the control of fraud provision relating to social welfare payments not now required in the Bill?</p><p>Am I reading that correctly?</p></speech>

While the D&aacute;il Business Committee decided to grant a waiver to the normal pre-legislative scrutiny process in respect of the Bill, it has asked all relevant Ministers to brief their appropriate committees by 9 October.  It is expected that the final version of the Bill will be brought to Government shortly thereafter for approval, to publish and to bring before the Oireachtas.  It will be essential ensure swift progress of this legislation to minimise any uncertainty for businesses.  There are only 80 plus days, or 2,000 hours, as mentioned by the Chairman, remaining before Brexit so we need to get this Bill through as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  The pension age is not impacted by this legislation.  I will bring legislation before the House before the end of this year to provide that the pension age will not increase to 67 next year as anticipated.  It will remain at 66 until the commission on pensions, which we are in the process of establishing, has reviewed the matter and made a recommendation on it to Government.  To clarify, people who will reach age 66 by 1 January next should apply for their pension now.  I think some people were a bit unsure about that so I take this opportunity to get that information out there.</p></speech>

Some of my questions have been already asked.  </p> <p>  On the UK fuel allowance, I have spent many an hour on the telephone to Newcastle on behalf of many constituents trying to get their details.  I ask that the Minister and her officials seek greater co-operation with their counterparts in the UK because there has been long delays in getting that information through, as other Deputies and Senators have said.  I welcome that this legislation protects that payment.  As mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v we need to get information out there because many people qualify for this payment in Ireland but are not aware of it.  I have come across many of them over the past number of years.  It is a substantial payment.  As mentioned by the Minister, it is between &pound;100 and &pound;300 sterling and so it would make a difference to those who have an entitlement to it.  I ask that the Department encourage its counterparts in the UK to be more co-operative in this regard.  As stated by the Chairman and the Minister, respectively, there are only 2,000 hours or 85 days to withdrawal.  If there is no agreement, this Bill will still be agreed by both sides.  We need to get that message out today because a substantial number of people here are entitled to UK pensions.  I welcome that this Bill will secure those payments for them and I again thank the Minister for bringing it before us today.</p></speech>

People can continue to claim it because of this reciprocal agreement with the UK.  We will raise the issue of the delay in processing claims or providing information.</p></speech>

Before she leaves, I have a question for her.  Will there be a public information campaign on the consequences of Brexit and the impact in regard to rights, entitlements and so forth, not just by the Minister's Department but across the whole of government.  Currently, everybody's focus is on Covid-19.  Is it proposed to have a public information campaign to prepare people for what will effectively be a no-deal Brexit regardless of what happens in the next 2,000 hours?</p></speech>

I have heard on radio the call for businesses to get ready for Brexit, which I am sure the Chairman has heard too.  In my previous role as Minister with responsibility for business, that Department had a massive campaign and held workshops.  As part of those workshops, officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection attended to provide people with information on social protection entitlements.</p><p>I am happy to engage with the committee.  It is about letting people know that the <i>status quo</i>remains and people will retain their entitlements.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, we can broaden that out in regard to the other countries when we have this bilateral arrangement.  I am happy to work with the committee on that.</p></speech>

I am talking about citizens.  For example, with the best will in the world I believe there will be a prolonged delay in getting information from Newcastle after 1 January.  I accept the Minister's reassurances here but I personally would be very concerned about GDPR, data protection and so forth.  In regard to those persons who will become eligible for a pension from 1 January surely we should be actively encouraging them to apply now if they have a mixed contribution so that we can get that information in advance.</p><p>That message is not getting out there and I think there is a responsibility on the Department and across the Government to look at this issue and other broader issues across the Government that impact on individual citizens and not just business.</p></speech>

I take the point that we need to reassure people that if they have worked in the UK and are now living in Ireland there are benefits they can get and they should make sure to check that out.  I do not know if we ever do campaigns around that.  I am not sure.  Perhaps we have done in the past.  We have general campaigns on what people are entitled to, but we will consider this specific matter.  The Chairman is absolutely correct.  People will be concerned about whether they will still get their UK pensions.  That is one thing they are worried about.  We will reassure them.  There is no reason we could not do an information campaign as part of the overall Brexit information which will be provided through the Government over the next number of months.  Minds will be focused as we get closer to the date.</p></speech>

I have a couple of brief questions.  If it is not possible to answer them today, responses may be submitted in writing afterwards.</p><p>There are approximately 132,000 people in Ireland in receipt of a UK pension.  How many have received top-up payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection?  </p><p>As we know, the common travel area goes back to 1924 and predates the establishment of the European Union.  We have reciprocal arrangements in place.  However, from my experience the common travel area has never been properly recognised after the initial period in terms of the habitual residency condition.  In respect of the habitual residency condition, initially a different approach was taken to British citizens residing here.  However, in more recent times there has been a very rigid interpretation of that.  What will be the treatment of the habitual residency condition test from 1 January?</p><p>The convention on social security between the Government and the UK authorities, which was signed on 1 February 2019, recognises the schemes that were in place at that time.  Since then, the parental benefit scheme, the unemployment benefit schemes for the self-employed and the pandemic unemployment payment have been introduced here.  They are not covered by that convention.  I would like reassurance that citizens of this State or people who have built up an entitlement in this State will continue to be able to draw on those entitlements from 1 January 2021.</p><p>What arrangements are now in place to deal with the all-Ireland free travel scheme from 1 January?  Does legislation need to be introduced?  Why is that not referenced in the primary legislation that we have?</p><p>Colleagues referred to Newcastle and the reciprocal arrangements that are in place.  The difficulty for all of us is that there seems to be a bottomless pit once a request goes in to Newcastle.  My concern, as I outlined to the Minister, concerns GDPR issues and the fact there is now a third country state that does not have GDPR recognition with the European Union.  We have seen the various interpretations of data protection legislation in Ireland.  Could that delay the process of releasing information and deny entitlements to individuals residing here, or <i>vice versa</i>in terms of Irish citizens with mixed contributions making a claim in the UK?</p></speech>

I will start with the last question and work back through them.  The issue with delays in getting records is not something we have any control over, unfortunately.  We simply do not know whether the delays will be worse after Brexit.  We hope not.  As the Minister said, when we were drafting the convention we had very good co-operation with our UK counterparts and we hope that will continue after Brexit.  I expect that it will.  All I can tell the committee is that we hope there will not be any further delays.  We will not know until things start to operate in the new environment.  We will see how things work out then.</p> <p>  The all-Ireland free travel scheme is a non-statutory scheme.  There are no legislative provisions for it as it is, which is why there is nothing in the Bill about it.  The main issue concerns the contract with Translink to produce the cards for the all-Ireland free travel scheme.  Our colleagues have worked with it in order to update the contract to ensure it is GDPR compliant.  Again, the issue is the UK being a third country after Brexit.  That is in hand but no legislation is required.</p> <p>  When we started the work on Brexit preparations, it was obvious that not very much was written down about the common travel area although it had existed since 1924.  There are two key documents.  The first is an overall common travel area agreement that was signed in May of last year between the UK and Ireland.  It set out the range of issues that the common travel area covers, including our social welfare issues as well as health, education and the ability to move and work between the two jurisdictions.  The convention on social security deals specifically with the social welfare payments which were covered under the EU regulations and which are now covered under the new convention.</p> <p>  As the Chairman said, there was a provision regarding the habitual residence test in the legislation at one stage.  I understand it provided that a person who lived within the common travel area for three years would be regarded as habitually resident.  That was changed a number of years ago.  Nothing we are doing now changes the rules regarding the habitual residence condition.  It will continue to operate as it does at the moment.</p> <p>  I am not sure we have figures on the number of UK pensioners living in Ireland who are in receipt of top-ups.  We can certainly get that information and send it to the committee.</p> <p>  As the Chairman said, the convention lists specific schemes and they are the schemes that are covered.  The convention was drafted and passed through the legislative processes of the two countries in time to be ready for the original Brexit date of 29 March last year.  As the Chairman said, some new schemes have been introduced since that time.  We always knew that was a possibility and likewise we knew the UK might introduce new schemes over the course of the agreement.  It was our intention to keep the agreement up to date to include any new schemes that come online.</p></speech>

I will leave a final comment with the witnesses.  The habitual residency condition is something that could come back to haunt us if, down the road, we take a different approach from that taken in the UK in terms of the test.</p><p>I do not think it is an issue in the short term but it will have to be looked at again.</p></speech>

Our habitual residence test applies to anybody coming here from anywhere and asks people to prove their centre of interest is this State.  I have discussed this with people in Britain who are familiar with welfare and my understanding is that they do not have the equivalent.  When a person goes to England and claims welfare, they do not have our habitual residence test, which we introduced to stop welfare shopping or people coming here for the purpose of welfare.  As the Department can confirm no doubt, back in the day there was an arrangement made with St. Brendan's Safe Home Ireland.  If it vouched for a person then it had to produce as much evidence as it could but if somebody was picked up off the streets then it was presumed that St. Brendan's was fixing him or her up and that a person's main centre of interest was going to be here.  I understand the arrangement worked quite well.  We all are aware of problems with people coming from America, England or wherever proving habitual residence.  It is the only case, to my knowledge, where one does not get anything not even supplementary welfare.  One cannot apply for housing, a medical card or anything else until one proves habitual residence.  My understanding is that was an Irish arrangement to deal with an Irish problem.</p></speech>
