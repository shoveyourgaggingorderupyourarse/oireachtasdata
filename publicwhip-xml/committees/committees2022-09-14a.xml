    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#A00200"><p>The purpose of today's meeting is to examine the nitrates derogation and nitrates action programme.  The committee will hear from a number of expert witnesses and officials from the relevant Departments.</p> <p>  Before we do so, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that they must, for the duration of the meeting, switch off their mobile phones completely or switch them to airplane or flight mode depending on the device.  On 28 February, the legal requirement for mask-wearing in all settings was removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use face coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus or in close proximity to others.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.</p> <p>  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts.  They may, therefore, consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurance in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts.</p><p>Members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.  </p><p> This will be our first session on the nitrates derogation and nitrates action programme.  In the first session today, the committee will hear from representatives from the Irish Creamery and Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, Mr. Pat McCormack, president; Mr. Denis Drennan, deputy president and chairperson of the farm and rural affairs committee; Mr. John Enright, general secretary; and Ms Alisha Ryan, the policy advisor.  I will now call on the witnesses to make their opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chair.  Never was it more important to get the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I sincerely thank them all for attending today.  We have made a submission and committee members will have gone through it, so I will not go through it word for word.  I have been involved in farming politics for ten to 12 years and never before has our industry been under such scrutiny.  We are facing climate change and there is a perception out there that is there is not a cap.  It is fair to say that directly, there is not a cap at this point in time, even though my colleague, John Enright, and I sit on the Food Vision beef and sheep group, as well as the Food Vision dairy group.  Time will tell as regards a cap.</p> <p>  There is a huge challenge out there and it is upon us without much consultation, which is the nitrates, the nitrates derogation and the nitrates action programme.  There is a perception out there that this may affect some large farmers.  However, the reality is that it affects the family farm model.  There is the model that is used by some of larger institutions, such as Bord Bia or Ornua to promote and advertise our products right around the globe.</p> <p>  At the outset, I give the committee an example of a 30 ha farm with 84 cows, which is the average-sized farm.  By the time this presentation is finished, they could find themselves back with 62 cows.  For many young and middle-aged farmers, that may be the difference between being viable and not.  That is the challenge that is there for us.  If it undermines the viability of our family farm model, over a short period of time, it will ultimately undermine the viability of our industry at a processing level.  It will cause severe economic carnage for many family farms.  </p> <p>  Water quality is very often mentioned.  One would think that the farmer had no cognisance about or interest in water quality.  However, the reality is that farmers, whether they are dairy or otherwise, are more dependent on water quality not just than most people, but than anyone.</p> <p>  We have invested heavily in slurry storage in recent years.  We have invested in low-emissions slurry spreaders.  There is ongoing investment into and huge uptake in the use of protected urea.  Our State advisory service, Teagasc, has strongly indicated that it will take between 18 and 24 months for a change in practice in order to deliver results.  That relates to the message that we want to drive home here today, which is that we need time for the change in practice in order to deliver results.  Unfortunately, there seems to be one regulation after another in that regard.  The opportunity of time is not afforded to the industry.  </p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that climate change is here and that we are involved in the Food Vision dairy group and the Food Vision beef and sheep group.  There is an opportunity to embrace new technologies that can deliver from an emissions perspective, but also from a nitrates perspective.  The nitrates regulations are upon us here and now, it is fair to say, without consultation with the farm bodies.  The most disappointing thing for me as a farm leader was that we took a delegation to Brussels to meet with officials of the agri-environmental group, the Directorate-General for Environment.  The message that seemed to come from Ireland was that we need to target intensive farmers.  It was hugely disappointing that Irish men or women would say that.  Some of our most intensive farmers are our family farm models.  They have modest holdings that need to be intensive in order for them to make a living, because the margin had been eroded.  Change is coming with the chemical fertiliser sales and register and the reductions in fertiliser use, both of which help our water quality and our opportunity from a nitrates perspective.  However, we need those 18 to 24 months of time.  When it comes to farmer supports, most recently, we have seen in the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, that a 1990s payment in an era where inflation has eroded farmer margins is not at all attractive to commercial farmers, irrespective of whether they are in the area of dairy or beef.</p> <p>  One of the greatest threats of all to the dairy industry is cow banding.  If a cow weighs approximately 6,500 kg, a farmer with a 30 ha farm will have to reduce his or her numbers significantly by approximately 14 or thereabouts.  That is hugely challenging and undermining.  On the issue of the potential reduction from 250 kg to 220 kg, what exactly will that carry in the catchment area?  If the harbour in Waterford is in bother does that mean that Tipperary, Kilkenny, Waterford, Laois, Carlow and Kildare will be all affected?  These are the questions that have not been answered, even though the regulation is on its way.</p> <p>  There is a whole challenge around eutrophication.  How much of it comes from agriculture and how much of it comes from elsewhere?  That is a challenge that is out there, as are the effects that this is likely to have on our industry.  We have given various different examples throughout the presentation, but the two changes, which are the cow banding and the potential move down to 220 kg will see that 30 ha farmer actually reducing his or her cow numbers by 22.  That is a 26% reduction.  That is huge at a time when farmers have invested heavily, borrowed heavily with the potential to make their payments.  This will be the difference between farmers making a financial payment or not.  I guarantee the committee, just as night follows day, that farm organisations will be back here in four , five and six years&rsquo; time with financial pressures on farms as a result of these.  That is why the challenge is out there for us all, and indeed for this committee in particular, to drive home the message that we need time to deliver the changes that have been implemented at farm level.</p> <p>  Another example of restraint and restriction is the slurry export rules and the volume has to double in order to remain within the same query.  Do the nitrogen and the phosphorus double in the tank over a period of time?  Did I miss something on New Years Day?  I do not say that lightly, because it is a huge issue.  What is necessary, and we have looked for this at the Food Vision group on dairy, is that an economic assessment should be carried out on the impact on farm families and, indeed, the wider rural and national economy as a result of these changes.  We need to see proper supports in place, including a meaningful ACRES scheme, because the solutions are within.  Yet, the more farmers that can be brought into an agri-environmental scheme in a meaningful way, the better.  We look forward to a question-and-answer session, but the issue here is the survival of the intensive, modest family farm unit that is severely undermined by this nitrates change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#B00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  It is important that they bring up this timely issue regarding the nitrates action plan and how it could have a huge impact on rural Ireland in particular.  Mr. McCormack mentioned banding.  The nitrates issue comes down to several issues, namely, that we will potentially reduce our nitrates by 250 kg to 220 kg, which will take a rotation out of the majority of farms.  That will have a huge affect on the stocking rate of the majority of farms.  There was a debate a few months ago regarding climate change and where we will be regarding potentially reducing stock numbers.  If this goes wrong, this will be a cull on the national herd.  That is effectively what will happen if banding comes in, as well as the reduction of the nitrates action plan, which will bring nitrogen down to 220 kg.  Throughout the country, that reduction on dairy herds will see anything up to 15% of the herd being wiped away.</p><p>Dairy farmers throughout the entire country could see up to 15% of their herds wiped out between now and 2025.  The timelines are crucial.  </p><p> I am interested in the witnesses' interactions with the Department.  There have been major changes in the Department over the past six to eight months.  Are they happy with the level of information they are receiving regarding, for example, the volume of organic nitrogen being used?  Are they happy with the statement that is issued on a six-monthly basis?  It was issued yesterday for the first time.  Are they happy that the farming community has been kept informed of these issues and has enough information for this year?  I have a great fear that we do not have enough information on nitrates, given that the figures were only published yesterday.  </p><p> I am also interested in the future.  We have had industrial levels of investment in production.  If we were to have a 15% cut in the national herd, which is potentially what is required, do the witnesses believe the stainless steel industry will stand still, with nothing happening?  Has there been investment in manufacturing plants that might not get enough raw materials to do its job?  </p><p> The most important point made today is on the economic impact this will have on the entire rural economy.  In a town such as Bandon, or any other town in rural Ireland, the economic effect could be enormous.  We need to get a figure for what it could mean for rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#C00200"><p>The Senator made a lot of interesting points.  The reduction from 250 kg to 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare will have a significant impact.  Farmers will either have to destock or shorten their grazing season somehow, which would be hugely frustrating.  We are renowned as the best in the world for growing grass and the length of our grazing season has a significant part to play in the promotion of our products as we move forward.  The figures for organic nitrogen were published yesterday, which is far too late in the year.  They should be issued at least on a quarterly, if not monthly, basis to give farmers an indication of where they are.<br/><br/><font color="#212529">  The Senator mentioned stainless steel.  There is a huge fear that we will have unutilised or under-utilised stainless steel.  That will create inefficiencies at processor level and will undermine our competitiveness on export markets.  The growth in exports from the agricultural sector had a significant part to play in the past decade, in particular, in bringing this country out of recession.  There were opportunities for expansion in the dairy sector with the abolition of quotas and that drove a huge stimulus in the rural economy from a construction and service-provider perspective.  There was huge demand among young people to study agricultural courses.  While in 2022-23 those agricultural courses will be filled, the same level of demand was not evident, and that has to be a concern and an indication of where we are going.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#212529">  The Senator asked about the Department and the level of interaction.  We have never made a secret of the fact that we were not happy with the level of interaction and consultation on the nitrates regulations.  Key personnel changes were made in the Department at a critical time in the context of fighting this country's cause.  Experienced heads and people who had been around the block and who had been out interacting with farmers and farm organisations were moved from the nitrates area at a critical time.  If I was in management, that is not a move I would have made.  Perhaps my colleagues would like to comment further.</font></p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#C00300"><p>The Senator asked some excellent questions.  The shock is that farmers could receive letters this time next year telling them that they will have to reduce their herds by up to 26%.  That will depend on water quality results for this year and next year.  The water quality results are normally released in July but for some reason, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has not released them yet.  Here we are, in the middle of September and we have no idea where water quality trends have gone for 2021.  This time next year we will be getting water quality results for 2022 and if there is a significant change in either direction, a decision will be made, sent to Europe and will come back to farmers by the end of next year.  Farmers could end up getting letters in November or December next year telling them they have to destock by 26% by 1 January 2025.  It is not like this is way out in the distance; it is critically close.</p> <p>  As our president said, we are not happy with the volume of information on banding coming from the Department.  At the moment we are not certain which band any of us, as farmers, will fit into because the banding system is based on 2021 and 2022 stocking rates versus the volume of milk produced on a holding.  We are still seeking clarity on which cows will be counted in that system but we cannot get that.  We cannot even establish which band we would have fitted into for the past three years or for this year and the previous two.  There is huge uncertainty.  People are not sure where they are going or what they are doing, yet they are being asked to make huge investment decisions on their farms and co-operatives are making huge investments on their behalf as well.  </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned an excess of stainless steel.  The issue, as our president has said numerous times, is that farmers have spent huge amounts to be compliant with regulations but those regulations keep changing every year.  We have banding this year and we have cuts in the nitrogen allowance this year that are going to have a significant effect.  The number of cows in the country could be cut by between 15% and 20%, as the Senator suggested and which is probably pretty accurate.  Not only have farmers made investments on their own farms that will have to be paid for from fewer cows and less milk, but the co-operatives have also spent money on behalf of farmers that will have to be recouped from a smaller milk pool.  There is a double-whammy coming if the number of cows in the country is cut and the production of milk is reduced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Enright" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#C00400"><p>To add a few points to that, we have members who are milking cows and supplying milk to their local co-operatives today.  Next November or December when they are drying off their cows, it will be decided whether they are going to be in band 2 or band 3 and that will have a very serious impact on the number of cows they have.  People need to realise that this is the first time ever that dairy farmers are going to be forced to reduce stock numbers.  In a lot of cases, these are very sustainable farmers.  They can produce the grass for the number of cows they have in a very sustainable way but a decision has been taken that effectively completely undermines their ability to earn a living from farming.  These are farmers with between 40 and 70 cows.  People have a notion in their heads that derogation farmers are all very larger farmers but that is not the case.  A large number of them have between 50 and 70 cows on small holdings and the derogation is critical if they are to continue in business.  If they have to reduce cow numbers by between 10% and 25%, that is it for them; they are gone.  I am not sure the politicians realise that, to be quite honest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#C00600"><p>I welcome our guests.  I read through their opening statement, in which they say that the ICMSA is confident that water quality trends will move in the right direction in the near future.  As committee members, we have the benefit of seeing in advance the statements from departmental officials who will be before the committee later and they say quite the opposite.  They say that we are going in the wrong direction currently.  Previously they have said to this committee that we are not going to meet our obligations under the EU water framework directive, which has been in place for more than 30 years.  What would the witnesses say to that?  I am getting a sense that they see a slow glide path here but a glide path that would take the dairy sector way beyond the directive target of 2027, which is the end date for all our watercourses and water bodies to achieve a "good" water quality standard.  It does not seem that what they are saying aligns with where we need to get to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#C00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  Maybe we gave that impression but the figures that are being discussed at the moment include 2018, which was a challenging year.  If the Deputy attended a discussion group meeting of farmers in 2018 and talked about protected urea, he would have been talking about something they knew very little about it.  Now, if one talks about protected urea at discussion group meetings, it is the norm.</p><p>Equally, there is low-emissions slurry spreading and the benefit it can have. The utilisation and the value put on animal nitrogen at this time is significant.  For one reason or another, 2022 has been a watershed year for the utilisation of organic nitrogen on the farm.  The difficulty is that Teagasc, the State's scientific farm advisory service, indicates to us it will be late 2023 or 2024 before the evidence will be found of the change in practice.  In the mean time, we will have two significant regulations brought upon us that will affect the family farm model.</p></speech>

The ICMSA has strongly given the impression the average family farm is going to be severely impacted by the fifth nitrates action programme and the derogation but is it not true that just 5% of holdings are derogation farmers, or some 6,000 farms?</p></speech>

This perception that it is a guy with 300, 400, 500 or 600 cows is out there.  I went to a local football match about three weeks ago on a nice, quiet Saturday evening and a man came up beside me in the stand.  I did not ask him to come and sit beside me but his issue was the nitrates; it was going to finish him.  He was going from 76 cows down to 63 cows and that was going to be curtains.</p></speech>

What if I were a farmer who did not have an intensive set-up but who was being required to fulfil the needs of the action plan because of my neighbour, who as an intensive farmer is the person whose practices are actually leading to the deterioration of water quality?  Is that a fair thing to say?</p></speech>

It states:</p> <blockquote> 	98,5 % of all monitoring stations for groundwater in Ireland had mean nitrate concentrations below 50 mg/l, and 81,5 % of those monitoring stations had mean nitrate concentrations below 25 mg/l. All monitoring stations for surface water in Ireland had mean nitrate concentrations below 50 mg/l ... </blockquote> <p>I emphasise it states &quot;all&quot; stations.</p></speech>

If you compare us with the quality across Europe, we have a very good quality of water.  We accept we have challenges but look at it from a dairy farmer's perspective.  The agri-climate rural environment, ACRE, scheme was introduced recently.  It is absolutely irrelevant to assisting those family dairy farms.  People can criticise dairy farmers and they can criticise farmers in general but they are not getting the required supports.  The ACRES would be an opportunity to help farmers along that line but it is not being supported and they are being completely excluded from that scheme.  We have an agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP, scheme in which farmers have voluntarily participated.  They have gone to meetings and listened to our advisers, and that scheme is shown to work.  Our concern here is we are putting regulation on top of regulation on top of regulation.  We are not giving the regulations time to work.  What we are doing is absolutely hammering family dairy farms.  People have the impression, as our president said, these are all large farms but they are not.  A lot of these farmers have 50, 60 or 70 cows and we are going to put these people out of business with the direction we are going in.  We are giving them no support whatsoever.</p></speech>

I think that is completely wrong.  Derogation farmers can farm at that level of farming very sustainably from the environmental perspective.

The model in the last number of years has been the low-margin, high-volume one and that is intensive farming.  There is an alternative model in the organic one.  It is higher-margin and low-volume.  Is this not the critical point?  We want farmers to produce food.  We want farmers to have sustainable livelihoods.  The effort should be mostly towards ensuring farmers get a fair price and if they did then they would not need to have such high stocking rates on their farms, would not need to be applying so much nitrogen on their land and then we would not have the knock-on effect of the polluted rivers.</p></speech>

There is no point in getting a fair price, like &euro;3 per litre for your milk or &euro;15 per kilogram for your bullock, if you can only produce 100 l and one bullock.  It is about having a sustainable economic living from a family farm model.  I have sat here before when we have condemned and talked about the power of the retailer.  Margins have been eroded but there needs to be a certain level of output to have a viable family income from the agricultural sector and from the family farm.</p></speech>

They indicate that of farms with more than 500 units, 529 are in derogation; of those with more than 400 units, 411 are in derogation; of those with more than 300 units, 928 are in derogation; and of those with more than 200 units, 1,074 are in derogation.  These are some of the figures the Department has given us.  I was trying to get my head around them.  I agree fully with Mr. McCormack that a farmer with 30 or 40 ha should not have to reduce the number of cows by the amount referred to.  It would make the farms unviable.  We need to keep dairy farms at the level Mr. McCormack talked about, which is between 80 and 100 cows for a family farm.  That would be my definition of a family farm in the west where farms are smaller.  If we add up the numbers for farms with more than 200 cows, there are nearly 6,000 farmers who will be over the threshold.  I consider a 500-cow dairy herd to be a commercial operation.  Unfortunately, in many places, these are over villages.</p></speech>

They are not going near the derogation and they farm under the 170 threshold.  Mr. McCormack is right that they are now being put into an awkward position by going from 80 or 85 cows to 105 cows, depending on the output of the cow.  That is going to affect smaller farms.  An exception should be made for smaller farms.  Given some of the figures I have provided, we need to look hard at farms with 400, 500 and 600 cows if they are on derogation.  A living is what we want to make out of farming, not a multinational company.</p> <p>  On the derogation, is 20% not an awfully high figure?  I tallied up the figures and the derogation covers about 300,000 cows.  How many cows would be taken out if the derogation was removed?  Does Mr. McCormack have any idea?  A figure of between 15% and 20% was mentioned.  I tallied this up.  If there are 1.5 million dairy cows in the country, 10% of that is 150,000 cows.</p></speech>

If the new figures, whereby the number may increase from 80 or 85 cows to 105 cows, are applied, it will affect everyone.  That is the problem.  Whether a farmer is in derogation or not, it could put push the farmer over.  Have the groups before us done any analysis on that?</p></speech>

On the other side, when we increase from 80 or 85 cows to 105, what type of figure would that be?  Going by the figures I have looked at, is it fair to say that nearly any farm would go to 105 cows, given the way it is being done?  All farms, those with under 170 cows and those with over 170 cows, will be brought into the new bands.  Has any analysis been done on that?</p></speech>

In the year from 1 January 2023 the banding will come in.  Forget about the derogation.  Many farmers who use less than the 170 will be driven above the 170 figure and into derogation if they have high production cows.  That is going to be a huge issue.  It is a massive problem.  Looking then at what is coming down the line next year, if we go from 250 kg to 220 kg of nitrates per hectare, using the numbers the Deputy mentioned, the position would be catastrophic were the derogation to go.</p></speech>

That could include our habitats etc.  Unfortunately, we believe that no effort was made to entice these farmers in from a policy or options perspective and that is regrettable because we should be trying to bring these farmers on board.

Most of the questions I was going to ask have been answered already.  I know the ICMSA has been raising this during the summer with the Department and, as has been said, the economic consequences for rural Ireland can be huge.  Have all the changes in the Department led to some of the confusion that has been described so far in the meeting?  Could the witnesses speak more about the practicalities involved in meeting the demands that are made as part of the derogation, such as the timeframe concerned?  If the water quality report is issued in June 2023 and the derogation for some of the farmers will have changed in 2024 then what will those affected face in that intervening period?</p></speech>

Our concern is that we need to look at the impact of that decision on individual farmers.  It will be severe on individual farmers and rather than looking back at history we need to examine how we will resolve this issue for the farmers concerned.  That is our issue and our deputy president made the point that we need to give time for these measures to have an impact and we believe we have not been given sufficient time.  All we have done is put new and severe regulations on people and we need to look at that again.  We need to look at the economic impacts of that and try to resolve the issue going forward rather than looking back at history.</p></speech>

For the purpose of my questions I will play devil's advocate.  Assuming this new banding is in and we have the worst case scenario, more needs to be done to highlight the consequences, not just for the farmers involved.  Does the ICMSA have any idea of the impact the final result - if it is as we seem to be picking up this evening - will have on small rural economies off the farm, including hardware shops and suppliers?  There would be a serious knock-on there but do the witnesses have any idea what the effect would be?</p> <p>  Along that line and again playing devil's advocate, the solution to a decrease in cow numbers is to increase land.  If enough farmers who will be caught by this took that approach, where would that land come from and what other sectors would the dairy demand for land effect, be it forestry, tillage or farmers in other sectors?  Has the ICMSA gone as far as pinpointing how this can have a ripple effect beyond the people it directly affects?  Does the ICMSA have any information on that?</p> <p>  The ICMSA is aware of the following point because it is its business.  A lot of milk is coming over the Border for processing and rivers and watercourses along the Border do not know any border.  Is there a possibility that the co-operatives or processors in the South could be on an uneven playing field?  What similar conditions are being implemented in the North or are there any changes?  Could we end up with a situation where the co-operatives or processors could fill the vacuum that would be created if there was a reduction in cows here with milk from the North?</p></speech>

It is hard to quantify the wider rural effect because that could change on an ongoing basis.  In answering Deputy Fitzmaurice I said the herd was maturing and that it would bring more and more people into the loop from the perspective of having 106 cows or more in their herds.  In effect, that could provide the industry with an ongoing cull, which would be a huge issue.  It would particularly undermine those processors who have invested substantially in stainless steel in recent years and find themselves still paying for it.  They would find themselves particularly vulnerable if they are not getting the milk and it could bring into question the viability of some of our processors.  That would have a hugely detrimental effect on our rural towns and villages because in the vast majority of cases where they are fortunate enough to have a dairy processor near them it is probably the best employer they can have and it is the heartbeat of that rural area.  If the heart is turned off there is little life left.</p> <p>  The availability of land is a huge issue and there is the potential for farmers to go down that avenue but the opportunities are very slim.  If it was to happen there would be a significant impact for other farmers.  The Senator mentioned forestry and there is huge ambition among this Government for afforestation but with nitrates and the single farm payment, as it was in olden times, it is very hard to see those targets being met with this level of regulation.  The Senator mentioned cross-Border issues and he said that water knows no bounds.  Hopefully there will be no bounds because that would create other issues for our industry as an island nation that is exporting.  Mr. Enright might come in on the regulations in the North.</p></speech>

There is a lot of discussion on what a family farm is etc. but if we undermine that and co-operatives cannot get milk supply from the existing stock of dairy farmers then the only alternative they have is to go far large-scale new entrants that would not be family farms.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

They are talking about a very different animal and not near as dependent on the pasture base as we are.</p></speech>

I will follow on from Deputy Fitzmaurice and Senator Daly and try to get a picture of the full impact of this.  The speakers have given a worrying indication of the impact of cow banding and the reduction to 220 kg.  In the tables they have given, have they expanded that to include the full herd?  Do they have a final picture based on the analysis they have given or is that just an indicative picture?  Can they give an industrywide figure for the total reduction in cow numbers?</p></speech>

Going from 250 kg to 220 kg, there will have to be further analysis done on that in terms of cow banding and the number of farmers above the 220 kg level.  That calculation is not available at the moment.</p></speech>

The farmer is looking at his options.  He has commitments to financial institutions that have to be paid.  He needs the number of cows he has to make those returns.  What are his options?  If he destocks, he is out of business and cannot make those returns.  His only options are to destock or to get more land, and it is putting pressure on the forestry sector.  We have huge aspirations for that sector but there will be, in certain parts of the country, dairy farmers who will look at leasing land that should be entering the forestry sector but will be held back because of the need for extra land in dairying.</p></speech>

Originally, that body said there was 5 kg of nitrogen in each cubic metre of slurry; then it re-evaluated it and brought it down to 2.4 kg.  We would probably dispute that figure with regard to farmers who are using low emissions slurry spreading, which all derogated farmers are.</p> <p>  I will make a point that is not related to the Chairman's question.  Derogation farmers have much higher standards of farming than all other farmers.  They are inspected at a much higher level and have to have proper storage and facilities in place.  Nutrient management plans, soil testing and all those things are carried out on derogation farms but not on non-derogation farms.  </p></speech>

It refers to average values of nitrate concentrate above 50 mg per litre, which is drinking water quality, or increasing trends of nitrates concentration compared to 2021.  They are comparing this year to last year.  We have not got the results for last year yet.  We have asked how much of a difference would have to be there and they will not give us an accurate figure.  They are saying it is generally the trend.</p> <p>  Part B of that is eutrophic.  That is a huge issue.  We could be cut from 250 kg to 220 kg because a water body or estuary becomes eutrophic or risks becoming eutrophic.  Eutrophication refers to algae growth, and that is more linked to phosphorus production.  Humans creates as much phosphorus that ends up in wastewater treatment plants as animals do.  Our president gave the example in his opening address of Waterford harbour.  If the wastewater treatment plant in Waterford city was spewing, if there is no nitrogen or phosphorus recovery in that plant, as it releases the water into Waterford harbour, the phosphorus coming from humans in the city is released into the estuary.  That could cause the estuary to become eutrophic, or risk becoming eutrophic, and would have a huge impact on the farmers, as our president has said, in Tipperary, Laois, Carlow, Kilkenny, Kildare and Waterford.  It might have no link to agriculture but because it becomes eutrophic-----</p></speech>

There is unanimity in the room on this.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will come before the committee shortly.  A week ago we had torrential rain.  The waste treatment plant in my home town cannot handle the rain water.  The sluice gates are opened and it ends up in the River Suir.  This happens on a regular basis.  How can we know there is an improvement in water quality?  How can we attribute it?  Perhaps the scientists can do so.  There is reference to urban waste and agricultural disimprovement.  We all want water quality to improve.</p> <p>  I will speak about the county I know best, which is Tipperary.  In that county there are 68 settlements with no waste treatment plant of any description.  Some of these are on the banks of the River Suir.  The capacity is insufficient for the population in some of the larger towns.  We will make major economic decisions that will have a serious impact on economic viability.  This is also with regard to our climate change targets.  The point has been made that land availability for forestry will disappear.  Forestry will not be able to compete for land and this will have significant economic consequences.  I will not speak about the impact at individual farm level as it has been well emphasised at the meeting.  Important decisions will be made.  When officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications comes before the committee, I will ask how water quality issues are determined between municipal and agricultural causes.  Major decisions are being made but our water quality infrastructure is not at the level it should be.</p></speech>

This is the problem.  I do not know why eutrophication is mentioned in the derogation because it is more a phosphorus problem.  According to EPA figures, humans in Ireland create almost as much phosphorus as animals but we have no phosphorus or nitrogen recovery in any municipal waste water plant.  When the plant in Dublin is fully upgraded it will have nitrogen and phosphorus recovery but it will not be anywhere else in Ireland.  Phosphorus is so water soluble that what we think is clean water being discharged from municipal wastewater treatment plants is heavily laced with phosphorus.  This is causing the eutrophic status of many of the rivers in the country, particularly the estuaries.  The national settlements are in Dublin, Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford are all on the coast.  The waste ends up in the estuaries.</p></speech>

We produce our milk from grass.  Grass takes nitrogen to grow.  Most of the other countries have indoor systems that have their own problems with water quality.  We have a completely different farming system.  We have carbon sequestration in our system.  I hope that the next water report we get will show that water quality has improved and it will solve the issue for everyone.  As has been mentioned by others, an economic assessment needs to be done of the damage this will do to the rural economy.  It is not 100 years ago that we had the troika in 2008 and 2009.  If we had not had our dairy industry in rural Ireland it would have been very easy to talk to it.</p></speech>

We see in Europe a move to emulate this structure.  It is the structure we have and we need to retain and cherish it.  We need to use it to promote what we do and its uniqueness.

The two most significant and advantageous measures found were a cut in chemical nitrogen and increased enforcement.  Both of these measures have been introduced this year.  There has been a 10% cut in chemical nitrogen this year.  We have an agricultural catchment programme that is better than anything in Europe, which looks at the effects of a reduction of chemical nitrogen.  Eddie Burgess runs it on behalf of Teagasc.  He and Teagasc say the rules and regulations introduced this year on increased enforcement and a reduction in chemical nitrogen will take 18 to 24 months to show results.  We are being judged on them now.  New measures have been introduced that will take 18 to 24 months to work but we are not being given this time.  This is what we are pleading for.  The rules and regulations that have been introduced because they were deemed by Teagasc as being the most effective are not being given the opportunity to work.  We are being prejudged on them.</p></speech>

I am not saying one farmer is better than another but could we have a situation where one farmer, who is highly efficient in climate and carbon reduction, may be alongside another who may not be and because they are in the same zone they will both be hit with the same penalty?  Mr. Drennan made reference to a Teagasc report.  What does he propose instead as a lead-in period?  What is he proposing in substance that should happen now?  As a layman looking on, I want consistency and fairness.  Everyone accepts we have to move on climate action.  It is just the way it is.  We must move in a sustainable way.  Dairying is very important.  I represent Limerick city but the constituency also includes a rural area with a lot of dairy farming.  The ICMSA is based in Limerick and I am very familiar with the work it does.  Is everyone treated the same in the way the zones are laid out?  What timeline does Mr. McCormack propose for the introduction of what is proposed in the nitrates directive?</p></speech>

Not alone do we want fairness among farmers but we want fairness among all the stakeholders involved who contribute to water quality.  This is critical.  I mentioned the embrace of low-emission slurry spreading and investment in slurry storage.  I also mentioned the fact that protected urea is becoming the norm.  To go back to Mr. Drennan's point, we need 18 to 24 months for results to materialise and be seen by the public.  Unfortunately, we are not getting this opportunity.  I can guarantee that cow banding introduced on 1 January 2023 will have a huge impact on the Deputy's constituency.</p> <p>  We mentioned the agri-environmental scheme, which is very important.  It is a missed opportunity to get the pH of the soil right and the incorporation of clover for farmers.  All of these measures can create efficiency in the fertiliser used.  Efficiency is critical in any industry given where costs are.</p></speech>

We used Waterford Harbour as an example.  That is a huge catchment area because the Barrow, Nore and Suir rivers all flow into Waterford Harbour.  We cannot get a straight answer regarding all the farmers in those three catchment areas.  We cannot get an answer on how big the catchment is.  They are looking at coastal waters.  The risky bit here is eutrophication, which is down to phosphorous and, as I said, can mainly come from wastewater treatment plants.  That is the danger.  That part needs to be sorted, as does our end.</p> <p>  The regulation for nitrates is coming this year.  There is a possibility that could be increased from a 10% reduction this year to a 15% reduction next year.  Even at farm level, however, if we look at the difference for farmers and how they farm, there is monumental change this year.  No slurry was spread in the closed period last year.  No fertiliser was spread in January and February this year.  Nobody went out.  The advice and science is coming through the agricultural catchments programme.  The advice is coming out and farmers are really embracing it.  If farmers wanted to get protected urea this year, it was unavailable at certain times.  If they want to buy a low-emissions slurry spreader at present, there is a waiting list of about a year for it.  If they want to get a builder to do building, it is impossible at present.</p> <p>  On incorporation of clover into grassland, I looked for clover this year.  I could not get it locally and ended up having to get it through a man in Offaly who got it from the North.  It could not be got because farmers were embracing the advice and clover seed just was not available.</p></speech>

Has any empirical work been done on that?  If someone is contaminating groundwater, whoever it is should be held accountable for it.  I have no issue with that.  The question is if wastewater treatment plants are bringing up the contamination levels, has any empirical work been done on that, to Mr. Drennan's knowledge?  He is saying that if we deal with all these issues over the next year or two, and we come to the directive being implemented, he believes it would then be implemented in a much fairer way.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

I sit on the water forum on behalf of the ICMSA.  That forum has requested information on wastewater treatment plants throughout Ireland from Irish Water.  We have asked it for that for the past three years.  There are approximately 54 areas where raw sewage is going straight into wastewater treatment plants but the bigger question related to the level of treatment.  Is it primary, secondary, tertiary or total treatment?  Is there nutrient recovery from any of the wastewater treatment plants?  Irish Water will not provide us with that information.</p> <p>  If we look at what happened earlier this summer, there was a huge celebration because a sod was turned for Arklow wastewater treatment plant 20 years after the problem developed there.  As Deputy Cahill said, how many areas are there in his constituency where sewage is being released into water?  Under the old system, when floodwaters come, the gates are opened and off it goes.  Everybody has to work together.  We accept farmers are part of the problem.  We want to be part of the solution.  We are embracing any advice we get on any technology.  Our general secretary, Mr. Enright, has told the committee about the ASSAP programme.  I sit on the consultative group for that programme.  There is some 94% engagement by farmers with ASSAP, even though it is a voluntary programme, and 91% of the measures asked of farmers are being implemented.</p></speech>

I was attending other meetings so I have not heard everything and I do not want to repeat questions.  I thank the ICMSA representatives for being here.  I will ask a broad question and they can answer it in the context of what has already been dealt with.  We have had many debates and a lot of public discourse on climate action obligations.  For the most part, it has been shown that the broad public recognise that we need to produce good quality food, that Ireland is good at doing that, and that any climate action measures need to be taken in the context of the global situations we will face.  There is a lot of empathy and support for the farming community.</p> <p>  When it comes to water quality, things are a little different.  We cannot blame the Brazilians for poor water quality in Ireland.  If watercourses are polluted, then the source is here.  It is important to say that the source is not always farmers but in the context of the nitrates directive and our ambition, shared by almost everybody in the country, to have the most pristine watercourses possible, where do the representatives see actions being taken when it can be shown that individual farms are contributing to deterioration of those water sources?  What is the best approach to be taken to address those issues recognising, as I said, that it is not always farmers who are responsible?  There is no doubt, however, that there are instances where individual farms are contributing to that deterioration.  In those instances, what measures are required to address that on an on-farm basis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#J00700"><p>There is a major opportunity under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, to address that from the perspective of slurry storage.  Where farmers may have expanded, may not have the full required period of slurry storage and may have a significant level of debt on-farm, but find themselves virtually excluded from TAMS, that is a huge issue.  The availability of 40% support under that scheme, or 60% support for the young farmer, can make a difference for young farmers in particular and for any farmer.  That is a major issue.  I am glad that the Deputy acknowledged in his remarks that there are other sources of contamination.  We just had that discussion.  We need to play our part and we are certainly prepared to be part of the solution.  The move to low-emissions slurry spreading and protected urea, in particular the way it was embraced in 2022 was, as I said, something nobody really understood in 2018.  By the time 2022 is over, the vast majority of farms will have seen it rolled out at farm level.  There is opportunity to build on that.</p> <p>  Mr. Drennan mentioned clover.  The incorporation of clover was huge.  The rejuvenation of pastures has been critical, as has getting the pH of our soils right for chemical fertiliser utilisation, which is critical.  I mentioned efficiency earlier.  It is all about efficiency, which particularly comes into play when the economics and the costs associated with the raw materials are where they are in 2022.  That has very much focused minds.  As we alluded to earlier, the difficulty is that it takes 18 to 24 months for changes in practice to deliver results.  That is the critical issue.  We find ourselves two months away from cow banding and potentially moving to 220 kg, when the practice changes have not been afforded the time and opportunity to deliver from a scientific perspective.</p></speech>

If a farm has not employed the type of practices Mr. McCormack talked about to a sufficient level, and it is shown that an individual farm is contributing pollution to a watercourse, is it better that that individual farm be mandated to reduce production until the stage where it has resolved those issues, as opposed to a blanket ban where all farmers, including those who have employed all of the measures Mr. McCormack talked about, are equally penalised?</p></speech>

That was a huge success.  People known to individual farmers in those catchment areas came to them, whether they were co-op or local farm advisory personnel, and helped them in a proactive way.  Very often, a very small thing, such as replacement of gutters and downpipes, can have a critical impact on a farm's ability to store slurry, for example.  Those farms that could be causing issues may potentially be due to a very small thing.  A similar programme to ASSAP, if not ASSAP itself, rolled out nationally, may significantly deliver for farmers in a proactive and gentle manner.</p></speech>

I always have a vision of a suckler herd where we should produce a cow that would rear two calves.  One on its own is not able to do that.  Is there any work being done by Teagasc and organisations such as the ICMSA that would help with the stocking rates, and all that involves, where a good quality dairy calf could be brought over?  I know that there is the ordinary dairy beef side, which I understand.  I would always take the view that it is tough going to make money out of one calf, one cow.  I have talked to some people who have an interest in the likes of that idea.  Is any research being done, or anything being done by Teagasc, to see how workable that is and if it would help both sectors?  There is pressure that everybody needs to know will be coming on.  I have seen full U-turns being done on such matters as exports out in Europe and there are many headwinds.  Is there any sort of think tank, solution or work being done to promote certain things like that, which may help both sides?</p></speech>

It is a huge task.  Teagasc has done work in conjunction with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, on the dairy beef index, DBI, and it is critical that the offspring of the dairy herd that will be sold is fit for purpose in the beef industry, whether that is to double suckle, to go from calf to weanling or to go from calf to finish.  It is critical and we all need, particularly given recent events, to recognise that the offspring of the dairy herd has to be fit for purpose and have a value within the beef industry.</p> <p>  Equally, its contribution to the beef industry needs to be acknowledged where up to 56% and 57% of the kill comes from the dairy herd.  That is why, perhaps, it is very important that there is a co-operation and unity rather than the divide that has crept in to the industry in that regard in the last decade from a beef perspective.  We would be very open to encouraging Teagasc, ICBF, or indeed anybody else, in such co-operation.</p></speech>

There is a duty on the EPA to give the report to the ICMSA and to publish it for the betterment of all, in the first instance.  When the Department appears before the committee to discuss the phosphorus issue, which Mr. Drennan also outlined, he is 100% correct that most of the sewage in the country is released when there is a big flood in most places.  Let no one try to say that it is a foolproof system.  We have to find out, as I  am not aware scientifically if there is somebody else who can say that it is different, or whatever.  We need to find that out when the Department appears before us later on and we will do that.</p></speech>

Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.</p> <p>  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Marie Archbold, who is a water policy adviser with the Department and co-chair of the nitrates expert group.  The Department has policy responsibility for the implementation of the nitrates directive and the water framework directive and associated water directives.  We work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on these nitrates issues and all water quality issues.  Both Departments benefit from expert support provided by Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency through the nitrates expert group.</p> <p>  On water quality, simply put, nutrient levels are too high in many of our water bodies.  The draft river basin management plan, based on data from the EPA, links agricultural pressures to 1,000 water bodies out of a total of 4,842 water bodies.  That is an increase of 223 over the previous period.  In contrast, the number of water bodies impacted by urban wastewater is 208, which has decreased by 83 since the previous cycle.  This excess of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds accelerates the growth of algae, causing an undesirable change in the natural ecology and lowering oxygen levels in waterways.  This reduces biodiversity as fewer species can tolerate this change.  Algal blooms impact on wildlife, drinking water and swimming areas.  Excess nitrogen can cause health issues in drinking water supplies.</p> <p>  As a result of these trends in water quality as shown in the water quality monitoring programme, Ireland is required to take additional measures and reinforce existing measures sufficient to reduce water pollution and to prevent further such pollution.  Part of this response is the fifth nitrates action programme.  The programme includes several strengthened and new requirements.  These requirements have been developed following stakeholder dialogue and three separate periods of public consultation.  The key measures include changes to chemical fertiliser allowances, livestock excretion rate bands and expanded closed periods.  My colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will provide further details on those individual measures.  In addition, there will be an interim review of the entire programme after two years and a review of local authorities&rsquo; agricultural inspection programmes.</p> <p>  On the derogations, the directive sets a universal limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per annum.  Where a member state can demonstrate that a higher limit will not lead to higher pollution, the Commission may adopt an implementing decision, a derogation, that allows higher maximum limits of nitrogen subject to adherence to additional conditions.  A derogation does not exempt Ireland from any of the directive&rsquo;s water quality objectives.  Ireland recently successfully secured a derogation for the period from March 2022 until December 2025.  The only three other areas in Europe that currently benefit from a derogation are Denmark, until the middle of 2024; Northern Ireland, until the end of 2022; and the Flanders region of Belgium, until December 2022.  The Netherlands is currently in the process of renewing its derogation and, going by recent media reports, this will be a three-year phase-out of its derogation, although that has yet to be decided.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s current derogation comes with conditions that include an interim review that must include a water quality assessment that compares 2021 and 2022 data.  This is to be conducted by June 2023.  If the assessment shows that we have eutrophic water bodies, risk of eutrophic water bodies or water bodies with increasing trends or exceeding an average of 50 mg of nitrate per litre over three years, then farms in the catchment areas feeding these monitoring points will face a cut in the derogation limit from the current 250 kg to 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare.</p> <p>  In conclusion, to protect water there needs to be a broad acceptance of and adherence to good agricultural practice requirements.  Ireland is simply not going to maintain the current derogation facility in its current format if recent water quality trends are not addressed and shown to have been addressed by a change in water quality data.</p></speech>

My colleague, Bernard Harris, joins me here for this discussion and we hope we can address any questions members may have.</p> <p>  As set out by our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine works closely with other Departments to ensure a coherent approach to meeting agriculture's commitments to the environmental challenges of climate, air, water and biodiversity.  Agriculture has a significant role to play in meeting environmental targets.  Existing water protection measures must continue to be implemented and accelerated but, nonetheless, new measures will also be necessary.  The strong support and work being delivered by farmers to address our environmental issues must also be acknowledged.</p> <p>  Ireland's nitrates action programme is the key regulatory framework by which farmers support the objectives of the water framework directive, WFD, but it is not the only mechanism to support farmers.  Support is available through our targeted agricultural mechanisation scheme, TAMS, and its support for infrastructure, actions to support water quality in our agri-environment schemes and investment in the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme, ASSAP, as well as research and monitoring, for example, through the agricultural catchments programme, ACP.</p> <p>  In supporting the work to improve water quality, both Departments have committed to renew the ASSAP, which works directly with farmers, industry and advisory services to protect and deliver improvements in water quality.  It must be noted that industry has provided additional resources to the programme, which sets a clear intention of the ambition to reduce the impact of agriculture on the environment.  From the Department&rsquo;s perspective, the agricultural sector is committed to stabilising and improving water quality.  The review of the nitrates action programme provided a timely opportunity to review the impact of agriculture on our water environment and support agricultural ambition to stabilise and improve water quality while seeking as many co-benefits for climate, air and biodiversity as possible.</p> <p>  Specifically on water quality, our waters are under increasing pressure.  The EPA has reported that almost half of our water bodies are not in satisfactory condition.  The most significant pressures on water are from excessive nutrients, namely, phosphorus and nitrogen, and agricultural activities contribute significantly to those losses.  From a policy perspective and by way of policy response, Ireland has been a leader in the EU in protecting the environment through strong regulation that includes both nitrogen and phosphorus, unlike most other EU member states.  As mentioned earlier, our Department is working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the delivery of a new nitrates action programme and related agri-environment policy measures.  This has built strong relationships to collectively develop a cohesive policy response in delivering and implementing policy on water to coincide with the delivery of Ireland's next river basin management plan.  Both Departments are also working closely with the Environmental Protection Agency on an ongoing basis in reviewing water quality, monitoring water quality trends and investigating and understanding the pressures from nutrients, pesticides and sediment loss from agriculture.</p> <p>  The fifth nitrates action programme process conducted a broad public consultation and held discussions with key stakeholders, including farm organisations and non-governmental organisations.  Ireland's fifth nitrates action programme contains a number of measures for the protection of the environment.</p><p>These include new requirements for slurry and soiled water storage and management, revised livestock excretion rates, new controls on chemical fertiliser, a chemical fertiliser database, green cover on tillage ground, new requirements on grazing land management, a commitment to review compliance and assurance activities by local authorities, and enforcement by local authorities.</p><p> The Department is also responsible for operating Ireland's derogation.  The Commission approved Ireland's derogation in early 2022 and the terms of the decision were presented at a meeting to the EU Nitrates Committee on 11 March 2022.  Member states voted to approve Ireland's nitrates derogation until 31 December 2025.  Ireland's nitrates derogation was transposed into Irish legislation through SI 393 of 2022 on 29 July 2022.</p><p> Additionally, in securing a nitrates derogation for Ireland, the commission introduced additional conditionality to its approval such that an interim review must be undertaken in mid-2023 to include an assessment of water quality results for a defined period to include 2021 and 2022.  This review will be considered and the terms of reference will be developed in due course.  It is important always to recognise that the derogation is provided on the basis that it is a derogation to the baseline commitment of 170 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare, not a derogation from the objectives of the water framework directive.  Key scientific criteria must be presented before a derogation can be sought, which, from an Irish perspective, includes a long growing season and crops with high nitrogen demand, among other criteria.  Ireland easily satisfies these conditions.  However, it should also be recognised that in the process of securing a derogation, it falls to the Commission to propose a vote of the committee of member states provided they are satisfied with our action programme.  As was said by my colleague, only four countries have sought to avail of this facility.</p><p> In implementing the derogation, farmers availing of the facility must carry out additional actions, including the likes of a farm nutrient plan, training and using low-emission technology.  It is important that the long term viability of the derogation be secured through the achievement of the requirements to secure good water-status outcomes.</p><p> If in developing the mid-term review next year, and when the assessment is complete, key criteria following the water quality assessment process are not met, there is a risk that the stocking rate equivalent of 250 kg of nitrogen per hectare, currently approved under our derogation, may be reduced to 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare from 2024 onwards in some areas.</p><p> In order to guide this assessment, and following on from the initial assessment completed as part of the fifth nitrates action programme review, Teagasc has again been asked to review and model the impact of potential measures and the impact of reducing the stocking rate limit to 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare.  This work is to conclude shortly.  </p><p> Ireland's grass-based model provides many environmental benefits, and our farmers and industry have structured its development around this.  While it is acknowledged that more needs to be done to reduce the agricultural impact on the environment, a strong regulation provides the bedrock to achieving this.  We are on the right path to achieving environmental sustainability while balancing the economic and social aspects.  I thank the members for their attention and time this evening.  We will be happy to take any questions from them.</p></speech>

We were listening to the previous discussions with the ICMSA.  To clarify, the monitoring data used for the nitrates directive are slightly different from those used for the water framework directive in that monitoring points have been specifically picked under the nitrates directive to reflect agricultural land use.  Essentially, they have been designed to try to rule out what the Deputy is talking about, namely all the other land-use impacts, including from sewage, hydromorphology and sediment.  That removes the question being asked.  One will find that the issue of the estuaries is not really considered in the nitrates directive monitoring dataset; it is focused primarily on river water bodies.  Again, that removes the issue that was spoken about, namely that of the Waterford estuary.  That is more related to what we have to report on under the water framework directive, not the reporting we are here to talk about today.  The set of data is a separate one designed specifically to monitor the impact from agriculture under the nitrates directive.</p></speech>

In looking for a contributing factor, the finger is always pointed at the farmer.  The book would be out even with a treatment facility.  It would be fine if we had the finest of treatment plants.</p> <p>  I have another question for the delegates from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  In all the major cities, there are big sewage-treatment plants.  In these, there is sludge that has to be removed.  With all that is going on in agriculture, farmers will be tightening down.  Where is all the sludge going to go?</p></speech>

There is a demand for it at the moment.</p> <p>  Let me finish my earlier point.  I do not believe there has ever been a suggestion by the Department or anyone that farmers are solely to blame.  River basin management plans show there is a range of issues, including wastewater.  I said in my opening statement that agriculture is tied to a thousand water bodies but that there are 208 with issues tied to wastewater treatment.</p><p>We have been fair.

My understanding is that if a farmer does not have enough capacity and is over the stocking limit, he or she will not get a grant.  Is that not counterproductive?  Should we not try to bring farmers within the requirements?</p><p>I have seen Mr. Callanan in Leinster House many a time.  What is his vision for what will happen?  Does he agree that we cannot just bring it down to 170 kg, 220 kg or 230 kg tomorrow, next week or next month?  What is the Department's opinion on derogations?  Are they becoming harder to get?  Will they be gone further down the line?  A farmer cannot just get rid of ten or 20 cows when different rules come in just because he or she does not have the extra land that is required.  There is not much extra land being made around the country at the moment.  We cannot just drop a bomb on top of someone.  We would nearly need a just transition.  Unfortunately, the first just transition did not work too well.  If we are going down this road, will the Department be straight with farmers about what is coming over the next two or five years?  Farmers deserve that.  Many of them have invested in making their farms better with better machinery and gear for milking or whatever they are doing.</p><p>A great deal of information is being thrown about.  Is there truth in the story about the discussions on nitrates or that a body is meeting?  According to the headlines in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, X amount will be given to people to reduce.  What is the story?</p></speech>

Regarding TAMS, the simple reality is that under the regulations on the availability of support under CAP someone has to be at the regulatory standard as set.  Therefore, we are precluded from bringing him or her up to that standard.  That has been the case for some time and it is something that I have raised with Commission officials.  The Deputy is right about the opportunity to bring someone up to standard.  Looking at it from the point of view of fairness, though, those who are compliant should not have their eligibility for TAMS diminished by others who are not compliant accessing it.  The Deputy's understanding of the situation is the case, and it is based on clear guidance regarding the implementation of CAP.  There is a requirement.  Take trailing shoe technology as an example.  We were aware of the absence of a grant for one year after that technology's introduction as a minimum requirement for derogation farmers.  In terms of the use of derogations, there are additional requirements placed on farmers.  When that is done through legislation, it precludes them after a period of grant aid.  This is a matter that we consider in terms of proportionality and speed.</p> <p>  I have worked in this area for some time and my vision is that the derogation has to be on a sustainable footing.  People are criticising the actions that we are introducing in respect of the derogation, but they are being introduced to avoid the reality or suggestion that the derogation is associated with poor water quality or negative trends.  This is about taking the right steps to secure the derogation over the long term.  The question of whether to apply is a political issue and I cannot answer for future Governments, given that it is a decision for the Government, but it is important that we have in place the bedrock of guidance to farmers about what actions need to be taken to ensure that water quality is on the right trend and the derogation is not negatively impacting water quality.  This means asking farmers to do more.</p> <p>  I have been in this area since 2010 and we have undertaken four reviews, including an interim review.  We are asking more of derogation farmers now.  I accept that some of our requests are challenging, but experience has taught me that most farmers will ask us what they need to do to get this right, given how important the derogation is to them.</p> <p>  Regarding the derogation on nitrates, I will point to a couple of matters.  The directive identifies a limit of manure applied, not present, on a farm.  As such, the derogation is available to a farmer who has a higher stocking rate in terms of moving manures or who has additional land.  Under the directive, a derogation is available based on four specific criteria.  I will not cite them, but they are based on a long growing season &ndash; in other words, whether a farm needs that nitrogen in the system in light of its capacity &ndash; the nitrification of soils, rainfall, etc.  There are specific conditions that make one eligible to apply.  From an Irish perspective and having presented on the tables, we have a growing season of 270 or 280 days, which is different than continental Europe's.  Our availing of the derogation is happening in a different circumstance than that of many European countries where animals are permanently housed, there is cropping, which dilutes stocking rates, and so on.  We must recognise these differences.</p> <p>  It is important that there be leadership in ensuring that the actions we are asking of farmers are proportionate and appropriate and contribute to the longevity of the derogation as opposed to just saying that we need more time or whatever.</p></speech>

With the excess increasing from 85 kg in dairy cows &ndash; some are increasing to 106 kg, depending on milk yield &ndash; will safeguards be put in place for the family farm, be it beef, dairy or whatever?  We talked about a smaller dairy family farm as being 100 or 120 cows.  Will safeguards be put in place to ensure that, unlike farms with 700, 800 or 1,000 cows, family farms are the last to be affected and some proportionality is brought so that the ordinary family farm, which has always been the model, is protected?</p></speech>

A small minority are larger farms.</p> <p>  I will address the issue of banding, which is what the Deputy is getting at.  From our perspective, we were operating a single band across all cows.  Administratively, that was easy for us.  People might not realise it, but the Department performs an administrative check on every single farm for nitrates compliance.  The checks are not universal, but we perform checks comparing single farm payments versus farms' animal identification and movement, AIM, data, that is, their livestock, in respect of every farm in the country.  It is a large check and quite a number of farmers are non-compliant and suffer a penalty as a consequence.</p> <p>  Moving from a single band will be a challenge, but we are putting our hand up to do that.  At European level, most countries were working a banding system and the Commission was adamant that it was a minimum requirement in terms of discussions-----</p></speech>

The Commission was clear on that.  The bands, as constructed, are scientifically determined by the nitrates emissions associated with relative categories.  I am aware that presentations have been made to the committee.  We examined having six bands.  There were complications around that.  There are pluses and minuses.  The structure that is being put in place maximises those in the low and middle bands.  Approximately 15% of farms are in the top-----</p></speech>

Certain breeds might have higher butter fat or higher protein.  There is a fear among some in the agricultural community that certain breeds might not be as heavy milkers as some of the more Holstein-like cows.  Some farmers may revert to those cows to keep under the litreage on the banding, and that could end in worse quality offspring going into the beef sector.  Has the Department looked at that side of this?</p></speech>

From the point of view of breeding, we had to find creative bands that would not encourage such a practice.  Farmers are at 6,500 kg before they go into the upper band.  That is the major change.  In the two lower bands, there is not a major change from the existing 89 kg per hectare, so for those categories there is not as big a change compared with the top-end band.  Certainly, if farmers are thinking of trying to manage their herd profile out of that band, I do not believe there is a need in respect of certain breeds to which people might allude and which are required to generate that.  We have plenty of capacity within our own breeding programmes to pick animals that ensure fertility, longevity and a focus on milk solids, which is available under the structure that has been put in place.  Farmers are paid on milk solids to increase the solids as a percentage of the volume of milk produced.  All those things were factored into our consideration as to how to structure this while minimising the negative aspects and recognising where the majority are at.  I accept that it is hard in respect of the 15% in the high category.  The science justifies the numbers associated with that, but the structure we have put in place has minimised the number in that category and created an opportunity to focus on improving solids, etc., within farmers' profiles, which is what they get paid for, over litres.  That is all I will say about it.</p></speech>

The majority of us would run on the basis of the life cycle of a cow being eight to ten years and, therefore, the breeding programme will have to change.  That stock will have to be born.  If I am stuck with a high-yielding cow, it will probably take me the bones of five, six or seven years for my herd profile to change dramatically such that I could drop the band and, therefore, in that five or six years the only way I could meet the criteria under the directive would be to have a cull.  Have the witnesses any idea as to what that potential is out there at the moment?</p></speech>

I would not expect culling as part of this process.  What I mean by that is that we have 6,500 farmers in derogation and 7,000 farmers who exceed 170 kg per hectare, but through exporting slurry, temporary grazing-----</p></speech>

Therefore, managing compliance is the best way I would describe it.  If you look at those who are in that situation of asking themselves whether they manage their milk production, for those who are close they will try to ensure they are in the lower band.  That is just normal.  I would question, though, because of the availability of the option of exporting slurry or taking additional land or temporary grazing, opportunities that are there in respect of which I would not anticipate that the immediate reaction would be to cull.  Having said that, unproductive cows etc. on the farm are maybe a different issue.  It is not my figure, but I know, for example, that one of the artificial insemination, AI, companies, which is an expert in that field, has said that 10% to 15% of dairy cows were not covering their cost of production.  From that perspective, I presume that somebody who is tight on their nitrates, for example, will maximise their efficiency in terms of milk produced off the farm while managing it overall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#O00700"><p>The Department would take it, however, that this cohort of more than 15% are probably the most efficient operators in the field.  They have probably spent a generation, if not three, building up their herd profile in a certain way, usually with high-yielding cows.  Some of them could be winter milk cows.  With the majority of these animals that hit the 15%, it will take, if not one, two breeding seasons to bring them back down into band two.  That is a significant change.  Does Mr. Callanan think they would need time to change their farming practices or their breeding profile?  The witnesses know themselves.  The animals that are in calf at the moment are probably not in line with the nitrates directive.  Next spring they definitely will be, but at the moment that work has not begun.  I just question the idea that there will not be a cull.  In places such as Barryroe, in west Cork, they are maximised out.  The majority of the herds are only 80 cows each.  The majority of farmers there are all dairy farmers.  There is no room to expand in respect of any other land becoming available.  The majority of them would be in that category.  I, therefore, question the timelines by which they would need to change their herd profiles.  Does the Department think they would need more time than 18 months?</p></speech>

We can look to the number of public consultations, as the Senator will be aware, around the nitrates action programme, and this action has been there nearly two years now in terms of putting it out there to farmers and saying this is the direction we are asked to go.  From the person who met the Commission, where the request came around banding, it was a simple ask: have you no big or small cows in Ireland?  Why are they all the same?  The approach, therefore, was to evaluate the impact scientifically.  Essentially, banding equalises scientifically the impact of those cows based on 170 kg or 250 kg.  There is no doubt that implementation is a challenge.  It has been signalled for a good number of years that implementation will be from next year.  There is more work to be done in developing the system to implement it, but that is certainly work we are doing at present.</p></speech>

The witnesses may correct me if I am wrong.  What programme of information does the Department have to roll out over the next six months to inform advisers and farmers what is required with this new derogation?  Is it proposing a roadshow of some nature?  I do not mean a roadshow as part of the CAP reform, but a roadshow to inform the farming community and the advisers of issues such as this?  The gentlemen should not get me wrong; they will be rough meetings.  However, has the Department proposals to do something?</p></speech>

We continued that over the summer, especially talking to farm organisations.  We also  contacted FAS advisors providing them with updates on any additional amendments or clarifications that are required.  We plan on holding roadshows from September onwards to meet farm organisations.  We are currently provisionally scheduled to meet the ICMSA across three meetings in late September.</p> <p>  As for other actions and banding, we developed a calculator, which is on the Department's website, into which farmers can voluntarily input their information for 2020 and 2021: milk delivered divided by the average number of cows they have.  It will provisionally calculate what they anticipate their banding figure is, so it will give them an indication and the direction in which they are going as to where they sit within the three bands.  We plan on having another session with advisers before the end of the year on the update.  We had an amendment recently on 29 July to SI 393.  It is ongoing.  There is no doubt but that there is more to be done, but we will introduce a further programme before the end of the year to make more progress on this.</p></speech>

We have been very upfront on this.  The organisation that appeared before the committee earlier is an illustration of the focus.  There has been relentless focus on the impact of banding.  I think there is a good awareness there.  As Mr. Harris has said, the calculators are there.  As we get greater knowledge of this cohort, we can write to them and be very clear with them.  Something like that would be very effective.  We are talking about how to get to that 15%.  We have been using 89 kg on those cows.  We do not know the individual herdowners.  I would have no reluctance in trying to segregate them out and try to get a feel for who they are and writing to them.  That might be more effective than a generalised discussion when people who might not be affected by this misunderstand its impact at farm level.</p> <p>  Many of the co-ops will be engaging with their own farmers.  We are talking about 15% of the 16,500 dairy farmers.  I would certainly recommend a targeted approach.</p></speech>

However, the entire nitrates directive involves many farmers, including the changes to what is allowed with the exportation in slurry.  There is potential for the Department to hit the road, go to the communities and talk about the entire entity that will affect more than 16,500 farmers.  We will park it today, but the Department might consider opening the door and having this conversation if possible.</p></speech>

The first port of call in many of those will be specific to the individual farm.  I chaired a session with the advisers in terms of identifying.

In the Irish context that is very high and there would not be very many.  The areas impacted by that would be very limited.  It then looks at average trends.

They told me what they are coming back with is beyond belief.  Yesterday's reading was 3.5 and it was below 2.6 all the way through.  For part of the year the reading was 1.  It gave me great hope with a catchment area that is so intensively farmed - they will definitely change farming practices - we could have a very good report coming given what is happening this year.</p> <p>  The EPA measurements are done monthly whereas this is done every ten minutes.  We have powerful academically based information coming with a test every ten minutes which is fantastic.  Are we making the most of that information when we inform the European Union what we are doing here?  Is it coming across that we have a really important data centre with such powerful information?

We pay for Teagasc to do the ACP and it is a tremendous facility.  We paid for it on time.  I worked in Clonakilty years ago and I know Timoleague very well.  Part of our commitment under the derogation is that we must have a monitoring programme.  At the outset we chose six different soil types and farm types to be representative.  That material contributes to our reporting under the derogation.  I wish to allay the Senator's concerns on that.  Whether it feeds into the water framework is a different question.  Mr. Harris may wish to comment on that.  We are required to have a monitoring system and programme as part of our implementation of that derogation and ACP delivers that for us.</p></speech>

It is a requirement under one of the articles of the regulation.  The scientific basis of that is the work conducted by the agricultural catchments programme and the scientific monitoring and water-quality monitoring coming from that is very powerful in assessing the measures in the current regulation on farm and at a catchment scale.  That programme has been in place for many years.  We work collectively to demonstrate that.  We also work in collaboration with the EPA to ensure we can scale up the potential impact of agricultural activity at a national level.  There is collaboration in developing and finalising that report.</p></speech>

Will that be part of the solution?  I know it is an expensive programme; I do not know how much it costs.  The results seem to be very positive and they are not just agricultural; they catch many issues regarding the farming catchment area itself.  This may be a debate for another day.  We have five or six of these locations with different soil types and different farming activity - dairy, grain beef etc.  Does that give us a different way of going forward rather than having a monthly test?</p><p>What I am trying to say is instead of having the monthly test by the EPA, which is obviously very helpful, should we not extend this programme to make it more efficient as regards the information.  As far as I have been informed, water was tested every ten minutes.</p></speech>

Much is learned from that and it also a focus point for discussion groups and awareness-building for farmers.  It is a huge resource in that respect.  I am not sure what would be the merit is of having one for every catchment.  What we learned from that was that because it was structured in such a way that there was variety of farming and soil types, it can give good indications.  The translation of that into practical support for farmers is through the ASSAP.  Effectively this is using and building awareness among individual farmers by having identified, using EPA data, where this programme should be rolled out first.  There are about 120 areas.  It uses those learnings and brings farmers to programmes such as the ASSAP.  I am not sure of the particular value.  It is expensive, costing more than &euro;2 million a year to run it.  We do it at a far higher standard than is required just for the reporting under the nitrates directive.  We have much more data from it so it is a tremendous source.  However in terms of practical assistance for farmers, that is delivered through programmes such as ASSAP.  Building on the knowledge gleaned from the ASSAP, people know what is happening in Timoleague and what similar farming styles can do.</p></speech>

Because we have such high resolution monitoring, we can see almost in real time what is and is not working.  It is about translating that to other catchments through the ASSAP by providing that free advice at farm level.  There is a balance between cost and resolution when looking at monitoring.  Obviously testing every few minutes is very expensive.  That must be balanced with the resources required.  The value is in what is learned from those really intensively monitored catchments.</p></speech>

It is better for Teagasc to answer this rather than me because I know there are sensitivities around the use of data, which is voluntarily supported by the farmers in an area, for a compliance process that is run by the EPA.  From history and my engagement, I know about such sensitivities.  For example, with the national farm survey Teagasc has always been very sensitive and careful about its use because that is dependent on full engagement based on anonymity for farmers.  In setting up the ASSAP, in my experience of this, there was considerable discussion at the time about the data, their use and what farmers were willing to support through an ASSAP on their land area.  Concerns were assuaged by the reality that these data were not used from a compliance point of view by bodies such as the EPA.  We got buy-in from local farmers on this basis.</p></speech>

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage wants to see clean water and a return to pristine conditions.  That is not easy.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is tasked with bringing the agriculture sector with it, which is not an easy task.  As we heard from our previous guests, they are very resistant to the nitrates action programme.</p> <p>  I am heartened to hear there is an alignment between both Departments.  If there is not an alignment, I would like to hear it.  The statements chimed, as I heard them.  The chair may wish to check but I think there was a divergence between what the officials said and the statements submitted.  We might just check that because it would be good to capture everything that was said.</p></speech>

At the previous session, a very strong claim was made about wastewater.  It has been addressed already but I will give the officials an opportunity to address it again.  It was claimed that urban wastewater might be significantly contributing to the water quality issues we have.  I am hearing that is the case to a certain extent but agricultural practices are responsible to a greater extent and, therefore, the fifth nitrates action programme is necessary.  The programme is necessary because the deterioration in water quality obviously presents a risk to the environment and water courses, but also a risk to agriculture.  It is certainly not good for the Irish agriculture sector if the country gets a label as having polluted water.  Our guests will probably agree with that.  I commend the efforts of everybody to try to turn this around.</p> <p>  We should be alarmed because we are hearing today from officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as we have heard previously, that we are probably way off course as regards our commitments under the EU water framework directive to restore our water quality to satisfactory conditions by 2027.  That is only five years away.  The industry lobby does not have much of a mind to that.  It would say we should go there gently and slowly.  If we adopt that approach, it will certainly not take us there by 2027.  We simply have to find a way of restoring our water quality to meet our EU obligations, notwithstanding that we also want better water quality for many good reasons.  </p> <p>  My principal question is, given the likelihood that we will not achieve the obligations set out in the water framework directive and given that all the nitrates action programmes to date have not been effective, where do we go from here?  The fifth nitrates programme is even more demanding for farmers because previous programmes have not been effective and because it is more demanding, we probably have less confidence that this programme will be effective.  We all need to be reassured that we really are turning the tanker around.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on the role of enforcement.  It was planned that 5% of farms would be inspected and I understand that figure will increase to 10% in this programme.  Is that enough?  Even if we are monitoring 10% of farms, are we really capturing the problem?</p> <p>  A strong claim was made by our previous guests that it will take between 18 and 24 months to see a change in water quality based on the programme.</p><p>I would like the experts from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in particular, to comment on that.  I have dipped into the issue and have done some research.  From what I have read, I understand that we can see results very quickly from changing certain practices, particularly with regard to the nitrate levels in the water.  I would like to give the experts from the Department the opportunity to address that claim that was made very strongly by the representatives of the ICMSA in the previous session.  </p><p> I wish to raise the issue of the rhetoric around the family farm.  Perhaps the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have picked up on it.  It was mentioned by Deputy Fitzmaurice, who has left now.  Indeed, I believe Mr. Callanan himself said that farms are family farms.  Do we need a proper definition of the term?  We need to have an honest discussion here.  If we are using that kind of emotive language, and saying that family farms are under threat because of the nitrates action programme, it is really not helpful.  The reality is that a small number of farmers are derogation farmers, and I absolutely accept that most of those are not the problem.  I find the rhetoric unhelpful.  Perhaps there is an argument for really defining the term.  While we do want to have a sustainable sector and to support family farms, we need to be very clear about what that means.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#R00200"><p>The Deputy asked quite a few questions there.  If I do not get to them all, he can pick me up on it.  First, the Deputy asked about alignment between us and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a very close working relationship between us and our colleagues in agriculture.  We work very closely, particularly on nitrates, and also on the CAP strategic plan, the water framework directive and a whole load of these issues.  There is certainly common interest on all of those matters, so I have no issue with that.  I hope my colleagues do not have issues either.</p> <p>  On the contributions, in our river basin management plan we break the country down into water bodies, which includes different aspects of rivers, lakes and groundwater.  We have attributed sources of pollution that are causing issues, and causing those water bodies not to meet the status requirements, to 11 different causes of which agriculture is just one.  We are able to disaggregate the causes.  I will not go through them all  but agriculture, hydromorphology, which is the shape and the flow in rivers forestry, urban wastewater and urban runoff are the top ones of those 11.  Agriculture is 1,000 out of the 4,842, followed by hydromorphology, then forestry, then urban wastewater.  We have better data now than we have ever had before.  We are able to disaggregate those causes.  It is not the case that there is one issue and one cause.  It is usually contributory from each of the causes.  We have better data now, which is largely and almost entirely down to the work of the EPA and local authorities in terms of that analysis.  Now, as policymakers, we have better information than we have ever had before.</p> <p>  On the 2027 target, it is certainly a very challenging date.  It is essentially around the corner.  It is a challenge right across Europe.  We are talking about a water framework directive from 2000 and a nitrates directive from 1991.  These are not new issues.  The Deputy talked about the effectiveness of each programme.  I would not be perhaps quite as pessimistic as the Deputy was in his question.  There has been a contribution on effectiveness from past programmes.  I think we certainly would be in a much worse situation had we not had that continual strengthening of programmes and even the midterm reviews of those programmes that we spoke about earlier.  I believe the fifth nitrates action programme is a very good programme.  We were here around this time last year and I would make the same comments again.  It is really about adherence to the programme.  We can send out inspectors and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine can send out inspectors, but we cannot be everywhere.  There needs to be support, adherence and acceptance that these rules are for the collective good among the farming industry itself and the industry that those farmers are supplying.</p> <p>  There are three layers of enforcement.  Local authorities are out doing the general nitrates enforcement.  Every single farmer in the country has to adhere to those general rules.  A stricter set of conditions applies to the derogation for farmers, which our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine look at.  There is a joint programme between our Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Part of the fifth nitrates action programme is an improvement in the local authority enforcement and work through the EPA and local authorities to use risk profiling and targeting into those areas of contribution to really get the most out of the resources that will be available in that area.  There is a set target as to how many derogation farms have to be inspected.  The same target does not apply to the general farming population.  The EPA is in the process of putting together a risk-based enforcement plan that will cover that.  That covers enforcement.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a period of 18 to 24 months.  We are essentially talking about how long it will take to improve water quality.  It will vary.  For phosphorous, because it can adhere to the particles in the soil, it can take many years for the system to readjust once the source load has changed.  With nitrates it tends to be a more linear and quicker response, but it is still very much dependent on the local geology and soil type.  I might refer to Dr. Archbold to say more on that.  If we think about the chain that is needed, the policy needs to be changed, that needs to be implemented, there needs to be a response in the water and that needs to be measured.  There is a distance there.  The previous contributors mentioned a period of 18 to 24 months.  It is not an unreasonable point to make.  In some cases it can take some time to show up in the environment and then to be captured by monitoring.   It is a process.</p></speech>

It can be a matter of weeks or months in certain geological settings.  Certainly, it is quicker for nitrates than it would be in a phosphorous situation.  Perhaps Dr. Archbold might say a word or two about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Marie Archbold" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022091400002#R00500"><p>Basically it is about the pathway.  If we think about nitrogen and the way it travels, it travels very quickly and landowners are pre-draining soils that may be overlying the areas of karst, the underground cave systems.  If nitrogen gets into those areas, we will see a response very quickly.  On the other side, looking at phosphorous, it usually flows overland in poorly-draining soils.  After a flood or a rainfall event, one might see a response very quickly in the river, in terms of the concentrations going up.  The response is based on the pathway, the soil type and the geology, as Mr. Flynn mentioned.  On the response time, in terms of the chemistry, we can see it very quickly, but the response of the biology, which is another part of the assessment that is required as part of this review, can be slower.  Also, it is monitored a lot less frequently, every three years.  That monitoring lag is another problem.  As I said, the chemical response can be very quick, but the biological response is probably the slowest to track.</p></speech>

Under negotiation with the Commission, that commitment was increased to 10%.  We have committed significant resources to putting that on the ground.  In terms of targeting to ensure we reach every farmer over the required period, a risk analysis is conducted to target specific areas, whereby we reduce the risk.  We target farmers to ensure compliance with the regulation.</p><p>That has improved and it should improve compliance in the short term.</p></speech>

I do not think anything should be taken from the fact that there is an empty chair between us and the representatives of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That was not at our request.</p> <p>  We work across Departments in our engagements.  An example of that can be seen in our existing agri-environment scheme.  We used mapping from the EPA on water quality as a determinant for priority entry to agri-environment schemes.  Entrants to those schemes are required to pick actions appropriate to water quality.  The current green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, was based on engagement with the likes of the EPA and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That engagement is there.</p> <p>  There are other examples in the forthcoming CAP strategic plan.  A significant amount has been set aside to address the impact of water quality as a joint commitment.  Provisions in respect of water are influenced by the food vision report, which identified the ambition of the industry.  That was called out in the achievement of regular standards in water.  Even Mr. Tom Arnold has spoken in the media about the importance of us, as a collective industry, in supporting his overall objectives.  Those considerations and their importance influence our approach.</p> <p>  Senator Lombard, who has left, asked about derogation.  He may not be aware that the manager of the ACP, whom I happen to know quite well, has always said that derogation farmers are the first to attend meetings he holds.  They are the first to engage and to understand.  He said the reality of their engagement with the environment is stark.  They ask what they need to do.  In our management of the derogation, we brought in a mid-term review in 2019 to look at what needed to be done.  My experience of farmers is that they are very engaged.  There are undoubtedly issues that are challenging in their introduction but the general direction has been towards farmers asking what they need to do.  They are receptive to being honestly and openly advised in that respect.  That is my experience.</p></speech>

Some of my questions may have been asked.  I will ask two quick questions, the first of which is for the representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Does the Department accept the figures provided by the ICMSA relating to the calculations of the 220 kg limit and the assertion that combined with cow banding, it will equal a reduction in herd size?  Are there other variables to take into account when calculating the potential impact these measures would have on a family farm?</p> <p>  Different areas have different farming practices and different water qualities.  Is the model that Teagasc is undertaking going to give a breakdown of the potential impact by region?  Specific regions face existing challenges.</p></speech>

To be honest, I have not seen the submission from the ICMSA so I cannot refer directly to it or its impact.  The Deputy asked specifically about actions.  I have referred to the suggested culling of numbers.  I identified earlier that is based on the application of manure, the exporting of manure, temporary grazing and issues such as that, which have always been available and will continue to be available.  I cannot give the Deputy a clear picture of the impact for the 15% who are in the higher band.  I certainly assume they will take the actions legally available to them to comply before reducing numbers.  That is up to individual farmers.</p> <p>  I will leave the question about Teagasc modelling to Mr. Harris.  Is that done by catchment or by area?</p></speech>

We have asked for an update based on the derogation decision.  That work is ongoing and we hope to finalise it shortly.  We can refine things further, if required.

When it comes to measuring water quality, is account taken of upstream levels versus downstream levels?  I am asking that for the purpose of making a distinction between farms where excess run-off drains into watercourses and others that are compliant.  A blanket response to the actions of a few has the potential to penalise those who are compliant.</p></speech>

A sample is based on what is coming downstream so it will be impacted.  That sample will also show what is coming from upstream.  The EPA examines land use and flow pathways that can contribute.  As Mr. Flynn said, the EPA can then determine what activities are making a contribution.  It can then almost decipher the relevant sources.  In addition, representatives of the local authorities water programme in a large proportion of the country go out and ground truth the EPA results to further confirm the sources.  There is a disaggregation involved there.  We are able to pull apart the meaning of the concentrations in a sample at a monitoring point.</p></speech>

Many farmers have invested heavily in expansion on the advice of successive Governments.  What response has the Department to farmers who are trying to repay the debt they have accumulated?</p></speech>

It is a matter for Government to decide to apply at any time.  We have agreed a four-year derogation with the Commission until the end of 2025.  In terms of the economic viability of those holdings, having that there is critical.  It should not be taken for granted.  We must deliver on water quality if we want to contribute to its long-term viability.  The vast majority of farmers would accept that.  In respect of the continuation of the derogation, we must do what it takes to ensure it is contributing to the overall requirements of the water framework directive.  That is what I would say to those who have invested.  They are putting in place the systems, in respect of storage, etc., to ensure they can be compliant to better use manure.  We have seen evidence of that, particularly this year with the high price of fertiliser.  Farmers are happy to have invested in storage to ensure they can use slurry at the right time because rather than managing a tank, they are managing their manure.  That is the way I would describe it.  This is an investment.  Our objective should be to show leadership in this area.</p></speech>

On the testing scenario, I cannot get my head around how we can identify bad spots or what is causing pollution.  That was the case going back to the first question from Deputy Fitzmaurice.  Perhaps it is my own lack of comprehension.  Perhaps we could get a breakdown in writing.  If I were reading it, I might be able to get my head around it more easily.  From what I have heard and observed, the words "profiling" and "modelling" have come up a lot.  It frightens me that decisions being made that are going to affect farmers in such a severe way are based on some of the figures that were given to us earlier by the ICMSA.</p><p>We do not have the EPA figures this year, yet we are going gung-ho for the changes to the derogation.  Has there been any indication from any of the testing, modelling or risk profiling that low-emission slurry spreading, or the use of protected urea, which have become almost sacrosanct over the last couple of years, have caused a change on any of the farms we are talking about today?  Are we going for another stick to beat farmers with without knowing whether what they have been doing to date has made any change?  Is the same modelling and risk-profiling being done on industry, roads, slurry or sewage treatment plants as is being done with the perceived run-off from the farm?  That is more a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Why did the nitrogen value in a cubic metre of slurry change from 5 kg to 2.4 kg?  Did we have it wrong before?  That will have a serious effect on the people who are trying to meet the targets that are being set for slurry exportation.  They will have to export twice as much to stand still.  It seems like a serious change.  Why did it change?</p><p> As I said to the ICMSA, being a devil's advocate and looking at the worst-case scenario, taking its submission verbatim and its numbers for herd reduction as being correct, what compensation will be available for people who are servicing loans, trying to live a life and who have invested a lot in a business?  If it comes to that, there has to be a just transition and some form of compensation.  What compensation would be available if a farmer comes to a point where the only way he can meet these targets is through a reduction?  As Deputy Fitzmaurice rightly said, there is not much more land available these days.  The exporting of slurry will have to be doubled for these farmers to stay where they are because of the change of value.  As was said about them coming to the meetings first, they are the first people to embrace science and technology.  Any farmer who has benefited from a derogation has it almost down to a fine art.  I do not see the wriggle room for further improvement to meet these targets that the witnesses seem to think they have.  If the only way to do it is through herd reduction, what compensation will there be?  They have to be compensated.</p></speech>

Its representatives stated they are still waiting for clarification about what cow numbers will be used to determine the band.  What cow numbers are used?  The Department said it has a calculator on its website.  What number does the farmer enter?  Is it the number for the cow or a livestock unit?  The ICMSA tells us it still does not know what cow numbers are being used to calculate the bands.  If the representative body does not know, I do not know how an individual farmer can get a correct calculation.  Which cow numbers is the Department using?</p></speech>

I will start with the first two matters to make sure that everybody has a clear understanding.  The first key benefit of low-emission spreading of slurry is ammonia reduction.  It has an additional benefit of improving the efficiency utilisation of manure.  That contributes to needing less bag fertiliser in reality.  One gets greater efficiency from it.  It is principally done through ammonia compliance, to which the dairy sector has to contribute too and was the driver of our inclusion of it as a requirement for farmers with a derogation.</p> <p>  Protected urea is a climate change mitigation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with it.  It is not a major game changer with regard to water quality because the number of nitrates lost from the system is based on the amount applied, uptake and various different things, but the protection and volume of nitrogen applied does not change.  To be clear, while there is a major change to the emissions factors associated with it, there is not in respect of the water quality associated with it.</p></speech>

We developed information for 2020 and 2021 to give farmers an indication of where they sat going into 2022.  It uses average cow numbers across the year.  If farmers refer to their ICBF HerdPlus account, they can see an average cow number.  We are currently developing the system for banding to implement this action.  It is still a number of months away from finalisation but once it is finalised, that will be clarified in the short term.</p></speech>

Any technical tables that were part of the regulation were examined.  One was the nitrogen and phosphorous value in slurry.  It was clear that its value was higher than in many other EU member states.  A review was undertaken with clear methodology for its evaluation.  It was clear that the nitrogen value was too high to reflect the current situation.  The Teagasc green book made that distinction a while ago when it was published.  In the review of the nitrates action programme and the amendment to the regulation, we introduced that figure of 2.4 kg for the end value in slurry to reflect the situation on the ground.</p></speech>

One is the monitoring programme for the nitrates directive, which my colleague spoke about earlier.  The nitrates directive set out the rules and requirements of the monitoring programme in detail, including reporting and methodologies.  When it comes to breaking down the wider picture, one needs to look at the water framework directive monitoring programme.  That looks at 4,842 water bodies across Ireland.  A significant risk has been identified in about 2,810 of those.  I listed those earlier, including agriculture, hydromorphology, forestry and so on.  We can provide details of both programmes to the committee in writing.  That is no problem whatsoever.  The requirements essentially come down to the concentration of the chemicals that one is looking at in water and the biology that one is examining.  While we might be talking about modelling and attribution, when it comes down to brass tacks, the concentration of the chemical in the water and the biology in the water, as found by the EPA and local authority experts, is what matters.</p></speech>

In the same vein, and going back to the nitrogen value in a cubic metre of slurry, this has changed from 5 kg of nitrogen per cubic metre to 2.4 kg of nitrogen per cubic metre of slurry.  Does this have ramifications for the calculation then of the overall output of the animal?  It is the animal that produces the slurry.  We were working on 5 kg of nitrogen per cubic metre of slurry and we are now down to 2.4 kg of nitrogen per cubic metre of slurry; is the same cow producing the same cubic metre of slurry now as then?  Therefore, when we go back to calculating our whole 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, 250 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year or 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, or whatever it is, are there ramifications for these calculations if there is that much less nitrogen in the cow effluent?</p></speech>

The evaluation was based on a lifecycle analysis of nitrogen in the cycle.  The methodology was undertaken during the evaluation period.  That calculation, as I understand it, would have been included in it.  We can clarify this point and respond later to the Senator, but I am sure that aspect was included in the calculation of the existing bands in the context of the next programme.</p></speech>

If this changes, then it changes, and in my limited knowledge of the whole science of this process, then that changes the whole calculation of the 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, the 220 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year or the 250 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year and the bands.  Perhaps I am wrong in this regard.</p></speech>

Those goalposts have not changed, but that calculation was being done off 5 kg per cubic metre of slurry and now it is being said there is only 2.4 kg per cubic metre of slurry.  In my ignorance, I think this must have an impact on how all our bands are calculated, if there is this big a change?</p></speech>

It must be an open and transparent process.  If we consider this aspect, it is a factor of the volume of slurry produced as well.  If the volume increases, then, in the context of those figures, the nitrogen as a percentage of that reduces as well.  Overall, however, the 89 kg, the 106 kg, etc. is all calculated annually based on what the animals eat and the nitrogen content of that material.  A factor is also taken out for maintenance in this respect, and this then generates an excretion factor as well.  There is a formula concerning how this value is calculated and, as I understand the situation, this is a Europe-wide approach.  Therefore, if we consider our typical bands now, and we take the existing 106 kg level, there are many production systems that are much higher.  I do not have the figures in this regard, but we can get them for Dutch cows.  I think the level is 120 kg or something like that for the nitrogen figure in the Netherlands, which is proportionate to its production, which is way over 6,500 l.  I think that was the figure given by the ICMSA, but it could be 8,000 l or 10,000 l.</p></speech>

There is a difference here, in that a derogation is negotiated with the European Commission.  It has been suggested that there is a value in this to the European Commission.  If we look, for example, at compliance with the water framework directive and if it is felt that a country is not compliant, then recourse will be had through the European courts and that is a lengthy process.  When we are in derogation, though, we are subject to negotiation every two or four years.  That is quite a different context.  We are looking across at the whites of the eyes of our interlocutors in respect of what needs to be done.  Therefore-----</p></speech>

It is not good for Ireland to go to the European Commission and ask for another derogation if we have not met our own programme.</p></speech>

The process commenced at the same time.  They have certainly not agreed.  It is important that we are not compared to the Dutch, because the water quality issue is just phenomenally different.  Considering our average nitrate levels, Dr. Archbold identified that we are in the top third in that respect.  Regarding nitrates, we might have 1% or 2% at over 50 mg of our national monitoring level, whereas in the Dutch situation - and I know this because I did a presentation at the same time some years ago - it is certainly north of 50%.  Therefore, the Netherlands has a fundamentally different challenge with the intensity in this regard.  I describe the comparison by saying it is a country the size of Munster that has the same size of dairy herd, but with double the production.  The Netherlands also has ten times the number of pigs and a huge horticultural sector.  The total value of agricultural exports from that country was &euro;60 billion annually versus our &euro;13.5 billion.  It is just a different scale of intensity, so therefore these are not comparable contexts.</p> <p>  This still goes back to the situation, however, that we negotiate with the European Commission concerning our next action programme.  It must be satisfied before it will propose a vote to member states.  It will not just do that automatically.  In my experience, the process will be undergone and then the European Commission will say that it is happy with the programme being put in place by Ireland.  This was conveyed at the beginning of the meeting in respect of there having been long and arduous discussions and, ultimately, the European Commission decided it was comfortable that Ireland had put a robust action programme on the table.  Such an outcome then undoubtedly influences voting positions.  As I said earlier, there must be a long-term commitment concerning a sustainable derogation and this is where we see it being important to ask the right things of farmers.  Experience has told us that they are willing to do them based on securing long-term viability.  Perhaps someone from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage might like to comment.  </p></speech>

However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online through Microsoft Teams.  Those attending the committee rooms and its environs should continue to sanitise and wash their hands properly, be respectful of other people's physical space where possible, and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If those attending the meeting have any Covid-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the committee room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members who are required to participate in the meeting remotely must do so from within the Leinster House complex, as they are well aware.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Senator Garvey and Deputy Shanahan.</p> <p>  Today's meeting is to discuss the general scheme of the representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers Bill 2022.  This Bill aims to give effect to the EU representative actions directive by creating a new civil litigation mechanism by which a qualified entity may act as a claimant party on behalf of consumers who have opted into a representative action against a trader in the High Court.  The Bill also creates a mechanism whereby an organisation which represents the collective interests of consumers may apply to the Minister to be designated as a qualified entity to bring a representative action in Ireland or in other EU member states.</p> <p>  The new law is a response to recent mass consumer rights breaches by private companies.</p><p>It will allow for several cross-border qualified entities to come together to represent EU consumers where they have been harmed by the same alleged infringement which has been caused by the same trader in several member states.  Today we are pleased to have the opportunity to consider these matters further with representatives of various bodies.  I welcome Mr. Philip Andrews from the Law Society of Ireland, who is a partner in McCann Fitzgerald with responsibility for EU, anti-trust and telecoms.  He is a member of the Law Society's business law committee.  I understand that Ms Aleksandra Pruska of McCann Fitzgerald may also be joining us.  I also welcome the chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, Mr Jeremy Godfrey.  He is joined by Mr. Kevin O'Brien, who is a member of the CCPC; Ms S&iacute;ona Ryan, who is the CCPC's director of policy and international; and Mr. Robert Dunne, who is the CCPC's deputy director of legal services.  I also welcome the chairperson of the Consumer Association of Ireland, CAI, Mr. Michael Kilcoyne, who is attending remotely.  He is joined by Mr. Raymond O'Rourke, who is the vice chairperson of the CAI; and Mr. Dermott Jewell, who is the CAI's policy and council adviser.</p><p> Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards references that witnesses make to another person in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> The opening statements from the three organisations have been circulated to members.  To commence consideration of the matter today, I invite Mr. Philip Andrews to make his opening statement on behalf of the Law Society.</p></speech>

The Law Society welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the committee's scrutiny of the general scheme.  I am a member of the business law committee of the Law Society of Ireland.  I am a practising Irish solicitor in the area of EU competition, trade and regulating markets.  My practice is mainly advisory and I do not regularly litigate cases.  I am therefore not an expert in litigation procedure.  I wish to extend apologies on behalf of Ms Aleksandra Pruska who is unable to attend today for health reasons.<br/><br/>I will set out some background and then talk about three specific points with regard to the general scheme.  As I am sure is well-known to members, in 2005 the Law Reform Commission, LRC, conducted a review of the law regarding multi-party litigation and reached a preliminary conclusion that the Irish legal system &quot;lacks a comprehensive procedure that would tackle class claims in a uniform and consistent fashion&quot;.  An LRC report on foot of that assessment which was issued later in 2005 recommended that a formal procedural structure for collective redress be established.  Following the introduction of a Private Members' Bill on multi-party actions, MPAs, the then Minister for Justice and Equality referred the question of the introduction of an MPA procedure in the Irish legal system to the review of the administration of civil justice review group, established in 2017 and chaired by the then president of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.<br/><br/>In January 2018 the European Commission published a report and study on collective redress mechanisms in member states.  The report and study found that Ireland was an outlier among EU member states because Ireland had &quot;no dedicated mechanism for bringing collective claims in Ireland&quot;.  It continued:</p> <blockquote> 	Rather, mass claims are dealt with under the general rules of civil procedure which only allow for collective claims in very limited circumstances. </blockquote> <p>A 2020 report on foot of the work of the administration of civil justice review group, which I will call the Kelly group, concluded that in addition to EU Directive No. 1828 on representative actions, there was a further rationale for the introduction of a new and more comprehensive MPA procedure to accommodate mass claims.  More specifically, while acknowledging the importance of public law redress mechanisms like those provided for in EU Directive No. 1828, the Kelly report concluded that in addition it seemed clear that there was an objective need to legislate for a comprehensive MPA procedure in Ireland.</p><p>In SPV <i>v</i>. HSBC, then Chief Justice Clarke stated, in 2018, that: </p><blockquote>	I remain very concerned that there are cases where persons or entities have suffered from wrongdoing but where those persons or entities are unable effectively to vindicate their rights because of the cost of going to court.  That is a problem to which solutions require to be found.  It does seem to me that this is an issue to which the legislature should give urgent consideration.   </blockquote><p>While the Law Society welcomes the directive and general scheme, it would support broader and carefully-balanced reforms that implement the recommendations of the LRC and the Kelly report.  It would be important that those reforms are carefully balanced to facilitate small-harm class actions while preventing excessive litigation.<br/><br/>I will give one US example.  In the US, courts have generally applied a very lenient standard for certification of class actions.  An example is a recent class action lawsuit from May 2022, Chimienti <i>v</i>. Wendy&rsquo;s International, in a New York district court in which the plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged misrepresentations and omissions because &ldquo;Wendy&rsquo;s advertises its burgers to make it appear that the burgers are substantially larger in size than the actual burger served to customers&rdquo;.  The lawsuit goes on to claim that &ldquo;the beef patties used for its advertisements are not fully cooked to make it appear that they are approximately 15-20% larger than the beef patties that are actually served to customers&rdquo;.  The claim is brought by the plaintiff &ldquo;on his own behalf and on behalf of all other persons or entities who purchased an overstated Wendy&rsquo;s menu item&rdquo;, so it is really an opt-out system there.  It is estimated that many thousands of new class actions are filed each year in the US federal and state courts.  According to one authoritative source, &ldquo;A putative class action takes no more than a single named plaintiff and a filing fee typically of several hundred US dollars&rdquo;.<br/><br/>I will now turn to the general heads and our three comments.  EU Directive 2020/1828 sets minimum standards only.  It requires member states to put in place, at a minimum, at least one procedural mechanism to enable consumer organisations, called &ldquo;qualified entities&rdquo;, to commence representative actions on behalf of consumers.  Notably, under the directive and the general scheme, only qualified entities, not individual consumers, can bring representative actions.  Many, if not most, member states are expected to go beyond the minimum requirements, or already do so.<br/><br/>A key purpose of the directive is to enable, consistent with Article 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, representative actions to ensure a high level of consumer protection.  That is in recital 4 of the directive.  To that end, the directive requires member states to implement, at a minimum, a type of collective representative action involving a qualified entity, but it is not a purpose of the directive to require that representative actions can only be taken by qualified entities.<br/><br/>Under subsection (1) in head 5 - application, the general scheme states that &ldquo;a representative action may be only brought before the court by a qualified entity designated by the Minister for the purposes of bringing a domestic representative action&rdquo;.  A question arises as to why head 5(1), appears to suggest that only collective actions by qualified entities are permitted in Irish law.  By explicit inclusion of the word &ldquo;only&quot;, a question arises as to whether a limitation is incorporated into the Irish legislation that may have unintended consequences.  Could this approach prevent organic emergence of representation actions in common law?  Ireland currently has a relatively restricted regime for collective action, including by reference to other EU member states, as well as other common law jurisdictions such as the UK.  A legislative provision that limited private-party rights to take collective or multiparty actions in such a way could also run counter to recommendations of the LRC and the calls for legislative reform by the Judiciary.  The 2020 Kelly report refers-----</p></speech>

My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to provide our views on the general scheme.  I am the chairperson of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and I am joined by Ms S&iacute;ona Ryan, who is director of our policy and international division.<br/><br/>The CCPC welcomes the general scheme, which will establish a system for representative actions in Ireland and will ultimately lead to the improvement of consumer access to justice and redress.  Redress is a very important aspect of consumer protection.  When things go wrong, consumers must be confident that traders will provide them with appropriate remedies such as compensation, repair, replacement, price reduction, contract termination or refund of the price paid.  The CCPC therefore strongly believes all consumers should have access to fair and timely dispute resolution and redress mechanisms.  One mechanism for achieving redress is enforcement action taken by public bodies.  Another is legal action taken by consumers themselves.  Where consumers have suffered as a result of a trader failing to uphold their rights, a public body such as the CCPC or a sector regulator can take enforcement action, using its legal powers to investigate and seek sanctions.  Enforcement action can result in penalties, orders to come into compliance and, in some cases, compensation for affected consumers.<br/><br/>Individual consumers can take legal action against a trader in the small claims court for amounts under &euro;2,000 and in the higher courts for larger amounts.  In some cases, individual consumers may also be able to avail of alternative dispute resolution; for example, by making a complaint to a sector ombudsman or a sector regulator.  This Bill will introduce another mechanism for consumers to take legal action.  It allows for representative actions to be taken on behalf of multiple affected consumers.  This will apply when a trader has failed to uphold rights derived from EU consumer law, both general consumer law and a range of other laws that protect consumer interests.  The Bill will allow both for injunctions and for compensation and will apply both to domestic and to cross-border actions.  Irish consumers will be able to join representative actions taken in other member states and <i>vice versa</i>.<br/><br/>This Bill transposes the EU representative actions directive, and the general scheme of the Bill closely follows the requirements of the directive.  We have only a few comments on the detail of the general scheme.  First, we welcome the criteria for designation of qualified entities who can take representative actions on behalf of affected consumers.  These criteria follow the directive and will ensure consumers&rsquo; interests are placed at the heart of all representative actions.<br/><br/>Second, we consider that qualified entities should be free to make independent decisions about which cases to pursue, based on their own criteria, such as the prospects of success, the scale of consumer detriment and whether they have the resources and expertise needed.  This is implicit in the general scheme and it will be important the final legislation does not constrain the independence of qualified entities in this regard.<br/><br/>Third, we welcome the provision for the Minister to facilitate co-operation and sharing of best practice among qualified entities.  Co-operation and sharing of best practice among entities interested in becoming qualified entities prior to designation will also be useful, and public bodies such as the CCPC may have a role in sharing experience with qualified entities or bodies seeking designation.  However, this does not necessarily need to be explicitly referenced in the Bill.<br/><br/>While the Bill will enable representative actions to be taken, there are a number of complementary measures that will determine how the mechanisms in the Bill operate in practice.  For example, the general scheme contemplates that courts could make rules on matters such as admissibility, evidence and the means of appeal.  Any such rules could set important criteria for representative actions, such as the minimum number of consumers affected and how similar their claims must be.<br/><br/>The CCPC also considers it would be useful for the courts to provide for fast-tracking of representative actions, both to provide faster redress when an action succeeds and to minimise the costs that are inevitably incurred when an action is prolonged.</p><p> The availability of funding for qualified entities will be crucial to their success.  The CCPC welcomes the possibility of removing court fees payable by qualified entities taking a representative action.  We note, however, that such fees are not likely to be material in the overall cost of a representative action.  The ancient prohibitions on champerty and maintenance remain in place in Ireland, despite having been abolished in most other common law jurisdictions.  These prohibitions will severely limit the ability of qualified entities to fund representative actions.  The CCPC therefore welcomes the recommendation in the 2020 Review of the Administration of Civil Justice, led by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, that the rules on funding of litigation should be modernised.</p><p> At the committee's previous hearing on the Bill, there was some discussion on which types of body might become qualified entities.  The CCPC's view is that the interests of consumers are best served if they have the option of civil society bodies taking representative actions on their behalf in addition to public bodies taking enforcement actions against traders who breach consumer law.  Having these two options available will mean that consumers will be able to take matters into their own hands if a public body decides not to pursue a particular case for any reason.</p><p> I will end with some remarks on the CCPC's role in helping consumers to secure redress.  First, we will use the enhanced enforcement powers contained in the Consumer Rights Bill to secure redress for consumers in cases in which there is substantial or widespread consumer detriment.  These new enforcement powers mean we will be able to require traders to provide refunds, price reductions or similar remedies if they fail to deliver goods or services or if those goods or services are faulty or otherwise do not conform with the consumer contract.  Second, we will continue to advocate improvements to the small claims court procedure and a rise in the ceiling for claims.  Last year there were only 2,134 claims submitted through the small claims procedure, indicating that many consumers find that the process does not meet their needs.  Third, we will share expertise and collaborate with civil society bodies that are interested in becoming qualified entities to help them to develop the capacity to take on this role.  Fourth, we will consider how the CCPC's role in securing redress for consumers could evolve in the light of our experience using our new powers and once we know whether other bodies have secured designation as qualified entities.</p><p> The CCPC welcomes the general scheme of the Bill and the introduction of representative actions in Ireland.  The CCPC believes that representative actions for the protection of collective interests of consumers will complement the soon-to-be-expanded role of the CCPC and other public bodies in securing redress for consumers.  It will allow for more efficient cross-European redress in cases of mass harm and provides a further incentive to traders to comply with consumer protection law.</p></speech>

Since 2004, the CAI has been lobbying for consumers to have the benefit of access to justice by means of collective action in a court whereby, rather than 1,000 consumers taking 1,000 cases to court, a qualified entity such as the CAI would take one case on behalf of those 1,000 consumers affected.  This is already effectively operational in other member states of the European Union.  Our engagement was significantly extended through our membership of BEUC, the Brussels organisation of consumer associations in the EU.  As a result, we are now, 18 years on, with collective redress demanded by the European Commission to be implemented by December and operational by June 2023 in every member state.</p> <p>  The draft Bill provides the template for Ireland's mechanism.  We have some concerns about a number of the provisions, their effectiveness and their fitness for purpose for Irish consumers and, when and if one is appointed, for the qualified entity.  I will pass to Mr. O'Rourke to outline those concerns.</p></speech>

We have some points about specific items and we drill down quite specifically into various parts of the Bill.  I hope Deputies and Senators will be happy with the detail, rather than just broad brush strokes, that I will put forward.</p><p>Head 16(1) transposes the conditions laid down in Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 on the designation of an organisation as a qualified entity for the purposes of taking domestic or cross-border representative actions; in particular that the entity should be an association with the primary aim of protecting the interests of consumers.  The specifics of the designation process will be dealt with under future ministerial regulations, as referenced in head 16(2).<br/><br/>We are concerned that additional conditions could be introduced, as seems to be asked by the Law Society even here today, militating against the Consumers Association of Ireland, the only existing consumer NGO in Ireland, from applying to be a qualified entity.  Will those regulations be in place by the time this directive is to be operational on 25 June 2023? <br/><br/>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is the designated authority to inform the European Commission of designated qualified entities.  What happens if it does not designate a body?  If it does not, Irish consumers will be left without their statutory rights under this directive.  What is the response of Oireachtas Members?<br/><br/>With regard to funding for qualified entities, head 7(3) states that, aside from an entry fee placed on an individual consumer to be a party to the representative action, &quot;any costs incurred in the bringing of a representative action for redress shall be borne by the qualified entity and not the consumers represented by it&quot;.  Head 20 clarifies that the head 7(3) fee should be a modest fee to be determined by the Minister, but how will this be determined?  Will it be determined via the proposed ministerial regulations or another regulation?<br/><br/>Head 4 states that all representative actions for redress or an injunctive measure will be taken via the High Court under new superior court rules.  Have these rules been adopted and will they be in place by 25 June 2023?  We all know that commencing legal proceedings in the High Court is not cheap and, yet, the Bill ignores the administrative costs that will be demanded of a qualified entity, that is, a consumer association, to commence a representative action. <br/><br/>Head 3(4) notes that the Minister for Justice may make regulations to provide for the removal of fees payable to the court by parties bringing representative actions under the Act.  This certainly would be of benefit to the qualified entity and, yet, as with other issues such as the superior court rules and ministerial regulations, we in the CAI are waiting to see if the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister for Justice is truly on the side of the Irish consumer.<br/><br/>The CAI suggests that even if such measures were introduced, the legislation places considerable administrative burdens on the qualified entity, such as the provision of information about representative actions online, transparency as to the funding of the qualified entity to avoid conflicts of interest and interactions with consumers prior to commencement of a representative action.  In that case, the qualified entity would need to have a well-resourced office with staff to complete the task of instigating representative actions.<br/><br/>Without some form of funding from the Government or co-operative assistance from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, as mentioned in its presentation, possibly by means of a memorandum of understanding, the CAI is doubtful if this directive will be fully enacted in Ireland for the benefit of Irish consumers.<br/><br/>I highlight Articles 20(1) and (2) of directive.  Article 20 specifically states - this is not in the preamble - that:</p><blockquote>	Member States shall take measures aiming to ensure that the costs of the proceedings related to representative actions do not prevent qualified entities from effectively exercising their right to seek the measures referred to in Article 7. </blockquote><p>Article 7 refers to representative actions.  The measures referred to in paragraph 1 may, for example, take the form of public funding, including structural support for qualified entities, limitation of applicable court or administrative fees, or access to legal aid.  <br/><br/>This issue is not mentioned at all in the Bill before the committee and therefore means that the Government does not seem serious about fully transposing Directive (EU) 2020/1828, taking into account all the additional issues mentioned that still have to be enacted via ministerial regulations and changes to superior court rules.  Are the Deputies and Senators happy, as Oireachtas Members, to potentially see Irish consumers unable to avail of their statutory consumer rights under the directive as of 25 June 2023 due to these anomalies?<br/><br/>I will mention the issue regarding a minimum number of consumers.  Members will understand that preambles are really the philosophy behind the legislation.  They do not have to be transposed.  Preamble 12 of the directive notes that it is up to member states to lay down rules on various issues relating to representatives actions, such as &quot;to decide on the required degree of similarity of individual claims or the minimum number of consumers concerned by a representative action for redress measures in order for the case to be admitted to be heard as a representative action.&quot;.</p><p>The CAI does not regard these important matters to be covered by the Bill.  Will they also be an issue for ministerial regulations?<br/><br/>The last item I will mention is the length of prior consultation.  Head 10(5) states that prior to a qualified entity bringing an action before the courts seeking an injunctive measure:</p><blockquote>	the qualified entity must first seek to enter into consultations with the trader concerned with the express purpose of having the trader cease the infringement referred to in section 6 of this Act. </blockquote><p>This is a reasonably correct transposition of the directive, but the CAI would point out that one very important matter has been omitted in the wording of this section of the Bill.  Paragraph (41) of the preamble to the directive states:</p><blockquote>	Where Member States have established that there should be prior consultation, a deadline of two weeks after the request for consultation is received should be set, after which, if the infringement has not ceased, the applicant should be entitled to immediately bring a representative action for an injunctive measure before the competent court or administrative authority.  Such requirements could also apply to representative actions for redress measures, in accordance with national law. </blockquote><p>This is a crucial issue that must be amended in the Bill; otherwise, the prior consultation could be a means to entirely undermine the consumer representative action by obstructive lengthy consultations, whether by solicitors, lawyers or traders, thereby making the injunctive measure of little use if finally agreed to by the court.  Injunctive measures need to be introduced in a quick and timely fashion, as understood by Preamble (41).</p></speech>

The directive is quite clear that the consumer representative action procedures are not like US class-action litigation.  The CAI has never sought or supported US-style class action legal procedures for Irish consumers, as highlighted on many occasions by Mr. Jewell.</p> <p>  Never before in the 56 years of the CAI&rsquo;s history, or arguably not since we launched the pilot scheme for the small claims court in Ireland, have we been so engaged in trying to bring affordable access to justice to consumers.  As members have heard, the CAI is not happy with many aspects of the Bill before the joint committee.  We ask that substantial changes be made to it in order that Irish consumers, as of 25 June 2023, can rely on their statutory consumer rights, as described in the directive, and, importantly, deliver the appropriate resources by a truly independent entity to challenge the deep pockets of those who seek, with far too much regularity, to deny consumers their legal and fair entitlements under common law.</p> <p>  We thank the Chairman and members very much for their time and engagement with us today.  We look forward to assisting in any way we can with the limited resources we have.</p></speech>

This is pretty complicated, so we need to be sure we get it right.  I am aware that there are substantial concerns, as expressed this morning.  We had representatives of the Department here before the summer recess.  Obviously, the representatives will have watched the proceedings.  I asked for more information on what body would be a qualified entity.  I believe that is really important.  I am concerned that there does not seem to be very much by way of clarity.  We were told that no decisions had been made as to what body would constitute a qualified entity, that there would have to be an application process and that those concerned would have to wait to be designated.  Have the representatives got any clarity from the Department as to how it will work and what the entities will be?</p><p>That is going to be a concern.  Have the witnesses any issues with the adjudication process involved in establishing a qualified entity?  The questions can be taken in any order they like.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will have seen from our presentation, we are concerned about the whole process because it references that it is via ministerial regulations.  The proof is in the pudding so we do not know.  The transposition of the directive is correct.  They follow all the lines.  There is an emphasis that the body and the entity should be a consumer organisation of long standing, etc. but I reiterate that the proof is in the pudding.  We have not seen the ministerial regulations or, as the Deputy said, the format of the application form or how to go about it and we do not know whether they are going to decide quickly, or whatever.  We are at a bit of a loss on that.</p></speech>

We particularly see that the issue of funding will be crucial to who feels able to become a qualified entity.  Of course, issues of public funding of qualified entities and issues of modernising the laws on private funding of litigation will be important.  Some of those are issues for the Department of Justice rather than for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We think it is important and highly desirable for consumers that some civil society bodies are able to come forward to be qualified entities.  From our point of view, we are not a funding body but we have some expertise to assist and will do what we can to support bodies that are interested in being qualified entities in their applications.  As the Deputy said, there is a lot of water to flow under the bridge before we know what is going to happen.</p></speech>

The directive provides for a two-category system of designating qualified entities.  As I read the directive for cross-border representative actions that qualified entities might take, these criteria must apply to qualified entities that are acting cross-border.  In respect of purely domestic representation, I read the directive also to allow that for domestic qualified entities these stipulations do not have to apply.  Article 4(4) of the directive on the issue of domestic representation actions states: "Member States shall ensure that the criteria they use to designate an entity as a qualified entity for the purposes of bringing domestic representation actions are consistent with the objective of this directive in order to make the functioning of such representative actions effective and efficient."  It is not a requirement of the directive that the six stipulations that are included must be applied in respect of domestic representation actions.  Member states have greater freedom to adopt different criteria under the directive.</p></speech>

I have a specific question for him.  Has he any designs or ideas for the representative action procedure that will be in place for injunctions and redress actions that can be brought by qualified entities when established?  How would he see this working effectively?  The legislation sets out how the procedures will work - that qualified entities can seek injunctions, redress measures or both.  However, we were also told that these rules could change depending on the view of the Department of Justice on the rules of the court.</p><p>Will it be necessary for us to introduce secondary legislation arising out of this in order to be able to proceed?  Do the witnesses foresee this design having to be done through legislation or can it be done without additional legislation, assuming this legislation goes through?</p></speech>

There is an expense to bringing a case.  Given that only nominal fees can be accepted by qualified entities, this creates a difficulty.  The High Court is not cheap, as the witnesses noted in their submission.</p> <p>  Dr. Johnny Ryan from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has pointed out that Article 20(1) of the directive provides that "member states shall take account of the non-profit making character of qualified entities and ensure that a lack of funding is not a bar to bringing representative actions".  Should the Bill be reconfigured to enable non-profit organisations to source some funding for collective actions given that it is not going to be free or, indeed, cheap to take such actions?  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses.</p> <p>  One of the witnesses asked if we were happy, as legislators, that consumers and others would be disadvantaged.  Of course we will all say we are not happy that they would be disadvantaged but we need to do something about that by trying to put a bit of shape on what that would look like.  If we are excluding not-for-profit entities that have a very real issue and may wish to take such cases, they will be barred from doing so because of the funding rules.  Do the witnesses have a view on how we might make a change to ensure the Bill is as broad as possible to encompass as many not-for-profit organisations as possible?  If they are going to be excluded, this provision will not work.</p></speech>

Let us consider the position in other member states.  There are a number of member states where consumer associations take cases.  We have examples of such cases and the costs involved.  The costs of administration, preparation and engagement with legal people in advance are significant because it takes a lot of time.  Beyond that, the cost of advising every consumer in an opt-in situation that a case is about to be taken and ensuring they all know and understand what the case is, are able to register, get in touch in person with an entity 24-7, as required, and not just a website, and be updated on progress is quite significant.  That is the reality before a case gets to court.  Cases under collective redress should be the exception.  As it would be a very significant issue to challenge, it comes at a cost.  The entity one is taking the case against will potentially fight it tooth and nail.</p></speech>

I will use the Consumers Association of Ireland as a classic example.  We are funded solely by the citizens who pay a subscription to us.  A consumer pays an annual subscription and not many people can afford that.  Our resources could not meet the provisions required under the Bill.  If we were dedicated tomorrow, we could not do it.</p><p>That is why there is no queue across the board of any other NGOs or non-profits, because they just do not have the capacity to do it.  The way to do it is to look to other member states, for example, as it was suggested, potentially by means of a memorandum of understanding.  It should be understood, and I am trying to be reasonable, that if we went to the CCPC or any other body tomorrow, it may not have the resources or funds available to join.  Therefore, it is quite a challenge and it needs to be funded separately and properly.</p></speech>

It may be asked to provide security for costs when taking a case. The funding issues are, if anything, even more severe than the Deputy pointed out.  The directive gives a number of examples of ways in which the funding issues may be addressed through both public and private funding of litigation.  Those will definitely have a big impact on the success of representative actions in Ireland.  They are matters for the Department with responsibility for the Bill and the Department of Justice.  Both will have a role in that.  I am not 100% sure whether that requires a change to the Bill.  We agree with the Deputy that the funding of qualified entities is a fundamentally important issue.</p></speech>

We heard from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, and it was very clear in saying we are out of line and that funding will be a real issue.  You can talk all day about how the costs will be modest etc., but they are not.  As it was point, it is time.  If you work for free, you will never be idle, but people do not because they must pay their rent and all the rest of it.  Therefore, people's time is valuable.  As the Bill is currently constituted, I am concerned that groups that genuinely need access to this and are not the ones with the big, deep pockets will be excluded, and that is a problem.</p></speech>

That action is being taken both in the UK and the Netherlands.  In the lawyers' press release when it was announced, they went through the team they have.  It illustrates how big a team is required.  It is a boutique competition law firm, Monckton Chambers in the UK, which is an extremely well-regarded barristers' chambers.  It has funding from a third-party specialist litigation funder called Harbour.  All of those things make it a serious case.</p></speech>

I have two questions for the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  Has the CAI any estimates, and Deputy O'Reilly referenced this, on what level of funding would be required?  Obviously, it would depend on what case the qualified entity takes and so forth, but is it possible to give an indication?  I know it is a complex matter.  Has research been done or is there a view on how many class actions could have been taken in recent years?  With the situation being so complex, I am trying to get an understanding of how often it would be used in Ireland.</p></speech>

On what it costs, it very much depends on the case.  One simple example I will give, and this is before anything, is an initiative taken by the Portuguese organisation just to advise the citizens in respect of their intention to take a case and ask them to opt in.  The cost for the advertisement alone was &euro;175,000.  That was even before the case was taken.  Some member states will take a single case in a very low court to see how the case and the argument fly, which is a smart way of doing it.  It tries in some way to mitigate the cost and gauge the potential that a case will be successful or how long it will take.  It informs those who want to try to plan.  Obviously they need to engage with legal people who will advise what their costs and opinions would be.  On the research side, there are quite a number of collective redress actions taken in member states.  We could get detail for the committee on what those are.  Italy and Germany have taken some, as have Belgium, the Austrians, the Greeks, Italians, Portuguese and Spanish.  Quite a number of collective redress actions have been taken already.</p></speech>

The Law Society of Ireland referred to broader reforms that are carefully balanced.  Could its representatives speak further on that and how it might be achieved as part of the legislation?</p></speech>

The question of broader reforms involves balancing.  There is a benefit in providing greater access to justice for small harm claims that otherwise would not be able to obtain access given the costs we are talking about.  On the other hand, taken to the extreme, a regime can promote excessive litigation.  That is not desirable either.  The Law Reform Commission report from 2005, as accompanied by the Kelly report in 2020, provide what the Law Society of Ireland thinks is a balanced way in which consumers can have direct access to collective actions other than via the scheme in the Bill.  This would involve a careful certification process by the President of the High Court and an opt-in arrangement rather than an opt-out, with a relatively strict legal test to be applied by the President of the High Court that would essentially be assessing if the multiparty action is fair, efficient and justified.  On that test, we think there would be a reasonable balance struck between the two competing interests I mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

They were very valuable.  The Consumers Association of Ireland has made valid points about what we need to clarify in regulations to create some sort of transparency.  Those points are well made.</p><p>I refer to the wider issue of it being too difficult to be a qualified entity, QE, and the level of Government support in that regard.  I would be interested to hear the views of our guests on how that could be designed.  I presume that if it were a body such as a legal aid board, it would, in effect, be adjudicating on a case before the case was taken.  That seems to be a slightly difficult model.  Are there models for support to QEs on which we could draw that would help us in this area?</p><p> Another issue that has been raised is that of court rules and the champerty and maintenance prohibition.  What are the issues in respect of changing court rules and champerty and maintenance?  Can the Oireachtas take an initiative to drive that or is it something that will have to come from the courts on an independent basis in whatever manner?  Is it up to Oireachtas Members to try to shift the dial on this issue at this stage?</p><p> I would be interested to hear the views of the CCPC on whether qualified entities only is the way to go.  That seems to be the issue.  We have heard two different views but I would be interested to hear the thoughts of the CCPC, with its experience and knowledge, on what might be the options in a European context.</p><p> I would also like to hear the view of the CCPC on the issue, raised by Mr. O'Rourke, of having to consult before injunctive action is taken and not having a time limit on that.  That seems extraordinary.  From the point of view of the CCPC , which takes enforcement and other actions, is there a hidden reason those sort of obligations to consult should be there?  </p><p> I am not sure which of our guests wishes to address the alternative models.  The CAI or the CCPC may wish to comment on how the State might support a QE.</p></speech>

The directive sets out a number of options for financial support for QEs.</p> <p>   On the Deputy's question regarding champerty and maintenance, Mr. Andrews spoke about the collective action that is being funded by a specialist third party litigation fund.  My understanding is that model would not be possible in Ireland at the moment.  The question of how to reform champerty and maintenance is very much on the table.  It was recommended by the Kelly report.  It is a matter for the Department of Justice in the first instance to consider that and come forward with proposals, rather than it being a matter for the Department that has the policy area for this Bill.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a couple of other matters.  As well as representative actions, there is always the role of public bodies in taking enforcement to achieve consumer redress.  There are 60 pieces of European legislation in the annexe.  There are 20 public bodies in Ireland responsible for enforcing that legislation, with varied powers.  For example, last month ComReg achieved an outcome of &euro;2 million in compensation having to be paid by Vodafone to customers in the context of a breach of the specific rules of the telecoms regulation.  Another limb of serving customers is to look at the enforcement powers those 20 public bodies have so that they can use those powers to get enforcement.  As the CAI stated, representative actions should be a rare backstop rather than the first port of call.</p> <p>  That is probably all I have to say in response to the Deputy.</p></speech>

In any legal aid, the funding body has to judge whether the case meets the criteria and has a reasonable prospect of success and so forth.  That is one possible model but there is obviously a policy issue with public funding of that nature.  There are models that enable third parties to fund litigation and recover the costs of the funding if the litigation is won.</p><p>We would be cautious about models where funders get a percentage of the damages awarded.  Then it becomes a more entrepreneurial thing and we slide into the American-style system.  The CCPC has long had concerns about the cost of litigation in Ireland and how a litigation culture and a "compo" culture can increase the cost of doing business, which, ultimately, does not serve consumers' interests.  The issues surrounding how to reform litigation funding in a way that strikes an appropriate balance are important but they are for the Department of Justice rather than for us.</p></speech>

There are due process rights in the public sphere.

I know that the preambles do not have to be transposed but I transposed lots of legislation in the Balkans and that is the thought process of the Commission.  If it puts two weeks, Ireland might say three or four weeks but it is within that.  What is in the Bill is very breezy and easy.  It is really up to yourselves.  You know that if you are in these situations, the other side might start doing a bit of a Trump, appealing, going back and forth and just using up the time and then the injunctive relief is of little use.<br/><br/>In Persona Digital Telephony Limited <i>v.</i>the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Supreme Court ruled that third-party funding to support a plaintiff's legal costs and disbursements, that is, payments by a solicitor to a third party and claim back from a client, is unlawful.  This judgement causes a bit of friction, which is why things are not very clear here.  <br/><br/>I hear the Law Society talking again about the multiparty Bill and how we can do things with the High Court judge.  What can I say?  The committee knows I am a very strong European.  Why have a directive if you are going to have your own legal system decide how you do things?  This directive has come from Europe and we are part of the EU and must implement it in some ways.  Dare I say it, it is a bit like a spurious Brexit way of doing it - a case of we have a different legal system and we will just do it our own way and give consumers their rights in that way.  The consumers' rights are highlighted in this.  I know, as does the Deputy having been a Minister in this area, that it is minimum harmonisation.  It is full harmonisation in the food area.  Minimum harmonisation has always been in the area of consumers because the Swedes do things and the UK used to do things much more strongly than other countries and, therefore, there had to be this balance.  Regarding getting a balance, it is a bit of a cop-out to say our legal system is different from that of everybody else.  It is common law, we have these High Court rules and we are looking after the consumer.  I find this to be an incorrect way of transposing the directive.  </p></speech>

Deputy Bruton referred to the champerty and maintenance prohibition.</p><p>The witnesses said this law is ancient and goes back to 1495 or some date like that.  Perhaps it is time, therefore, that we had a look at it to consider making changes to the third-party funding aspect.  We have an opt-in system here.  Am I correct that other jurisdictions have an opt-out system?  There are certain time limits in the procedures here under which people can apply to opt-in.  If those deadlines are missed, however, people miss out on the opportunity.  Would the witnesses like to comment on this aspect and whether we should look at it?  Am I correct that the UK has an opt-out rather than an opt-in system?  I know it is not in the EU anymore and is not covered by this.  </p><p> Regarding funding, I also noted the Quebec model in Canada, which is a central justice fund for funding this type of action.  Has any consideration been given to that system or have the witnesses any knowledge of how it operates?  I would also be interested to know what the CAI representatives might say regarding the impact this might have on insurance costs for traders and businesses.  Am I correct that traders and businesses could experience an increase in their insurance premiums, which could impact on costs for consumers in the long term?  I have noted comments on this aspect in some of the literature.  Everything else I wanted to ask about has been covered, except for whether this measure might be partially retrospective.  Could this legislation have retrospective application even though it is coming into place in 2023?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Andrews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022091400002#P00200"><p>Before I address that question, my understanding of the case heard in the Supreme Court, which was referred to earlier, is that the former Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Denham, recognised that a statute dealing with maintenance and champerty, the Maintenance and Embracery Act 1634, prohibited this type of activity.  The former Chief Justice, therefore, said that this would need to be changed by the Legislature.  At the same time, it is also clear that the Irish courts, particularly in the context of more recent judicial appointments, are taking a more activist view on what might be permissible in respect of funding.  I refer the committee to the 2022 case of Atlas GP Limited <i>v</i>. Kelly &amp;amp; Ors.  In her judgment, Ms Justice Egan said: &quot;The range of interests and relationships which may justify the provision of funding is not closed and is properly the subject of development by the common law&quot;.  She also noted that the law in this field has undergone, and will undergo, considerable development.  Regarding the Law Society's position, I apologise if I have said it wrong, but we are in favour of the Bill.  It seems to us to be a good step, but we think the legislation could go further.  Our view simply reiterates what was previously set out in the LRC report and endorsed by the Kelly report, which is to give consumers direct access to collective, multiparty actions for themselves.<br/><br/>That brings me to the Deputy's question on the opt-out system.  My understanding is that the UK, even if it is not a member state of the EU anymore, has a possibility for opt-out in the context of its competition appeal tribunal.  The benefit of that opt-out system, and there is one, is that many of these cases may be settled, and a settlement is generally better in that it avoids the litigation costs.  If an opt-out class action case is settled, then the entire action has been settled.  It does have that efficiency option.</p><p>If an opt-in action is settled, there may still be others remaining outside of that tent that will come after you again.  There are benefits and arguments on either front.  However, it is clear in the heads that the Department is going for the opt-in process.</p><p> I cannot say I know anything about the funding in Quebec.  I know the funding in the UK is significant third-party funding.  A wave of consumer collective actions has been taking place in the two years since the UK Supreme Court took a lenient assessment on certification.  Those actions are being backed by large funding, effectively venture funds which will take some of the profit from those actions if they win.</p></speech>

I will start by asking them their opinion on why the Government has adopted such a narrow approach to qualified entities.  What is their attitude to whether the Government should have gone further, in particular on the question of the possibility of <i>ad hoc</i>designation.  It is clear in the directive that for domestic actions, member states could allow qualified entities on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis.  My assumption in terms of what that would look like &ndash; I could be wrong, so I am interested in the guests describing it to me &ndash; is that an issue could emerge where, for example, a bunch of apartment owners across the State affected by the same issue want to take an action against a designated construction company, builder or whatever, and they form an association.  There would then be some process whereby the State would determine that the association is a designated or qualified entity that can pursue an action on that basis.  Is that what is meant in that regard?  Do the witnesses have an opinion on why the Government has opted to take a much narrower approach by applying what is set out in the directive as the rule for cross-border actions to domestic actions as well?  Should that be expanded?  Our guests need not all rush at once to respond.</p></speech>

Again, I do not want to be Mr. Preamble, as it were, but I will read out preamble 24, which takes into account the Deputy&rsquo;s issue.  As I said, the preambles are the philosophy.  Preamble 24 states:</p> <blockquote> 	Consumer organisations in particular should play an active role in ensuring the relevant provisions of [European] law are complied with.  They should all be considered well placed to apply for status of qualified entity in accordance with national law.  Depending on national legal traditions, public bodies could also play an active role in ensuring that relevant provisions of the Union law are complied with... </blockquote> <p>Regarding &ldquo;public bodies&rdquo;, we have brought up the possibility of the CCCP being involved in some way through a memorandum of understanding.  Looking at the preamble and then Article 4(3), it specifies those bodies or NGOs that have public activity in the protection of consumer interests.  The Department correctly has gone down that line because that is the philosophy behind it.<br/><br/>What the Deputy and I are asking is that the Minister possibly open the doors a little bit through the ministerial regulations.  However, as the consumers&rsquo; association in Ireland, we would like this to be kept to bodies that are protecting consumers&rsquo; interests.  If the Deputy looks at the long list of legislation at the back of the document, it is all consumer protection legislation.</p></speech>

It is important then that the Bill does not facilitate a compensation culture and vexatious litigation.  A question was asked earlier about the impact on insurance costs.  There must be a balance to make sure cases are taken when there is a genuine grievance rather than on a speculative basis.  Subject to this, there may be cases in which an association formed for the purposes of a narrow issue that did not meet all of the criteria for a general purpose qualified entity might be designated.  We would not be opposed to that.</p></speech>

It goes back to the difficulties that would arise if a real US-style class action culture took root.  It is taking root across Europe now.  It is taking root in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.  The example I used in my paper was to illustrate the challenges in getting the balance right.  The Wendy's case has been held up as a pin-up of excessive and abusive shakedown-type litigation in which the harm is imperceptibly low.  At the same time, it is also being held up as a case where a food lawyer sought to vindicate the rights of those who had been injured.  The Law Society is saying we should not rush into anything because law has a tendency to evolve beyond its original intention.  A cautious approach is not necessarily a bad one.  At the same time, I reiterate the possibility of implementing the reforms spoken about and reflected in a Private Members' Bill, which are also reasonably cautious and balanced.  They allow for a fairly comprehensive and strict legal test to be applied in the case of certification.  It is the certification point in the US that is very lenient.</p></speech>

I will jump off from this issue of direct access to multiparty actions.  The Consumer Association of Ireland stressed in its opening statement that it is not looking for this and that it does not want it and is not in favour of it.  What is so bad about giving people direct access to taking cases together?  It is often spun that there is a culture in the US of people taking vexatious claims.  There is the classic case of the woman getting burned by the coffee in McDonald's.  However McDonald's knew the coffee was dangerously hot and the woman suffered third degree burns.  It was spun to make it look bad but in a country where things are balanced very much in favour of business against ordinary people the ability of US consumers to take class action suits rebalances them a little bit.  What is the downside of direct access?</p></speech>

I highlight this because the two things are being mixed together.  The Law Society has its views on multiparty actions, as does the Deputy.  I am a lawyer and that is great.  We are speaking about a particular directive that introduces the right for consumers to take representative actions.</p><p> I will highlight to the Deputy the kind of action I would be hoping to do.  Last weekend Aer Lingus obviously had some difficulties at the airport.  That is covered under EU legislation and maybe the airline will compensate people in the correct way, but there could be people who will not be compensated correctly.  That is something I would hope a certain number of consumers would come forward about and there would be a representative action.  I am aware the issue is that such an action could go the High Court, so you are immediately into a very difficult area.  Possibly, however, even just taking representative action involving so many consumers or whatever would make the trader, in this case Aer Lingus, negotiate because it does not want to go down this route and will instead put its hands up and say "Yes".  That, in a way, is what we want to do.</p><p> There will be some cases that may go to the High Court if they are for &euro;75,000 or more.  The Deputy knows himself how tedious and long that can be and all the documentation involved, so it is not a quick process.  We would have preferred, even with the directive or whatever, something at a lower level.  In some member states this is done via administrative courts.  Parties can go to an administrative court and have a little ruling and then they go to the other court about compensation or whatever.  However, we are were where we are and that is why we would like the directive to be transposed and in line with that.  Multiparty actions might help consumers in the long run but-----</p></speech>

In its submission A&amp;amp;L Goodbody said:</p> <blockquote> 	It is important for consumer-facing businesses to note that the system proposed is likely to be partially retrospective &ndash; so breaches of consumer law that occur even before the system is implemented in June 2023 may form the basis for claims under the new system, subject only to the time limits imposed by the Statute of Limitations. </blockquote> <p>Should traders and others be gearing up for this?  As we speak there could be activities occurring that come under this new legislation even before it is implemented.  It is an interesting point that people may not know about.  I made the point, which comes up again further on here, that insurance costs may rise because of this.  It would be an unwelcome development but is something we should keep an eye on and perhaps discuss as well to ensure it is limited to the maximum because insurance is having a massive impact on businesses.  That indirectly falls on consumers because of higher costs.</p></speech>

What would be what we call a disproportionate impact on insurance is if we ended up with effectively vexatious actions, or nuisance actions, that people felt they had to settle as it was cheaper to settle them than fight them in court, so it is important that balance is struck, and the mechanisms in the Bill strike that balance adequately.</p> <p>  I do not have a view on retrospection.  Whenever anyone says "retrospection", I always think there are legal issues about retrospection, and perhaps the Law Society may have a view.  Of course, if people have breached consumer law, they will certainly be at risk of public bodies enforcing the obligations.  Where those obligations include payments of compensation, they can be enforced by public bodies anyway.</p><p>Of course the real message to businesses is that they should comply with the law and then they will not need to worry about whether anyone can take retrospective action.</p></speech>

Mr. Godfrey said that in some cases, enforcement can deliver compensation to consumers.  Where does that interact with a class of people who might be affected by something?  If an individual takes an action and wins the case, does it require a qualified entity to take a case on behalf of a group of consumers who are similarly aggrieved, or does that individual's success knock on to all the consumers who are in a similar category?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  The second question relates to what Mr. Jewell said about people starting in a low court.  If a person has a victory in a low court but obviously only took the worst case, has the risk been considerably narrowed for a qualified entity taking a case for a much wider class of people for whom the same evidence effectively applies?  What is the dynamic of that process?</p></speech>

The approach that has been taken in other member states involves trying to understand the potential costs of funding a group action or collective action through the courts, usually the equivalent of our High Court.  Several methods have been flagged.  One method involves taking an initial case on an opt-out basis, which means that they take a case to a lower court, present it and see what comes from it.  Another method involves taking a case on behalf of a pocketful of their members and seeing what the position is.  This is done to inform their legal advisers on how to proceed, what the timeframe and the costs are potentially going to be, and the depths to which they will have to invest to take a full class action, certainly if it is going to be a cross-border action.</p></speech>

The annex refers to 60 pieces of legislation and they are all different.  As they all involve different public bodies, one answer probably does not apply to all of the pieces of legislation.  Broadly speaking, when enforcement action is taken, sometimes the trader concerned settles the case.  As part of that settlement, the trader might agree to pay compensation to all the affected consumers, which means there is no need for follow-on action.  In other cases, there might be enforcement action.  It can be the case that the obligation is to pay compensation.  I refer, for example, to statutory amounts of compensation for delayed flights.  The consumer rights Bill proposes to introduce a requirement for refunds in some circumstances, or price reductions in appropriate circumstances.  If a trader is not complying with those obligations, the enforcement action can order them to comply with those obligations.  It is all quite complicated because there are different enforcement mechanisms for different pieces of legislation.</p><p>An order to comply with an obligation to pay compensation might obviate the need for follow-on class action.  There are other mechanisms in the legislation for which the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, is responsible.  One sometimes sees compensation orders on foot of a criminal conviction, for example.  There are a number of different routes that might result in consumers getting redress without needing a representative action.    </p></speech>

The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  I invite the Ministers to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

I will begin by briefly outlining the economic and budgetary context for the budget.  This is a challenging and deeply uncertain period for our economy.  Over the past several years, we have found ourselves facing a series of shocks, including Brexit, a pandemic and the consequences of a war.  The pandemic that dominated our lives for two years has receded, and I think it is important we do not lose sight of the fact that, even with the challenges we are facing, we have recovered with remarkable speed and strength.  The strength of the recovery is driven by two factors: the resilience of the Irish people and the success of the budgetary and economic policy of the Government over the past two years.  During the pandemic, the Government made available resources in the region of one fifth of national income to protect households, businesses and our health throughout the crisis.  That was the appropriate response, and it laid the foundation for a robust and broad recovery.</p> <p>  For a brief period at the start of this year, the prospects for the economy appeared to be bright.  However, we are now confronting the consequences of the war on Ukraine.  It has changed the economic situation and outlook, with this being most evident in the changes in energy and commodity pricing.  The reduction in purchasing power that has taken place due to this change in pricing will dampen consumer spend over the coming quarters, with the risk of increased uncertainty and weaker external demand affecting investment decisions by employers.  As a result, my Department is revising its projection for growth in our economy next year in the budget.  We will make a downward revision, which I will confirm today fortnight.  However, there are many positive signs in our economy.  Due to the reasons I outlined, our jobs market has made a remarkable recovery over the past two years, with 2.5 million people in employment in the second quarter, the highest level on record, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% recorded in August.  We are, therefore, facing into these challenges from a good starting point.</p> <p>  However, it is also clear that the cost of living is the most immediate and urgent challenge facing our country, households and businesses.  Of course, it is not the only issue that we will have to contend with.  That is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have said that budget 2023 will focus on the cost of living, with further interventions aimed to help.  However, I emphasise to the committee that in drafting this budget we do have a particular responsibility to strike a balance.  We have to provide help to those who need it, but without making inflationary problems here at home even worse.  As a Government, we have an important role to play in limiting the impact of the current price shock.  We know that.  However, as we have seen from many other countries, there are limits to what any one Government can do to address the effects of global pressures outside of our direct control.   As we remember from the 1970s and other points, trying to respond back and overreacting to some of the challenges of inflation can result in far bigger and more structural problems in the longer term. </p> <p>  I will now turn to the fiscal position, as it currently stands.  At the end of last month, tax revenues stood at almost &euro;50 billion, up by more than &euro;10 billion on the same period last year.  Income tax continues to perform well, and reflects the resilience of our labour market and the success of Government policy.  The strong performance of VAT receipts confirms the rebound in consumer spending once public health restrictions were lifted.  However, it should be noted that much of the surge in tax revenue that we have seen take place across the year is due to particular increases in corporate tax, which amounted to nearly &euro;12 billion to end of August.  My officials expect these receipts to top &euro;20 billion this year.  This is an enormous figure.  To put it in context, a decade ago receipts from the corporate sector amounted to approximately &euro;4 billion.  These receipts are a reflection of our success, but, as the Government and the committee will recall, I have frequently warned that this is an extremely unreliable revenue stream that could be volatile in the future.  The surge in corporate tax revenues is concentrated among a small handful of firms.  To put it bluntly, the future growth of corporate tax receipts is not a one-way bet.  Positive headline figures can, as a result, serve to obscure real challenges and vulnerabilities in our public finances in the medium term.</p><p>With this in mind, my Department last week published a range of corporate tax loss methodologies, and we will publish an alternative measure of the fiscal position that includes estimates of windfall corporation tax receipts.</p><p> In the summer economic statement, the Government set out our parameters for the budgetary strategy for 2023.  Our total budget package for next year stands at &euro;6.7 billion.  As the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I have confirmed, a set of one-off measures will be provided this year.  One of my main objectives in this budget will be to do what I can to try to help workers so that they do not find themselves in a position where they pay more income tax solely because of wage changes.  For future years, we will stay within the parameters of the medium-term budgetary strategy set out last year.  However, the Government believes that the parameters outlined earlier this year are appropriate, given the significant change in pricing.</p><p> This is a challenging time.  We have once again found ourselves facing an unforeseen economic shock.  We in government are very much aware that many are struggling to make ends meet as we approach a difficult winter.  However, there are also reasons for hope.  Employment is now at record levels and our public finances are back on the road to sustainability, giving us the ability in this budget to help on a significant scale with the cost of living challenge.  We have shown time and again over the past two years that we will act when necessary to protect households and businesses to the extent that we believe is affordable and sustainable and does not create other risks in future.  We will aim to continue with this approach in the forthcoming budget.</p></speech>

Since we last appeared before the committee in July, there have been a number of developments that impact on our budgetary considerations.</p> <p>  As inflation continues to rise in the short term, my Government colleagues and I are cognisant of the financial impact and strain that this places on people, businesses and wider society.  Consequently, we have deployed a number of measures over the past year to reduce the inflationary burden on households.  Budget 2022 set out a &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures across a range of sectors to assist with the cost of living pressures.  These measures included increases in weekly social protection payments, the fuel allowance and the working family payment, social and affordable housing funding, health affordability measures, and enhanced student and childcare supports.  Since December 2021, more than &euro;500 million of additional expenditure measures have been put in place to support citizens facing increased costs.  These included the electricity credit of &euro;200 for all domestic account holders, a 20% average fare reduction for public transport services until the end of this year and additional fuel allowance payments, just to name a few examples.</p> <p>  The Government is committed to continue doing its part to assist households and businesses in the face of a rising cost of living.  This is the key objective framing budget discussions.  The urgency of this task underpinned the Government's decision to bring forward budget day to 27 September.  We will seek to ease the burden for lower and middle-income families in particular who are facing difficult choices.  As ever, we will balance the need to provide supports while ensuring that we do not add to inflationary pressures.  Discussions are now under way as part of the Estimates process to introduce targeted, impactful measures capable of timely implementation, including in quarter 4 of this year.  A comprehensive package will be announced on 27 September.</p> <p>  A vital piece of the jigsaw for budget 2023 is public sector pay, which accounts for one third of total current expenditure.  I am pleased that proposals have now been agreed to extend the current public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, to the end of 2023.  Of course, it is subject to ratification, which we do not take for granted.  Subject to that approval, the proposals will see a 3% increase in pay for public sector workers backdated to 2 February 2022, a 2% increase from 1 March 2023 and a further 1.5%, or a minimum increase of &euro;750, from 1 October 2023.  This is in addition to the 1% increase provided on 1 February of this year and the further 1%, or &euro;500, due on 1 October 2022 that were agreed under the original Building Momentum agreement.  In total, the adjustments provided for in 2022 amount to 5% for the majority of public servants.</p> <p>  I believe that the proposed pay increases strike the right balance between providing a deal that is fair to public servants in the midst of cost-of-living challenges and one that is sustainable and affordable for the taxpayer.  It is important to invest in our public service workforce to attract and retain the staff we need to deliver quality front-line services for a growing population.  If the proposed agreement is ratified, it will enable the Government to move quickly to alleviate some of the impact of inflation on our public service workers as well as secure industrial peace.  Under the proposed agreement, the benefits for those on lower levels of pay will again be higher than the headline percentage increases.</p> <p>  I will reiterate the Government&rsquo;s budget 2023 strategy, as discussed at this committee in July.  The budget will see an expenditure ceiling of &euro;90.3 billion and core spending next year will reach &euro;85.8 billion.  This significant overall level of resources will enable continued investment in the quality of life in Ireland and support a strong, fair and equal society into the future.  As set out in the summer economic statement, this will provide for an expenditure budgetary package of &euro;5.7 billion over 2022 and 2023.  This is an increase of &euro;1.7 billion relative to what was originally provided for in the medium-term expenditure strategy.  This temporary adjustment balances the need to protect core public services while ensuring that budgetary policy does not become part of the inflation problem.  It is important to ensure that our approach is responsive to the challenging economic environment that many face but also fiscally sustainable.</p> <p>  Approximately 3% of the core current expenditure base will be available to meet existing levels of service.  This includes continued investment in the public sector workforce, as set out in existing Building Momentum pay deal, as the delivery mechanism for a wide range of critical services; funding for demographic developments, including supporting a growing population and the changing profile of our citizens; and the full-year impact of measures from budget 2022, which are being implemented on a phased basis.</p> <p>  Capital expenditure will increase by a further &euro;800 million next year.  Overall core capital investment will reach some &euro;11.7 billion in 2023, with an additional &euro;200 million as part of the national recovery and resilience plan.  This represents an increase of 7%, which in line with the National Development Plan 2021-2030.  This funding will provide for vital investment across sectors such as health, education and transport while also delivering progress towards our ambitious climate goals.  The remaining amount - some &euro;2.7 billion - will be available for new current expenditure measures across 2022 and 2023.  The recently proposed extension to the Building Momentum public sector pay deal will account for approximately &euro;1.4 billion of this amount, comprising pay and associated pension costs.</p> <p>  Other new measures, such as social protection supports and other Government commitments in respect of housing, education, health and so on, will be announced on budget day.  As always, this will require appropriate prioritisation of the numerous demands across a range of sectors.</p> <p>  The Government is providing &euro;4.5 billion in non-core expenditure for temporary measures.  This approach facilitates responsive fiscal policy, which can provide supports to key emerging issues while protecting day-to-day expenditure and investment.  This expenditure will provide humanitarian supports for displaced persons arriving from Ukraine, more limited Covid-19 provision in respect of the continued response to the effects of the pandemic, and enable us to respond to Brexit.</p> <p>  Each year on budget day, attention is primarily focused on new current expenditure measures and increases in funding that are necessary to maintain existing levels of service.  While these changes in expenditure are important, the vast majority of public expenditure supports the provision of ongoing current expenditure and capital investment.</p><p>It is important to keep sight of the totality of public spending and ensure that the overall level of expenditure remains affordable over the longer term and delivers sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  The Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2022, published by my Department in July, provides further detail on the different processes for effective measurement of outcomes.  These processes, including the well-being framework, green, equality and gender budgeting, and the spending review processes are examples of how we can improve the evidence base to support ongoing improvements in public services.</p><p> In less than two weeks' time I will bring forward a spending package, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe will bring forward a taxation package, that seek to address the inflationary challenges we are now facing while also providing for investment in our economy, our public services and our critical public infrastructure.  The budget will balance the need to provide supports to the most vulnerable now with investing in the future of our economy and our society.  While fiscal policy must be responsive, we must maintain a focus on long-term priorities, investing in quality of life in Ireland through our public services. </p></speech>

I will begin with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  The Minister will be aware that the committee wrote to him on two occasions asking him to publish the White Paper on revenue and expenditure.  It is usually published on the Friday before the budget.  There is no legal impediment to publish it before that.  Given that we will not have the September fiscal monitor given the date of the budget, and that the August fiscal monitor was available at the start of this month, why did the Minister refuse the request of the committee?</p></speech>

The committee said that we want the information beforehand.  There is no legal impediment to this and all the information that goes into it is available to the Minister.  The committee asked that the Minister would bring it forward.</p></speech>

That will be incorporated and made available to the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity.  From working with my officials, I am assured that the earliest opportunity I can make that available is next Friday, which I will do.</p></speech>

I wish to ask the Minister, Deputy McGrath, about the contingency fund that was allocated in budget 2022, where &euro;7.5 billion was allocated to non-core expenditure.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council advises that some &euro;2.5 billion of that is unallocated and that if decisions are not made in the budget, for example to do once-off spending between now and the end of the year, it would still remain.  Is that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#C00800"><p>The position at present is that we have some &euro;3.7 billion unallocated, but in a sense that is a technical term because as the year goes on and as we approach the end point of this year, we will be allocating much of that expenditure to different Votes across government that have been incurring expenditure.  We are, of course, doing an assessment as to how much of that will be fully utilised.  It will have to meet a wide range of needs, including Covid expenditure across the health service this year, Ukraine-related expenditure, which is growing all the time at a significant rate, and also the cost-of-living measures that we have brought forward as a Government that would not have been provided in the original budgetary framework in 2022.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#C00900"><p>Of course, but in the absence of further cost-of-living measures to be announced in the budget, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said that &euro;2.5 billion is likely to remain unallocated because they recognise that of the &euro;3.7 billion more will be spent on Covid and there will be a bit more spent on the Ukrainian-related crisis.  Is that the ballpark we are in at this point in time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#C01000"><p>We are continuing to work through that.  Consider the end of August expenditure returns; we are about &euro;1 billion over profile on the current side alone.  This is because we have not allocated against the different Votes' funding from that particular contingency provision.  If one adds to that additional expenditure that will occur from 1 September to the end of this year in respect of Ukraine, we are facing into the autumn and winter period in health where there will be a need for additional Covid-related expenditure.  There will be a very significant drawdown of that funding.  I do not believe that the amount of unallocated resources from that contingency will be as high as the Deputy is suggesting or attributing to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We are continuing to work through that.  I cannot give a final figure at this point.  We still have a number of months to go in the year but we are assessing it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#C01200"><p>Going back to the summer economic statement, on the non-core side there is an overall amount of &euro;4.5 billion.  For the purposes of the summer economic statement we put a figure of &euro;3 billion next to that.  We are now assessing the allocation of that &euro;4.5 billion across the different elements.  It is likely that there will be some change but still within the overall &euro;4.5 billion.  It could well be the case, for example, that the provision for Ukraine-related expenditure might be less than &euro;3 billion.  I would expect that the provision for Covid-related expenditure would possibly need to be higher than the amount provided for in the summer economic statement.  It will all be within the overall non-core provision of &euro;4.5 billion.  It is still consistent with the overall framework.</p></speech>

The expenditure on the Ukrainian crisis seems to be significantly inflated.  The &euro;3 billion figure is more likely to be a &euro;2 billion figure.</p></speech>

We will consider what is the appropriate allocation within those different areas under non-core.  There is a lag in respect of incurring some of the Ukraine-related costs.  It is increasing significantly.  The Deputy is aware of the pressures the system is under with regard to accommodation.  New commitments have been entered into-----</p></speech>

The 100,000 people are not here and they are unlikely to come unless there is a huge wave.  It was a big estimation.  We never knew at the start but it seems that as time goes on it needs to be revised downward.</p></speech>

We are approaching 50,000 people and we are only at the midpoint of September.  It is difficult to know what direction the war will take and what impact that will have on international migration from Ukraine.  It is prudent to have a good provision there.  I am signalling that it is likely we will be in a position to reallocate, probably more to Covid-related expenditure with some reduction in the Ukraine-related expenditure.  We are doing an ongoing assessment of that, in particular with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is doing a lot of the heavy lifting in relation to accommodation.</p></speech>

We are currently evaluating what would be the right kind of intervention and what would give the most help to households and businesses.  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, and I are working on what the duration of that support would be.

Okay.  Hypothetically, if a credit was to be paid out in 2023, which the Government is talking about or is being floated, it would be outside the parameters of the summer economic statement because it would be deemed a once-off.

On the windfall tax measures being discussed and to be agreed at European level after the budget, have calculations been done on the impact they would have, particularly the cap on non-gas production of energy which would take in wind farms and so on?

Maybe the chief economist can give us some back of the envelope figures to help steer us.

In bringing forward the budget we are not relying on any particular sum of money that we expect to receive.  We are saying that any additional revenues received by Ireland will be used to help people, households and businesses.  It would not be fair of us to give an estimate that we cannot stand over at this point.  That is a straight answer to that question.</p> <p>  On the second question, the Deputy knows the answer.  It is a matter for the party leaders.  There will be plenty of time after the budget for them to discuss all these issues and come to final decisions.</p></speech>

They always make themselves open and available to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, for which we are very grateful.  I know it is an obligation but it is always good to see them here.</p> <p>  Returning to what Deputy Doherty said, his notion that we may have under-budgeted for the Ukrainian situation is like suggesting that Covid is out of the way.  We need to be very prudent and cautious on that.  Last week, when the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Nevin Economic Research Institute, IBEC and the ESRI were before the committee, I made the point that none of them, in giving a background or context to the budgetary preparations, mentioned the weaponising of energy by Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.  It is important to note that this provides the bulk of the context of the energy price increases and cost-of-living challenges that we face.  We need to keep making that connection for the public.  Once that connection is lost, so too will be the solidarity built up around welcoming refugees and accommodating, schooling and employing them.  There are up to 50,000 Ukrainian refugees and reflecting the very generous response by Irish people and the solidarity they have shown is very important.  The weaponising of energy by Russia is central to everything we are discussing today.</p> <p>  I congratulate both Ministers on the employment figures.  The recovery of the economy and the manner in which the Government dealt with Covid can be understated and forgotten about because there is such a tumult and a complexity of issues facing the world.  They should not be forgotten.  I came from a Webnet event for women held in Tallaght today.  Of 180 participants, 104 are now self-employed having started up businesses.  The initiative is supported by the Government and the EU.  This is just a snapshot of some of the incredible things that are taking place.  Unemployment has been eliminated and is at its lowest level ever.</p> <p>  This leads me to a point I want to make to the Minister for Finance.  Some businesses are doing exceptionally well.  There is a facility for gift tax.  There is an opportunity in the budget, which I mentioned to my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Businesses have contacted me and some of them can afford to assist employees through the cost-of-living crisis.  The tax-free limit on gifts is &euro;500.  If businesses want to make a once-off gift to their staff at Christmas or in the run-up to it, we should encourage that where possible.  These are not cash gifts and they would have to be spent in particular areas.  I ask the Minister for Finance to look favourably on this proposal as it would allow successful companies, which do not need to be large, to show largesse to their employees.</p> <p>  On fuel prices, petrol has come down from a height of &euro;2.18 to &euro;1.83 per litre, which is the price I saw on my way to Mullingar recently.  The Government is committed to the supports that were implemented on petrol and diesel until the end of October.  What is the Minister's thinking on that now? </p></speech>

I know it is a matter in which he is interested.  It is the case that some parts of the economy and some firms are doing well and are in a position to support their employees.  We will give consideration to the Deputy's point.</p> <p>  There has been a moderation of our worst fears about diesel and petrol prices but even in the &euro;1.80 to &euro;1.90 bracket, they are still higher than they were before the economic effects of the war began to be felt at the pump.  I have not made a decision with the Government on the extension of those particular measures.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I are discussing these matters with our party leaders and we will draw that discussion to a close in a couple of weeks.  However, I make the point that even though fuel prices are lower than what we feared would be the peak, they are still significantly higher than the more normal price people were used to paying at the pump in the early part of this year.</p></speech>

I will throw out a couple of examples and then move to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not have many examples of these in my constituency but there is one complex run on a district heating basis.  The fuel provider is purchasing the energy.  The electricity bill for December 2020 and January 2021 was &euro;350.  A letter has been written indicating that the energy bill for December 2022 and January 2023, based on the cost of purchasing the energy from the fuel provider, could be up to &euro;1,400.  I am not an advocate for the hotels industry but I will give an example.</p><p>I have seen the invoices for these hotels.  A large hotel in the country faces an increase in its energy bill up to &euro;809,000 over a ten month period, which is simply unsustainable.  We all have examples of that.  If something is completely unsustainable, how far is the Government prepared to go to assist?  Back in 1992, when we faced devaluation but had not devalued, the Government led by Albert Reynolds stepped in with significant grants to industry, particularly exporters, which were facing issues.  Has the Government plans in that field?</p></speech>

I know the same is true of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe's party colleagues.  They raised many examples across the country of three-fold, four-fold and even five-fold increases in energy costs for businesses, which are out of line with even the steep increases that households have had to endure.  I think that is partly due to the nature of the contracts and the arrangements that they have in place with their providers.  Once they come out of contract, they are faced with a hefty increase in the per unit charge.  All I can say at this remove is that we are deeply conscious of the impact of that extraordinary energy inflation on businesses.  They are also facing rising costs across a number of other areas.  The most severe and impactful increase is undoubtedly in relation to energy prices.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, outlined the progress that we have made on jobs, which the Deputy has acknowledged.  Having seen such a recovery in the economy and having seen the number of people at work reach a record high watermark in Ireland's history, we are determined to do all that we can to help viable businesses to survive.  Of course there is a limit to what we can do.  We cannot fully offset all of the increases for businesses in the same way that we cannot for many households.  We have to be honest with people and acknowledge that.  I can say that work is actively ongoing across all of the main Departments that the Deputy would expect to be involved, to assess the best and most effective way to support the businesses that are in most need.  We will bring forward that response on budget day.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I, the T&aacute;naiste and others are directly engaging on specific issues.  We expect to come to final decisions in the next ten to 12 days.</p></speech>

One is for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There are some groups which are more vulnerable than others.  I am thinking of community groups and schemes, where the grants and subventions that they get from Government are being eaten up.  I am thinking of block grants.  The Taoiseach mentioned heating bills for schools, so the Minister will be aware of that.  I know where the Minister's heart is.  I am advocating for them, so that notice and attention is given to the fact that they may have received a certain amount which would have covered the cost in a normal year, but the increase in energy costs is eating into their daily running costs, and I ask the Minister to take account of that.  This Government has been exceptional in its sports capital investment and I am thinking of such projects.  Many clubs around the country are finding that construction costs have increased so much that the sports capital grant they received is, in one case, barely covering the VAT of the original cost.  Is that feeding into the Minister's thinking?</p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister for Finance.  We have done much work and received a lot of information from witnesses about the index-linking of social protection payments and measures.  What is the Minister's view on that and how is that informing him in the run-up to budget day?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#E00400"><p>I would be the first to acknowledge that the impact of inflation is across the board.  Public services that I would be seeking to agree a budget for in the next couple of weeks include the cost of running our schools, which the Deputy touched on, hospitals, public transport systems and food, which is so important in different parts of our public service.  All of these costs have increased.  It puts pressure on what we call ELS, or protecting existing levels of service.  We have made provision for 3%.  Line Departments are now presenting their estimates of what actual costs will be next year based on the level of inflation.  We have to work through all of that in the best way that we possibly can.  I am conscious that there is an impact on sports clubs and community groups.  We will consider that issue and take it into account over the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>  The Deputy has acknowledged the record allocation for sports funding.  It is the largest ever, at &euro;150 million.  I will engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to ensure there is a funding stream in future and a new round of sports funding can be opened up.  We get great value for money from the scheme, notwithstanding the construction inflation.  I believe that investing in sport is the best place to spend money, especially in grassroots sport.  We will work in a positive way with the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, on that.</p></speech>

He will work with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on it.  We are both aware of the value of indexation, whether for taxation or social welfare payments for those who need and deserve additional help.  We are also looking to see how or if we can deliver that inside the constraints of the competing demands that we have at the moment.  It will be the subject of much work for both of us in the next two weeks.</p></speech>

We all wish them well in their endeavours over the next couple of weeks.  I have a couple of pieces of advice from somebody who was around.  I was not a Member of this House in the 1970s.  A strange thing that happened with energy in the 1970s was that the supply slowed to nothing.  There were queues at garages all over the country.  People borrowed cans to collect fuel and so on.  It was totally unsatisfactory.  The point I am making is that the situation needs to be monitored carefully to ensure that we do not find ourselves back in that situation.</p> <p>  Another matter requires constant attention.  In an inflationary situation, I accept that it is necessary to support the economy, but paying the household bills cannot go on forever.  It will not work and has never worked before.  I will debate that subject with anybody.  I am not suggesting that it is the intention, but I am saying that care needs to be taken.  It is like a merry-go-round.  Once one gets on that merry-go-round, one cannot get off except under special circumstances.</p> <p>  The last point I want to make is that the Ministers will get advice from every quarter, including from all around the table here.  We will advise the Ministers about how they should proceed.  I have heard some advice from the Commission on Taxation and Welfare in the last couple of weeks.  If the Ministers want to make themselves really unpopular, follow that lead.  People in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s paid interest rates of 17% or 18% on their mortgages, tried to educate their kids at the same time, paid tax at the high rates, and bailed out their kids when they did not have a deposit for a house in the 1990s, then found themselves under threat of eviction after all that.</p><p>My advice, for what it is worth, is that if the Ministers want to become unpopular with people in that age group and their sons and daughters, by all means they should penalise them for doing what they did when they did - for providing themselves with homes they hope to hand over to their kids.  For the State to intervene and grab what it can, even though taxation was paid on all those salaries and borrowings, is not advisable.  I thank the Chairperson for letting me in and my learned colleague can and no doubt will take over where I left off.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#F00300"><p>I will make a brief response to the points aimed at me.  I confirmed earlier today at a public event where I launched the report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare that I will not be bringing to the Government proposals in relation to inheritance.  I have made that clear.  I respect and recognise the work that the commission has done.  It is a 500-page report containing over 100 recommendations and plenty of things with which I am confident Deputy Durkan would agree, but it needs proper time to evaluate and discuss it.  I am well aware of the equity issues and the matters the Deputy referred to.  I want to give him a clear indication in relation to that.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I are keenly aware of the need to be able to fund what we are doing beyond a month or two and into the years to come.  That is a big factor in our thinking regarding what we do in the time ahead, while also recognising there are many people who need help at the moment.  The note of optimism I would strike concerns where we were during Covid and the range and breadth of the support programmes we had in place.  So many times it looked unlikely that we would ever not have an EWSS, PUP or Covid restrictions support scheme.  They are all gone now because we were able to make the right decision on the size of the programmes when they were needed and then get out of them at the right time, which we could stand over.  I believe we will get to the same point with our measures but it is a difficult journey for people, given how hard it is at the moment.  That is why we want to help.  </p> <p>  The Government is very aware of the question of supply.  In the coming days, the Government statement on energy security will be published for public consultation and feedback.  We are taking steps in the interim to fortify ourselves against the challenges.  That is why it is excellent news that the European Commission has confirmed that gas storage facilities for the EU as a whole are above 80%, where they would be normally.  That is an exceptional achievement by the European Union and its member states in the context of the threat made against us earlier in the year.</p></speech>

I am stealing the same question I asked then.  IFAC estimated that the Government's revenue for 2022 will be &euro;3.5 billion higher than forecast in the July summer economic statement.  It stated that a surplus of &euro;4.5 billion for 2022 is achievable, whereas the summer economic statement projected a surplus of &euro;1.2 billion.  That is a differential of &euro;3.3 billion.  The Minister for Finance referred to parameters under the summer economic statement.  What latitude does that &euro;3.3 billion differential provide to the Ministers, in framing the budget, for once-off measures in 2022?  The Minister for Finance said there is &euro;3.7 billion unallocated from the continuity fund this year.  Some of that will go towards overspend in various Departments.  There is &euro;3.3 billion, effectively of corporation tax receipts, which are questionable in terms of their certainty into the future.</p> <p>  I am talking about targeting for energy costs.  We have businesses, such as supermarkets and hotels, across the range getting excessive bills.  They are up three and four times.  Households are having the same issue.  What level of the &euro;3.7 million that is currently unspent do the Ministers see being available to them, on top of the &euro;3.3. billion in unexpected corporation tax, to provide once-off measures?  It is about framing a budget.  The &euro;3.3 billion on top of the &euro;6.7 billion announced to date in the summer economic statement comes to around &euro;10 billion.  We are in a wartime situation with energy costs.  What scope does that &euro;3.3 billion provide the Ministers for once-off measures in 2022?  What will be the total once-off measures in 2022?  I am not embedding it in core spending; quite the reverse.  We are in a wartime situation regarding energy costs and must bring business through, as we did during Covid.  I asked this specific question of IFAC and ask it of both Ministers.</p> <p>  Then I have a follow-up question for the Minister for Finance on &euro;1.05 billion in taxation provided for in the summer economic statement.</p></speech>

IFAC also warned us about the need to get the balance right between them being affordable beyond 2022 and not adding to inflation.  We are keenly aware - and the Deputy has acknowledged this in his question - of the possibility of finding ourselves in a world undergoing a further and prolonged energy shock.  That affects the profitability of very large companies, which in turn affects the corporate tax they pay.  We do not want to be in a situation where we get a double hit, one where we see corporate tax revenue begin to go down while at the same time we need to fund important measures.</p><p>If I could tell the Deputy this evening what the figures are with regard to the scale of interventions for this year, or any of the decisions the Government will make, the budget would be announced this evening.

However, we have had an unusual event where we have this surplus unexplained corporation tax.  The question is about what use we put it to.  In the environment we are in now, businesses are under such incredible pressure.  The question for me is whether we get better value in the overall economy by ensuring they can come through by way of once-off measures rather than, we will say, using that money instead to repay the national debt.  That is the question I am posing.</p></speech>

It is a fundamental one but we also have to be conscious that this period of very high levels of energy costs may not be very shortlived.  That is a reality the Government must also take into account.  However, it is a good thing that we are in a situation where the actual outturn for the year, the surplus, will be better than we predicted back in July in the summer economic statement.  Exactly where it will land remains to be seen but it is a better position to be able to use at least some of that than to have to borrow for a package of one-off measures and add to the national debt.  We need to be careful overall, however.</p></speech>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made a reference that Europe will not have the decision made on the detail of decoupling in terms of energy costs and the level of funds will come back to Ireland.  The Minister is giving a commitment, really, that this decision will be post budget, and that we may have a situation where further measures may be announced on energy post budget that are directly related to the share-out of windfall taxes in Europe.  I am assuming that is a commitment.</p> <p>  My second point is for the Minister for Finance.  A figure of &euro;1.05 billion is being put aside for taxation measures.  Does the Minister anticipate that changing in the budget?  Will that be the level to which they will come?  Has the Minister an idea of the general parameters around how he will frame that?</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, dealt with the energy costs earlier.  Am I correct that there could be, dare I say it, a separate measure very soon after the budget and on top of the budget specifically dealing with the outcome of the extra supports that come from Europe based on the structures that are being put in place at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.493" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#G00800"><p>Yes.  I will just restate that we are not relying on any particular sum of revenue from any EU initiatives that we are baking into our budgetary position.  The revenues that will be derived from its final decisions as applied to Ireland can be given back to people in a number of different ways.  It could be directly through network charges, for example, or it could come back by way of payments whereby Government might decide to use that revenue and administer it back to energy users.</p></speech>

We are working on the basis of the information we have.  I think it is important to make that commitment, however.  We do not wish to use any revenues we receive from those initiatives to enhance the fiscal position of the State.  The purpose of raising those revenues is to help people struggling with energy costs and to help businesses.  We have to work now on the basis of the information we have at our disposal, however, and finalise the budget we will present in 13 days' time.</p></speech>

If the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I are in a position to have clarity regarding what a revenue gain will be 2023, of course, we will want to bring that forward and inform the Oireachtas and use that in our work.  I think both of us are being quite clear this evening in saying that is not what we are banking on.  There is much work to be done in that regard.  It is worth emphasising briefly that whatever measures the Government brings forward in 2022, we believe they will be the measures we will be implementing for this year.</p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question regarding the &euro;1.05 billion, I am not planning any change with regard to it.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I are committed to sticking inside the parameters we have announced.  I would expect the vast majority of that will be used to try to deliver a degree of indexation to wage earners who have seen their wages go up response to the cost-of-living pressures of which we are aware.  We are trying to preserve the value of those wages as they go up.  I would anticipate that is where most of that will be used.  Government has not made a decision on it, however.  We are looking at all these things in the round at the moment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#G01400"><p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett as I must go into the D&aacute;il to speak.  First, I wish to compliment both Ministers on the forthright way in which they are dealing with the problems we have.  We are not that far away from the budget and there seems to be a hell of a lot of stuff that still has to be resolved and measured out to see where we are going to land on the day of the budget.  Budget day is the week after next; it is fast approaching.</p> <p>  In dealing with an economic environment in which we are not so sure where we are going in terms of cost of living and energy security, there are few things I would really ask the Government to ensure.  In the event that the Government is thinking of increasing pensions and benefits for older people and those on fixed incomes, the income threshold for benefits like medical cards should also increase in line with this in order that we do not end up giving increases that push people outside of the market where they will perhaps not be able to hold on to a medical card, GP visit card or those kinds of things.  Likewise with the fuel allowance and other good supports that are in place, again, it is important that we reflect that the thresholds for people to qualify for these added benefits should also increase alongside the increases we expect will be given in order that we do not rule people out of getting benefits such as fuel allowance.  That is very important.</p> <p>  The other very important area in the context of the cost-of-living crisis we have at the moment is the fact that that for people with disabilities, the expense of their disability has been costed.  The additional cost of living with a disability without any other supports is up to &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 per annum as stated in the Indecon report.  No matter what is going on, it is high time that we actually start the process of recognising this by giving people with disabilities the money to deal with the additional cost of living with their disability.  It is very important that we start that process.  I am not saying the Government can put in &euro;12,000 for every person with a disability in year 1.  However, we need to recognise it and start a scheme in order that incrementally over the next five to ten years, we actually do something to support these people with disabilities.  Those are two issues with regard to people on fixed incomes.</p> <p>  There is another area about which I have a concern, the magnitude of which is enormous; it is frightening, really.  We talk about the cost of doing business and the cost of products increasing.  Take the small rural shops and pubs that have fridges and freezers or whatever else.  Their energy prices have absolutely gone through the roof.  My concern is that we need to give them something like a Covid-19 support now that will give them life support until they get over this energy crisis and things settle down.  I have seen it in every shop I have gone into and heard it from every retailer and small business or family business owner to whom I have spoken.  They are horrified at the types of energy bills they are getting at the moment.  The bills are absolutely frightening.  They do not know how they are going to cope throughout the winter.  Something we have to take on board as well are the small businesspeople who have no other income.  They are trying to make a living and also trying to provide a service within a rural area.  We need to do something for them.</p><p>In the context of the fact that energy Ministers will make a decision by the end of the month on what will happen, and we are talking about forming a budget, I believe that within the next two months we should have another budgetary intervention by the Government, once it sees what is coming from Europe.  It is important that that money and support is given out as quickly as we can give it.  It is important that we do not think this budget will be the full stop on all of this.  We have to watch the game as it is being played out over the next 12 months and then maybe consider other direct interventions that will be required.  I ask for comment on that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#H00200"><p>On the freak budgetary interventions, we have not even completed this budget, as the Deputy knows.  He has summarised very well the fact that it is only a few days away, which the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and I are keenly aware of.  When we do our budget and announce our measures, that will include measures for 2022 that we do not anticipate changing.  The Minister has made the point, and I fully agree with him, that if we get an EU-wide measure that we are able to opt in to, we will then use that money to fund measures that will help households and businesses.  We are a little away from that at present.  I do not want to create a sense that when the Government brings forward this budget in a week and a half's time, we will then have new, different and additional measures a few weeks later.  We are trying to outline a set of measures we believe will work and help and that will go across the rest of this year.  We will do our best to get that balance right first time.</p> <p>  We are very much aware of the business issue the Deputy referred to.  We are obviously working hard to see what measures can be put in place that will help.  We have made the case to the committee that what we have done over the past number of years has worked, but this situation is very different from Covid.</p></speech>

In fact, we had deflation on a few occasions.  Economies were closed.  We are now in a high-inflation environment, with a record number of people at work.  We need to put measures in place that will work and make a difference but are appropriate to that different environment.  That is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#H00500"><p>I will add that the Deputy raised a number of specific questions relating to different areas of expenditure.  All I can do is acknowledge the points he has made, one of which is that an increase in income because of a Government decision in the budget to increase a particular payment should not result in somebody losing an important secondary benefit.  That is an important point made by the Deputy, which I acknowledge.  It will be considered over the course of finalising the budget.  He also quite understandably raised the issue facing people who have a disability, namely, the additional cost involved in living with a disability.  Again, that is something we are very conscious of.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Rabbitte, are very keen to improve services and, where possible, to improve incomes for people who have a disability.</p> <p>  I echo the point the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, made around businesses.  We acknowledge the scale of the challenge for many.  We know that it raises very serious viability challenges for some though not for all.  We have come across countless examples in recent weeks where the scale of the increase has been eye-watering and will quickly put many of those businesses in real trouble.  We will do our very best to respond through the budget, while acknowledging there are always limitations to what we can do, especially bearing in mind that nobody can predict with any degree of certainty how long this period of very elevated energy prices will continue.  I agree with the point the Minister made.  We are focused on this budget, which has two parts.  It includes the normal budget for next year that will allow us to do some good things even though, on the expenditure side, when we take out all the pre-commitments, the increase in the public capital programme, and the public service pay deal that I hope will be ratified, the scope for new initiatives and new measures is quite limited.  It is tight on the core side for next year.  That is another reason we will do the best we can in the context of the package in quarter 4 to assist those who are most in need and to assist businesses too.  </p></speech>

The intention is then to introduce tax adjustments totalling just more than &euro;1 billion.</p> <p>  Correct me if I am wrong, but the programme for Government committed this three-party coalition Government to a 2:1 ratio of spending over tax cuts.  Why has that changed for next year?  It appears to have changed.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#H00700"><p>The Deputy has homed in on the available resources for new initiatives and new measures.  Core spending will increase by &euro;5.7 billion.  That is the scale of the overall package.  There is some rebalancing in that we are now bringing approximately &euro;700 million of that forward into the current year in the event the public service pay deal is ratified.  However, it is still a &euro;5 billion increase in core expenditure for next year.  The fact that a large share of it is already accounted for is because of decisions we have already made, including to prioritise a public capital investment programme and to have a national development plan, NDP, envelope next year of approximately &euro;12 billion.  That is a very conscious, deliberate decision by the Government that will do many good things throughout the country, in building schools, healthcare facilities, public transport, roads and so on.</p> <p>  It is also a function of the fact that the level of inflation we have means delivering public services has become more expensive, as I said.  That envelope for protecting existing levels of service, ELS, has become more expensive.  That is just the reality of the environment we are in, which then shrinks the envelope I have for new initiatives.  That is a fact and a constraint.  There is always a constraint on budget day.  We will use those resources to the very best of our ability but we have to make decisions in the context of the overall picture, which is that core spending will grow by more than 6% next year.  We believe that puts us within safe parameters.  We have made a temporary adjustment to the spending rule.  That has been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC,-----</p></speech>

The Minister is on record as saying that.</p> <p>  We are approaching, at least technical, full employment.  Nobody could have envisaged that this time two years ago.  It would be churlish of me not to recognise the impact the measures, formulated by the Government and endorsed by the Oireachtas, have had in supporting business and people in work at an unprecedentedly difficult time for our country and globally.  That is recognised.  We are approaching full employment.  There are risks over the next period that have been articulated by other colleagues.  We all know, and the Ministers know as constituency Deputies as well as senior Ministers, the impact the energy crisis is having on the very viability of some businesses that would be otherwise viable.  I had a conversation with a small hospitality sector business owner last week who told me that his energy bills are now exceeding his rent costs.  That puts things in perspective.  We all accept significant initiatives need to be taken by the Government to try to assist businesses through this very difficult process, though of course with conditions attached.</p> <p>  I put a question to Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment officials last week regarding any analysis that may have been done around the sectors or sub-sectors of the economy that might be especially at risk and the number of jobs that may be involved.</p><p>There are approximately 120,000 jobs involved in energy intensive businesses, especially those in the heavy manufacturing space that rely on gas.  Some of those jobs may be very vulnerable.  We know that a significant Government programme was signed off by the European Commission on 11 August.  This will be operated by the State agencies to assist some of those companies into the future.  While it is all well and good assisting companies to meet their ever-rising energy bills, in truth it involves burning through cash to keep the show on the road.  That means energy companies always get paid.  In considering how to use our resources smartly, I will return to a hobbyhorse of mine, that is, the need for a form of German-style short-time working scheme that we could take from the shelf, customise, tailor and target at industries that are experiencing crises.  That is something that needs to be considered again.  It may well be the case that some intensive users of energy in highly skilled sectors of the manufacturing sector of our economy will require support to furlough workers at this difficult time.  This is a crisis we could not have foreseen.</p><p> I will give an example.  There is an employer in my constituency named Premier Periclase.  It is based in Drogheda and is involved in heavy manufacturing.  It manufactures magnesium-based products and has an old manufacturing facility on the banks of the River Boyne.  The company has initiated redundancy notices to almost 40 of its 45 staff.  It came out of examinership at the end of May confident that once it transitioned from a reliance on gas to renewables, which was its plan post examinership, it would become a viable company that may even diversify over the next few years and continue to retain its skilled engineers, electricians, fitters and general operatives.  The company's gas and energy bills are running &euro;5 million ahead of what was anticipated in May.  There are finite supports the State can provide to an industry such as that but one of the measures that could be introduced is a furlough or wage support scheme for businesses such as Premier Periclase to help them with their labour costs during this difficult period.  Instead we are going to see almost 40 skilled workers laid off.  Some of them may never work again because the sectors in which they work may no longer exist this time next year or in two years.  I plead with the Ministers to seriously consider in an urgent fashion the introduction of a form of short-time working scheme to help assist companies such as Premier Periclase and sectors such as theirs with their costs over the next period of time because once those jobs are gone, they will not come back.  We need to focus in a laser-like fashion on supporting industries and sectors such as the one I have mentioned because otherwise they will be gone.  That could be a smart investment of what I accept are limited public funds at this difficult time.</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised a particular example.  It is always deeply regrettable when people are given notice like that.  I hope it will not materialise in that particular case.  We can only restate our understanding and acknowledgement that for many businesses, the situation is serious.  We know that some businesses have the capacity to absorb the additional costs.  Some businesses have been trading well, are highly profitable and can afford the cost of the significant hikes in energy prices.  However, other businesses are still recovering after the pandemic.  Some of those businesses were not able to trade for part of the past two years and simply do not have the necessary reserves.  One of the guiding principles that the Minister for Finance, myself and the rest of the Government used over that time was to help businesses that were otherwise viable.  It was a challenge of an altogether different nature, as the Minister for Finance has outlined.  There will be a response from Government.  We are considering all of the issues the Deputy and his colleagues have raised in the context of the challenges facing businesses at the moment.  We will make the final decisions in the coming days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#J00500"><p>The Minister appears to have indicated that the Government has not fully made its decisions on an additional package that may be made available to address the cost-of-living crisis we are facing.  I will make a suggestion to him for when he is considering what the Government is going to do.  To my mind, and the minds of a considerable number of people, it is worrying when he constantly repeats the mantra that we cannot fully protect people against this cost-of-living crisis.  It is a constant mantra.  It is not acceptable to continue to use that mantra to prepare people and condition them for the hit they are facing as we head into the winter.  It is simply not acceptable that pensioners, people with families and people who have done nothing wrong will not have the money to heat their homes.  They will have to turn off the heat.  They will not have the money to provide hot water to have showers or to pay essential bills, particularly at a time when we are seeing the very companies that produce the energy making incredible profits.  It is morally unacceptable that those companies can continue to make profits while ordinary people suffer in an unacceptable way.  Whatever solutions the Government comes up with must address that point.</p> <p>  Our view is that the Government should control the prices to make them affordable.  There should be some recognition in the face of the unprecedented crisis we are now seeing that a privatised and for-profit energy sector is not capable of dealing with the sort of situation we are now facing.  It is incapable of doing so.  The evidence is piling up.  The EU is now talking about windfall taxes.  It was not talking about them a while ago.  Only the loony left was talking about windfall taxes but now the EU is considering them.  States are starting to control prices.  That idea was dismissed when it was proposed by some of us a year ago.  States are starting to talk about renationalising the energy sector.  Some states are doing that.  These are the sorts of things we need.  The Government must start to think outside the box, reject previously held convictions about markets and rethink the whole thing in the face of this crisis.  We must guarantee that vulnerable people who have done nothing wrong are not going to suffer.  We must stop the profiteering.  We must also consider whether to take our energy supply, a basic need for people, under the control of the State, where it is run on a not-for-profit basis.  Is the Government even considering those things?  I think it should.</p> <p>  I note that corporate tax receipts for last year amounted to &euro;15 billion.  The Government is projecting &euro;20 billion in corporate tax receipts this year.  I know we do not have the returns yet but the Ministers must have a projected figure for what that means in terms of the increased profits that are being made by the corporate sector.  There could not be a 33% increase in corporate tax receipts unless there is a corresponding increase in the level of profits.  When other people are seriously suffering, a bonanza of profits is being enjoyed, which is reflected in our corporate tax receipts.</p><p>Would it not be fair and just to use the huge surge being seen in profits and the additional corporate tax revenues to shield people against the cost-of-living crisis?  The Minister for Finance will say that these are vulnerable tax heads, we might not have the money in a year or two and so on.  However, one-off payments could be made to shield people against the costs.</p><p> There are also other things the Government could do.  As well as a cost-of living crisis, we have a massive housing crisis.  Would it not be a good investment to use those additional revenues to buy up a lot of the property out there at the moment?  Rather than let international investors buy up the newly constructed houses, the State could buy them and avoid spending huge amounts of money on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment or HAP scheme.  Would it not be a good use of the additional revenues the Government has to use them to deliver public and affordable housing for the people who need it?</p><p> Would it not be a good use of that money for the State to provide a scheme to insulate homes on a massive scale and reduce energy costs?  Would it not be a good investment, one that is not dependent on ongoing current expenditure, to invest in areas such as public transport infrastructure, including more buses for rural Ireland and new routes?  Would these not be the types of measures the Government could take with these additional revenues?  They would be sensible investments in the medium and long term that would make a real difference in the short term with regard to the cost-of-living and housing crises that people are faced with.</p></speech>

On one hand, he views the corporate sector as being at the root of many of the difficulties we are in.  He has said many times that he wants to nationalise many large corporate companies that are located here and he said that again this evening.  On one hand, he sees the corporate sector as being the cause of the many challenges we are facing while, on the other, he is all too happy and willing to spend the taxes we are collecting from them.  We are warning that we cannot rely on the taxes we are collecting from these companies being there forever.</p> <p>  In terms of the corporate sector and the global capitalism, which the Deputy is committed to defeating, he cannot, on one hand, say he wants to see the back of them while, on the other, saying he wants to spend the money coming in with confidence that this money will keep coming in.  He cannot do both.  He cannot believe both of those things at the same time or if he does, he must acknowledge the risks that are there.</p> <p>  I do not recall that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I did not recognise the vulnerable and those who are under the most pressure.  We recognise the commitment we have to them and we will do our best to discharge it in the budget.  Both of us have acknowledged publicly on different occasions that where there are large super-normal profits coming in, ways should be found to either tax or capture some of that profit through regulation.  Both the Minister and I have acknowledged that if very large levels of profit are being made for reasons that are beyond the control of a firm and that firm is going to enjoy super-normal profits, it would not be fair that it should enjoy those profits while other firms go out of business.  The European Union is likely to come up with the best way of addressing that and we will examine if we can be involved in it.  These are matters that are being considered.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett assumes the system he wants to see the back of will keep generating current levels of tax revenue and profit and that it is safe to keep spending that money.  I do not believe that is the case.</p></speech>

We are paying out a &euro;1 billion in RAS and HAP payments, increasingly to these international investment funds.  Would it not be better if we just bought the stuff instead of the funds buying it?  We could then deliver public and affordable housing.  For every home the State bought, not only would it be able to house people and give them a secure place to live but it would save money in terms of current expenditure.  That would be a prudent use of this bonanza of profits.  It does not rely on the future profitability of those companies.</p> <p>  Does the current situation not give the Minister pause for thought about the danger of energy supply being dependent on companies that operate on a for-profit basis?  Does it not give him pause for thought that a lot of the renewable energy resources being developed around the country will be owned by private companies, many of which are not even from this country and have absolutely no commitment or requirement to provide affordable energy, or provide us with energy at all, if it is not profitable for them?</p></speech>

I very much appreciate their efforts.  I value the Ministers' engagement, which is always very forthcoming.  I know they are obliged to be forthcoming but we appreciate it and I am thankful for it.</p> <p>  These are unprecedented times.  One of the issues I will home in on is business.  Both Ministers are extremely committed to small businesses and SMEs throughout the country because they are the backbone of employment.  In smaller and more rural areas in particular, the people who create a job for themselves or one, two or ten others in the community are the backbone of society.  They are really hurting and finding life extremely difficult.</p> <p>  A reporter for a local newspaper in County Kerry who is doing a story on the effects of energy costs on businesses asked me today how businesses are being affected and how they are managing.  Obviously I left out the medical side because nothing was worse than the loss of life during Covid, as we all readily acknowledged, but I am being hard-nosed about this in talking about business.  From a business point of view, I truthfully believe that energy costs are worse.  Through the efforts of the Minister for Finance and his officials and the good work of the Government in supporting small business, doors were kept open.  Even though the doors were shut during Covid, the Government handled the situation in such a way that businesses were financially supported and could open their doors when the rules and regulations allowed them to do so.  Now we find that the doors are open, businesses are operating, as they are entitled to do, and open for business, but the costs are so enormous that they do not have the benefit of the Government supports and are really struggling.  The Ministers know this but I feel I must say it.  What is happening now, from a business point of view, is worse than Covid because we do not have the back-up of the Government.</p> <p>  I look forward to seeing what measures the Government will put in place.  I do not believe the measures will be enough.  I am not being negative when I say that because everyone knows I am not that way.  I am not criticising the budget before I know what it contains but I find it hard to envisage how the Government will be able to do for small business now what was done for them during Covid.  I hope I am proved wrong and the Minister will be the saviour small business needs in terms of addressing the energy costs encountered by shopkeepers, hairdressers, and the owners of beauty salons, small engineering works and so on.</p><p>We hear about the issue of declaring interests.  I have a small shop myself, so I see it myself.  The bills that were &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000 every eight weeks are now &euro;9,500.  One can deal with that once or twice, but when one has to contend with that and sees it go nowhere but up, one would wonder if it is possible to keep the business open.  The people I represent tell me that they are more fearful than ever before.</p><p> I have another matter to put to the Ministers.  I was grateful that the rates review that was being carried out a couple of years ago was, rightly, deferred because of Covid.  It is now going ahead.  The local authorities are rolling it out for every business and rateable properly.  It is not being looked at with a view to reducing the rates but with a view to increasing them.  I do not think, in the times we are in, that it is a good time to tell people in small businesses that their rates are going up.  It is the exact opposite.  We should look at deferring this.  I humbly ask the Ministers, on behalf of the businesspeople in Kerry, to please not touch the rates.  I am sure other people around the country would say exactly the same thing.  People will not be able to afford the rates.  Kerry County Council and its finance department, as the Ministers know, is excellent at its job.  I know that local authorities can look at inability to pay case by case.  Unfortunately, many businesses will be unable to pay.  Rather than pursuing a rates increase, I ask the Ministers to look at that.  I know they might say it is outside their sphere, but if the people in charge of the Department of Finance cannot look at that in a sensible way, then who else can?</p><p> The Ministers have often heard me talk about mum's purse.  One could be the Minister for Finance, be over in Europe and doing everything in the world, but if Mrs. Murphy or Mrs. Sullivan's purse is not in order on a Friday evening and she cannot manage the bills or run her house, then everything else is in serious trouble too.  Unfortunately, mum's purse is at breaking point because there is nothing in it.  During Covid, the Government was good at trying to support all those circumstances.  Unfortunately, a bag of coal for Christmas is now &euro;40 or &euro;45.  It is fine to tell people to retrofit their home and that the Government will give them a big grant, but I know nobody with &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 under the bed to produce to retrofit their home.</p><p> While I hate telling the Ministers this, though it is a fact, the majority of businesses installing solar energy are doing so without the grant.  One might say it is insane to leave a grant of 20% or 30% on the table, but I will tell the Ministers why that happens.  One of the first things that has to be done is an energy audit, which costs between &euro;10,000 and &euro;12,000.  The Government might say that it will provide grant aid of 50% or maybe a bit less.  It is telling businesses to get a big bundle of paper.  They will have to provide &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 and the Government will give them &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000.  The paperwork will delay the project by nine months.  Every eight weeks, one has to pay an energy bill of between &euro;9,000 and &euro;12,000.  People are better off, by hook or by crook, to go ahead and put up the solar panels without the benefit of the grant.  A grant should not be set up that way.  It should be more user-friendly and easier to get.</p><p> The buzzword of the Government seems to be that it has to do its part for the environment and rightly so, but there is no good reason, by now, for every roof in Ireland not to have solar panels.  The Government is not actually serious about that.  I do not like telling the Ministers that, but it is a fact.  Talk to the people who are installing the systems and who want to have these systems.  They will say that it is not working because the bureaucracy involved in getting the grants is turning off households.  The energy audits and so on are just not practical for businesses.  That is why so few take this up.  If one was up in the sky looking down at roofs in Ireland, every farm building should be covered in solar panels.  Every day when the weather is at all fair, we should have between 70% and 80% of our energy coming from solar.  Even on a bad, cloudy day, we should be self-sufficient to the tune of 20% to 30% coming from the sky.  We are not.  What has been done so far is like a spit in the ocean.  I would like the Ministers to work on those things.</p><p> I express my hope that the budget will do meaningful things.  Regarding what has happened in the past, there was much talk about the &euro;200 that people got off their ESB bill.  I respect it very much.  The &euro;200 was a lot of money in the week when it came out of people's accounts.  Many bad weeks have come and gone both before and after that.  We want to see more of those meaningful measures.  I am fearful for older people who, in many instances, can only hope to heat their homes this winter through what they buy, whether it is timber, coal or turf, if they are allowed to do so.  One can call those homes energy inefficient, but they cannot be made efficient and, in those people's lifetimes, they probably will not be able to change in the way the Ministers might like them to change.  These are the types of problems we have.</p><p> I will finish like I always do.  I thank the Ministers for the work they are doing.  I acknowledge the people in the Department of Finance who work behind the scenes.  As a small businessperson, compared with someone running the finances of the country, it is all relative.  It is like running a bigger business and trying to do everything the right way.  It is the same in a small business.  One tries to pay the bills, to do things right and to keep one's nose clean.  That is what the Ministers are trying to do on a larger scale.  I thank everybody involved and hope that they will make the best decisions that they can for the people who are hard-pressed and need help in this budget more than ever before.</p><p> I am sorry if I ran over time.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Healy-Rae for coming in and making that contribution.  The measures that we will announce the week after next will be meaningful.  I am sure they will not satisfy everybody and that we will not be able to meet every need and ambition.  We will try to focus on what really matters in the budget, which is the basics and looking after people to make sure that they can get by and can meet unavoidable day-to-day costs.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a number of issues relating to businesses.  A number of colleagues raised those issues over the course of the meeting.  Both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and I are in close contact with businesses, both representative bodies and individual business owners in our constituency and nationally.  Our colleagues in our respective parties and across the House come to us all the time and share the kinds of example that Deputy Healy-Rae highlighted from his personal circumstances.  We are aware of the issue and the worry.  It is not just about the bills that have been received but what is to come.  Nobody can predict with any degree of certainty how long this is going to last or how much worse it might get.  The Government has to calibrate its response with incomplete information.  It has to do so based on the facts that it has at this time, while also trying to safeguard the bigger picture of public finances and making sure that we keep them in safe territory.  The economic environment has changed, as I am sure the Deputy is well aware.</p> <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae raised a few issues about rateable valuation, which I will pass on to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.</p><p>There are two levers relating to the rates bill.  One is the rates struck by the local authority, and then there is the valuation which is set.  Deputy Healy-Rae raised an issue about revaluation.  We will take on board the points the Deputy made about grant schemes for retrofitting.  A lot of money has been made available for retrofitting to support businesses and households.  We would like to see the support rolled out more quickly.  There is a capacity issue with the number of contractors available in the sector.  We are addressing that through the provision of more apprenticeships, skills, training and so on to try to build up that capacity, because there is significant work ahead of us.  Even when we get through the current point in the energy price cycle, this phase of work will last for many years.</p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of solar energy.  We have work to do in that area.  We should acknowledge that we in Ireland, along with Denmark, are among the world leaders in onshore wind energy.  There will be more offshore wind in future.  I take the point about solar energy.</p><p> Deputy Healy-Rae concluded on the matter of older people.  They get particularly concerned when they see the bills coming their way.  Many have extra needs and need to be looked after.  We will do our best on budget day to respond to that level of need, while acknowledging and being honest and straight with people that we will not be able to do everything.  We can help a lot.  We will do that in two weeks.</p></speech>

Like the Minister, Deputy McGrath, I have been approached directly by businesses, which have sent me pictures of their bills.  I fully understand the challenge that is developing and the need to respond to it.  I agree with everything the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has said on that.  I will add two points to that.  I say this to Deputy Healy-Rae with respect and the same honesty with which he has spoken to me.</p> <p>  The first point I would respectfully make is that if the benchmark for whenever the Government tries to help the economy is what we did during Covid, we will run out of money.  The Covid pandemic was an extraordinary and, I hope, please God, a once-in-a-generation experience in which people could not leave their home.  I know the Deputy understands this because I heard him speak about it in the D&aacute;il and he has raised what that meant for businesses with me for two years.  A set of things came together that, please God, none of us will ever have to confront again.  We had to do things at such a scale because of the terrible harm it would do to people's health and what would happen to the basic functioning of businesses and our economy if we did not intervene.  It cannot be the benchmark the Government is compared with every time we have to intervene again.  If the Government is asked to take that approach, in all honesty, the people who will suffer in the years to come are the people who Deputy Healy-Rae is representing, because the public finances will not be able to afford it, our debt will go up, and we know what happens after that.</p> <p>  We will do all that we can to help to make a difference.  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, used the phrase "incomplete information".  We do not know for how long this situation could continue and what else could be around the corner.  We have to temper what we are doing with that in mind.  I ask the Deputy to consider that, every time we have to respond to a shock, if the Deputy expects us to do what we did during Covid, we will quickly have bigger trouble on our hands.  We are trying to manage that.</p> <p>  I take the point about solar panels.  We will have to look at that.  The job of the State and whoever is in government is not just to find money to make solar panels cheaper but to find money to keep hospitals running and to respond to all the other needs the Deputy is referring to.  As much as we want to make things that we value affordable, at the same time the Government cannot do everything.  Few people understand that better than Deputy Healy-Rae, because of his background and the fact there is a big business community in Kerry that understands what is going on in the world.  I fully understand the challenge many are facing, but I hope the Deputy will appreciate my candour in asking him to consider other risks.  If we are requested to intervene as we did during Covid in every economic shock, we will face an economic shock of our own making at some point soon.  None of us want to be in that position.</p></speech>

I have two things to start with.  This will be the third budget for which I will have been a Member of the D&aacute;il.  We are living in extraordinary times.  I hope that, next year, we will be living in less extraordinary times when we are coming into this phase of the year.  The issue with speaking two hours after the meeting started is that many of the questions I had have been asked.  I will start with a different angle, with a question for an Aire, an Teachta McGrath, about media reports regarding the Department of Health maybe needing a bailout.  Will he detail how that came about?  If there is a need for significant additional funding, how does he expect that to be done?  Will it be done through a Supplementary Estimate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#M00400"><p>I thank Deputy Farrell.  I acknowledge she has been here since the beginning of the meeting, which we appreciate.  Health expenditure is a challenging and complex area, as she knows.  There is a close working relationship between the officials in my Department, the Department of Health and the HSE.  There is a dedicated group, the health budget oversight group, which meets regularly to tease out these issues and make sure there is ongoing communication and good co-operation relating to the management of health expenditure.  It is such a large area of our overall expenditure.  The allocation in 2022 is &euro;22.2 billion, with a further &euro;200 million held in reserve.  A particular challenge we face in respect of health expenditure relates to Covid-19.  The Deputy will recall the wave of the Omicron variant we had at the beginning of the year, which would not have been envisaged on budget day last year.  That led to significant budget-related expenditure that went above and beyond what was allocated to health on budget day in respect of Covid.  That is the first issue.  There is an overrun relating to Covid-related expenditure.  We are working through that issue with our colleagues in the Department of Health as part of the Estimates process.</p> <p>  On the non-Covid side, we are analysing overall core expenditure.  We have made much progress with beds and adding capacity to the system.  Thousands of staff have been recruited.  The Department of Health has received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff beyond that.  We are working through the budgetary implications of that at the moment.  To add complexity to that, there are other measures that would not have been funded on budget day which we will have to fund, such as measures relating to the recognition payment.  There are health-related costs associated with looking after the displaced people who came here from Ukraine.  We decided on an expanded flu vaccination programme.  As part of the Building Momentum agreement, we honoured our commitment regarding the Haddington Road hours.  Given the scale of the workforce for which the Department of Health has responsibility, it had to make provision for significant expenditure relating to that agreement.  There are many different moving parts, but the Covid cost will be more than was provided for originally, with a need for additional expenditure.  We are working through core spending at the moment and assessing the need for a Supplementary Estimate in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

There are two questions that I really want to get answers to, but people have asked them and we have not heard exactly how much the Minister expects the surplus to be.  I also wanted to ask if the Minister has decided what to do in regard to the rainy day fund and if so, how much it will be.  If he has the information perhaps the Minister will answer that as well, if he wants to respond to me.</p><p> The other question I had relates to the amount of warehoused tax debt that arose during Covid.  Has the Department done any analysis on the outstanding amounts and how they are being impacted by the current energy crisis?</p><p> Following on what Teachta Healy-Rae said, we have all been speaking to local businesses in our area about the different strains they are experiencing.  We are all acutely aware of the pressures on households.  There has been some talk about a potential loan initiative coming from the Government.  I am not asking the Minister to confirm that, but how would it also impact?</p></speech>

It is not the case that there is a Government agreement in place regarding the scale of measures for this year and that money is going to be set aside for the future challenges, but we are not telling people; it is that we are working on all of this at the moment.  The decisions will be made just before the budget and we will announce them at that point.</p> <p>  In response to the question on debt warehousing, the total amount of money at the end of August was &euro;1.3 billion in VAT and &euro;1.2 billion in employer PAYE.  We have &euro;2.5 billion in those two tax heads and a further &euro;200 million across other taxes, bringing the total value to &euro;2.7 billion.  Some 78,000 individual businesses are currently availing of the option.  As of now, I have received no advice or guidance that there is added difficulty at the moment in settling that.  For businesses that may be looking in, which are concerned about their ability to pay us, I would advise them to engage fully with the Revenue Commissioners on it because they will collect the money on a case-by-case basis in a way that also respects the viability and continuation of employers and companies.  That is why I have shied away from a single plan for all, because I accept there is a need for differentiated treatments depending on the status of various taxpayers.  They are the figures at the moment.  I hope in the time ahead Revenue will be in a position to collect the outstanding money.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the beginning of the presentation as I was in the Chamber, but I have both hard copies and I have gone through them.  I will ask my questions consecutively because of the time saving, and because everybody has been here for quite a long time.</p> <p>  Earlier today I met with Age Action.  We are very concerned about the effect of the current inflation cycle on older people.  People on fixed incomes are extremely vulnerable.  Will the Government commit to introducing a cap on energy prices or a windfall tax and using the proceeds to increase the eligibility for fuel allowance and to fund energy upgrades specifically for older people?  The previous speaker, who is sitting beside me, Deputy Canney, asked about the fuel allowance but I did not hear the response.  I would welcome some clarity on the issue.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said today that there are a number of items in the taxation commission report, which are straight out of the Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto, and they will not happen under this Government.  Which elements do the Ministers have an issue with and do they intend to ignore this independent report because Sinn F&eacute;in agrees with certain points?  I ask this question very respectfully.  I merely want to get clarity if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.543" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#N00800"><p>I thank Deputy Ryan very much.  I will address some of those points and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will respond to the Deputy as well.</p> <p>  In the course of our pre-budget discussions, we have met a wide range of stakeholders, including groups representing older people.  We are two practising politicians who have been elected like Deputy Ryan and we are very much in touch with our constituents and the elderly members of our community.  We very much appreciate that many of them are worried, especially about inflation, the cost of living, energy bills and so on.  We have given a commitment to many of the Deputy's colleagues this evening that we will do the very best we can to support them.  We will be making a contribution and helping them to get through this period in the best way we possibly can.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan raised a number of issues relating to capping energy prices.  It is a complex area but in Ireland we have many electricity providers who do not generate electricity.  They purchase it on the wholesale markets and the price they pay is indeterminate.  We do not know what price they will end up paying and if we put a cap on the price that they can charge the consumer, many of those businesses may well go bust and go out of business.  We need to think through very carefully the consequences of the solutions that we are bringing forward because it seems to me that such a proposal does sign the taxpayer up to an unlimited liability for pledging to bridge that gap, whatever it may be, but it is undetermined what the amount will be.</p> <p>  We are working with our EU partners on a windfall tax.  We expect movement in the coming weeks on excess revenues being earned by non-gas electricity generators.  That is an issue which may well impact on those generating electricity through wind power.  There may well be additional revenues for Ireland in that respect.  There is also a proposal for a solidarity contribution from primary producers of fossil fuel.  As I understand it, there is only one such provider in Ireland but, again, that may yield revenue for Ireland.  We have given a commitment that any additional revenues that we receive from those sources will be used to help people and businesses over the period ahead.</p> <p>  On the specific issue of fuel allowance, it is - as with all other social welfare schemes - under consideration.  It is being reviewed and we will make a final decision close to budget day.</p></speech>

Some of the recommendations it brought forward are difficult in the current economic environment with the pressures on living standards that we discussed at length here this evening.  The Government will consider the report fully now that we have noted it this morning.  There will be different reactions to different proposals within it.  That is to be expected given the fact that there are more than 100 proposals in the report.</p></speech>

I know that I have just a few seconds left.  I listened intently to Deputy Boyd Barrett speak about energy suppliers and what the Minister said about Putin and related issues.  In fairness, does he not feel that some of the energy companies are price gouging?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#N01200"><p>We have just seen an energy company leave Ireland.  The prices being charged by many of the energy companies to which the Deputy refers are determined by the purchase price of the energy they need.  I strongly reject Deputy Boyd Barrett's suggestion that the cause of where we are at the moment is corporate malpractice or companies charging more for energy than they should.  I do not accept that.  The cause of where we are at the moment is a war and it is rippling through the world and the global economy.  As to whether I believe there are firms making more profit than they should be because they have seen no change to their costs but the price at which they are selling has gone up, yes, there are very high levels of profit being made there.  That is why there will either be an EU or national response to it.  I am not here defending that profit.</p><p>It is not fair that while one company that is still producing something at the same price sees its profits go through the roof, another company cannot afford to stay open because the price of energy has gone through the roof.  That is why there is a place now for tax measures to tax that additional profit or regulatory measures such as those being proposed by the European Union.  Ireland will adopt either depending on what we believe is the most effective and efficient.  We will conclude all of that in the next few days.</p></speech>

Both Departments have done work on gender budgeting, equality budgeting and well-being indicators.  What will we see in this budget not in terms of budgetary measures but working methods and implementation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.550" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#O00600"><p>We have a lot of work under way in the Department of Finance, as do our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to try to capture what would be the impact of budget decisions, how they differentiate by gender and by different groups in society.  We are committed, on budget day or shortly afterwards, to try to publish a more rounded assessment of what we have done beyond the more traditional economic metrics that have been seen in the last few years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.551" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#O00700"><p>That would be a very welcome report.  It sounds like a process that happens towards the end of the decision-making.  When Departments engage or interact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance, is there an onus on the Departments to provide performance indicators or data on how particular asks are being considered in terms of gender, equality or general well-being?  Do the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance ask for this at the beginning of the process rather than at the end?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#O00800"><p>Yes, it is very much part of our discussions.  The line Departments that come to us with individual measures cannot see the totality of the picture but because we sit at the centre and are responsible for putting together the budget, we have to make sure the overall mix is correct and we get the right balance in relation to the issues the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, just touched on.  In addition, we publish a citizens guide on budget day.  We provide distribution analysis and we also provide more information in the Revised Estimates volume, which is published in December.  Across all of the publications, whether the mid-year expenditure report, the expenditure book on budget day or the Revised Estimates Volume, we are incrementally building up capacity and the amount of data we provide measuring the impact of budget and all of the decisions we make, whether in the form of equality or green budgeting.  As the Chairman will know, the Department of the Taoiseach is leading on the well-being framework as well.</p></speech>

I have definitely seen in recent years that when Ministers and their officials are bringing forward proposals they are couching them more in terms of what impact they could have on children and vulnerable groups in society.  It is well beyond the macro effect on society and the economy.  When specific proposals are brought forward it is increasingly being done with reference to groups and cohorts in society that Departments are trying to do good by.  To pick up on what was implicit in the Chairman's question, it is far from being evaluated at the end, which is when it happens more formally.  Before we reach the end, there has been a big change in how proposals are developed and then pitched to Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.554" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#O01000"><p>Is that led by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance?  Implementing performance indicators and gender equality budgeting at the beginning of the decision process is complex.  Are the Departments training staff in other Departments?  What is the point of interaction?  Are the Departments given a <i>fait accompli </i>at the end when other Departments come and ask or is there an interaction at the beginning of the decision-making process whereby suitable performance indicators are discussed?  To be clear, I see this all the time when Estimates are being discussed at the Select Committee on Health when the performance indicators we examine are sometimes not quite fit for purpose in terms of what the outcomes should be.</p></speech>

That is the reason we are increasingly finding that proposals that come to us already have a distributional analysis done.  I see in my interaction with colleagues that the information is more rounded and comprehensive.  Certainly, when the Minister and I present to the party leaders on budgetary issue, which we do all of the time, we look at these issues and we let them know what the distributional impact is, whether it be by income decile or household type.  Even in very recent meetings, we did that.</p></speech>

I reassure the Chairman that we do not see this as a box-ticking exercise.  It is inherent in the budget process, which is all year around.  All of these processes are embedded in the range of publications we produce throughout the calendar year.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily think we were expecting to see indexation rolled out this year, and certainly I was not expecting that, but maybe there could be a recognition of the value of indexation as a map for how welfare rates, in particular, could be decided.</p> <p>  Last week, the committee met representatives of the ESRI, IFAC, IBEC and NERI.  One of the issues we discussed was that children in Ireland are more likely to live in poverty than people of working age or elderly people.  We discussed that in the context of child benefit and the working family payment.  While we have spoken a lot this year about targeted measures, which I very much support, some universal measures have a particular impact.  The research tells us that they might be paid more to women or used in a particular way.  Rather than having only targeted measures in the budget, can we expect to see that recognised in an uplift across the board, particularly in respect of payments that have stagnated since 2008?</p></speech>

We are very conscious that the kind of inflation that is being experienced impacts on everyone.  That is why it will involve a combination of measures, some of which will be targeted.  We have made progress in recent years in reducing inequality and poverty.  Even at times when it was not possible, for example, to increase the weekly core social welfare rates some good work was done through those very targeted measures such as qualified child dependant allowance payments and, in the case of people living alone, through the living alone payment.  We will examine all of those but we recognise that there are certain payments that have a universal characteristic to them which will also play a role in getting that overall balance right.  We will be very conscious of the need to protect the lowest income groups or lowest income deciles but we know that everyone is impacted, not in the same way and not evenly, by what we are experiencing at the moment.</p></speech>

The challenge with indexation, as I mentioned in an earlier exchange with the Chairman, is the costs involved in delivering it and how we reconcile that with all of the other commitments we are expected to deliver.  The Minister covered that.</p></speech>

In any case, it is new to the committee, whereas I know the Ministers have had it on their desks for a while.  It is clear from the recommendations that the commission is not keen on reduced-VAT or zero-VAT mechanisms.  However, one of the issues the committee discussed at length at its meeting last week was the openness of the EU to the greening of VAT.  IBEC stated that the definition of the greening of VAT was so broad that somebody would have to audit a list all of the time and in its view we were not doing enough to eke out what could be green in terms of a reduced VAT rate.</p><p>Would the Minister for Finance like to respond to that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.563" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022091400002#P00200"><p>There are opportunities to make adjustments to our VAT code now on foot of the new directive implemented by the EU before the summer.  I used some of that flexibility earlier this year to lower VAT on electricity.  There is also additional flexibility in VAT on some forms of equipment and investment.  As such, the point is a fair one.  What I now need to do is try to reconcile some ideas that could be attractive with our ability to fund the overall package.</p> <p>  The Chair made an important point about indexation.  Indexation also applies to taxpayers, mainly those who earn a normal wage and do not qualify for the social welfare supports that we have discussed.  They are in work and need universal payments but also need the money in their wallets to go a bit further right now.  Reconciling the cost of trying to do that with greening the VAT code is difficult.  The Chair is correct, though, as there are opportunities now that were not available a year ago.</p></speech>

The report makes a point over and over about the need to broaden the tax base.  In recent months, we have heard a great deal of discussion about how, as per the programme for Government, we will not increase income tax and that there may be income tax reductions or a change in income tax.  Last week, we discussed how, while wage increases could lead to inflation, changes to income tax could also do that.  Does the Minister accept that?</p></speech>

To make tax proposals that are capable of adding to inflationary pressures within our economy, we would need a tax package worth many multiples of &euro;1 billion.  When people see our budget day tables, in which we will lay out whatever tax proposals the Government agrees, they will see net change in disposable income versus the rates of inflation that many are facing.  There will be a difference.  In order to have a tax package that is, from an income tax point of view, capable of adding to inflation, it would have to be ahead of the rates of wage change that we are expecting to see in our economy and probably ahead of the rates of inflation that we are now seeing and expect to see into next year.  At &euro;1 billion, we will not be doing that.</p> <p>  Reverting to the Chair's point about universal measures, nearly no one who is earning &euro;39,000 will qualify for the targeted measures that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, and I hope to introduce in a few weeks' time.  As the Chair knows from representing people in Dublin Central - she knows it well, given that it underpins what she has raised with us at this meeting - many of them are feeling the impact of higher bills.</p></speech>

Another energy ministers meeting will take place at the end of the month.  If we are in a position to have clarity about a good figure that we can stand over for use next year and about which we can give an indication to the Oireachtas and the public, of course we will do so.  However, we are conscious of the fact that, if we put a figure in our budget arithmetic, we have to be confident that it will not change by orders of magnitude.  Currently, I cannot give that figure to the committee or the Government.  There is no point in pretending otherwise, as doing so would only lead to difficulty and confusion.  If we put a figure into our budgetary calculations for next year, it has to be a figure that we can stand over and has a reasonable chance of being delivered.  Currently, that figure is not available to us.</p></speech>

What would happen?  Would we revise matters?  Would there be a supplementary budget?  We have played this issue out today, but if there is an energy ministers meeting at the end of the month and we then put a mechanism in place by Christmas, would it take a few months before we started seeing dividends from that?</p></speech>

It is possible that we may form a forecast well before then.  If we can do so sooner rather than later, we will, but the measures for 2023 will be funded from the tax revenue that we have within the year, which is why Deputy O'Donnell was asking me about that.  If we are in a position to accrue new tax revenue in 2023 as a result of these EU-wide measures, we will use it to try to fund measures for 2023 or, more likely, respond in various ways to something that happens beyond the first quarter.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Senator Malcolm Byrne and Deputy Johnny Mythen who are unable to attend today's public session.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened to discuss the final report of the Future of Media Commission with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  I welcome the Minister and her officials and I remind her that her officials are not expected to speak in the public session.  I advise that the opening statement and any other documentation submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I cannot permit a member to attend where he or she does not adhere to that constitutional requirement.  I ask members who may be joining this meeting today via Microsoft Teams to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report and also to mute their microphones when not contributing so as to reduce the background noise.  I remind all those joining today's meeting to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or, better still, switched off.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

A diverse, vibrant and independent media sector is essential for wider society, democracy, cultural development and our social cohesion.  Our media enlightens and educates us and facilitates discourse and debate.  Its content is a reflection of our society.  It is a showcase for our unique culture and heritage and it has the capacity to maintain community bonds.  This has never been more clearly demonstrated, and needed, than it was in recent years.  However, it is a sector that is undergoing profound change.  The Government recognises this and it committed in the programme for Government to establish the Future of Media Commission with a remit to examine how media should serve Irish society, how well the current system meets these goals and what changes ought to be made to improve media in Ireland in the future.  The commission's timely recommendations will inform the framework to help the Government to achieve this.</p> <p>  The insights the commission's report offers and its recommendations will feed into Government policy and directly impact the future of media in Ireland for the next ten years and beyond.  The Government accepted in principle 49 of the commission's 50 recommendations, demonstrating how committed the Government is to supporting the media sector as it transitions to new economic models.  With regard to the recommendation to replace the TV licence with a fully Exchequer-funded model, the Government decided that in these challenging economic times, we must balance the needs of the country and economy as a whole.  Our decision not to accept this recommendation was based on more than purely economic reasoning.  We must also ensure the continued independence of media and it is vital that we maintain a link between the creation and consumption of media content.</p> <p>  The Government recognises the need to reform the current funding model to ensure it provides for the new realities the sector faces and, importantly, is sustainable.  I have already set up a technical working group that will report to me in November with practical steps to improve the TV licence system to make it fairer and more efficient and sustainable.  A cornerstone of the commission's report and recommendations is a regulator with a wider remit to address the shift in media consumption - a media commission.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which is progressing through the Oireachtas, provides for the establishment of such a new media regulator, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n.  A media regulator must now go beyond broadcasting, and an coimisi&uacute;n will replace the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and have a broader role in relation to media as well as online safety.  It will thereby provide the regulatory and developmental framework to implement the commission's report.</p> <p>  Two of the initial commissioner roles - the broadcasting commissioner and the media development commissioner - will play a significant role in delivering on the Government's implementation of the Future of Media Commission report.  To help Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n hit the ground running, I secured funding in budget 2022 to enable an early establishment of the new body and competitions to fill commissioner posts are in train.</p> <p>  Another key recommendation from the commission is that the broadcasting fund be replaced by a new media fund, with six proposed new schemes added to the existing sound and vision and archiving schemes.  While the new fund will need to be underpinned by legislation, I have asked that two schemes be prioritised for development and roll-out in 2023 on a pilot basis.  These are the local democracy scheme, which will aim to ensure local media can keep the public informed on areas such as regional health forums, joint policing committees and local authorities, and the courts reporting scheme, which will enable improved reporting from local, regional and national courts.</p> <p>  The reform of the licence fee, together with the implementation of the commission's accepted recommendations will enable RT&Eacute; to build on its strengths as our national broadcaster.</p><p>Through digital innovation and strategic planning, and with the support of NewERA and Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, RT&Eacute; will further develop its mission to educate, entertain and enrich the lives of our people in a digital era.</p><p> Tugaim t&uacute;s &aacute;ite don Ghaeilge chomh maith ar leibh&eacute;al pearsanta agus gairmi&uacute;il.  TG4 fulfils a vital role in supporting the Irish language, sport and culture in an innovative way and I was pleased to provide TG4 with additional funding of &euro;4.2 million in budget 2022, building on a substantial increase in 2021, and leaving TG4 better funded than ever before.  This has enabled TG4 to continue its innovative approach, extend its reach, support the development of quality content, and highlight key cultural and sporting events and festivals.  I very much support the commission&rsquo;s recommendation that Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n conduct a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services.  Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will work with stakeholders to find synergies and build co-operation throughout the sector.</p><p> Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will continue and expand on BAI&rsquo;s sustainability network to further promote sustainability in the wider media sector.  I will also be asking an coimisi&uacute;n to prioritise the development of new gender equality and equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, standards for the sector to ensure greater representation and content that reflects Irish society today.  The recommended diversity and inclusion strategy for sports broadcasting and reporting will help us showcase more diverse sports across multiple platforms.</p><p> I strongly welcome the commission&rsquo;s recommendation to develop a national counter disinformation strategy.  My Department will lead on the strategy&rsquo;s development in the coming months.  We will work with the Irish hub of the European Digital Media Observatory, industry stakeholders, and with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department, which is overseeing the Digital Services Act.</p><p> The commission was well briefed on the challenges facing the print sector.  The expanded media fund will directly benefit the print sector, especially local media.  The proposed local democracy and court reporting schemes I referred to will directly benefit the print sector, in particular local and regional outlets.  The commission has also recommended a consideration of indirect taxation measures for the sector, and there will be engagement on this matter in the context of the implementation process.  The commission&rsquo;s recommendations will also benefit the radio sector in the years ahead, both from the widening of the sound and vision scheme to support news content, and from new media fund schemes, such as the media access and training scheme, the community media scheme and digital transformation scheme.</p><p> The implementation group established by the Government has now commenced its work with the initial task of developing a detailed implementation strategy, which I intend to bring to the Government in November.  I will also receive a report from the newly established technical working group on proposals to reform the TV licence system this November.  Together with the establishment of Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, this will enable the Government to deliver on its commitment to develop a framework to support our media sector for the next decade and beyond.</p><p> Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; cheana, aithn&iacute;onn an Rialtas an g&aacute; at&aacute; le hathchomhaireamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an m&uacute;nla maoinithe reatha chun a chinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; sol&aacute;thar d&rsquo;earn&aacute;il na me&aacute;n cumars&aacute;ide amach anseo.

The commission also considered potential challenges associated with other funding models.  As I said, the Government believes that maintaining a direct link between broadcasters and the public is important and reforming the TV licence fee system to make it more equitable and sustainable is the right action to take.  There are two reasons; it is about keeping a distance while also considering the context of where we are right now, in challenging times.</p> <p>  The Government is not ignoring the commission's recommendations; on the contrary, as Professor MacCraith said at the launch, we have agreed to accept and implement 49 of the 50 recommendations.  We absolutely recognise the fundamental societal value of public service content.  Irish media has served us extraordinarily well, which we have seen in recent years.  However, all funding models are challenging, as the commissioner said, and I believe any new or reformed funding model should retain and build on existing revenues given our current situation, which is from the direct sale of TV licences.  That provides an important, direct link between broadcasters and the public.  It would also reduce the burden on the Exchequer compared with a model based fully on taxation.</p></speech>

I am aware the Minister referred to the economic crisis, but there were reports in the media in February, long before the current economic and energy crises, that the Government was set not to accept the commission's main recommendation in the report.  The Minister also referred to the independence of media, but let us look at Nordic countries.  The committee had recommended the Norwegian method of funding, in which they have maintained their media independence which is crucial.</p> <p>  Given that it was supposed to be a long-term plan for public service media and for the future, it seems bizarre that the one recommendation that was the cornerstone of commissioning the report in the first instance was not accepted.</p></speech>

The technical working group is currently working on the reform of the TV licence, which is a long-term plan.  The Government was of the view that to move to an Exchequer-based funding model would raise certain concerns in respect of the independence of media funding.  We need to minimise the risk of actual or even perceived political interference in media independence that could arise in a system in which public service media is fully dependent on Exchequer funding, and that was our concern.  The report of the commission states that there is no perfect funding model, and that all funding models are challenging, as I said.  Any new or reformed funding model should retain and build on the existing revenue available.  That is what the technical group is examining and it will report to me in November.</p></speech>

If the model remains as it is and there is no long-term future plan to change the funding mechanism, what supports will be put in place?  Does the Minister have an answer to this or is she waiting on the group to report in November in order to support An Post in dealing with the high percentage of evasion?

I join her in thanking all of the members of the Future of Media Commission who did such excellent work and who have been so engaging during the Covid pandemic and at other times in holding webinars and encouraging debate.  They have been extremely helpful in formulating discourse on this very important topic.</p> <p> With regard to the technical group the Minister has established, the basic principles of providing news have not changed substantially in hundreds of years.  I refer to the work reporters do in ascertaining basic information, reporting on it and then conveying it to the public.  What has changed is how we access that news not just in terms of broadcast media, but also print media.  What all of the media organisations are struggling with is the revenue streams that underpin that or the lack thereof.  Notwithstanding the work that is going on and which the technical group is doing, is the Minister worried about the future of media, both broadcast and print media - and national and regional newspaper editors are going to be in the audiovisual room tomorrow, which is something I will address in a moment - as a viable commercial enterprise?  I ask her that in the context of the Government's decision that directly intervening, abolishing the TV licence fee and providing direct Exchequer funding might result in a perception of political interference in the media sector, whether such interference is real or not.  There is a fear that, notwithstanding any reform of the TV licence fee, it will not meet the funding requirements of RT&Eacute;.  Is the Minister worried that the commercial viability of RT&Eacute; is under threat?</p></speech>

On the broader context, I believe that the 49 recommendations that have been accepted in principle by Government and the work that has been done on the reform of the TV licence will put us in a good place.  The establishment by the Government of the Future of Media Commission was a recognition that something had to change.  As the Senator has said, it has to do with how people now access media.  I will point to the media fund.  The commission recommended additional funding of &euro;15 million for the new media fund.  The detail of that additional funding will be agreed in the context of the budgetary negotiations.  I have already engaged with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath's Department in that regard.  The introduction of this new media fund will be a significant step towards the support that, as the Senator has said, is needed to allow the media to continue in their vital role, which we all recognise.  This is also very true at local and regional levels as well.  I refer to local radio and local newspapers.  I have asked that priority be given to the roll-out of two of the schemes, the local democracy and court reporting schemes.  All of us, and especially those of us who come from rural Ireland, know how important such reporting is, whether on radio or in print.  I have asked that work be done on that.  I expect that the new Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will be in a position to commence these schemes in 2023.  The work will start with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  That will ensure reporting on the joint policing committees, the regional health forums, our local authorities and so on.  The existing-----</p></speech>

In January of this year, RT&Eacute; reappraised its losses from evasion from &euro;50 million to &euro;65 million, which is a very significant amount of money.  It is continuing to go in one direction.  On top of that, there is also the hit to its commercial revenue streams, which are being gobbled up by other platforms.  When RT&Eacute; launched its autumn schedule this year, the point was made that, unless stability was brought to funding streams, the high quality of internal productions could not be guaranteed.  By the way, the Future of Media Commission itself said that the system is broken.  RT&Eacute; has also said that.  The funding system is broken.  The Minister has established a technical group to see how to fix that.  Notwithstanding that, entities sometimes die.  Is there a fear that this particular model of news consumption, not just in Ireland but globally, is on its knees?</p></speech>

The Government is absolutely committed to our national broadcaster and to helping it operate on a more secure financial footing.  NewERA and my Department will continue to engage with RT&Eacute; on its financial situation and the commitment to deliver savings and efficiencies under the revised strategy for 2020 to 2024.  I support the commission's recommendation to designate RT&Eacute; as a body to be supported by NewERA under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990.  This will guarantee independent oversight of RT&Eacute;'s finances.  The Future of Media Commission also saw an enhanced role for Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n in setting targets for RT&Eacute; and monitoring how well RT&Eacute; achieves these targets.  I also welcome the commission's recommendation that RT&Eacute; institute a strategic capital asset management plan.</p><p>This will help RT&Eacute; focus on optimum use of available resources in the medium and long term.</p><p> Having carefully considered the commission's analysis and recommendations on reforming the public funding model, we agree with its conclusion that the funding model should be reformed.  However, we are of the clear view that a move to fully Exchequer-based funding raises certain concerns.  That is why we believe that any reformed funding model should retain and build on existing revenue from the direct sale of TV licences.  It should minimise the risk of actual or perceived interference and should reduce the burden on the Exchequer.  It should be future-proofed, such that revenues will increase-----</p></speech>

The decision is made and the Minister will not change that.  It is about reform.  Let us talk about future-proofing because it has been identified that 282,000 homes in this country do not have a traditional TV set.  If we start billing for access to this, how can we bill?  Many young people are accessing an app to download their news through RT&Eacute; News Now, Sky News or whatever, where they might be paying the provider but are paying nothing to the State.  Is that the manner in which the Minister talks about future-proofing because that trend of 282,000 homes is only set to increase?  That is what I talk about with regard to sustainability of the model that RT&Eacute; has now.</p> <p>  I could get into a debate that we should support RT&Eacute; through direct Exchequer funding to protect something that the State requires.  I do not believe that the State interferes but that decision has been made.  I accept that.  What I do not accept is that future-proofing will address the fact that the trends are changing so rapidly.  Will we really be able to get the revenues?  Will there be a targeting of people in terms of accessing news here?  There is also a suggestion that the local property tax, LPT, database will be used with regard to the evasion rate of 15%.  We see LPT collection is at 97%.  Will the LPT database be used to ensure that people are not evading the licence fee any more?</p></speech>

It takes into account public possession, burden of proof, enforcement challenges and legal issues.  It includes the revenue-generation potential of different options and an assessment of those issues and any issues arising.  It covers collection, enforcement and implementation.</p> <p>  No decisions have been taken on the database.  The technical group is just up and running, is meeting and will come back to me in November.  However, I asked for an examination of the data sets necessary to effectively implement that.  That means legal obstacles to the sharing of data and potential solutions in this regard as well as the technical and cost requirements for the development and maintenance of an appropriate database and the timescale.  I will forward the terms of reference to the committee.  The points the Senator has raised there are exactly what we hope this technical group will forensically examine and report back to me.</p></speech>

They have particular calls to ensure that we have newspapers continuing into the future.  There is a problem here.  The model is broken by virtue of the fact that young people, in particular, but also people my own age are not buying news in the traditional fashion that they used to.  I had the amazing experience of going into a local shop here in the city centre and asking for a newspaper only to be told they do not stock them any more.  It is frightening.  We have seen newsrooms be absolutely decimated by cuts.  We saw the Irish edition of <i>The Sunday Times</i>release a huge number of journalists just before the summer.  A number of them were exceptionally good journalists who worked in here and covered political events.  I welcome the court reporting scheme and the local democracy scheme.  I commend the Minister and the commission on seeking to implement them.  This will be very significant.</p><p>However, I will go back to the commercial viability of newspapers.  We can provide all the reporters we want but if there is no publication, they will not be reporting for anybody.  One of the requests is to cut VAT on print and digital newspapers to 0%.  We will have to have a serious conversation with publishers and newspapers about their commercial viability.  We will be putting good money after bad if things are in trouble.  I wish to hear the Minister's opinion on the propositions that are coming forward from newspapers and the seeking of the reduction to 0% VAT in the budget.</p></speech>

Ultimately, VAT is a matter for the Minister for Finance but I have raised it with him and ongoing budgetary negotiations are happening on those issues and others.  We mentioned local democracy and we looked at the court reporting scheme but it is by supporting content we will be supporting print.  We looked at the other schemes such as the support for digital transformation and running those schemes.  The support for access and training is intended to develop bursaries, internships, diversity training and that presents opportunities for new and existing staff.  I believe that will help.  The reason this commission was set up was that I could see the crisis that was happening because of the change in access.  What has been recommended here will make the difference.</p></speech>

That is the correct way to do it because it ensures that they will be taking that content.  A point to note is that we used to have Oireachtas reporters here who provided local and regional newspapers and radio with content from what happened here and the Houses of the Oireachtas got rid of that.  That was a retrograde step.  I wish to put that on the record.</p></speech>

I commend the Future of Media Commission on its work and Professor MacCraith on a brilliant document.  It would have been very helpful to have the document in advance of the passage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 through the Seanad.  I am obviously disappointed.  It is a regret.</p> <p>  I will also come to the defence of the recommendation that has been made on general Exchequer funding.  The issue of independence has been raised many times over the years when it comes to general funding of RT&Eacute; or public service broadcasting through general taxation.  The Department of Social Protection, through the household benefit package, already covers TV licences for 483,000 homes at a cost of &euro;70 million.  That is approximately 31% of TV licence revenues.  There is no suggestion of interference when we take that into account.  TG4 has always been funded by general taxation from the Exchequer.  As there is never any suggestion of interference when we think about TG4, I do not accept the argument of interference a whole lot.</p> <p>  There is also the benefit general taxation would have in producing prosecutions.  In 2020, there were 9,555 summons.  Approximately 4,000 of those cases went to court.  Those prosecutions - what a waste of everyone's time - would be done away with through general taxation.</p><p>While I know An Post needs the money, those costs would probably not be in the mix through general taxation.  It is important that we come to its defence that.  Funding RT&Eacute; through general taxation is a good suggestion.</p><p> The Minister has said that reform of the television licence together with the accepted recommendations will enable RT&Eacute; to build on its strengths.  How much of the gap will be filled?  RT&Eacute; reckons that the loss through no-television homes is &euro;35 million along with an evasion loss of &euro;30 million.  The technical working group is due to report by November.  How much of the gap will be filled by measures it might propose?</p></speech>

Both broadcasters receive a mix of public funding and commercially generated revenue.  RT&Eacute; receives 37% of its revenues from advertising but TG4 got 10% from this source.  As the Senator said, RT&Eacute;'s funding comes mainly from the television licence, but TG4 is now funded directly by the Exchequer.  TG4 gets its news content directly from RT&Eacute; and that is a slight difference regarding his point about interference.  The technical group is working on closing that gap as much as possible.  That is its goal in reforming this model.</p></speech>

We have seen what happened in Australia and some EU member states with the Article 15 of the copyright directive.  The report of the Future of Media Commission states:</p> <blockquote> 	There is a need to rebalance the relationship between media and Big Tech.  The Commission sees strong potential for direct negotiations between media and Big Tech, in the context of the EU Copyright Directive, to achieve that rebalancing.  However, should these negotiations prove insufficient, the Commission is of the view that the Government should then be prepared to move swiftly to pursue additional measures... </blockquote> <p>This relates to remuneration for journalists when their stories are used by social media platforms and shared online.  If those negotiations prove insufficient, is the Government prepared to move swiftly to pursue additional measures, as Australia has pursued?  That relates to Article 15 of the copyright directive. </p></speech>

I am aware of one broadcaster that is working on that issue with the big tech company.  That is outside what we are discussing on the commission.  The report recommends an assessment of the impact of the copyright directive.  The second group, the implementation group, will look at that.  That copyright directive comes under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It recommends that it be implemented as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The last time the Minister appeared before the committee, I asked about the RT&Eacute; Player and Government supporting RT&Eacute; in the digital transformation.  I did not challenge her on it that day.  She said there would be no top-ups to RT&Eacute;.  In the past we have seen top-ups to RT&Eacute; in the last mandate prior to the election.  The commission has called for targeted public investment to enable RT&Eacute; and TG4 to undertake the capital investment necessary to support their digital transformation strategies.  Ms Dee Forbes has told us how much she estimates the RT&Eacute; Player will need but I am sure there are other issues.  Will the Minister consider targeted public investment on that front?</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; has acknowledged publicly that there is room for improvement with that.  RT&Eacute; operates in a different environment.  The growth of streaming services and on-demand content means that traditional broadcasters need to catch up quickly and meet viewers' expectations.  The Future of Media Commission report acknowledged the requirement for increased investment in digital and technological innovation.  I agree that RT&Eacute; needs to complete its digital transformation by investing in and improving its technology, particularly streaming services such as the RT&Eacute; Player.  To support a number of key strategic initiatives, the organisation disposed of some land at its Donnybrook campus in 2017.  The net proceeds of this are ring-fenced for specific purposes, including investment in digital.  This will be progressed with RT&Eacute; in the context of implementing the commission's report.  Anything else will be met by whatever is already there from our point of view.</p></speech>

This committee frequently discusses archiving when representatives from the National Archives come in.  The digital legal deposit is not mentioned in this report.  Given how much archiving is mentioned in the report, I cannot let the opportunity pass to ask where we are with the digital legal deposit that would enable the systematic capturing of the ".ie" domain by the National Library, for example.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, is now in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and probably has responsibility for this.  Has the Minister met him?  I am blue in the face from raising this over the years as we lose our country's memory as it disappears from the web.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late when she gave her introduction.  Along with a number of my Fine Gael colleagues, we made a submission to the Future of Media Commission.  We met representatives of many of the media organisations, regional newspapers, regional radio stations, etc.  There is strong support for media content in Ireland.  Page 39 shows the reported levels of trust in specific media and technology providers, including RT&Eacute;, TG4, local radio stations, newspapers and Irish based websites.  It is more than 70%, which is very high, whereas the new social media sources listed are down at 34%.</p><p>It is quite telling that the support is there from the public to support the content across all those media.  Like other colleagues, I feel that we hedged not making a decision on the television licence, which was a recommendation of the report.  We need to go down the route of direct taxation if we are going to maintain all media sources.  We must put enough funding in to make sure we are able to maintain regional newspapers and radio stations and RT&Eacute;, which has eaten up a chunk of the money.  We need a significant fund.  I do not see that we are going to reach the figure we need bar seeking funding directly from the Exchequer.</p><p> There are a number of positive proposals.  Nearly everything we put forward in our proposal forms part of the recommendations.  I concur with Senator Cassells, however, with regard to the re-establishing of reporters in the Houses of the Oireachtas Service, who were there up until four or five years ago.  That would be important.  I ask that this perhaps be taken on board.  The direct comments of any of us who represent people and organisations throughout the country could then be sent to regional newspapers and radio stations.  That was stopped approximately five or six years ago.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-14a.634" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022091400002#G00300"><p>Was it?  I ask that this perhaps be looked at.  It would be positive and would provide content for the regional and local newspapers.  I also support the local democracy scheme and the court reporting scheme, which we also looked at.  There is a model in the UK whereby they take it out of the licence fee and fund reporters who then supply that information from either the county council meetings or the courts.  That information is then made available to all the local radio stations and newspapers.  It is something we need to look at to make sure we maintain the viability of the regional newspapers.</p> <p>  I concur with comments saying that we need to look at the VAT.  The Minister will meet with NewsBrands Ireland in the next week and it will bring that proposal.  However, as a retailer with a small shop who sells newspapers, and I will say this when I meet with NewsBrands Ireland's representatives, I have witnessed the decline in newspaper sales over the past number of years.  One little issue is that many of the newspapers are attached to different distribution networks.  Some businesses do not carry certain newspapers because they have to pay two delivery charges.  That is aside from this report.  Newspaper owners need to consider that in order that all newspapers are supplied to all retailers who wish to sell the newspaper.  They are reducing their sales by going down that route.</p> <p>  Significant funding goes into RT&Eacute; every year.  It is looking for more money yet we regularly get reports on the significant high wage levels within the structure in RT&Eacute;.  We recently saw a report on how something like 100-odd managers earn more than &euro;100,000 per year in that organisation.  That would not compare to any other business or organisation.</p> <p>  There was also a recommendation regarding sport, which is welcome.  Since the 2020 campaign, which the committee has discussed previously, there has been more reporting on women's sport and reporting by women commentators in recent years, even the women's international soccer team.  We are only starting to show these sports on various forms of media.</p> <p>  Other active sports out there get little coverage, however.  We need to look at that.  The report mentions sports such as swimming, running and cycling.  We want to make a more active population who are invested in sport.  We need to see more alternative sports on our media and not just concentrate on the three main national governing body sports.  That is very positive.  I do not have any further comments.  I will listen to the Minister's comments and I might come back in again shortly.</p></speech>

It may be something he could ask a colleague on the commission to raise.  I take his point on distribution, although that is probably for the businesses to engage on.  He referred to salaries in RT&Eacute;.  That is an operational matter and, therefore, it would not be inappropriate for me to say anything on that.  Has RT&Eacute; not engaged with the committee on this issue?</p> <p>  The Senator raised the recommendation on sport, which I know he has a genuine interest in from our engagement in the Seanad.  There are some fantastic recommendations to take away the traditional focus and exploit modern technology to showcase a greater variety of sports across multiple formats and feature people with disabilities or minority sports.  Coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, when it is set up, will work with the media organisations, Sport Ireland and the Federation of Irish Sport to develop a strategy to promote diversity and gender equality, and examine making sport-related equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, standards a condition of receiving grants from public funding.  I strongly believe we need to create more opportunities to showcase greater diversity in sport in Ireland.  I am in full agreement with the Senator on that.  Again, this is something on which the commission has made recommendations.  The setting up of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n will be the perfect enabler of that.  The implementation group I have set up will hopefully come back to me in November with the plan for implementation and timeline on how it will be done.</p></speech>

I feel strongly and passionately about all of this.  I was that European Commission President von der Leyen make a strong speech this morning about where we are in terms of our democracy and the fragility of our democracy.  This is our big opportunity to do something about that in this country, not just with the Future of Media Commission but also with the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  We have to really take this seriously.</p><p>We have to make a big commitment to ensure that our media outlets are allowed to continue, that they are not weakened by running after advertisements all the time and that they are given the space to allow journalists to be journalists and report on what is important.  They are the most important people we come across when we talk about democracy.  We have voices here but we must have that outlet for the media and journalists.  As discussed by Senator Cassells, <i>The Sunday Times </i>let 11 senior journalists go over the summer.  That is frightening but it comes down to money and sustainability.  Those types of outlets are trusted media outlets.  They are the media outlets on which people depend and rely upon, and that they read and know as being objective and balanced.  President Von der Leyen talked about outside influences.  It has been happening for years.  Europe has not taken that seriously.  We have not taken that seriously as individual countries.  I hope that not only by her recognition of that today but by talking about putting money into that now, we are beginning to wake up and smell the coffee about how we and the public are being influenced by fake news and so forth.  We have a big opportunity.  I encourage the Minister to continue the work she is doing in grasping that.</p><p>I thank commission members who made these 50 recommendations, all of which, as Senator Carrigy said, we came up with in our own reports.  We concur with all of that.  There is talk in the Minister's Department about the national counter-disinformation strategy.  Could the Minister tease that out a little more for us?  I am very passionate about that aspect of all of this.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, that diverse independent media sector is essential for the wider society and, as she said, our democracy, cultural development, well-being and social cohesion.  Its content is a reflection of us as a society.</p><p>Never have we felt that more than in the last few years.  What the Chairman is really talking about is disinformation and I agree with her that it is one of the major challenges to democracy in our era.</p></speech>

Covid emphasised the critical importance and fragility of our good media outlets.  Again, I concur with what my colleagues have said.  As the Minister will know, we will have a delegation from NewsBrands Ireland in tomorrow.  I encourage her and her officials to attend, if possible, as it is important.</p><p>NewsBrands Ireland has asked for a cut in VAT.  I advocate for that because I have seen the critical role played by my local newspapers, <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>and <i>The Northern Standard</i>, in local communities.  I know how difficult it is for local newspapers to have a section dedicated to chasing after advertisements and the fragile position of journalists so we should do anything that we can to provide support.  NewsBrands Ireland has asked for a cut in VAT so it can fund the digitalisation of its outlets, and I support its call.  I ask the Minister to please use her influence on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance as we come up to the budget to secure a cut in VAT.</p><p>I wish to raise an issue with the Minister as it is important that we lead from the front.  I agree with my colleagues here today that we had a very good department within the Oireachtas that reported on what was being talked about in committees, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and reported with great forensic detail to <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>, the <i>Dundalk Democrat, The Northern Standard</i>and all other newspapers.  That service provided fresh and hot-off-the-press news and content.  Even though I know this matter is not part of the remit of the Minister's Department, I will ask the clerk to the committee to research how this decision was reached.  We must lead by example and this is our opportunity to find out what happened to those journalists, where did they go and why was the decision made because it does not bode well for the fact that we are all saying here that journalism and the trusted outlets are so important.  I do not believe that reporting happens in the same way that it did in the past.  There is a media and communications outlet within the Oireachtas campus but I think we have missed an opportunity.  I ask the clerk to conduct research on how we can tease out whether the right decision was made and analyse how we might move forward.  Do my colleagues support my suggestion?  Yes.</p></speech>

Are the 49 recommendations achievable without delivery on the one recommendation that the Minister has not accepted?

One of the reasons there is a high evasion rate is because you must have a television set.  I believe that if every household was liable, there would be a far higher collection rate.  Twenty years ago, you could purchase either a licence for a black and white television or a colour television.  The vast majority of people opted to buy the licence for a black and white television because it was cheaper.  The reason for a high evasion rate now is the fact that every individual household does not have to purchase a licence and I believe that Exchequer funding the scheme is the right way to go.</p></speech>
