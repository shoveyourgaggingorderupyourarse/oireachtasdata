He is joined by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Kate O'Connell.  The minutes of previous meetings are being held over and will be cleared next week.</p><p>There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is category A with briefing documents and opening statements.  No. 1745 A from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is dated 23 November.  It provides briefing notes for today&rsquo;s meeting on the various chapters, the outturn figures and various summary documents.  These are noted and will be published.</p><p>Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee, as well as other documents for publishing.  At last week&rsquo;s meeting, we dealt with a number of matters held over from previous meetings and left a few to be deal with.  No. 1560 B dated 7 September 2018 is from the president of Cork Institute of Technology.  It provides a detailed note requested by the committee on the preparation of the terms of reference for the KPMG review of anonymous allegations against Cork Institute of Technology in 2014.  We have discussed that.  It will be noted and published.  We will deal with it as part of the committee's upcoming periodic report.</p><p>No. 1637 B from the Office of Public Works provides the managing valuer's report on five historical cases on foot of a preceding submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have advised the correspondent that we may request a meeting with the individual in due course.  This matter has been discussed previously.  I propose to note and publish it.</p><p>No.1684 B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is dated 24 October 2018 and encloses a minute from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on the third periodic report of our meetings from January to May 2018.  This will take a few minutes as it is the biggest item of correspondence.  I ask members to bear with me as we go through that.  We will first agree to note and publish the document.  It relates to the report the committee published on 11 July 2018 that covered a range of Departments.  The document contained 39 recommendations for the various Departments, 30 of which have been accepted and nine of which have not been accepted.  I do not intend reading out the document because it is 27 pages long.  We will briefly run through each recommendation.</p><p>Recommendation A1 was that a business case be made for all proposed major capital expenditure projects above a certain threshold.  The Department accepts that and is now updating its guidance as part of the public spending code, which is to be published.  We will write to the Department to ask when we can expect to see a copy of that.  It is very easy for a Department to accept a recommendation, but we are interested in how it follows through.  We want to know when the change to the guidelines will happen.</p><p>Recommendation A2 concerns public bodies that do not adhere to procurement policy.  It has not been accepted by the Department.  The committee had recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform examine &quot;the imposition of appropriate sanctions for public bodies that do not adhere to public procurement policy.&quot;  The official reply indicates the recommendation has been noted and that the matter raised is for each contracting body, with the Department acting in a supervisory capacity.  It is interesting that the Department does not accept the principle involved.  It states this is a matter of good governance for each individual Department.  We stand by our recommendation and it is disappointing that it has not been accepted.</p><p>Recommendations B1 and B2 related to the Valuation Office's national property revaluation programme.  The office accepts all of the recommendations.  We were not satisfied with the timescales and the delays in revaluations, which was the basis for one recommendation.  The Valuation Office accepts that and has a new plan whereby they will do a revaluation every five years.</p><p>Recommendation B3 covers the variety of payment methods that should be allowed for ratepayers who, until now, must pay their rates bill in one or two annual instalments.  That has been accepted and agreed.  The change will be made in the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018.</p><p>Recommendation B4 addressed the sequence of the revaluation and how the Valuation Office chooses the counties to be included in the programme.  We asked it to present the logic for tis decisions.  The office stated the first revaluation is almost complete and that future revaluations will be conducted on a rolling basis of five to ten years.  There were some owner-assisted revaluations and some external contractors also did some revaluations.  We suggested the Valuation Office carry out a review to determine which is the most efficient and effective approach.  It has accepted that recommendation but states that it &quot;will have to be considered in the context of the overall funding allocation for the Housing<font color="#2F2F2F">, </font>Planning and Local Government Vote Group.&quot;  The Minister indicated that the Department will make funding available to facilitate this.  We will write to the Department to find out how much money has been included in the 2019 Estimates to implement recommendation B5.  Recommendation B6, which recommends an independent external review, has been accepted.  The Valuation Office has accepted, in so far as possible, all of our recommendations.</p><p>Recommendation B7 concerns the National Shared Services Office and the management of salary overpayments.  The office accepts the recommendation and has established a new committee to liaise with clients to ensure there is proper agreement and understanding.  It wants to root out overpayments at source, which arise mainly from people being absent and notification not being given quickly enough.  We note, however, that the office seems to be improving in that area.</p><p>We asked what savings will be achieved as a result of the establishment of the National Shared Services Office.  The correspondence states: &quot;The Minister is further informed by that Office that the process for planning the evaluation of savings from the implementation of the Shared Services model has commenced.&quot;  The committee will write to the Minister to ask when this evaluation will be completed and seek a copy of the report.</p><p>The next recommendation from our periodic report related to the Dormant Accounts Fund, which was a disaster in terms of how it was managed.  The key issue was that responsibility for the fund transferred to various Departments over the years.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development currently has statutory responsibility for the dormant accounts disbursement scheme.  Some good recommendations made by the committee have been accepted.  We suggested that a substantial amount of money that had been locked in to older projects that were not going to proceed be decommitted.  The Department has confirmed that an action plan has resulted in decommittals totalling just over &euro;16.5 million and these moneys are now available to fund new measures in future action plans.  This is very welcome, and it is good that the Department has accepted our recommendation on the Dormant Accounts Fund because it was one of our more important recommendations.  The committee also recommended that the fund be maintained by one body to provide a stable platform for its effective administration.  As I stated, responsibility for the fund has been moved from Department to Department.  The Department notes our response and states that the allocation of responsibility for the fund is a matter for the Government and, ultimately, the Taoiseach.  We accept that response and that it is a matter for the Taoiseach to outline ministerial responsibilities.</p><p> The final recommendation, B14, concerns reviewing the scheme.  This is very important.  The committee recommended that the Department review the dormant accounts application process.  We felt it was overly complicated.  Our recommendation has been accepted and that is good.  The Department acknowledged that the assessment and selection procedures, in particular, would appear to be superfluous.  It also stated that some of the rules and recommendations go far beyond the normal accountability for Exchequer funds.  The Department has, therefore, accepted that some of the procedures were unnecessary and superfluous.  It is now dealing with that.</p><p> The next item was the decommittal of funds and that recommendation has also been accepted.  We will watch this space for future improvement.  It has been accepted, however, that some of the application procedures were overly and unnecessarily complicated, and the recommendation has been agreed to that some funds should be decommitted and available for new applications.  Those are two good achievements.</p><p> Our next recommendations were to a Department that, by and large, accepted very few of our recommendations.  I refer to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It noted everything we said but does not seem to have accepted any of it.  The committee recommended that the flow of funds from central government to local government be reviewed to simplify the process.  That was noted by the Department and it stated that the Comptroller and Auditor General has a chart which explains it all.  I think that chart highlighted how complex the whole issue was rather than simplifying it.  We will be coming back to that Department because, in its answers, it has not taken on board the spirit of what we were saying.  It might be understood by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Accounting Officer, but the public also needs to be able to understand these things.  The Department has not simplified the issue.</p><p> We also spoke of the fragmented nature of funding for local authorities from the different Departments.  That has also been noted.  The Department also stated that a review group has been established by the Minister to bring greater balance and equity for local authorities.  That is the funding model and that is being examined.  It was recommendation B18 and we are writing to the Minister to see when we might see that implemented.</p><p> The next item is about roads.  The Department has stated that it is providing additional funding for serious road accident blackspots.  The next recommendation, B20, was noted.  That was where the committee recommended that there should be a &euro;5 charge for online transactions for taxing cars and that the excessive charge for the quarterly issue of tax discs should be reduced.  The response from the Department states that this would be a charge on the Exchequer.  It is being stated by the Department that the cost of &euro;5 for each online transaction is actually closer to &euro;10.  That does not tally fully with what we understood from the evidence here during the course of our meeting.  In any event, the Department has stated that any such change would require an amendment to section 152 of the relevant legislation.  We will note and publish this and if any Member or party feels that it is worth amending the legislation, a Private Members' Bill can be brought forward.  We have highlighted the issue now.</p><p> The next item is in respect of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  This concerns inspections.  The Department has accepted recommendation B22 and states that there has been some duplication where local authorities were inspecting private rental accommodation which might also be covered by a HAP inspection.  The Department makes a disappointing remark, but I admire the honesty.  It stated that while the inspections are being undertaken widely by local authorities, not every local authority is recording data for every HAP tenancy on the dedicated HAP system.  Inspectors are walking in and out, saying accommodation is grand and keeping no record.  That is a recommendation we need to follow up.  The Department admitted that inspectors are not recording their inspections.  That is extraordinary.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112900002#C00600"><p>The last paragraph states that the Department accepts the recommendation and it highlights the particular problem which I just explained.  The Department continues by stating that it is expected that by the end of 2018 sufficient progress will have been made to integrate the recording systems and provide an inspection status on all active HAP tenancies on an ongoing basis.  We will write to the Minister requesting a copy of that report early in the new year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112900002#C00700"><p>How will that work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112900002#C00800"><p>The Department has said it is working on it, so we will follow up on that.  I thank the members.  We are getting there.  Next are the recommendations in respect of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  There were several recommendations in respect of the Galway art house cinema.  The Department has accepted all of them, that is, recommendations B23, B24 and B25, and stated that it has learned many lessons.  It is a historic issue at this stage but lessons have been learned from that.  The Department has also accepted that it should have had more oversight and that is the system it is planning to use for future projects.</p> <p>  The recommendations we made to Department of Finance are next.  The committee recommended that the Department prioritise the production of a consolidated central government financial statement.  That has been accepted and the Department is working on it with the help of the OECD.  Recommendation B29 was to bring forward proposals to improve co-ordination in Government accounting, including the various State bodies.  That has been accepted and is also part of the review being undertaken with the OECD.</p> <p>  We recommended also that the Minister for Finance should endeavour to make sure progress was made in respect of the use of gross national income (Star), GNI*, for measuring activity in national income.  The Department accepted that measurement is very clear but stated that it is not a European rule.  The official reply stated several times that there is no legal status for GNI* as it is purely a domestic measure and it is not defined in the European system of accounts.  We understand that.  The Department stated that the consent of all of the other European Union countries would be needed to change the European system of accounts.  It added, however, that the European Commission, while it uses the normal GNI and not the Irish GNI*, does take the GNI* measurement into account when dealing with Ireland.  GNI* does not, however, have legal standing and to change that would require a European Union change.  It has accepted that the point was well made at this committee.  GNI* is only a domestic figure and not an internationally accepted figure but the European Commission does take it into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112900002#C00900"><p>On that, it is important to restate that the European Commission might take GNI* into account in that it accepts that is the figure that is used, but that is meaningless.  It is the gross domestic product, GDP, figure that is used to calculate and implement the fiscal rules, or any rules.  The application of any policy is based on GDP.</p></speech>

It continues by stating that it also needs to be assessed against complementary indicators such as debt to GNI*.  It is accepting everything that has been said, but the rules are the rules, and they are European rules.  The GNI* measure is taken into account when the stability report for Ireland is being issued but the measure still does not have legal standing.</p></speech>

The problem, however, is that the EU fiscal rules use debt to GDP and not debt to GNI*.   In the presentation of reports, therefore, the European Commission might reflect the fact that GNI* is more accurate.  My point, however, is that it is meaningless in respect of policy.</p></speech>

It is based on the EU-wide standard, which in reality means Ireland is paying a higher contribution to the EU each year because that contribution is based on the European legal definition rather than our domestic GNI* measure.</p></speech>

We said:  &quot;The Committee recommends that the Chief State Solicitor's Office ensures its oversight mechanisms are sufficient to prevent reoccurrence of this unacceptable waste of taxpayers' money&quot;.  That relates to where the Probation Service took over a building in Wolfe Tone Street in Dublin but the building was never occupied.  We were told that advice from the Office of the Chief Solicitor was based on &quot;legal professional privilege&quot;, and it is good.  They accept this.</p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has replied in writing that, &quot;The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will commence a process with relevant law officers to examine how legal professional privilege will be protected in future in a manner which is, so far as possible, consistent with the accountability role of the PAC.&quot;  The Department has accepted that we have a valid point, that it will go as far as it can to meet that in future but there will always be the issue of legal privilege.  However, the Department has accepted it needs to go the road with us, in terms of public accountability, which is good to see.</p><p>The next item is the Toland report on the Department of Justice and Equality and that Department accepted the view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We know there is an ongoing programme for change in the Department.  We will continue to raise this matter when the Department comes before us again.  The Committee of Public Accounts recommended a number of steps to monitor the follow-through in terms of this matter, and the Department is doing so.  We can return to this matter, at any stage, when we deal with the Department again.</p><p>The next section deals with the strategic communications unit in the Department of the Taoiseach and that Department accepted our recommendation that &quot;this process should proceed in the manner outlined by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach in his review of the operation of the Strategic Communications Unit.&quot;  We accept the review conducted by the Secretary General.  The Department of the Taoiseach made matters clear, in terms of implementing that review, and I will read a couple of the points it made.  The Committee of Public Accounts recommended &quot;that public bodies should always ensure that they retain the right to sign off&quot; on documentation.  The Department stated that the following guidelines concerning paid content are now in place: </p><blockquote>(1) Any sponsored or paid-for feature articles should continue to be clearly identifiable ... and they should state clearly that the copy is 'advertorial', 'advertisement', 'sponsored' or a 'commercial feature'<br /><br />(2) Where media partnerships or agencies (third parties) are used, final editorial control or 'sign-off' must be by the relevant Department<br /><br />(3) Should anyone be interviewed for an advertorial or infomercial, they should be informed of the purpose and their permission sought.</blockquote> <p>That means people welcoming issues but not knowing that it is part of a paid advertisement.  The final guideline is as follows: </p><blockquote>(4) Politicians and public representatives should not feature in any paid-for content by Government other than relevant office-holders (Ministers).</blockquote> <p>That clarifies the entire issue.</p><p>The final matter is RT&Eacute; and its licensing system.  The minute states that a working group was established, that there were proposals before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, that it has sent proposals to Government and on 28 July a working group was established, arising out of the pre-legislative scrutiny by that committee.  The working group will report to the Joint  Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The working group will also consider the possibility of the collection of the licence fee by the Revenue Commissioners or contracting externally for licence fee collection as provided for in the Broadcasting Amendment Bill.  There is no commitment; it is just being examined.  </p><p>Finally, RT&Eacute; has accepted the final recommendation we made about the Eversheds report.  </p></speech>

As I said, several employees contacted me a number of weeks ago because RT&Eacute;'s management still has not contacted them.  At our last meeting, I sought a breakdown of the 157 reviews in terms of the 433 contracts.  I also asked what was done, how many people were contacted and, if not, why.  I sought that information last week because the workers have said that if RT&Eacute; accepts the recommendations then the recommendations should have been implemented.</p></speech>

Most of the other Departments accepted the vast majority of everything that we recommended and we are following up on the implementation of those recommendations.  That completes our consideration of the largest item of correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1703, from the CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, on a request from the committee for a copy of a report arising from a value for money review of Irish public bodies.  The report is subject to a non-disclosure agreement between the LGMA, Irish Public Bodies, IPB, insurance and PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The CEO has written to both bodies to request their consent for LGMA to release the report and awaits a response.  The secretariat of this committee will keep an eye on this matter and we will update the committee on the current position in December.  We note and publish that.  I think we have mentioned this matter in public session before.</p> <p>  No. 1725 is from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills regarding the structural assessments carried out in schools constructed by Western Building Systems.  We agreed to note and publish this item and to request a briefing from the Department when we meet them in the New Year.  When the Department of Education and Skills appears before use we will raise this matter with its representatives.  We will note and publish the document that we had here last week.</p> <p>  No. 1731 is from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, dated 19 November 2018.  This is the signed performance delivery agreement between the Department and Galway 2020.  We noted an unsigned version of this document at last week's meeting so we note and publish this now.</p> <p>  No. 1737 is from Ms Jackie Maguire, chairperson of the County and City Management Association, dated 20 November 2018, in relation to the committee's request for a representative to attend a meeting on housing.  The association has provided some information on housing but has declined our request to attend.  We have already requested the association to review an earlier decision.  The association states it will provide information and assistance to the Accounting Officer, that is, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, who is the accountable person to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I believe that members are very disappointed that senior public servants in local authorities, who are at the front line when it comes to dealing with the housing crisis, have decided not to make themselves available, on a voluntary basis, to assist the Committee of Public Accounts in its examination of matters pertaining to housing.  We note and publish it.  We asked for advice and assistance and never suggested that those concerned were within the remit of, or accountable to, the Committee of Public Accounts.  We stressed that attendance was voluntary.  I am very disappointed that senior public servants chose not to attend.  We will return to the issue because we will have a second meeting to discuss the housing issue early in the new year.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Cullinane.</p></speech>

The non-attendance is an act of bad faith and it is not good enough to just furnish us with information.  We want to examine the issue of housing and one of the biggest issues is the relationship between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and local authorities.  That is one of the obvious links, and especially in an environment where Ministers and the Department have put some of the blame and responsibility  on local authorities for maybe not moving quickly enough or not being ambitious enough in terms of their own plans.  I refer, for example, to local authorities not using the money that the Department claims is available.  The public servants not have done themselves any favours by not coming here.  They have said they will furnish information but their non-attendance here feels like a slap in the face for this committee.</p></speech>

It is instructive in terms of our work and the engagement we want with them.  However, I do not think we should just note and accept this.</p></speech>

While we will publish the letter, the committee is dissatisfied with the response.  We will come back to the matter because we will be discussing housing after the Christmas break.  We will see what mechanism can be used in having some people who are on the front line dealing with this issue because they deal with the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and several issues involving taxpayers' money, never mind the building programme and approving applications for approved housing bodies.  It is a slap in the face to the people that the chief executives of the local authorities would collectively decide not to appear before an Oireachtas committee that is discussing housing.  We will come back to that.</p></speech>

However, we went through the proper channels.  That point should be made.  We did the right thing.  This is the body that represents all the CEOs of local authorities.  It has a clear function.

It relates to people who have applied for sick leave.  I do not want to cast aspersions on any individuals.  The figures may point to issues in the work environment in some State bodies.  The average number of sick days across the public service is 10.1.  I look at those organisations with above average numbers.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is at 13 days.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is at 12 days.  The Prison Service is at 15.7.  I do not think that will come as a surprise to some of the members here given that a whistleblower appeared before the committee in private session.  Is that related to work practices?  That number of 15.7 represents three full working weeks.</p></speech>

Revenue at 11.4 represents two weeks.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is at 11.2.  I ask the secretariat to take a note of those that are above average and we can put them to officials from those Departments when they appear before the committee.  We need a response from them when they appear.  There are significant variations.  For example, the Department of the Taoiseach is at 3.5 and yet Revenue is at 11.4.  How do such variations arise?  There might be a reason, but I would like to know the reason.</p></speech>

I am not saying anything is wrong with the public servants who claim sick leave.  I am just looking at the variations.  The Chairman made the point that the number for the Prison Service is high for very obvious reasons.  That highlights the need to look at the environment in which these people work.  These are public servants who deserve our support and protection.  The sick leave is high in some areas, with the Prison Service being one.  In others it is less obvious why the number is high.  We need to get an understanding of it.  Are there problems in Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that we should know about?</p></speech>

In recent years there have been no protected disclosures in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Members might be able to help me.  My memory of that exchange when we asked about protected disclosures in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was that it was more about the Department's role in enforcement and oversight when they are not being handled well elsewhere.  It deals with the action to be taken if it is not being handled well and monitoring.  Based on the committee's experience of protected disclosures, we have found issues with how they are handled, the perception of people reviewing themselves etc.  Maybe I am wrong, but that was what I was expecting back from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

The Department recently issued a report on the operation of protected disclosures.  It was one of the poorest reports I have ever seen published.  It had no engagement with any person who had made a protected disclosure.  It looked like a desktop exercise among senior officials.  We will come back to that.  We have noted it before.</p></speech>

We have no problem coming back to that issue again.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1743 is from the chief executive officer of IDA Ireland, providing information requested by the committee regarding the annual employment survey.  We had asked for details of the annual employment survey.  Obviously other schemes are done on a very specific basis through checking the numbers of people who are employed as a result of particular funded schemes operated by IDA Ireland.  We asked it to outline the response rate to their surveys.  Did it have a 5% or 95% response rate?  The letter states that on completion of the 2017 survey the response rate stood at 94% of the total population.  On the face of it, that seems like a very high response.  If it had a 94% response, we can rely on the figure.  We just wanted to check the veracity of the survey.  On first reading, that would appear to be a good response.</p></speech>

It is an assessment, an estimate.  It cannot be said it is accurate because it is self-assessment.  What controls are in place?  What follow-up inspections take place to ensure the figures are accurate?  We were never given any information to reassure us that is the case.  I do not accept that these are accurate figures.  While it is great that 94% of the companies complete the forms, on what basis do they fill in the forms?  It is self-assessment.  What is the follow up?

It shows we are watching carefully.  No. 1749 from the Higher Education Authority is dated 26 November and provides information requested for our forthcoming periodic report.  It is a table relating to the Munster university costs.  On the second page attached, it says the committee was looking for a breakdown of direct and indirect costs.  There is further information on matching funds from the HEA contribution.  That is fine.  We sought that information but the HEA does not give us a detailed breakdown.  It has just broken it down between direct and indirect costs.  We have that figure in our periodic report which will be published next week.</p> <p>  No. 1750 from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is dated 26 November and provides information requested by the committee on a response to queries regarding the ICT directorate payment process and the extension of a project agreement on 3 December 2014 for the provision of skilled resources.  The information is included in our periodic report.  We will note and publish this.  The Garda provides a breakdown of all the different categories under the ICT contract.  In particular, it says the approach allows for the current skilled resource contract to be broken into a number of manageable contracts and for better competition under the OGP ICT skilled resources framework.  Rather than to have this one massive contract going to one company, it is now being broken down into manageable amounts that can be tendered separately.  There will be a bit more competition and hopefully a better result.  That is progress.  As such, it was good to follow that and the Garda acknowledges that.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next matter is correspondence C, which is from private individuals.  The first, dated 20 November, is from a correspondent who makes a number of interesting points in relation to developments at the University of Limerick.  I propose to note this for the time being.  We may consider the points when we come to consider the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on UL and Sligo IT which was published a couple of days ago.  We will discuss-----</p></speech>

It chimes with what we were saying when its representatives were here.  We were getting push-back from these universities as to what we were asking questions for and they said we were being too tough.  It goes back to this public perception, or rather the perception of some in the commentariat, that the Committee of Public Accounts is overstepping the mark and is unfair to witnesses, which I reject completely.  Here is a situation in which it is very clear to us now that we had Accounting Officers before us who did not give us the information we sought and in fact may have given us inaccurate information.  Certainly, it seems they gave inaccurate information to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is quite serious and we have to come back to it.  The Waterford report is not in the same space, to be fair.  It is not about wrong information.  My comments were on the Limerick one.  However, we can deal with both on the same day.</p></speech>

We will go through our work programme for the new year next week and try to sign off on priorities from the committee's point of view and the sequence in which we want to deal with them.  That is noted and published.  Sorry, it is not.  The letter was from an individual and we can discuss it in the context of the meeting to which we have just referred.</p> <p>  No. 1742 is from Deputy Catherine Murphy and concerns a proposal regarding our forthcoming meeting with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We note this and will return to it when we are considering the work programme.  Deputy Murphy can raise the matter later in the meeting when she is present also.  The letter says that when the Department is in next week, she wants us to consider extending an invitation to BT, Eir, Image, Siro and Enet as they will be in a position to give evidence from a non-departmental perspective.  We have that request.  I propose that next week's meeting goes ahead as scheduled as we are not going to mix the private sector with the Department at such short notice.  We may consider inviting some of those companies to provide us with information other than what we are hearing from the Department.  Other companies came here in the past, for example, in the context of the Project Eagle report.  When it came to the CervicalCheck issue, Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap provided a very important counterbalance to what we were told by the HSE.  It helped us in our work.</p><p>I am of a mind to do that but we will wait.  We might discuss it in the course of the afternoon.  It will not happen for next Thursday but possibly at a later date.</p><p> We then have No. 1746 from Deputy Alan Kelly, who is requesting further details from the HEA regarding the implementation of employee assistance helplines and the names of the firms providing them across all colleges.  We will forward the schedule that Deputy Kelly has provided.</p></speech>

We made a specific request.  We try to help witnesses when we are looking for information because they might not have it with them and we ask them to write back in.  I asked when each institution put in an employee assistance line.  They wrote back with a general response saying, "These are examples..."  I do not want examples.  I want to know specifically when each institution put in an employee assistance line.  This just makes work.  I did not mind if they did not have it in a week or two, and I was not expecting it straightaway.  I have had to go and write out a table which lists off the institutions and then ask them to put in the dates when each one was put in place.  This is just chasing our tails.  The HEA should write to all institutions and ask them to come back within two weeks to confirm the date when they put this in place, fill that in and send it on to us.</p></speech>

We will discuss Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s request to invite third parties to the broadband plan to the meeting next week.  With regard to meetings, officials of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are here today and we thought, if we did not get finished, we would bring them back on 13 December.  Next week we have the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and we will deal with the broadband plan, as well as its Vote.  For the following week, which is the last meeting before Christmas, on Thursday, 13 December, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was not available to return on that date.  A special report has been produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General on school transport, which might be a simple and straightforward issue to deal with on the last day before the Christmas break.  That will be the sole item on that day.</p></speech>

I speak with some knowledge, having been in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This is in the Department of Education and Skills, so they are the right people to bring in.  However, there is a serious crossover with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have to consider whether we should bring in some people from that Department purely on the basis of crossover.  Personally, I am not satisfied it is in the right Department and I never was.  The crossover and the economies cannot be realised by this being in the Department of Education and Skills.  Given we are discussing a special report, is there a view that we should bring in Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport officials as well?  That is the request.</p></speech>

I have the bizarre scenario where some people living beside me are being told they have to go to school in Clare, although that is a side issue.  The issue here is that Bus &Eacute;ireann without school transport is not Bus &Eacute;ireann.  To be honest, we could be looking at a completely different scenario for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There is also the whole overlap in regard to rural transport schemes and the connotations in that regard, and there are many other issues.  I do not see how we can go through a special report without having representatives of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport here.  That Department is over Bus &Eacute;ireann, which provides the service, so the overlap is huge.  We would be one leg of the stool short.</p></speech>

Expenditure on the schemes is spread across two accounts: the appropriation account for Vote 37, and the account of the Social Insurance Fund.  The Department's overall expenditure on scheme payments in 2017 totalled &euro;19.3 billion.  Expenditure on administration of the schemes amounted to a further &euro;618 million.  An annex to the appropriation account provides a useful summary of the combined programme expenditure and sets out the expenditure on a scheme-by-scheme basis.</p> <p>  The Vote account is funded mainly through direct Exchequer issues.  In contrast, the Social Insurance Fund is financed mainly from pay-related social insurance contributions, which are collected by the Revenue Commissioners, acting as the Department&rsquo;s collection agent.  Receipts into the fund have recovered in recent years as employment and earnings levels have increased.  Total receipts in 2017 were &euro;10.2 billion, up 6.6% year on year.  The receipts included some &euro;422 million in levies payable to the National Training Fund operated by the Department of Education and Skills.  The surplus for the year was &euro;731 million, leaving the fund with accumulated reserves of &euro;1.2 billion at the end of the year.</p> <p>  I gave a clear audit opinion on the accounts of both the Vote and the Social Insurance Fund for 2017.</p> <p>  Welfare recipients may be paid amounts to which they are not entitled or which exceed their entitlements.  Such irregular payments can arise as a result of innocent claimant errors, deliberate fraud by claimants or the manner in which claims are administered by departmental staff.  Control surveys of welfare schemes carried out by the Department are intended to identify the types of cases where such excess payments arise.  The surveys also provide a basis for estimating the level of irregular payments affecting the schemes examined.  The results of successive control surveys suggest that there was a material level of payments in excess of entitlements on both the Vote and social insurance schemes in 2017.  As has been the case for a number of years, I have drawn attention to this concern in both audit certificates.  The matter is explained in further detail in chapter 11.</p> <p>  Chapter 14 presents an example of the type of circumstances that give rise to welfare payments in excess of entitlement.  As part of the audit of the 2017 appropriation account, a review was undertaken of jobseeker's allowance.  One of the matters examined was the correct application of age-related rate reductions, which have been implemented since 2009.  Reduced payment rates apply to most jobseekers aged 25 or younger but there are a number of circumstances where an exemption applies and the payment rate is not reduced.  At the beginning of November 2017, there were just over 30,000 claimants in the age cohort, of whom 5,225, or 17%, were not on a reduced rate.  The audit identified, based on the information held by the Department, that 486 of those claimants, or 1.6% of the cohort of claimants as a whole, did not meet the qualifying conditions for payment of the maximum personal rate.  As a result, they were being paid an amount in excess of their entitlement.  We estimated the cost to the Department of such excess payments at just under &euro;1.2 million in 2017.  This is attributable to departmental or official error rather than to claimant error or deliberate fraud.</p> <p>  Chapter 12 reports on an examination of the Department's JobPath employment activation service for people unemployed for one year or more.  The JobPath service has been delivered since mid-2015 across the State by two companies contracted by the Department.  The key objectives of the JobPath service are to move people from the live register into employment, to reduce the number moving back onto the live register, and to reduce the duration of unemployment when it arises.  The service has been delivered against the backdrop of a substantial upswing in employment levels in recent years.</p> <p>  Jobseekers selected by the Department for participation in JobPath are provided with information on the services available and a personal adviser is assigned to each jobseeker.  Together, the personal adviser and the jobseeker develop a personal progression plan, or PPP, which includes a series of actions designed to assist the jobseeker in securing employment.  The service provider then supports the jobseeker in implementing the plan.  Up to March 2018, the Department had referred 192,000 jobseekers to JobPath.  Almost 160,000 of those referred had commenced engagement with the service providers.  Approximately 16,000 had dropped out and a further 16,000 were still in the process of developing a personal progression plan.  Approximately 69,000 were working with the service providers in implementing agreed plans.</p> <p>  The engagement with a service provider can extend to around two years.  Consequently, in order to assess the outcome of the service, we looked at the outcomes for almost 63,000 jobseekers referred in the period up to the end of 2016.  Of these, approximately 25% had subsequently commenced employment, which was significantly higher than the target minimum rate of job commencement set by the Department.  However, the proportion who stayed in employment fell away over time, so that by the end of 12 months, only 7% of those who engaged with the service providers were still in a job.  As indicated in the diagram which is now on screen, this was just marginally above the reference job sustainment rate, which the Department based on its own previous performance.  Broadly speaking, the outcome pattern achieved was similar for the various categories of unemployed persons.</p> <p>  With regard to the cost, fees of some &euro;109 million had been paid to the two companies up to March 2018.  The payments were based on verification of the delivery of the service to individual jobseekers, and of continued employment for those who took up a job.  Fee discounts built into the contract were availed of in 2017 when employment in the economy generally exceeded pre-specified levels.</p> <p>  Rates of contribution to the Social Insurance Fund are based on earned income, but vary for different contribution classes.  The types of benefits available to contributors also vary considerably by class, reflecting the insurance nature of the system.  Chapter 20 reviews the procedures adopted by the Department to gain assurance that PRSI classifications declared by employers in relation to their employees and on a self-assessment basis by self-employed individuals are appropriate.  The report also considers the adequacy of the arrangements in place between the Department and Revenue in relation to the collection and reconciliation of PRSI receipts.</p> <p>  In 2016, 96% of persons classified for PRSI purposes were in one of three classes: A, M or S.  Class M, approximately 10% of the total, applies mainly to those under 16 or over 66 who are in employment and those in receipt of an occupational pension where no social insurance liability arises and very minimal benefits are available.  Class A, which is approximately 76% of the total, applies to the earnings of most categories of employees, while class S, approximately 10%, applies mainly to earnings from self-employment.  An individual may have more than one contribution classification, depending on the source of earnings.  The rate of personal contribution by persons is the same for class A and class S, at 4% of earnings, but in the case of class A, employers are liable for an additional contribution equivalent to 10.85% of their employees&rsquo; earnings.  Consequently, there may be a considerable potential economic incentive, at least in the short term, to categorise workers in certain circumstances as self-employed.  However, we noted that despite apparent changes in employment relationships over recent years, there has not been a significant increase in the proportion of earners in PRSI class S over the past ten years.</p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s scope section may make a formal determination of the appropriate PRSI classification if requested.  However, the number of such determinations is small, less than 1,000 a year.</p><p>The Department undertakes some testing of compliance with PRSI classification rules, including through joint investigations carried out with Revenue.  Targeted joint investigations in recent years have detected a significant incidence of misclassification in the construction sector.  Members will also recall the review of the circumstances of persons in RT&Eacute; classified as self-employed, which identified a significant number of cases that required further review as to whether individuals were employed by RT&Eacute; or were truly self-employed.  That potentially has implications for their PRSI classification.</p><p> The Department also recently undertook a pilot review of the social insurance class of company directors and concluded that such a review did not need to be repeated.  The examination found that the pilot review used a very narrow sampling frame, resulting in assessment of the cases of just 13 individuals.  That limits the conclusions which can be drawn from the exercise.  The examination concluded that there is scope for the Department to increase the level of compliance activity it undertakes in relation to contribution classification and recommends a programme of random reviews of PRSI classification.</p><p> Chapter 13 reports on the long-term prospects for the operation of the Social Insurance Fund, SIF.  That is based on the results of an actuarial review of the financial condition of the fund that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is required by law to commission at least every five years.  Based on the position at the end of 2015, the review projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the fund will move into a deficit position and the Exchequer subvention required each year to meet ongoing expenditure requirements will be substantial and will increase rapidly.  The review projects that the subvention, in constant 2017 prices, will be &euro;1.7 billion in 2025, &euro;5.6 billion in 2035 and &euro;11.4 billion in 2045.  However, these projections are heavily assumption-driven.  Changes in assumptions about real earnings growth and life expectancy have the most significant impact on the projected SIF shortfall.  The conclusion is that the periodic review is a valuable exercise that enables informed public discussion about the expected long-term implications of current decision-making.</p></speech>

I am also joined by Mr. Jim McDonnell, the Department's chief accountant and Ms Gr&aacute;inne McGuckin, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  With the Chair's permission, I may rely on assistance from my colleagues in addressing some of the questions members may ask.</p> <p>  I arranged for an advance copy of this statement together with briefing material on each of the chapters under review, the annual report of the Department and the annual statistics report and other relevant information to be provided to the committee secretariat last week.  I hope members found that material to be of use.  In my opening statement last year, I referred to the changes in the nature and role of social welfare over the period dating back to the establishment of the Department some 70 years earlier.  I spoke about the role of welfare in compensating for and mitigating the impact of failures in the market economy.  I spoke of how the more than 70 different payments and services provided by the Department contributed significantly, not just to cushioning the impact of the great recession but to helping the economy recover faster than it might otherwise have done.  I spoke about how our staff are acutely aware, through their everyday work, of the impact of welfare and employment services at the micro level - the level of individual citizens and families - and that while they are mindful of the need to control the distribution of scarce State funds, they are equally mindful of the vulnerability of the people who rely on our services.  I spoke about how we work to treat every person with dignity and respect and to make our offices bright and welcoming.  I also spoke of how independent research indicates that customers rate our staff and services highly, including those provided under contract by third parties.</p> <p>  I mention this again because the work of the Department is essentially the work of balance, not just the external balancing of market dynamics and social goals but also internal balances.  In our work we have to strike a balance between ensuring, on the one hand, that people have access to a payment and, on the other, providing them with, and requiring them to avail of, a service that can help to reduce dependence on that payment.  There is also a balance to be struck in, on the one hand, designing and managing large-scale service processes that are reliable, efficient and effective for the overwhelming majority of customers and, on the other, imposing controls and checks intended to reduce fraud and error.  As I said last year, we cannot pursue the elimination of error or fraud at the cost of denying entitlement to service or frustrating access to that entitlement.  There are also balances to be struck on the revenue side of our operations relating both to intergenerational and inter-temporal equity and to horizontal equity in terms of treatment of social insurance charges on different types of employment.  These are the balances at the heart of the five chapters selected for discussion today, and it is on these chapters that I will focus my opening remarks.</p> <p>  The first chapter, chapter 11, summarises the Department's approach to what, following feedback at the Committee of Public Accounts last year, we now call control surveys.  It outlines the results of 14 surveys conducted by the Department over the past six years, covering approximately 80% of the Department's expenditure.  These surveys are conducted to help identify the risk factors that give rise to incorrect payments on individual schemes and to inform changes to operations processes and control measures to help reduce the level of incorrect payments into the future.  The surveys also provide an indicative estimate of the level of control loss, or leakage, in the system at a point in time.  In general, for most schemes surveyed, this ranges between 0.5% and 5%, with farm assist being a notable outlier at 10.4%.  Across all 14 schemes, the net level of excess payments averaged about 2.2%.  As Accounting Officer, I agree, given the scale of the Department's expenditure, with the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment that this level of control loss or leakage is material.  However, as I did last year, I also draw attention to the fact that this rate stands comparison with equivalent rates in social welfare administrations in other states, for example, in the UK it is 1.9%, in Israel it is 5% and in Canada it is 3.5%, and indeed to rates of bad debt, which typically range between 2% and 5%, and shrinkage, which is typically 2% in commercial industry.</p> <p>  The second chapter, chapter 12, reports on a review of the JobPath service by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  By way of background, JobPath is an employment advisory and case management service provided to long-term unemployed jobseekers.  The service is provided on behalf of the Department by two contractors who are remunerated based on their engagement with jobseekers and the employment outcomes achieved.  The service sits alongside and augments the case management and advisory service provided by the Department's own Intreo staff and the contracted service provided by local employment services.</p> <p>  In the past, at this committee and elsewhere, a number of queries have been raised in respect of JobPath.  The first is whether it is appropriate to provide and to require jobseekers to engage with a case management or employment advisory service.  The evidence on this is, I believe, very clear.  Of all of the types of labour market intervention provided by public employment services around the world, the form of intervention which is shown to have the most impact is case management and employment advice.  For this reason, it is important to provide an employment advisory and case management service and JobPath is simply a method of doing this.</p> <p>  The second question raised is whether such a service should be provided under a contracted model or should be provided directly by the staff employed by the State.  Different people will have different views on the matter.  What I can say as Accounting Officer is that most countries use a mixed model, contracted resourcing being used to ensure that resource capacity can be flexibly added as required to core in-house capacity.  This was the rationale for the procurement of JobPath services at a time when the Department's in-house resources could not respond, as required, to the large increase in unemployment.</p> <p>  The third question raised is whether the JobPath model provides value for money.  I have provided under separate cover some additional briefing material which sets out the costs of the JobPath service and the outcomes achieved.  These data indicate that the service is delivering on targets set and that the costs of the service compare favourably with other case management services contracted by the Department.  Committee members may be interested to know that preliminary results of an econometric study currently being finalised indicate that people who received the JobPath service have higher rates of progression into employment and higher earnings in employment than people with a similar profile who have not received the service.</p> <p>  The fourth question raised is whether the Department has sufficient controls in place to ensure that payments to contractors are validly made and supported by real evidence of sustained employment.  This issue was considered by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his examination of JobPath.  Overall, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report notes that the number of people moving into employment from JobPath exceeds the target levels and that the number of people sustaining employment is broadly in line with the reference levels, both of which were set at 62% of the counterfactual or base case level, by which I mean 62% higher than the counterfactual or base case level.</p><p>The report also notes that the Department has a reasonable basis for the key performance measures used to evaluate contractor performance and that payments made to contractors were validly supported by evidence of the performance achieved.<br/><br/>Other questions raised in respect of JobPath, including about its interaction with programmes such as community employment, were addressed in a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection earlier this year.  I have provided the committee with a copy of a statement on the JobPath service which was submitted at the time.  I hope it will address questions members may have, although I will be pleased to address further issues of interest.<br/><br/>Chapter 13 summarises the results of the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund and notes that it is a valuable exercise to inform discussion on short-term decisions and their impact on long-term outcomes.  The actuarial review is a periodic study conducted every five years in accordance with statute to project forward the likely evolution of the funding position of the Social Insurance Fund based on a defined set of assumptions.  It is important to note that the Social Insurance Fund, unlike, for example, private pension funds, does not operate on a pre-funded basis, whereby contributions made by a contributor today are invested to fund future disbursements.  Rather, it operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, with current year expenditure funded by current year revenues.  Deficits in any year are funded by means of an Exchequer subvention paid from the Central Fund.  Surpluses in any year are invested by the Department of Finance for the benefit of the fund and used to supplement income in subsequent years, but they are not netted off against deficits incurred in prior years.  Therefore, although the fund is projected to be in surplus to the value of &euro;2.3 billion at the end of 2018, that is a somewhat simplistic presentation of the actual position.  It has run deficits in six of the past ten years and during the recession the total value of the deficits amounted to &euro;11 billion.  These data indicate that the value of benefits paid by the fund greatly exceeds the value of contributions made to the fund.  That position is confirmed by the actuarial review which indicates that the value of the State pension alone is more than the value of the contributions made.  For that reason, given the projected increases in the numbers of older people and increasing life expectancy, the actuarial review projects significant annual deficits into the future.  It is important to note that decisions on the funding of the Social Insurance Fund, in particular on the setting of social insurance rates and the investment of any fund surplus, are vested in the Minister for Finance.  <br/><br/>The fourth chapter for discussion is chapter 14 which sets out the results of an examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General of age-related jobseeker's allowance payments.  The report finds that approximately 1.6% of jobseeker's allowance payments to people aged 18 to 25 years were made at a higher rate than provided for in legislation, at a cost of some &euro;1.2 million in 2017.  It, therefore, recommends that the rules used to calculate payments be coded in the Department&rsquo;s computer systems and that, pending this change, a greater level of quality control be applied and additional staff training undertaken to ensure all staff are aware of the rules.  As Accounting Officer, I agree with the recommendations and have taken steps to put them into effect.  These steps are set out in the conclusions and recommendations section of chapter 14.<br/><br/>The final chapter earmarked for discussion is chapter 20 which deals with the collection of PRSI contributions by self-employed persons.  As this topic cuts across the operations of this Department and those of the Revenue Commissioners, I will be joined by Mr. Keith Walsh and Mr. Kevin Cashell from the Revenue Commissioners who will endeavour to address questions related to its work.  As noted in the chapter, self-employed persons pay the standard rate of employee&rsquo;s PRSI, or 4%, but they do not pay the employer-related contribution of 10.05%.  The difference in contributions may provide a financial incentive for an individual to be declared as self-employed.  However, the chapter also notes that despite this apparent incentive, there has been no increase in the proportion of earners classified as self-employed in the past ten years.  The issue of disguised employment was the subject of an interdepartmental review group study in 2017 which is referenced in chapter 20.  A copy has been provided for committee members under separate cover, together with a recent presentation on the subject to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<br/><br/>Classification of employment for social insurance purposes is based on self-declaration, typically by the employer, with the scope section of the Department determining the appropriate class in cases where the correct classification is unclear or in dispute.  The section utilises the agreed code of practice for determining the employment and self-employment status of individuals in making such determinations.  The Revenue Commissioners act as agents of the Department in the collection of PRSI.  Both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department, working separately and together, conduct investigations of compliance, with correct classifications as part of our standard investigations regime.  As part of his review, the Comptroller and Auditor General examined a random sample of 35 determinations made by the scope section during 2017 and found that the evidence supported the basis on which the section made its determinations.  No example of a misclassification was reported.<br/><br/>The examination also considered a pilot review undertaken by the Department of the social insurance class applied to company directors in order to assess the merits of a regular annual review and noted that the Department had concluded that such an annual review process was not merited.  In addition, the examination considered a number of cases where the Revenue Commissioners or the Department&rsquo;s inspectors had conducted investigations into social insurance classifications and did not find any issue of concern in them.  However, it did note that the investigations had detected what the Comptroller and Auditor General considered to be a significant incidence of misclassification, particularly in the construction industry.<br/><br/>The Comptroller and Auditor General concludes with three recommendations.  The first is that the Department introduce a random programme of reviews of PRSI classifications, both to provide assurance as to the accuracy of classifications and to act as a deterrent to deliberate misclassification.  In the main, I agree with this recommendation.  However, my preference is that it should be achieved by increasing the number of employer PRSI inspections, rather than reviews <i>per se</i>, and that the inspections should include targeted, as well as random, elements.  As members may be aware, earlier this year the Department conducted a media campaign on the issue of false self-employment.  Following the campaign, we undertook an intensive programme of employer inspections in the Dublin area and a targeted campaign in the construction sector in the Galway area.  Based on these exercises, the results of which are being reviewed, we intend to intensify our employer inspection activity, as part of which we will again conduct a media campaign in 2019.  The purpose of the campaign will be to increase employer and employee awareness of rights and obligations and encourage reporting of suspected cases of misclassification.  The intelligence garnered in response to the campaign will inform the targeting of specific business and industry sectors for inspection purposes.<br/><br/>The second recommendation is related to the compilation of sectoral data for self-employed contributors.  The data provided by the Revenue Commissioners does not include sectoral data for the source of PRSI receipts.  I agree that receipt of this information would be useful in targeting inspection activity and we are following the matter up with Revenue.  In the meantime, the Department has analysed the sectoral data for self-employment available from the Central Statistics Office.  I have forwarded a trend analysis of the data in the past 20 years.  In summary, it indicates that the share of employment comprising self-employment is in gradual but steady long-term decline.  This suggests that, at a macro level at least, the issue of disguised or false self-employment is not as prevalent as it is sometimes presented to be.  Within these data, there are some interesting trends worthy of note.  For example, the share of self-employment accounted for by the services sector has grown, whereas that accounted for by agriculture has diminished.  The share accounted for by other sectors is largely unchanged.  However, these changes are largely driven by changes in the composition of employment in the economy, in particular the growth of the services sector.  As a result, the share of employment in the services sector comprising self-employment has remained relatively unchanged, at approximately 11%, over the entire period.  Again, this suggests there is no systemic reclassification of employment in the sector.  <br/><br/>When the data are analysed by type of self-employment, a somewhat different picture emerges.  Two types of self-employment are captured for the purposes of statistical reporting.  The first is people who are self-employed and employ staff in their business.  It is very unlikely that such persons are misclassified as self-employed.  The second type of self-employment is people who are employed on their own account - people who do not have staff engaged in their business.  This type of self-employment could include some people who should properly be classified as employees.  At an overall level, the share of own-account self-employment is in steady decline.  This trend is common to all of the major sectors, with the exception of construction.  As shown in the charts forwarded to the committee, the share of construction employment classified as own-account self-employment was constant, at approximately 15%, in the period up to the start of the recession.  During the recession it doubled to approximately 30%.  This can mainly be explained by the fall in construction employment during the period.  It is notable that the share of own-account self-employment is falling again as construction employment has recovered in recent years.  However, it will be important to monitor the trend to ensure the downward trajectory is continuing.  Accordingly, the Department will continue to place a particular focus on PRSI compliance inspections in the construction sector in the next year.<br/><br/>The third recommendation is related to the process undertaken with the Revenue Commissioners to reconcile monthly variances in PRSI receipts versus estimates.</p><p>I agree that a more structured process would be useful and would expect more timely data that should become available as part of the PAYE modernisation programme will support such a process.  I am therefore arranging to have this recommendation followed up with the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p> I understand that members would like to discuss the issue of housing supports today.  This Department previously played a significant role in providing monetary supports to help people in receipt of welfare payments to cover some or all of their household rent.  The role of the Department has diminished since 2014 when the housing assistance payment, HAP, funded by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and administered by the local authorities, was introduced.  Payments by local authorities, which are not contingent on a person being in receipt of a welfare payment, and so avoid a welfare trap problem, now account for the majority, more than 70%, of housing support payments funded by the State.  In order to address any issues that the committee members may wish to raise I will therefore be joined by my colleagues Ms Mary Hurley and Ms Marguerite Ryan from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government later this afternoon.</p><p> In conclusion I would like to say that the scale and scope of the operations of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are greater than perhaps any other Department or public body.  The managers and particularly the staff of the Department work hard to deliver services to the communities from which we come and in which we live, conscious that it is our families, friends and neighbours who not only depend on these services, but who, through their social insurance contributions and taxes, pay for these services.  We are proud of the work we do but we know we are not perfect and we do not always get things right.  That is why we welcome the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of this committee.  This process plays an important role in reminding us of our purpose, helping us to identify areas for improvement and helping us to learn from our mistakes.  It is through such a process that we would hope to improve.</p><p> I and my colleagues will be pleased to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I accept that the Secretary General and Accounting Officer is dealing with four chapters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the appropriation accounts but the reason we seek supporting documentation in advance of an Accounting Officer coming in is to avoid lengthy opening statements.  We have a voting block at 12.50 p.m.  I do not suggest it is the case here but there is sometimes a perception that Accounting Officers give lengthy statements to talk down the clock.  It does not work because we can stay here for as long as we need to.  I do not suggest that was the case this time.  We will not even get to one of the issues because there is a large amount.</p> <p>  Am I right in saying that the PRSI contributions by the self-employed and rent supplement are best dealt with in the afternoon-----</p></speech>

That is fine.</p> <p>  I gave prior notice that I would raise this with Mr. McKeon.  He talked about his staff working hard, and no doubt they do, and I pass on my appreciation for the work his staff does.  This morning, under our correspondence, we received a breakdown, at our request, of Civil Service sick leave statistics for 2017 and statistics that show lost time rates in percentage terms.  Mr. McKeon's Department has one of the highest recorded average working days lost, a full-time equivalent of 13 days, which is two and a half weeks per year.  The average across the Civil Service is 10.1 days.  In percentage terms of lost time, his Department is at 5.7%, as opposed to the Civil Service average of 4.4%.  Can he account for why it is so high, at 13 days per full-time equivalent?</p></speech>

If the Deputy was to delve into the figures in more detail, and I know he has not had the opportunity and some of the information that I have would not be available to committee members, but if one looks at the age profile of our Department, compared with the Civil Service generally, if one looks at the gender mix and the grade mix, it is different than the Civil Service generally.  To give an idea, we have about 150 staff under the age of 30 and close to 3,000 staff over 55.  That would not be the typical age profile.  Those issues play into that.  If we adjusted for those issues-----</p></speech>

They set out a number of caveats that might explain why the figures are higher in some areas.  That explanation is not one of them.  This breakdown colour co-ordinates each Department in terms of the numbers of staff.  Mr. McKeon's is one of the bigger Departments, of 5,000 staff or more.  It says there may be fluctuations in smaller organisations because of their nature.  The bigger the organisation means there would be the full flavour of staff, in age, demographics, gender and so on.  It should not be the case that those statistics are higher, if that is the case.  This is according to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  It also says there might be an issue in the Department of Rural and Community Development because it was only established in 2017.  </p> <p>  My point is that it is unacceptable for Mr. McKeon to say it is a result of how it is classified and that if it was done differently it would show a different outcome because it would show a different outcome for everyone.  That caveat is not given to us here.  I appreciate we have not been given an opportunity to delve into the figure, but I think we need to understand why the average amount of working days lost is 13.  In the Irish Prison Service, the figure is 15.7.  We can accept it might be higher in that area, given the nature of the job and that people get assaulted in the course of their work who would then be out.  We can see obvious reasons for it to be higher in that area.  Mr. McKeon's Department is the next highest, at 13 days.  He said it was a concern but the explanation he gave does not really satisfy me.  I am trying to figure out why there is a difficulty in his Department that does not seem to apply in other Departments.  For example, in the Department of the Taoiseach, the figure is 3.5%.  Some other big Departments are well under 10%, yet the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is 13 days.</p></speech>

Can we go back to the Department and get a gender breakdown and an age profile for each Department?  That might give us the full picture of what Mr. McKeon is saying.  I am not saying that staff do not have an entitlement to apply for sick leave, of course they do.  For example, we are very sympathetic to the type of job the staff of the Irish Prison Service have.  My concern is that if there is a problem in a Department where people are out sick for whatever reason, we would want to know to improve the situation for the staff.  It is not an attack on the staff at all; quite the opposite.  It is a concern when the figures are so high.  Maybe Mr. McKeon is right, if we delve deeper into the figures, but we will come back to it once we get that breakdown.</p></speech>

In our report to the committee, we also gave information on our own performance statistics, such as on sustainment.  At that time, we had only had 26-week job sustainments.  The information showed that we were outperforming people who were not on JobPath by approximately 22% or 23%.</p><p>JobPath is delivering significantly higher job outcomes than is the case for people not referred to the scheme.  Those who engage with JobPath are sustaining their employment.  As I said, the preliminary outputs from the econometric review, which is independent and is carried out by the OECD and Deloitte, indicate that earnings, employment, job progression and job sustainment are significantly higher among people referred to JobPath compared with identical or close to identical people who are not referred to it.  I am quite satisfied that these figures will compare more than favourably with our Intreo service and local employment services.</p></speech>

Is that an appropriate benchmark?  The Central Statistics Office, for example, would not use sustained employment but rather part-time or permanent employment.  It would not use sustained employment as a benchmark.  The period of 13 weeks is a low threshold in the context of measuring success.  There are four stages up to a year but a period of 13 weeks would not be a success.  From where did that period come?  Why did Mr. McKeon refer to sustained employment as opposed to permanent employment?</p></speech>

The other issue concerns the payment model.  We pay the local employment services on an inputs basis.  We pay them &euro;20 million a year and they deal with 20,000 clients, which is approximately &euro;1,000 per client that they look for from us.  There is no visibility or accountability, however, regarding whether they get somebody into a job or whether that job is sustained.  We did not want to do that under this model.  We wanted to base payments on outcomes, but the question was how to define an outcome.  We defined it as a person getting a job for at least 30 hours per week and it must be retained for at least 13 weeks.</p></speech>

The outcome can be defined based on a low bar, which the period of 13 weeks seems to be.</p></speech>

There is a strong incentive, therefore, for the providers to try to sustain some of the employment for a full year.  Part of the service they must provide is working with employers and the jobseeker while he or she is in employment to help him or her.</p></speech>

There was input from the National and Economic Social Council, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion and labour market experts from Maynooth University.  We did much study and research on similar models in other countries, and the conclusion was that if somebody is to be contracted to do something and be paid by outcomes, he or she must be paid something along the way or he or she will have no cashflow.  That "something along the way" is paying him or her based on a 13-week job sustainment.</p></speech>

The issue is that the service we want to provide to people is a case management employment advisory service.  It is a service that we should provide to all jobseekers on a continuous basis.  Should people who have been on JobPath but have not obtained jobs just be left alone and ignored?  While they have finished JobPath, they have not gone on after six months to community employment, training or the local employment services, but they are on the live register.</p></speech>

While the companies receive only the initial registration fee, they receive it twice.  I am trying to tease this out from the point of view of the companies and what incentives there are for them to make money, because that is their aim.  The period of 13 weeks is too low a threshold for the first tranche of money.  If 15,000 people have gone through twice and these companies have been paid twice, I see that as a problem.  Mr. McKeon might not, and he has given the reasons he does not, but there is an issue from a value-for-money perspective.</p> <p>  A discount rate of 8% is mentioned on page 148 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Will Mr. McKeon clarify the discount rate?  Why were two rates introduced?</p></speech>

We introduced the discounts in the contract design because when we carried out our research in other countries, we learned that their pricing models do not include any consideration of the fact that the economy might recover and, therefore, it would be easier to get people into employment.  In the request for tender we issued to providers, we told them in advance that based on employment growth in the economy we would reduce prices, subject to an analysis of their financial accounts and so on.</p></speech>

We have a recovering economy with greater than expected numbers of people in employment.  It is a little easier to get a job than it was three, five or seven years ago, which means it is less difficult for these two companies to operate and get people into employment.  The Department built in discount rates because of that, yet there is still only a 9% success rate at the end.</p></speech>

The Department is paying less, but my point is related to the figure of 9%, which Mr. McKeon quoted moments ago.  Notwithstanding that there is a recovering economy and it is easier to get a job, we are dealing with the long-term unemployed.  It should not be seen in the same way, but the Department does see it that way and it builds in the discount.</p></speech>

That suits when one is talking about the discount rate, which suits the Department.  In measuring whether the project actually works in overall terms, however, we cannot use that argument because it is different due to the long-term unemployed.</p></speech>

On the first, one of the challenges we had in designing the contract was doing it in a way that would protect the value for money for the State in order that we would not pay money to people in a recovering economy that we would have paid in a more depressed one.  We built that in and that is what we apply.</p> <p>  The second issue is-----</p></speech>

We do not just look at the disability of the recipient of care.  We look at the circumstances of the carer as well, including their means and their habitual residence.

There is also the means test.  I am concerned about both the carer's allowance and the disability allowance.  I am dealing with a few cases at the moment.  In one example, an individual who applied in October was told that it would be well into January before the application would be processed and a decision made on it.  Carer's allowance affects people who are very vulnerable.  Illness can come upon someone quite quickly and can be progressive.  The delay in assessing claims can be very frustrating, especially when we are told that we are now at record levels of employment.  A total of 2.3 million people are employed in this country.  One would imagine that more resources would be available to the Department to reduce the lead times on such schemes, particularly when so many labour activation schemes have been outsourced.  It frustrates me that we are not seeing more progress on these payments.</p></speech>

Everyone in the Department would like to see us deliver those services more quickly.  They tend to be more difficult.  In some ways the average paints a picture which is worse the reality.  That figure would include situations where somebody has had an application for disability allowance turned down and then gets a review, which takes time.  Then there might be an appeal.  The average includes all of those situations.  It is not just the clean cases, for want of a better term.</p></speech>

The four schemes that are growing most significantly are carer's allowance, disability allowance, domiciliary care allowance and pensions.  Carer's allowance has increased by 5% year on year.  Jobseeker's allowance has fallen by about 15%.  Domiciliary care allowance has grown by about 11%.  Disability allowance has grown by about 5%.  Those increases are putting pressure on our processing capability.</p> <p>  There are two types of people involved in the processing.  Actually there are three, but there are two main types.  One group is our deciding officers, who for these schemes are based in Longford and Buncrana.  They review the claim, carry out the means assessment, check conditionality and so on.  Then there are medical assessors.  We are looking to add more resources to both of those areas.  It is difficult at this point to get medical assessor resources, but we are working on it.  We are interviewing-----</p></speech>

For example, the person providing the care is meant to be providing full-time care and attention, ideally in the home of the recipient of care.  We provide flexibility for the claimant to work up to 15 hours and to live away from the recipient of care, provided they can get there within a certain time.  All of these things have to be assessed, because many people claiming carer's allowance are not living with the recipient of care.  As such, we have to assess whether they are in fact providing full-time care and attention.</p></speech>

Our identity verification process, which serves a good public service purpose, could be used again instead of requesting similar information from the same customer.  My understanding is that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was concerned about whether it would have to make changes to its legislative framework to use our service.

Our own contracts had run out and the new framework contract was not in place yet, so we had to renew the contracts.  Regarding the contract for our mobile phone service, for example, we could not leave inspectors and other staff of the Department without mobile phones while we were waiting for a Government procurement contract.</p></speech>

Like most other large organisations within and without the public service, we get files everyday of references in the press to the Department.

On average, we recover approximately &euro;10 million a year.  We have six people working full-time on debt recovery on employers.  Many of the employers still trading are still in financial difficulty so if we pursue recovery of the debt too robustly, we are in danger of tripping them over and maybe incurring an even higher debt because of the workers they then have to let go.  We always try to get that balance.  I looked at a number of cases myself just be sure and there are a number of small businesses that are struggling, particularly outside Dublin.  We could go after them but that would not serve anybody's best interest.</p></speech>

We have just set up, under our memorandum of understanding with Revenue, an employer debt recovery group and we have agreed to take 100 cases from both organisations, look at the intersection or the overlap, and then work together on that overlap.

The control piece for us is the people who walk through our door with the letter stating that there has been an overpayment or whatever, and there are questions that jump out from that.  If somebody was overpaid or made a fraudulent claim, the Department has to deal with that and the way people negotiate with the Department is sometimes the reason they contact us.  I am aware of a number of people on family income supplement who, say, work in a school but who did not work the right number of weeks because of the storm, school holidays and so on.  They should have signed off and gone onto a jobseeker's payment, which might have been a smaller payment.  How do the witnesses manage that in terms of the way they reflect that type of case?  Is that a contra item or do they look in retrospect with somebody like that?</p></speech>

It depends on what is counted in terms of value for money.  I have no problem with there being a case management system.  It is welcome that people are helped to have a plan.  I am not wild about the outsourcing of it but I have a bigger problem with what people are being told to expect from the service when they engage with it.  Nearly everybody will say they are invited in once a week to sit at a computer and look up the<i>jobs.ie</i>website or a similar website.  That is the extent of their engagement.  I hear that over and over again.  Have the witnesses done an analysis of the difference between the engagement with Intreo and JobPath in respect of the person's experience of their case being managed?</p></speech>

Other countries use what is called a black box approach.  They would say, "We are sending you a jobseeker.  Your job is to try to help the jobseeker get a job.  We don't care how you do it but if you do, we'll pay you a certain amount".  We said we would not go that route and that we will specify a minimum range of services that must be provided such as assistance on curricula vitae and interview skills, the development of a personal progression plan, if a person is in employment, support for the first three months they are in employment, and a range of other services.</p> <p>  We do customer satisfaction research.  We have done it four or five times now; I think I provided the most recent published version of the research and the information.  We ask customers if they are satisfied that the service being delivered is a good one and so on and on a scale of zero to five, where five is brilliant and zero is lousy, they score it at 4.3 or 4.4.</p><p>It was across pretty much everything we measure, including the personal progression plan, post-employment support and whether they think the services are valuable and will help them get a job.  At the macro level the feedback from customers is good.  We have done approximately 180 inspections of JobPath providers, although I need to verify that number as it might be a little off.  We have inspectors who check what is happening on the ground.  We have not come across anything that causes any major concern.  There are always issues but any that we have had have been sorted out.  We have not come across any major issues.  One of the questions-----</p></speech>

The narrative has not changed in terms of people who make contact.  It is the point I make.  Customer satisfaction in people's minds might relate to something from a shop not fulfilling what is supposed to, for example.  There is a different kind of mindset.  There are particular Departments with which people do not like to have a serious engagement.  We hear that people will fill out the form but they do not want to rock the boat with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection because they seem themselves as being in a vulnerable position.

What we consider is not so much the percentage of unemployment but the number of people in our caseload.  It is what people used to call the live register, although the Central Statistics Office has moved a little away from that.  It still produces the figure but it now focuses on a monthly unemployment figure.  Our live register has 188,000 people on it currently, with another approximately 70,000 on various programmes, leaving a total of approximately 250,000.  We will see where we are.  These contracts are due for renewal at the end of next year, if they are renewed.  We will have a look over the next year.  We will serve our client base with our own resources first, the local employment service second and then contract the capacity on top of that if required.  We will consider that.</p></speech>

If we counted community employment schemes only with respect to progression, a different measurement may arise, as some of the community employment schemes fulfil quite significant roles in communities.  They include the likes of meals on wheels, the running of football clubs or whatever.  Very often such processes help a community to function.  The likes of JobPath have changed the dynamic as people are directed more towards JobPath than community employment schemes.  The minute people leave a community employment scheme, they go straight to JobPath.  That is counted but they may have had beneficial training that could help sustain employment afterwards.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

We can all get very narrow-minded in specifying what gets people a job.  Was it a stint on JobPath or in community employment or a training course with the local education and training board?  It is important to remember it is probably the sum total that ultimately helps somebody who is very long-term unemployed get into employment.<br/><br/>For a while and until last year, mainly because we were trying to ration available places to everybody, people on community employment and T&uacute;s could not also be on JobPath and <i>vice versa</i>.  Perhaps the Deputy is alluding to that.  We have changed it and in the past couple of months, for example, approximately 1,200 are on community employment or T&uacute;s and JobPath at the same time.  We have relaxed the stipulation because community employment is a requirement of 19 hours per week and JobPath does not take up the other 19 hours per week.  It is a couple of hours per week.  To an extent people thought they were in competition but they never were.  It has been raised by people as such but I can honestly and absolutely say they were never in competition with one another.  To the extent that people thought they were, it is certainly not an issue any more.</p></speech>

There is a Government decision on this.  Where citizens, clients, customers - people use different terms so I will use all of them - engage with the State to get a high-value public service, they should authenticate their identity with what we call the SAFE2 standard.  It is a high level of assurance of somebody's identity.  Whether it is done through our process or another body decides to set it up and have a parallel process, we strongly encourage that other body to use our process purely for purposes of savings and public convenience.  If another public body decides to use another process, it is a matter for that body.  It must get sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for that expenditure, so it is a separate discussion it would require.</p></speech>

If we are to have one, we should have a debate and it should not happen by stealth.  There were question marks over the legal status of Departments to use the card.  I would have thought that when it was being set up, it would have been given a considerable degree of consideration.  As Mr. McKeon says, if there is a cost it should not have to be repeated with multiple cards, for example.  What kind of engagement occurred?</p></speech>

There was a Government decision and a joint memo to the Government sponsored by our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is up to the other Departments to make that real.  I cannot write the legislation if it is required for another Department.  I am confident that within the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, particularly section 262, other bodies are given the legislative authority to use the card.  It is something that may be tested in due course but I am confident the authority is already in place.</p></speech>

Deputy Burke spoke about the length of time it takes to process carer's allowance.  One is looking at situations with carer's benefit, for example, where someone has to leave work due to a stroke and there can be a delay.  That needs to happen quickly as a person can be at work and suddenly have to depend on social welfare.  As the person may have some savings, community welfare officers do not really kick in.  That is one category but there are others in the area of disability.  I have come across people who were previously on an invalidity pension.  I realise it is not necessarily a pension for life where someone recovers.  One wants people to recover and go back to work.  It is a useful payment from that point of view.  However, I have seen people removed from payment in circumstances which make the mind boggle.  It is where someone has an obvious long-term illness.  If someone appeals that or a disability payment matter, there is a very high rate of reversals of departmental decisions in disability cases.  It is, or it certainly was, in excess of 50%.  That is not a very good use of administrative time.  In fact, it adds a layer of concern and bureaucracy for people who get the payment when they succeed on appeal.  Has the Department looked at that and has the number come down in recent times?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McKeon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018112900002#W00700"><p>The Deputy raised two issues.  One was the issue of someone who was on a payment having the case reviewed and being taken off the payment.  It is very rare that happens.  It is very unusual.  If the Deputy has examples, I would be very happy to have a look at them.  That is very rare as it is generally the case that to get onto the invalidity pension payment, a person will tend to have a very profound medical condition.  It is very rare that happens, albeit it is not to say it never does.</p> <p>  With regard to appeals, the Deputy is right that approximately 60% of people who appeal a disability or invalidity related decision, which is approximately 1% of those who get a decision, which is the context in which this must be considered, get a favourable outcome.  The appeals office then sends the file back to the Department for another look and it is at that stage when most of them get the favourable outcome.  Generally, it is because people have provided additional information which was not available to the Department the first time.  We have worked with disability activation groups and carers.  We have developed a new form which is getting positive and negative feedback.  On the one hand, we are accused that the form is too long.  On the other hand, the Carers Association feels it is as long as it needs to be to ensure all the information required to make a first-instance decision rather than a second-instance one is captured.  We are continuing to work to try to improve the quality of the information available.  Our medical assessors are not like Attila the Hun, they are trying to look realistically and objectively at each case.  It is frustrating for them when someone presents with a bare characterisation from a GP on a particular illness whereas subsequently a full consultant's report is provided which puts the whole thing into perspective.</p></speech>

The full range of information is needed to make a decision.  However, I have seen cases reversed or where there is a more favourable treatment where there has not been much additional information.  My question is whether it would be useful to look again at the process for value for money reasons and given the administrative hours required to deal with this when a large proportion succeed on appeal, albeit that is of a small proportion who apply.</p></speech>

I have met the chief appeals officer who operates an independent office from the Department.  I have asked her to meet with our chief medical officer.  They do not like having to meet, not because they do not like each other, but because of the independent element.  However, I have asked them to sit down and discuss this to find out what is going on underneath and to see if we can sort it out.  We are doing that at the moment.</p></speech>

I can give the Deputy a very rough number that might help.  If he looks at the number of people who got employment subsequent to the JobPath service and divides the total cost by the number of people who are now in full-time employment it amounts to approximately &euro;4,000 per job.  Those people would generally be in receipt of &euro;10,900 as jobseekers but when they go into employment they will pay approximately &euro;5,000 in taxes.  One could say, in a very simplistic way, that there is &euro;15,000 for approximately &euro;4,500.  It is not as clean and simple as that.  Then one must ask how many of the people on whom &euro;4,500 was spent would have got a job in any event.  That is where the complexity comes into the analysis.  It is important to do that-----</p></speech>

We had argued there was a type of order it was possible to make to resolve the constitutional issue which would not result in people in prisons being entitled to benefits.  We now must consider with the Attorney General whether that is an issue that might be the subject of a further appeal.  That is as much as I can say.</p></speech>

We are working off two sets of figures, the current figures and those from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I am happy to work on the basis of the figures from the Comptroller and Auditor General report, which states that 15,731 of the 62,631 actually commenced a job of some duration.  It refers to 15% sustained employment for at least 13 weeks, which comes to approximately 9,395.  Does this mean that 6,336 did not make it to 13 weeks?</p></speech>

Approximately 40% of people do not make it to 13 weeks.  The next category is those still in employment at 26 weeks.  The number is about 7,515.  I estimate that there drop-off of 1,880 - in the region of 20% - between 13 weeks and 26 weeks .  At the next stage, it is 5,637, a further drop-off of 1,878, or approximately 25%.  After one year, we end up with 4,384 people, which is a further drop-off of 1,253, about 22%.  Are those rough calculations correct?</p></speech>

Around the world the evidence is that the first four weeks, in particular, of somebody starting in a job, particularly if they have been very long-term unemployed, is critical.  Most of the people we have referred to JobPath have been three years or more unemployed on the day they start.  It is very difficult for someone who has that long period of unemployment.  It is simple things like getting up in the morning, being there at 9 o'clock and taking instructions from somebody when one has not been used to doing that for a long time.  In making that adjustment evidence all around the world has shown the first four weeks are critical.</p></speech>

I am working from the Comptroller and Auditor General's figures.  I know there are more up-to-date figures, but I did my calculations on this.  Those 15,731 represent the five different groups - people unemployed for up to 12 months, between one year and two years, etc.  There are five categories.  That would encompass all five of those categories.  I do not need to get details now; they can be passed on to the secretariat because we are up against time.  Do we have a further breakdown of the 15,731 across the five categories?  Does the Department follow through on each of the various stages?  In other words, do we have a breakdown of those 4,384 people who have reached one year in continuous employment by each group?</p></speech>

This mainly applies to groups 1 to 4, maybe not so much group 5.  I am trying to get an understanding of what JobPath actually does then.  Irrespective of whether it is real, there is a perception and we have seen evidence that they help a person with a CV and how to prepare for an interview.  However, do they do what Mr. McKeon said about trying to get people back into that work routine and teaching them life skills?</p></speech>

They provide workshops on what to expect in work.  One of the things we ask them to do - the feedback, our own inspections and the customer satisfaction research indicate they are doing it - is to stay in contact with the person during the first three months.  They make regular contact with them to try to help them through.  We know that if one can get over the first three months, as the Deputy can see, the tail-off flattens off quite considerably.  Getting to the first three months is actually the critical thing.  We do ask them to provide those services.  Our feedback from our own contacts with the people involved and our own research indicate that they do.  The incentive, in terms of the financial payment, is also there to encourage them to do it because obviously they get a relatively small payment, all things considered, for getting somebody to three months, but they get a much bigger payment for getting somebody to 12 months.</p></speech>

Research that has been carried out indicates that the reasons are really associated with what I said earlier.  It is the change in work habits; it is getting used to getting up in the morning.  To put it bluntly, it is getting used to taking instruction from somebody where maybe one did not have to take instruction before.  The other issue is a confidence issue.  If one has been three years unemployed one generally goes into a job with quite low confidence.  Those are the factors that play into the decline there.</p></speech>

It should be borne in mind that we set the reference rate at 62% above the actual rate; therefore, we had set a stretching target which is being exceeded.  The evidence is available and we will see the outcome of the econometric review when we publish the findings in January.  As I have only seen very preliminary data, I do not have that level of detail, but the preliminary data suggest people are finding jobs and staying in them.  They are earning more in them than those who did not go through JobPath.  There will be more detail.  The OECD is still finalising the review.</p></speech>

The controls in the contract include a minimum performance level that the providers have to meet.  It is 30% higher than the counterfactual rate, which is set at a lower level than the reference rate.  We set the reference rate as a target in order that we can make price comparisons between bidders.  The providers have to do 30% better than the counterfactual rate.  If they do less than 30% more than what was the case beforehand, we can terminate the contract.  If they do not hit their own submitted targets which are different from the reference rate, although the are often quite close to it, we can take 14% of their payment, but we have not had to do that yet.</p></speech>

We built in controls in order that if they did not perform, it would affect the retention payments.

They relate to job sustainment claims which were found to be invalid.  This is to be found in Table 12.10 on page 148 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When providers apply for their fees, there are some controls in validating the data.  The report reads, "During the validation process for some 50,000 claims for job sustainment fees submitted in the period July 2015 to March 2018, the Department found a total of 10,000 claims (20%) to be invalid".  Table 12.10 gives a breakdown of the reasons the claims were found to be invalid.  The report goes on to state that after the initial verification, there is an opportunity for the companies to submit for reverification.</p></speech>

We have not generated them up to this point, but we should be able to do so if they are of interest to the Deputy.  We built in those controls specifically to avoid concerns about cases of contractors committing fraud in other countries.  We only pay when people receive a commencement of employment notice from Revenue and sign off on it, which means that we know that they are no longer claiming a payment and are in employment.  If we cannot verify it in our systems, we do not pay.  It is a good control to have in place.</p></speech>

They include the housing assistance payment, HAP, for rental accommodation and the social housing current expenditure programme which includes long-term leasing and rent supplement, as the scheme is known.  The HAP for rental accommodation and long-term leasing come under the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, while rent supplement comes under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I think I am right on that much.  What is the current spend?  What was the spend in 2017 for each of the four categories?  How many tenants or families come within each of the four categories?

I have listened to the Department and the Minister recently talk about RAS and HAP not as long-term solutions but as more short-term to medium-term solutions.  I am trying to understand whether that is the case.  Am I reading it wrong?  I spoke to my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who is very active on this issue.  His sense of it is that the Department now sees HAP and RAS as more short to medium term and not long term.  That is the language the Department uses.  Am I right in that?</p></speech>

I say that because in terms of the Rebuilding Ireland, they argue that after 2021 there will be a strategy to house some of the people who are in housing assist programmes and RAS into traditionally social housing.  I am trying to figure out what the policy and targets are.  It is very important for us to measure whether or not strategies are working and that there are benchmarks and targets.  Perhaps I am wrong about their interpretation and perhaps my colleague is wrong.  I do not know but I doubt it very much.  If Ms Hurley is saying from her perspective it is long term, is she then saying the plan up to 2021 is to have almost double the number of people in HAP accommodation, from 37,000 in 2017 and whatever it is now - it is probably over 40,000 - and up to 83,000 by the end of 2021, which is double?  I imagine it would also double the cost.  We could be talking about &euro;400 million just for HAP alone.  That is them sorted.  From the Department's perspective, their long-term housing needs are being met through HAP.  Is that what Ms Hurley is saying?</p></speech>

What needs to be taken account of is there are 71,000 households on waiting lists.  That has reduced from 92,000 in 2016.  Of those 71,000 families on housing lists, Rebuilding Ireland has a plan to deliver 50,000 built, acquired and leased homes and separately 87,000 housing supports through HAP.  What the Government and officials are saying at committee is we will see housing support numbers drop annually from next year.  The target is 16,600 as opposed to 17,000 this year.  We will see supply by way of building.  From 2021 we will see the State deliver build acquisition and leasing homes to the order of 12,000 on an annual basis.</p></speech>

That was one of the take-out points of that report, yet we seem to be increasing our expenditure.  We are going to double it yet the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform report, which is independent, is saying there will always be a need for some level of supports for people in the private rented sector because of the nature of housing.  The more fundamental question in terms of value for money, which we have to look at, is we have a target to double the investment in HAP, yet we are not using that money to invest in capital investment to build homes that people need.  The State would then own those homes.  We are adding to a problem.  All of this is having a consequence on the private rented sector.  We are funding almost everybody, including social housing tenants, into the private rented sector.  What has happened?  Rents have gone up.  The average rent in Dublin is now &euro;1,900.  The average rent across the State is &euro;1,400 a month.  Part of that is a result of the policy solutions that are put in place.</p><p>Everybody is being pushed into the private sector.  We are not building enough houses, yet it seems that the Department has not learned from it because the target is to double the spend and to double the number of people in HAP by 2021.  Do the witnesses think that will reduce rents across the State or will it continue to play its part in increasing rent?</p></speech>

The rent limits for HAP and the rent supplement were reviewed in 2016 to ensure that they were fair and equitable and were not driving up rents.  From looking at the discretion that is being used, we found that in Dublin the average HAP payment is well below the average Dublin rental payment.  We are not seeing the effect Deputy Cullinane is talking about but we will continue to monitor the situation because it is very important that we do so.</p></speech>

That, in itself, creates fierce competition in the private rental sector, which has played a very significant part in increasing rents in Dublin and elsewhere.  Nobody could argue that is not the case because it is the reality.  Could Mr. McKeon respond to my questions as well?  Has he read the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform report I am talking about?</p></speech>

How many of those who are in receipt of rent supplement are on the transfer list?</p></speech>

We pay people who present to us on a welfare payment with a difficulty paying their rent and we provide them with a support to help them pay their rent.  That is the purpose of rent supplement.  That is why it is called a short-term scheme, because hopefully people are in a transitory situation when they are on a welfare payment.  For those who have a longer-term need responsibility for their housing needs moves to another Department.  That is where HAP and social housing or whatever else comes into the equation.</p></speech>

The approach is very haphazard.  We have four different schemes and sometimes the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.

I will move on then to PRSI contributions by the self-employed.  For clarification, note A on page 254 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states the Department does not analyse PRSI receipts by class.

Self-employed PRSI receipts are presumed to be class S receipts.  A difficulty here is that the statistics are gathered by Revenue and there are different definitions in use in Revenue and in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  One has different schedules used and the information that is captured in Revenue is captured on a revenue basis and some of the statistics captured by the Department are using those definitions and some of them are using their own class definitions.  There are different schedules in Revenue and different classes in the Department.  They are very close but they are not exactly the same thing.  I would like all receipts and all individuals to be classified on both bases so that we could get behind the statistics.</p></speech>

To be clear, we produce in our statistical report every year the number of contributors by class in some detail.  We report the income by employee and self-employed.  We could seek to break that income down by class as well but we would need to do a bit more work with Revenue first.</p></speech>

I want to get the Accounting Officer's response to it.  It relates to bogus or false self-employment.  Mr. McKeon said that following the awareness campaign on false self-employment, which commenced in May 2018, the Department is intensifying its activity in employer inspections by its social welfare inspectors and special investigation unit, SIU, staff.  He said it is anticipated that a significantly larger number of employer inspections with a particular emphasis on insurability for PRSI purposes will be carried out in the latter half of 2018 and 2019.

There has been none in the past year.</p> <p>  What I would say is when we look at bogus self-employment and trends in self-employment - I provided the information in my opening statement and in the supplementary information - it is not that it does not exist but it does not exist to the extent that is commonly perceived.  I refer to all of the data.  The ESRI has studied this and has separately produced a report.  The report on zero-hours contracts was similar.  When one goes looking for evidence of precarious employment, the levels of bogus self-employment in Ireland that one can detect are much lower than in other European countries.  That does not mean that there is not a problem and that every case is not an issue to be dealt with, but just to make the general point, it is not as prevalent as people think. </p> <p>  For example, we conducted 2,000 employer inspections as our response to the media campaign that we ran, both in Dublin and in Galway.  In Galway, they concentrated on the construction industry.  We interviewed more than 170 staff and there was only one case that was suspicious.  When we finalised the investigation of that case, it was found to be correctly classified as self-employed.  In Dublin, when we did more than 1,000 inspections, there were three cases that we found to be suspicious, all of them, by the way, in the private security sector which is not something we were expecting to find.  Those three cases are being followed up.  If they lead to prosecutions in due course, we will follow them up.  I have no interest in presenting something that is not the case.  It is just that what we learned from our own data and our own experience is not what is sometimes presented to us.</p></speech>

Mr. McKeon states that it is not as prevalent as some people think, whoever the some people are.  It is possible it is exaggerated by some.  My point is that we should have more accurate recording and more accurate data on how prevalent or not it is.</p> <p>  Because of its nature, it is difficult to determine when there is a case of bogus self-employment.  For example, we had staff members of RT&Eacute; before the committee who stated that they felt they were victims of bogus self-employment.  An employer, not in this case, will say that he or she sees it differently.  It is a difficult area.  That is the point I was making earlier.</p> <p>  If we are not capturing the data correctly and if employment is not being properly recorded, we cannot be as definitive as Mr. McKeon is in saying that it is not as prevalent.  Mr. McKeon may be correct.  I would need the data to prove to me it is correct and I do not have it.</p></speech>

It is difficult and it is something that we find frustrating in the Department.  It is difficult for someone who is being paid to stand up and say:  "The person who is paying me is not paying me the way I would like to be paid" or "The person is paying me on a contract for services instead of a contract of service."  We appreciate that is difficult.</p> <p>  That is why we did the media campaign.  We encouraged people to contact the Department, on an anonymous and secure basis.  We spent more on that media campaign than we did, for example, on the famous "welfare cheats" campaign last year.  We spend more on the campaign asking people to please tell us about whether they thought they were in a situation of being falsely self-employed, and received 50 calls.</p></speech>

The ESRI has clean hands on this.  I believe we have clean hands.  We are still concerned about it.  The Deputy should not get me wrong.  I am just saying it is not as prevalent.</p> <p>  We will be increasing employer inspections.  We will be focusing on the construction sector.  Perhaps, based on what have got from the Dublin experience, the private security sector is an area to look at.  There are some other sectors.  The Deputy mentioned RT&Eacute;.  We will have a look at that in due course.  There is an investigation going on there at present.</p></speech>

The Government has extended the benefits available to self-employed people to include treatment benefit, invalidity pension and so on.  The main benefits that they cannot access are illness benefit and jobseeker's benefit, but the Government has just announced that it will introduce a jobseeker's benefit for formerly self-employed people.  The percentage of entitlements that self-employed people will not be able to access will be small.</p></speech>

When some applied for benefits, means would have been found to decide against them and they would have been paid allowances instead of benefits.

I cannot recall the details, but a review was undertaken.  The committee should be aware that the nearly 90% of people who presented as self-employed and did not qualify for jobseeker's benefit ultimately qualified for the jobseeker's allowance, which is the means-tested scheme.  That was a high proportion, which reflects the fact that many people who are self-employed - trades people, crafts people and so on - do not necessarily have the large reservoirs of personal wealth that would disqualify them from a means-tested allowance.</p></speech>

In the domiciliary care allowance application process, an applicant now sets out his or her case.  It is not the old type of form where an applicant would tick a box beside "Domiciliary Care Allowance" and everyone got it.  This was done to improve it, make it more user friendly and whatever.  Did I correctly hear Mr. McKeon state that the Department was moving towards the same method for the carer's allowance application form?</p></speech>

I take it that it will be for new applicants.  The Department will have to give people an explanation as to how to work the new form.  Those who have been used to ticking a box will now find themselves having to state their cases and write essays, as it were.  They will need help.  It is a good system and I have helped many people with their domiciliary care allowance applications, documenting what they do from the moment they wake up right through the day.  It is the same for elderly people, who must set out their living circumstances.  I imagine that the assessment process will take more time, given the volume of information about the persons being cared for, where they live, how many hours of care are provided and so on that will have to be read.  Why has the Department come to this decision and will it be a good thing?</p></speech>

The change to the domiciliary care allowance application process, which he is familiar with, was done in co-operation with the stakeholders and people involved, for example, the parents.  As the Chairman is probably aware, the rate of approval at first instance is much higher because we get a great deal more information now, which leads to fewer appeals.  The application process is done more quickly.  As Mr. McKeon stated, our response rates and processing times in that regard are quite good.</p></speech>

The reduction is due in part to getting far better information.  For example, families keep diaries and so on.  The Chairman will be aware of that from his own work.  We will use that model in the carers area and in due course will use it in the disability allowance area.</p> <p>  The medical schemes are the most difficult and take the longest for the reasons outlined.  We have used the same model for the carer's allowance.  As a means of learning, there have been considerable discussions with the advocacy groups and people who are in receipt of the entitlements.  We need to hold discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, which represents general practitioners, GPs.  We have a new form.  While it is far more detailed, we hope that, as with the domiciliary care allowance, the level of approvals at first instance will be higher and we will have all of the medical and non-medical information that we need at the first point.</p></speech>

In the medical section, there may be 12 separate queries where an applicant must tick "Mild", "Moderate", "Severe" or "Profound".  Eleven of the 12 relate to physical difficulties, for example, whether someone can walk, climb a stairs and so on, and many people who have mental illnesses feel that the forms are weighted in favour of physical illnesses.</p><p>There is very little space for people with severe depression or who are suicidal.  The form does not adequately capture the reality for a lot of applicants.  They might be able to run up and down the stairs but the doctor ticks just one section for mental health.</p></speech>

We are assuming that the economy is growing and that some of that will translate into real earnings growth.  I think that is reasonable.  The second thing is-----</p></speech>

Another thing they did, to be fair, was a sensitivity analysis.  High, low and base case earnings growth models were all done.  I agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Many of these assumptions have to be examined.  There was a projection that we would be heading back into deficit in 2019 but we are not.  The surplus is actually growing.  Even within three years, therefore, this has gone a little askew.  We hope that is goes more askew in the same direction.</p></speech>

The Irish pension share expenditure on public pensions as GNI* was about 4%.  Many other countries that are already ahead of us have equivalent GDP spending of about 8%.  That is, effectively, what is said will happen in Ireland.  It is just a question of whether that 8% spending is funded through the Social Insurance Fund or whether it comes out of general taxation.</p></speech>

A person has to be 26 years old to get the full rate.  There is a reduced rate for someone who is 25 years old and a more reduced rate again for people who are between 18 and 24 years old.  The 4,700 people on the rate were examined and the Comptroller and Auditor General found that there were 486 people on the full payment who should not have been.  How did those errors arise?  I do not understand how the mistakes were made if a person's date of birth is known when he or she makes a claim and he or she also has a public services card.

We worked through the first set of cases we got from the Comptroller and Auditor General and, between us, we decided what the final error cases were.  It is complex and even within our various Intreo offices we had a debate about some of these cases and whether they should or they should not get the benefit of the exemption and be paid on the higher rate.  It is not as straightforward as might be thought.  For the future, firstly we have put in better training.

Generally one stops paying PRSI on one's 66th birthday.  What is the position on self-employed people in this regard?  The chapter is about them.  If the self-employed make an annual return on income for the calendar year in which they turn 66, their income covers the full year and their payment to the tax office is for the full 52 weeks.  I understand there is a mechanism whereby one can add the number of days up to one's 66th birthday to increase one's number of contributions but this is not taken into account in working out one's annual average.  I believed the legislation stated that if one is self-employed, there is zero or 52 weeks' PRSI.  Do the delegates understand the question I am asking?  They must know the question.</p></speech>

There are thousands affected.  Could I have the full rundown?  Letters were being issued to people.  What is the current position on that?  When did the people get their increases?  We will ask for a detailed breakdown.  Perhaps the witnesses have already done so through parliamentary questions but I have not been taking account of it.  How many people are getting increases?

There are 70,000 in Ireland and 7,000 outside Ireland.  I believe there were 77,000 in total.  We have taken on 74 staff on a temporary basis and will take on more in the new year.  In January, we will start to do the exercise on recalibrating or recalculating everybody's pension entitlement.  We will write to them at that time.  Nobody will get a reduction.  We will be writing to people telling them we have made a calculation and that it works out at a certain value.  The correspondence will state they are getting an increase or that the value will remain the same.  People will be able to ask for a review.  It is a deciding officer's decision.  If one believes a calculation has been made incorrectly, one will be able to request a review.  We hope to start making the first payments of the new pension fairly early in the first quarter but it will probably take us from three to five months to get through all 70,000 odd, stating what each calculation is and getting those concerned to come onto the new system and so on.  That is the current position.  We will not know the numbers until we carry out the reviews.</p></speech>

If they do not have the answer, they may send it on.  Reference was made to the HAP.  On the Joe Duffy show all week, landlords were ringing in saying they took on tenants on the HAP and had no problem doing so but then received a letter from the local authority or the central processing body in Limerick stating that because those tenants did not pay their rent contributions, amounting to 14% or 15%, the landlords' payments would be stopped.  How many landlords had their HAP suspended during the course of the year to date?  Could I have a breakdown of the reasons, especially where it was through no fault of the landlord and was because a tenant did not pay his or her proportion?  The witnesses will have heard that controversy raging all week.  Could they talk to us about it?</p></speech>

Is there anyone receiving a HAP in respect of over 30 properties?</p></speech>

With regard to payments to landlords, we have a very robust system in place in the HAP shared services centre in Limerick.  Where tenants are beginning to get into trouble in terms of arrears, there is a system whereby a numbers of letters are triggered.  The rate of collection of rent is 98%.  Only 1% of cases would be of the kind referred to by the Chairman.  To date, 575 tenancies ceased where a payment was not made.</p></speech>

I was listening to what Joe Duffy was reading out all week.  The landlords knew that if the tenant's 15% did not go in, the entire payment would be stopped.  Therefore, some landlords said they were paying the 15% to make sure they got the 85% because they had a mortgage on their property.</p></speech>

One of the objectives of the HAP shared services centre in Limerick is to streamline processes to make it easy for the landlord.  Once the landlord is set up and the paperwork is done, it is very straightforward.  On the last Wednesday of the month, the landlord is paid.  The differential rent comes into the shared service and the landlord is paid.  All the regulation and paperwork is done through the shared service so there is a centre of excellence, shall we say, for landlord and tenant.  It works well.</p></speech>

There were agents on the radio during the week.  An agent was saying he was the collecting agent and was passing it on to the landlord.  Out of the 21,000 or 42,000, how many are covered by agents?  I am sure some agents could have 100 or more properties.  They might not be the landlords but they are agents.  I do not want a breakdown on landlords alone.</p><p>The HAP shared service officials will have details of that.  Ms Hurley and her colleagues might send that on to us as soon as possible.</p><p> My two final questions for the officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection relate to the briefing note they supplied.  I refer to document 1745(2).  We have been given a summary of the outturn for 2017 and for this year up to the end of October under all categories of payments.  We have also been given the 2018 Estimate.  My question relates to Appendix 2 to the document and the working age employment supports.  I am surprised that the T&uacute;s Estimate for 2018 represents a considerable reduction on last year's outturn and that the Department's Estimates for the back-to-work enterprise and back-to-education allowances and back-to-work family dividend represent a considerable reduction on last year's figures.  Will Mr. McKeon comment on why the Estimates for 2018 are significantly below the previous figures?</p></speech>

In fact, the number of people on T&uacute;s this year is probably a little higher than it was last year.  The outturn for 2018 might be closer to the outturn for 2017.  Perhaps it will be a little higher.  That is what will happen regarding T&uacute;s.</p> <p>  The back-to-education and back-to-work enterprise allowances and the back-to-work family dividend are led by the demand from people leaving the live register.  As the number of people on the live register is falling a little more quickly than it had been, not as many people are leaving the live register to go into education or to set up their own businesses.  It is purely a question of demand.  We are not doing anything.</p></speech>

Mr. McKeon said the opposite earlier with regard to the back-to-work family dividend, which used to be known as FIS.  It was mentioned earlier that people are leaving social welfare and going into work.  This means there should be an increased demand for the back-to-work family dividend.</p></speech>

That dividend is a payment made to people who leave the live register.  It allows people who have children to keep the qualified child portion of their payments.

The document in question is on the screen.  I refer to page 23.  I have to compliment the Department in this regard.  I do not have a question on it.  There have been annual increases in the value of the overpayments being recovered by the Department.  The overall figure increased from &euro;50 million in 2012 to &euro;81 million last year.  The Department has stepped up its collection of overpayments.  There has been a great deal of discussion about this.  Total overpayments in 2017 came to &euro;111 million whereas, last year, overpayments of &euro;81 million have been collected.  The Department is heading towards a position where it might recover more in overpayments than it overpays.  The gap is closing.</p></speech>

There was a gap of &euro;56 million in 2013, when overpayments of &euro;127 million were made and overpayments of &euro;71 million were recovered.  Last year, the Department overpaid &euro;110 million and recovered &euro;81 million.  The gap has reduced considerably.  Progress is being made.  I am not here to knock it; progress is being made.  Overpayments are not increasing and the recovery of previous overpayments is improving.  That is to be recommended.</p> <p>  We referred in our latest periodic report to the writing off of small amounts of less than &euro;100.  According to a chart on page 25, some &euro;501 million of outstanding debt - presumably from overpayments - was due to the Department at the end of last year.  More than 30% of that is pre-2010 debt and is, therefore, more than eight years old, and another 36% of it is debt that was accumulated between 2010 and 2014.  The majority of this debt is historic.  What are the chances of the Department collecting that historic debt, especially the pre-2010 debt?  Will these figures sit on the chart year after year?  Is the Department making much progress on the old stuff?</p></speech>

In the past year, we have written off &euro;41.5 million in old legacy debt associated with pre-2011 overpayments.  In each of these cases, the value of the debt was less than &euro;10,000 and no repayment had been collected since 2015.  We wrote off &euro;41.5 million in just over 33,000 cases.</p></speech>

It relates to the process whereby the Department enters into arrangements for the repayment of overpayments, perhaps caused by accidental payments or rollovers.</p><p>Surely the Department has some sort of legislative backing for deducting money from existing social welfare payments rather than trying to get it back.  If it has, why is it not using it?  If some debts go back to the 1980s and the debtors are in receipt of social welfare in any form, surely there is a means by which small sums, say &euro;5 a week, can be deducted, at least making some inroad. </p></speech>

That is since 2012.  We are gradually going back through the years.  The main issue with debt recovery is that the quicker it is done, the better the chance of success.  If it is left for a longer time, it gets harder to make the recoveries.  In recent years, we have been trying to concentrate on more recent debt, but we are working our way back.  Among people who are receiving a payment from us at the moment, a high percentage are making repayments.  We have a legislative basis for this.  There is a basis under social welfare legislation for us to take up to 15% of the personal rate, and we do that in certain cases.  We try to agree a repayment plan with people who have been overpaid, but there is a provision that allows us to take 15% of the personal rate if someone does not co-operate with us.</p></speech>

They might ask why they had not been told so they could pay it back rather than be hit with the debt when drawing a pension.  As a Deputy, I have found that sometimes somebody advises a person to verify how a debt arose.  A local office's paperwork on a claim from ten years previously is consulted about a claim the person says he or she did not make.  The evidence is not always up to scratch on the old stuff.  The Department probably has to take a pragmatic view on some of that stuff if the old records are not great.</p> <p>  We have covered great ground.  We have discussed five chapters of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, as well as the Department's annual accounts and the social insurance fund.  I did not think we would get through it all today.  I consistently have to compliment this Department.  The officials have answered questions and provided all the information sought.  In due course we will get anything they have not provided.  That has added to the smooth running of the meeting.  It allows them to get all the answers out and it allows us to get all our work done.  I originally thought this would take two meetings over two days.  A couple of organisations are very good when they appear before the committee, and it helps the smooth running of the committee.  I thank everyone from this Department, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Revenue Commissioners and the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are similar.  The objective is to have consistency within the Bill.  The change proposed in amendment No. 1 would need to be made again in section 3.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are linked because they replace the definition in question with a different one.  These amendments are about consistency.  The Minister of State will recall the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011, passed recently by these Houses, which makes provision for claims to be made for those who had insurance with Setanta or claims relating to that company.  I understand the payments are to be made later this week or early next week, which is very welcome.  The phrase &quot;risk in the State&quot; is consistently used throughout the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011.  Therefore, it would seem logical to use the same wording here rather than the phrase &quot;Irish-based risk&quot;.  Amendment No. 6 defines this as per the 2011 Act.  Amendment No. 5 deletes the definition in the Bill and replaces it with the one in the 2011 Act, the purpose being to have consistency in how we interpret risk.</p><p>The Minister's definition, which amendment No. 5 deletes, states that an Irish-based risk means &quot;a risk, falling within a relevant class of non-life insurance, that, by virtue of regulations under section 7(1), is regarded, for the purposes of this Act, as a risk based in the State&quot;.  The current text ends up defining the subject as a risk based in the State.  The definition I am suggesting is that used in the 2011 Act.  If my amendment is not accepted, this Bill will define Irish-based risks and another two Acts would be defining risks in the State.  There is a lack of consistency.</p><p>Section 7, which we will discuss in more detail later and which refers to risks based in the State, allows the Central Bank to make regulations specifying what counts as risk based in the State, but we already have a definition.  The only reason for a redefinition, which is what is included in this Bill, is to limit the range of insurance types that would be caught by the definition.  It seems confusing given that we have two Acts that define the risks as risks in the State as opposed to Irish-based risks, which we are now trying to introduce.  The  amendments make the point that we should be using the definition already established and used in numerous Acts.  Is there any reason non-life insurance should be excluded from the database?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#B00700"><p>I shall read my note and then deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.  Amendment No. 1 is opposed on the basis that it travels with a substantive amendment to section 4, which is also opposed.  It is intended that risks in the State would be defined by regulation, rather than in the primary legislation, to minimise the need to amend the legislation in future.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are opposed on the basis that the incremental way in which relevant classes of non-life insurance will be provided for by in the database over time &ndash; we are starting with motor insurance - means that much of the text of the amendments would not be initially relevant or appropriate.</p> <p>  The definition of a "risk in the State", which is used by the Deputy, is that which is used in the Insurance Act 1964 in respect of the framework for compensation in the event of an insurance insolvency or administration.  That 1964 Act definition is split out in terms of what risks are excluded and uses categories that may not be contemplated in terms of the database - for example, travel insurance.  The current drafting requires the Central Bank to provide for the definition of an Irish-based risk in this Bill to be analogous to the 1964 Act definition while providing flexibility to vary it where appropriate.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel believes the current drafting better serves the purpose of defining risk in the State for this Bill rather than using the definition in the 1964 Act.</p> <p>  It is matter of whether or which.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel believes that what we have in place is better than what the Deputy is proposing.  The aim is certainly is not to limit the definition in the legislation concerning what will be calculated by the Central Bank.  It is quite the opposite.  Rather than being prescriptive, we want to leave it open in order that all information from different streams can be calculated by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

We are now introducing a different category of risk, namely risk that is Irish based as opposed to what is already established, which is a risk to the State.</p></speech>

The Bill is doing exactly what we require it to do, which is to provide for the collection and collation of the information for all the areas of insurance that might be relevant.  We are starting with motor insurance and over a period we will flow between other areas where calculation is required.  We are satisfied that what the Deputy proposes is not required.  We are satisfied there is no issue of consistency.  It is a matter of whether or which.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel believes what we are doing and how we are doing it comprise the better approach.</p></speech>

The Minister gave the example of travel insurance, which sounds fine, but amendment No. 6 defines "a risk in the State", which is what is already included in the legislation.  It is not coming from my pen but from what we have already passed.  Subsection 2(f)(c) of the 2011 Act refers to "a risk relating to travel or holidays where the policy holder took out the policy in the State and the duration of the policy is 4 months or less".  How does that stack against the fact that the Minister of State is suggesting the existing criteria do not actually include travel insurance given that it is explicitly stated that they do?</p></speech>

I hope it can be expanded sooner rather than later.  I do not want to put on the record a date if I am unsure it can happen.  The Central Bank is carrying out a feasibility study incorporating a ten-year look-back at settlement channels and different categories of motor insurance claims.  This would include windscreen damage, theft, fire, accidents and personal liability.  There is a large body of work to get through in the context of that exercise.  When it is completed, the database will be updated annually.  I cannot say for certain when it will be possible to expand beyond motor insurance into the next section.</p></speech>

That said, I will deal with them together.</p><p>The blue book contains specific headings defining business expenses.  This is a critical issue because it sets the parameters insurers must follow.  Otherwise we would effectively be allowing them to self-declare.  For example, returns in respect of non-life insurance business must not be distorted by agreements between the companies concerned or by arrangements which could affect the apportionment of expenses.  Management expenses should not be charged to underwriting accounts, including directors' fees and foreign exchange gains or losses related to investments other than those attributable to the underwriting account.</p><p>The amendment seeks to tighten up on what can be declared as expenses and to distinguish between what are genuine business expense costs and what are distortionary bookkeeping exercises.  I will give an example of how they can be inflated.  We need to do this in primary legislation.  It is important that parameters are set down here at this time.  Responsibility should not be delegated to the Central Bank; we need to decide on certain parameters.</p><p>When dealing with people trying to get insurance, we must do everything to ensure that the database helps them get insurance at a reasonable price.  This is about tightening up and ensuring that there cannot be an inflation of or a bookkeeping exercise in terms of expenses that can be declared.</p><p>As stated, I do not believe amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are related.  Amendment No. 7 outlines a number of steps which can be counted in the context of the section.  It deals with the issue of transparency which is at the core.  It also deals with out-of-court discussions through unofficial channels that are not recorded in any way.  By adding these two additional non-formal steps I am trying to ensure the data collected include these informal discussions which are not captured in the Bill at the moment.  The additional informal discussions to be captured if the amendment is accepted would be:</p><blockquote>(c) direct negotiation after registration of the claim by the claimant under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 but before the respondent consents or declines a formal assessment progressing,<br /><br />(d) direct negotiation after consent by the respondent to a formal assessment but before a final award is made under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 or final determination of the claim by the acceptance of both parties, or by default of rejection by the respondent, of the formal award under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003.</blockquote><p>These areas are not currently captured by the Bill.  It is important to have the full data available in order that we know what is happening through informal channels and other parts of resolutions to ensure all of the data are captured in the database.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#D00200"><p>The items mentioned in amendment No. 3 already fall within the existing definition.  The approach of individually specifying this level of detail is not in keeping with the general drafting approach taken in the Bill.  We propose to set down in primary legislation a framework within which the Central Bank will establish an administrative claims database that will allow the specific approach to evolve over time.  It is intended that the data to be collected from insurers will be defined by regulation, rather than in the primary legislation, to minimise the need to amend the legislation as the level of data collected in the future becomes more detailed.  The Central Bank has informed me that it will take the substance of the amendment into account when it finalises its data specification in order that the data outlined are collected in this way.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about distortion in bookkeeping exercises, they are not going to be acceptable to anybody, let alone the Central Bank.  It is a sharp practice that certainly could not be accommodated anywhere.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 is being opposed on the basis that it comprises detail which is unnecessary to drill down into the primary legislation and that is appropriately covered in the existing text.  In that regard, the existing provision which provides for "the employment of the procedures under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board" covers all of the cases which come within its scope, including those set out in the amendment.  It is similarly covered already.  </p> <p>  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has also highlighted in respect of this provision that there are deficiencies in the terminology used in the amendment.  As such, it does not properly reflect the wording of the original Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 which is referenced.  In addition, in trying to break down the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process into a series of component parts we run the risk of missing out on certain elements.  For example, having consulted directly with it, we understand the proposed amendment may not cover cases that the board releases almost immediately under section 17 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 where consent has not been sought from the respondents.  These may be cases such as psychological bullying, abuse, etc. that may ultimately be settled after concluding the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process.  This means that there is a possibility that it would not allow for all settlements made in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process to be captured, thereby unintentionally decreasing the scope of the information that might be requested.  On the basis that the existing text captures all scenarios within the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process, I do not think it advisable for the committee to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

On being prescriptive, the reality is that insurance companies are not to be trusted.  They are under investigation for engaging in cartel-like activities and were raided by European authorities.  I have no qualms in saying they are ripping people off.  I received an email late last night from a person who was being fleeced in seeking to get motor insurance.  It is not possible to pay insurance premiums upfront.  The insurance companies are then allowed to add additional charges because people pay in monthly instalments.  No matter what way they turn, they feel under serious pressure.  To tell the Minister of State God's honest truth, I would not trust insurance companies as far as I could throw them.  We know that this happens.  We know that businesses and accountants look at how expenses can be offset from a subsidiary here to one elsewhere to present figures in a different way and that best suits it.  Amendment No. 3 would not limit how business expenses would be defined, but it sets out clearly what needs to be included.  I do not, therefore, hear any reason it should not be included.  The Minister of State, rightly, talked about it not being in keeping with the Bill, as drafted.  He will see, however, in a number of my amendments, that I believe that, as legislators, after what we have come through and given the reasson we know that this is needed, we do not need to agree to loose legislation that allows the Central Bank which I trust to interpret what we would like to do.  The Central Bank is independent in implementing Acts and using powers passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is interaction where we set down the ground rules for how this issue will be dealt with.  Therefore, we do need to be more prescriptive.  The reality is that this has been happening and the Central Bank has not been the great protector of consumers who have witnessed increases of 70% over a period of three years.  The Central Bank was also not the great protector of consumers when it came to the scandal of tracker mortgages, etc.  There is, therefore, an onus on us to be prescriptive to a certain degree.  That is what amendment No. 3 attempts to do.  It tries to ensure, in so far as is possible, that we will not see the industry using its accountants to try to cook the books.  I refer to the use of business expenses as a way to reduce the figures that the industry will present in the claims database.</p></speech>

I will not pretend that I am pleased with the method by which the Central Bank has taken consumers into its bosom.  The reality is that it is much more concerned about prudential regulation than consumer protection.  I think the Deputy's criticism is fair and I agree with his point.  </p> <p>  On business expenses, I do not have the exact figure offhand, but awards account for more than 90% of funds paid out by insurance companies.  In talking about business expenses the Deputy used the term "cooking the books".  It is not one I will use, but in the scheme of things business expenses actually come to a small amount.  In this jurisdiction awards constitute the much larger amount.  We have had this conversation before and I have made the point to the Deputy.  If he is satisfied, I am prepared to give a commitment that what he is asking for can be captured by regulation, rather than primary legislation.  The legislation has been designed in that way in order that we do not have to be prescriptive.  There is flexibility to enable the Central Bank to capture everything we want it to capture in the future.  It is much easier to alter a regulation rather than legislation.</p></speech>

The current definition of &quot;direct negotiation&quot; in subsection (4) is very limited.  It is more a definition of formal negotiation than direct negotiation.</p><p>I believe we need a full picture.  What the amendment does, simply, is make clear that this would involve not only negotiation involving in whole or in part the services of a solicitor or counsel as happens at present and would add "by either the claimant or the insurance undertaking or by both".  This will make it clear that if there is only one side with a solicitor or counsel, then it is deemed as direct negotiation and it can be captured.</p></speech>

The definition can only be changed by the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The definition in this case has direct negotiation as including in whole or in part the services of a solicitor or counsel.</p> <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to reflect on this.  The amendment does not take away from the provision unless I am unaware of some legal issue arising from the Office of the Attorney General.  If that is the case I would be happy to hear it.  In any case, this amendment makes clear that this is by either the claimant or the insurance undertaking or by both.  The interpretation of the provision could lead to what would be defined as a more formal negotiation between two sets of counsel or solicitors, as opposed to an individual making contact with an insurance solicitor or insurance company's legal representatives in an agreement or settlement that would not be captured.</p></speech>

The point is similar to the point I was making with amendment No. 4.  It relates to the Mediation Act.  I wish to reflect on the Long Title and what it tells us about the purpose of it.  It refers to an Act "to facilitate the settlement of disputes by mediation, to specify the principles applicable to mediation, to specify arrangements for mediation as an alternative to the institution of civil proceedings or to the continuation of civil proceedings that have been instituted".  The question arises as to why this would not be included in the Bill as a step to take into account.  Basically, the amendment inserts in page 5 an additional term: "or mediation as per the Mediation Act 2017".  Obviously the process is now legally underpinned by statute and should be included as part of the steps that would be taken into account.</p></speech>

Section 6(1) states that the relevant information will be made available to the State to enable us to identify factors that influence the cost of insurance.  To what end?  Who will actually get this information?  What are such persons going to do with the information?  That is my first point and it is a fundamental issue.  There must be transparency.  Will a potential new competitor have access to the information referred to in section 6(1)?</p> <p>  The section also brings up questions of delegation.  This is the trend in the legislation.  The language of this section includes phrases like "in the opinion of the bank", "special consideration of any views expressed by the Minister" and "shall be carried out from time to time as occasion requires".  This is the opposite of what we need to be doing, which is to bring in far more robust legislation that is not as opaque as this section appears to be.  There is concern &ndash; it arises throughout the Bill &ndash; that notwithstanding my support for the purpose of the Bill, the language is rather opaque.  My fundamental question relates to the information in section 6(1).  What is the State going to do with this information upon getting it?  To what end will the State collect the information?  Will new competitors have access to the information referred to?</p></speech>

This allows for the extension of the scope of the database to different classes of non-life insurance in future on foot of an assessment by the Central Bank of the appropriateness of such an extension after consultation with the Minister for Finance without requiring further amendments to the legislation.</p><p>The section, therefore, provides for several principles and policies, in which one of the guiding principles in any potential extension of scope relates to the cost of that class of insurance.  As per the recommendations of the cost of insurance working group, it is intended, in the first instance, that the database will focus on the private motor insurance sector.  Consequently, it is proposed that this area will be the subject of the first set of regulations to be developed by the bank.  It is important to give this matter appropriate consideration before expanding into other classes of insurance.</p><p> A report will be published at least once a year.  When the first report is published, we will have a decade of information.  Some 20%, 30% or 40% of cases might be settled without a medical report.  If a significant number are being settled without a medical report, it falls to those of us who set policy, namely, the Department of Finance and the committee, to examine why insurance companies are settling injury claims in such a way.  They have different methodologies for calculating what they pay out and at what stage.  Some settle claims very early, while some do so without a medical report.  Some settle them too early, while others challenge people with a very clear and obvious case for damages through no fault of their own every step of the way.  We are trying to access the data to understand the flow of information.  We have information on 30% of claims which are publicly settled in court or by the Personal Injuries Assessment Bureau but none on the remaining 70% of settlements.</p></speech>

Section 8(3) states: &ldquo;In relation to the data to be collected by the Bank from an insurance undertaking under <i>subsection (2)</i>, the insurance undertaking shall use its best endeavours to provide the information to the Bank in such a form so that no individual is identifiable from it&rdquo;.  That gives significant latitude to the insurance industry.  It is not held to any standard in providing the information.  As a company has the information, for what reason does the section state it &ldquo;shall use its best endeavours&rdquo; to provide it?  It should read, &ldquo;the insurance undertaking shall provide the information to the Bank in such a form so that no individual is identifiable from it&rdquo;.  Why are we letting insurance companies off the hook by allowing them to state they have used their best endeavours but that it was difficult and that they could not find the file?  We should make it very clear insurance companies have a responsibility to provide the information in the required form.</p></speech>

It might be easy to identify a very large claim settled publicly by a small insurer.  If we were to set the very high threshold suggested in the amendment, it could cause insurers to take an overly conservative view of the information they were comfortable in sharing with the bank, which would result in a deficit in usable data.  The amendment is also opposed on the basis that it is unnecessary in the context of data protection, as an appropriate safeguard has been included in the section to protect personal data.  Where an insurer provides information from which an individual is identifiable, the Central Bank is mandated under subsection (3) to ensure the information is not disclosed by it.  That requirement is in addition to, rather than in substitution for, any other data protection requirement in the Bill or the Data Protection Act 2018.  We do not want insurance companies to propose giving aggregated information to the Central Bank in order to avoid the potential identification of an individual from among a smaller number of claims, bearing in mind data protection requirements.  That is why the section provides that insurers shall use their best endeavours to provide the information.</p></speech>

It is not appropriate to include that provision as we should be facilitating transparency.  The identification of an insurance undertaking is appropriate in certain circumstances.  I accept that as a result of the blanket deletion proposed in the amendment, it would also delete the protection for individuals, which is not its aim.  I will, therefore, examine the issue further on Report Stage.</p> <p>  We have discussed the issue of &ldquo;best endeavours&rdquo; in the context of the provision of data under the section.  The Minister of State will be aware that under recommendation No. 4 made in the report of the cost of insurance working group, a data template was sent to the insurance industry in May.  The intention was that it would respond to him by quarter 3 in order that the data could be published before the end of the year.  However, it told him that that would not be possible but that it had begun to collect the data.  In certain respects, I do not trust the industry as far as I could throw it.</p><p>There is language in this Bill that we need to examine on Report Stage that looks at some of these issues.</p><p> An amendment of mine on this section that was ruled out order would have given a greater breakdown of each expenditure type in the settlement channels and would have empowered the Central Bank to correct public statements from insurers that are not accurate.  I think those amendments should be considered by the Department.  The Minister mentioned consumer protection.  The Central Bank should be empowered to correct public statements by insurers that are not accurate because they are deeply misleading.</p><p> Another amendment of mine was ruled out of order.  The Chairman is becoming very strict in respect of disallowing all my amendments and is becoming very soft on the insurance industry.  I have the letter with his signature to prove it.  I am only joking.  I know it is not the Chairman.</p></speech>

It is whoever is pulling his strings.  A number of amendments were ruled out of order.  One of them was ruled out of order for reasons beyond my understanding.  The official response as to why it was ruled out of order was that it would impose a charge on the State.  This was to specify that motor insurance or public liability insurance would be subject to this database.  We all know here that the intention is that motor insurers would be subject to this database but it does not say that in the Bill.  That is what the amendment sought to do.  It sought to ensure that the Central Bank does do that because it is not in the legislation.  It was ruled out of order because it would be a charge on the State.  How the hell could it be a charge on the State unless it was not intended to do it in the Bill in the first place?  If this is what the Bill is all about, let us state the obvious and say that under no circumstances can motor insurance not be included in respect of this database.  The amendment has been ruled out of order because that could be a charge on the State.  It cannot be a charge on the State if it is going to happen.  When this legislation passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President, it goes to the Central Bank.  No harm to it but we cannot go in and go through this again.  This is our opportunity to be tight and to make sure that what we want is there.  I will talk to those responsible for ruling these amendments out of order and get a better understanding of the reasons for doing so but I make those points to say that the Minister of State should look at clarifying these issues by looking at some of the amendments that have been ruled out of order.  I ask the Minister of State to look at them before Report Stage.</p></speech>

After all, the Central Bank is part of the European system of banks.  The problem with Central Bank reports is that from the point of view of ordinary people, many of them are inevitably highly technical.  Would the Minister of State be agreeable to providing broadly based information and comparators, including all other countries in the European banking system because they all collect data, so that is not putting any big burden on anybody?  In respect of the ongoing conversation about insurance and how expensive it is, it would enable us to build up comparators over time that would be useful to policymakers here and give us insights into how much value for money is provided by insurance in Ireland compared with how much it costs.  We have a lot of anecdotal information.  In many European countries that are part of the same European central banking system, financial services like insurance are simply not as expensive as they are in Ireland.  Would the Minister of State be open to discussing or even showing us what this report is likely to look like?  Given that the Central Bank is a member of the European system, can we not see how it shapes up in terms of this kind of regulation compared with other European banks?  Would the Minister of State accept an amendment like that?  I appreciate that this is a Finance Bill so the ball is entirely in the Minister of State's court as to whether he accepts or rejects an amendment.</p></speech>

The Bill is about doing a job, namely, to collect the Irish information - not information relating to France, Spain, Germany or anywhere - and make comparisons.  The Deputy made the point that insurance value in Ireland is poor compared with other jurisdictions.  There is a single reason for that.  We have the highest awards in the world.  That is the reason it is expensive here and much less expensive in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

In terms of motor insurance, we are down 23% since the peak, according to the CSO.  This will be a very important aspect of further reducing premia.  The Deputy asked me how I know about the awards.  We have benchmarked awards in Ireland through the report of the Personal Injuries Commission chaired by Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.  On average, a soft tissue award in Ireland is 4.4 times greater than elsewhere, so if a person gets &euro;10,000 in the UK, he or she will get &euro;44,000 here.  This is not an attractive jurisdiction for insurance companies.  How do I know that?  Quite a few of them have left.  They have left because the sector is expensive, the awards are high and many of those companies were not profitable.  It is very easy for them to move their capital and go to another jurisdiction where things are better operationally.  This is important legislation to get through the Houses.</p> <p>  According to Mr. Justice Kearns, the recalibration should be undertaken by the judicial council when it is established.  I met the Minister for Justice and Equality and the expectation is that all of that will be concluded - the legislation for the establishment of the judicial council, the establishment of the council and the work on recalibrating the book of quantum, which will reduce the awards.  This is when we will see a further decrease in premia.  That is the objective of everybody in this room.</p></speech>

What amount of information will the public - ordinary consumers - be given regarding this section?  If we are setting up a database under which we will eventually have anonymised data, I cannot understand why it would not be part of the Central Bank's function to put information about what has been gleaned into the public domain regularly, as is done in many European countries.</p><p>I am not asking for personal details about anything.  I am asking for information that is useful to consumers.  The Minister of State's concern, I understand, is with the insurance industry but there needs to be concern about the consumers who are paying high premiums here.</p></speech>

The information flow will benefit the consumers based upon policy direction.  As I stated a moment ago, we have sight of 30% of the settlement channels.  We have no sight over exactly how the awards are affecting the premia but we will have sight over them when this legislation is passed.</p> <p>  When we pass the legislation, potentially, there will be more information.  The 70% of the settlement channels of which we have no knowledge at present will be available and we will be able to see whether a percentage of companies are settling too earlier and whether some companies are settling without a medical report because it is probably cheaper commercially.  If that is the case, it falls within the ambit of the Oireachtas to do something about it.  We will not see until we get the information flow.  The information flow will be a ten-year look backwards.  Some of that work, in terms of the types of insurance and the types of flow, is done already.</p></speech>

In response, the ECB invited the Minister to clarify through appropriate amendments that any anticipated or actual shortfall of funds to defray the bank's expenses under the draft law will always be granted by the Minister on a regular and prompt basis as the costs arise to ensure that the bank does not have to fund the cost of its task under the draft law from its own funds.  Further information on this was provided to members in the briefing sent to the committee.</p><p>As a result, I am introducing this technical amendment to section 11(3) to reflect that the Minister shall, rather than may, on the written request of the bank, advance to the bank such sums he or she thinks proper to enable the bank to defray all of its expenses, arising in that year, associated with the function the bank is required to perform under the legislation.</p><p>I believe that this amendment, on balance, is sufficient to address any hypothetical concerns around future monetary financing raised by the ECB in its opinion.</p></speech>

This consideration took into account the need for balance and constitutional proportionality and has been signed off by the Attorney General.  Therefore, while legislation can always be challenged, we are satisfied that constitutional issues should not arise in the context of these two limited amendments and that there should not be any unintended negative consequences for genuine claimants.</p><p>On section 8, the amendment deals first with the letter of claim and the potential consequences of a failure to serve a notice in writing on the alleged wrongdoer within a prescribed period from the date of the cause of action &ndash; currently two months.  The cost of insurance working group formed the view that section 8 should be amended to enhance the effectiveness of this statutory requirement.</p><p>The key aim of this amendment is to reduce the notification period for the serving of a letter of claim from two months to one month, to align the time period with data protection legislation and the new general data protection regulation, GDPR, which came into force on 25 May 2018 and which provides that data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is obtained &ndash; generally no more than one month.</p><p>However an exception to this rule is where information on CCTV footage, video footage or digital footage is held in the context of an investigation, such as a personal injuries claim.  Consequently, by requiring a plaintiff to notify a defendant within one month of an alleged incident under section 8, the defendant will be given the opportunity to identify within the data protection time limits any footage the defendant may have of the incident, and keep it beyond the one-month period for investigation purposes where the defendant believes the claim is questionable.  This earlier notification period will also help a defendant prepare his or her defence in a range of other ways such as being able to put together more accurate employee witness statements where this is relevant.  It also may help the defendant in accepting his or her liability as early as possible, thus enabling the claim to be settled quickly with minimal legal fees incurred.</p><p>The existing wording of section 8 needs to be strengthened in order to ensure it is used more effectively by the courts.  In this regard, it is proposed that instead of a court having the option to draw inferences from the failure to serve a letter of claim on the alleged wrongdoer within the prescribed period of time through the use of the word &quot;may&quot;, it should be required to do so as a matter of course through the use of the word &quot;shall&quot;.  It should be noted that these inferences may not always be negative as the court may conclude that there was reasonable cause for the delay in notification.  However, where the inference is negative, the court may make no order as to the payment of costs to the plaintiff or deduct such amount from costs that would, but for this section, be payable to the plaintiff as it considers appropriate.</p><p>Finally, on this part of the amendment, the working group believes that the words &quot;or as soon as practicable thereafter&quot; should be deleted as this allows arguably too much latitude to a plaintiff to delay unnecessarily before notifying the defendant.  The working group, however, is of the view that with the deletion of these words, sufficient protection still remains for the plaintiff in this section, as only where there is a failure &quot;without reasonable cause&quot; can a court draw a negative inference.  That refers to section 8.</p></speech>

I do not have an issue with that as such.</p> <p>  I have an issue with the other parts of what the Minister of State has done here.  The Minister of State has removed the words "or as soon as practicable thereafter", which allows for the court to decide whether it is practicable.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has then determined in law that the court shall draw an inference and while the note he provided to us states that such inference can be positive, the language is negative and it is designed to be a negative conclusion.  The court has the power, if it so wishes, to draw an inference.  The reason it is written in that way is because inferences are negative so that it can draw a negative view in relation to this.  Now the Minister of State is saying they shall do it but it kind of states this is good and there is nothing negative there.  There is a serious issue in that regard.</p><p>The amendment to section 14 of the 2004 Act is tinkering around the edges.  I am not sure about it.  I have not heard any reasonable explanation for why a fraudulent claimant would delay his or her own proceedings.  I do not understand why that would be the case, but that is not the core issue, which relates to a number of steps that are being taken in the amendment.  We all want fraudulent claims to be stamped out.  I will give the Minister of State the opportunity to outline to us his conversations with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on the establishment of a funded insurance fraud squad within the Garda force.  The official position is that such a body should be funded by the industry.  A number of steps are specified in the amendment.  It specifies a reduction in the notice period from two months to one month and proposes the deletion of the phrase "as soon as practicable thereafter".  Another phrase is used that is still more restrictive.  A further proposed change is that the court "shall" as opposed to "may" draw an inference.  The penalty for genuine claimants who fail to fulfil the terms of subsection (4) is that an order of costs could be made against them or the costs for that part could be made against them.  The change is far-reaching and for this reason, I cannot support the amendment.</p><p> I support the core principle of the amendment, namely, the proposed change in the term from two months to one month.  I do not have a problem with that, but the Minister of State needs to revisit the amendment on Report Stage.  If a court decides there is a reason for the claim not being been served on an individual, it is up to the court to draw a conclusion.  Courts are empowered to draw conclusions and we should allow them to make such decisions rather than dictating to them by using the word "shall".  The problem is that the change would make it harder for genuine claimants.</p><p> We are correctly coming at the legislation with the intention of stamping out fraudulent claims and driving down insurance premiums.  However, there is also a responsibility on us to look through the lens of people who are making genuine claims.  We must ask whether this is proposal will create three further hurdles that will allow insurance companies, which are multi-billion industries with lawyers akin to Goliath, to go up against individuals who were genuinely injured having been involved in a motor or other accident.  The Bill provides additional ammunition for the industry to tackle fraudulent claims but the approach would also have an effect on genuine claims.  We have got the balance wrong here.</p></speech>

It has been customary for Ministers for Finance to provide detailed notes if Members request them.  We received the text of the amendment at short notice.  This is potentially a very big change.  Did the Attorney General give advice on it?  It is a very overt direction to a court.  If, for instance, an honest claimant is caught out by the proposed change, does he or she have a mechanism to appeal what is becoming an automatic process which the Minister is trying to impose on the court?  If we could get the detailed note, we could get advice on it.</p> <p>  What mechanisms, if any, does the Minister of State have in mind to ensure that honest claimants do not lose out?  The vast majority of people are honest.  We all have a problem with fraudulent claims and we are united in wanting to stamp them out, but this is a big step up and we did not hear much about it beforehand.  We were handed copies of the proposed amendment the other day.  I would like more detailed information from the Minister of State.  Will he outline what will happen to an honest claimant who, for whatever reason, does not meet the one month deadline?  What recourse, if any, will he or she have?  Usually in such cases there is an inbuilt system akin to an appeals mechanism which would allow someone to seek a remedy if, for some reason, it was not possible to comply with the regulation.</p></speech>

The change which requires a court to draw inferences is subject to the caveat that if there is a reasonable cause for the delay, the provision mandating the court to draw inferences does not apply.  The implication of the court drawing inferences relates to costs, as set out in subsection 3(<i>b</i>)(i) and (ii), but that is only where the interests of justice so require.  That is a matter of interpretation and judgment for the judge.  Accordingly, there are caveats and safeguards.  However, it is important that the measure is properly discussed and teased out.</p><p>What practical difference will this make in a scenario where a claimant does not notify a business owner of an incident and waits until the eve of the two year anniversary to lodge a claim?  That could be the first the policyholder would have heard of it.  This practice will still be permitted and a claimant will still not have to notify a business of an alleged incident and may still take a claim on the eve of the second anniversary of the alleged incident.  In practical terms, what difference will this change make in such a scenario?</p></speech>

Many business owners have informed me of claims being made against their businesses 18 months after the event.  This practice is common in the hospitality sector, for example, in respect of nightclubs.  A business is not able to defend itself in cases where no report of an incident of any nature has been made to a staff member.  I will tie this in with Deputy Doherty's point about why a fraudulent claimant would delay proceedings.  The best ploy available to a fraudulent claimant is to make a late claim because there may no evidence of an incident on the part of the business owner and, subsequently, to drag out the case for between three and five years.  This potentially leaves an open claim on a business's books for that entire period.  Business owners have frequently told me it is cheaper to pay off a claimant, even though they have no knowledge of any incident having taken place because as long as there is an open claim on their books, their insurance premium will increase.</p></speech>

For this reason, Deputy McGrath's question is relevant.  I was referring to section 14 and cases where proceedings have already been served.</p></speech>

If a fraudulent claim has begun, why would it be to the advantage of a fraudulent claimant not to swear their pleadings?  They have to do so before the court anyway at some point.  All it does is delay the case.  That is my point; I was not referring to the delay. A period of one or two months is beneficial, notwithstanding the impact of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#K00200"><p>I will discuss section 14 afterwards, if the Deputy does not mind.  In my view and in the view of several businesses who have presented to me, this is almost 100% complete.  The number of occasions when fraudulent claims show up and they have no evidence that an incident did not happen is significant.  Heretofore, before the change in the data protection laws on 25 May, they could keep the footage for as long as they wanted - months, two years, whatever.  Now the law of the land says that footage must be deleted after one month.  It is only appropriate that we equalise the period for which the footage must be retained and the period within which people have to be notified of a case.</p> <p>  We are in no way removing the court's flexibility in dealing with somebody making a legitimate claim.  It is important to put on the record that whenever I meet businesses or groups who are concerned about insurance, everybody wants to ensure that the legitimate claimant is compensated, as we in this House do.  We provide for reasonable cause in the section to ensure that if somebody has a legitimate and reasonable cause for not notifying the party against whom they are making a claim, the court will consider that.  This does not impact upon that.</p> <p>  However, the matter of inference arose in the working group.  In this amendment, the inference pertaining to the plaintiff remains in cases where there has been a failure to notify without a reasonable cause.  If somebody rocks up with an insurance claim one year, 11 months, three weeks and three or four days later, we are again in a situation where the person against whom claims are being made has no evidence.  Staff members might be gone.  The respondent might not even know who was working on the night in question.  This situation could last for two, three or four years.  Drawing a negative inference in cases where there is no reasonable cause is a matter for the court.  It is important that we have enough protection for claimants with a reasonable cause for not giving notification.  We are here to protect the individual who has a legitimate case for damages against his or her person.  We are all at one in wanting to protect those people.  However, we have to move to a new space.  The period of one or two months and the provision for inference is crucial to make an impact.  We could pretend to make an impact and make a provision that is not legitimate.  I am not about that and I do not believe this committee is.  If we want to make an impact, this section is crucial.</p> <p>  We are not imposing on the courts.  Yesterday, the Attorney General gave his opinion and he is comfortable with this.  I am meeting Garda Commissioner Harris on 11 December.  I continually have to say that I am not opposed to the establishment of a Garda insurance section within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  As a personal view which I aired a long time ago, very early in the job, I am opposed to the industry funding the section directly.  If the industry provides the money to the Minister and the Minister provides it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I am 100% comfortable with that.  That arrangement does the same thing.  Funding is provided to the Exchequer, which, in turn, provides the same funding.  I would look for additional funding to establish the insurance section.  That is what I would prefer.  The cost of insurance working group, which was present before I came into the job, also highlighted that.  It is the UK model.  However, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  He will speak with the Minister for Justice and Equality about the establishment of the section and how it is funded. </p></speech>

That is the critical issue, whether we are talking about company directors or bankers misbehaving or fraudulent insurance claims.  I do not understand why a structure that allows action has not been developed.  We hear all the time about cases where a person comes into a restaurant, stages an incident some time later and then makes a claim.  As the Minister of State said, nobody has much knowledge of the incident at issue.  The only way to deter that is for the fraudsters to be prosecuted, as happens with fraud in other areas of business.  I do not know if the Minister of State has addressed that.  It is a scandal.  Judges openly say it in court and claims are withdrawn.  We must bear in mind that the vast majority of people are honest, but they see fraudulent claimants being admonished by judges and then just walking away.  We do not know, but it does not appear as though everything ever happens to them.</p></speech>

We need to get this up and running as quickly as possible.  As we have talked about in reference to section 14, personal injury claims should not be delayed.  That needs to be part of the database.  Personal public liability needs to be part of it, not just motor insurance.</p> <p>  I have made one point on a number of occasions to the Minister of State's predecessor and to the line Minister.  Any instance of big private business directly or indirectly funding our police service is inappropriate.  It does not matter if it passes through the Minister's hands before it gets to the Garda.  It is not acceptable.  It would also not be acceptable if a philanthropist came to the Minister and offered to fund a section of the Garda to investigate rogue or corrupt politicians, or if a big businessman decided he wanted something investigated and passed money through the Department of Finance.  It would not be done.  We need to establish this as a matter of principle.  Everybody on this committee and in the Houses of the Oireachtas believes the Garda should have an insurance fraud squad.  Then we need to publicly resource it.  Before the Minister of State meets the Garda Commissioner, he should get a commitment from the Minister and make it clear to him that the Houses of the Oireachtas stand four-square behind him.  The Garda Commissioner is independent in how he structures the Garda.  However, it is the view of the Oireachtas and of this committee that there should be such a unit within the Garda and the necessary resources should be made available.  Whether we want to raise additional money through taxes or levies on the insurance industry should be a secondary issue.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments about his personal view on this.  From my point of view, even if funding passed through the hands of the Minister before getting to the Garda, a precedent would be created.  It is just not right.</p> <p>  I can understand how frustrating it is to see people who have had their claims dismissed as fraudulent by a judge and who have taken up court time walking away without a worry in the world  because they are not going to be prosecuted.  We need to deal with this quickly.  I ask the Minister of State to take that issue off the table and to get a commitment from his Cabinet colleagues to make the resources available.</p><p>I can only speak for my own party but the Minister of State will have its full support because this needs to be done urgently.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#A00700"><p>I am pleased to be present for this Supplementary Estimate.  I am joined by Mr. Donncha O'Sullivan, Mr. Seamus Clifford, Mr. Frank Maher and Ms Downey, who is in the building and may be joining us shortly.  I thank members of the committee for making time available for this consideration.</p> <p>  The net amount of the Supplementary Estimates is &euro;59 million for the Garda Vote, &euro;10 million for the Prisons Vote and &euro;8 million for the Department of Justice and Equality Vote.  The Courts Service Vote does not require additional Exchequer funding but requires that surplus receipts of &euro;600,000 are used to offset current expenditure requirements in a technical Supplementary Estimate.  The remaining Votes in the group for the Policing Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will remain within budget and have surrender balances of approximately &euro;2.7 million at the end of the year.</p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;59 million arises in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote this year.  This comprises a gross expenditure requirement of &euro;76.2 million, which is offset by a projected surplus in appropriations-in-aid of &euro;17.2 million giving a net additional requirement of &euro;59 million.  An additional &euro;46.4 million is being made available to meet payroll and overtime costs, including the Garda College subhead.  The additional requirement for pay and allowances is &euro;23.7 million and &euro;22.7 million relates to overtime.  I am pleased that in budget 2019, an additional &euro;72 million will be provided for Garda pay and allowances, which provides for the costs of accelerated Garda and civilian recruitment and costs associated with pay agreements.  There are additional requirements under a number of other administrative and operational subheads, including travel and subsistence, expenses associated with road traffic policing, maintenance of Garda premises, certain other station services, and clothing and operational equipment amounting to &euro;30 million after offsetting underspends in other areas.</p> <p>  The offsetting underspends arise across subheads such as superannuation due to fewer retirements than expected, at &euro;2.5 million, and compensation, at &euro;1.8 million.  There are surplus receipts of approximately &euro;17 million, mainly accounted for by pay-related pension deductions.  This is directly related to the increased expenditure on pay and overtime and the Supplementary Estimate is making these additional receipts available to offset a proportion of the overtime and payroll cost.  The Supplementary Estimate also includes the reprofiling of &euro;6.649 million in the capital building and refurbishment programme, &euro;3.581 million which it is proposed to carry forward to next year under the capital carryover provisions, and the balance of &euro;3.068 million being reallocated to ICT capital.  This is to balance a similar reallocation at the end of last year when a corresponding amount from the ICT budget was reallocated to the building programme.</p> <p>  A total capital allocation of more than &euro;92 million is being made available to the Garda Vote next year.  This will facilitate significant further investment in leading edge ICT of &euro;64.8 million, &euro;10 million for transport, and &euro;17.5 million for the capital building and refurbishment programme.  The current Supplementary Estimate process and the increased budgetary provision for the Vote in 2019 provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the financial resources to address the challenges it faces and, significantly, to support the ongoing reform programme, which will gain further momentum from the implementation of the recommendations in the report on the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The recommendations in the report are comprehensive and far-reaching and provide a blueprint for future development of the policing service in Ireland.  Specifically, on the financial front, it recommends the production of a costed policing plan presented in a multi-annual framework.  While the details have yet to be fully worked out, this has the potential to significantly change the way in which budgets and expenditure are presented in the future, including to this committee.  I look forward to the output from this process.</p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;10 million is required for the Prisons Vote.  The requirement arises across a number of subheads, including pay and additional allowances of &euro;1.997 million, travel and subsistence of &euro;548,000, staff training and recruitment of &euro;1.1 million, building and equipment, mainly maintenance costs, of &euro;2.6 million, prison and operational services at a cost of &euro;2.3 million and compensation payments of &euro;2.4 million.  There are offsetting underspends available of &euro;2.129 million, including surplus appropriations-in-aid of &euro;1.5 million, which has reduced the net funding requirement to &euro;10 million.  There have been pressures on a number of the non-pay subheads in question in recent years but it has been possible to offset some of the costs from underspends in other subheads, including payroll.  This is not possible in 2018 as there are increased payroll costs arising from a pay agreement integrating rent allowance with basic pay.  While recruitment is ongoing in the Prison Service, it is not yet at the point, coupled with retirements, that all vacancies are covered.  It is necessary to fill some of the staffing shortfall through increased additional hours payments.  A number of once-off costs arose this year in respect of training expenditure, for example, where alternative accommodation had to be used while the training college in Portlaoise was being renovated.</p><p>In addition, particularly in respect of the maintenance expenditure, the severe weather conditions earlier in the year, the collapse of the Mountjoy circular roof and certain other unplanned works gave rise to some additional expenditure.  </p><p> Turning to the justice and equality Vote, there is a requirement for an additional &euro;8 million in the current year.  This mainly arises across criminal legal aid and asylum accommodation with a combined projected overspend of just under &euro;26 million.  However, in a Vote with in excess of 60 subheads across five programmes, there are a number of underspends and overspends against budget which have contributed to reducing the additional Exchequer funding requirement to &euro;8 million.  </p><p> The budgetary arithmetic underpinning the Supplementary Estimate requirement takes account of the various under and overspends across the budget.  As outlined, the areas of overspend relate to criminal legal aid, &euro;15.7 million, and asylum accommodation, &euro;10 million.  The volume of cases arising from criminal activity before the courts is increasing and this has a proportionate increase in the criminal legal aid budget.  The upward trend in the number of legal aid certificates granted increased by 18% in 2017 and this trend is continuing in the current year.  There is also evidence that the length and complexity of cases is contributing to the increased costs.</p><p> Another demand-led area of the Vote relates to asylum accommodation.  The number in accommodation is approximately 14% higher than this time last year.  The number of persons seeking international protection has increased significantly in the past 12 months, which has a direct impact on the numbers in accommodation.  Arising from the increased demand, it has been necessary to open six new accommodation centres providing 567 new bed spaces to date this year.  This contributes to additional budgetary costs. </p><p> An additional provision of &euro;2.4 million is being provided to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  This brings the total the total allocation to &euro;6.7 million for 2018 and the budget mainly relates to the payment of awards made by the tribunal.  The areas that have reduced the additional Exchequer funding required to &euro;8 million include surplus receipts in respect of immigration registration and visa fees of about &euro;7 million, underspends on payroll across a number of subheads, including Probation Service, &euro;2.5 million; Data Protection Commissioner, &euro;2.2 million; and Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, &euro;3 million.  This is mainly due to the delays in recruitment such that a full year staffing cost is not reflected in 2018. </p><p> There is also an underspend of &euro;5 million in the capital budget for the forensic science laboratory, after proposed capital carryover to 2019, pending the issue of an updated request for tender which is now expected to issue shortly with commencement of the main construction works in 2019.  Preparatory works on the site of some &euro;2 million were carried out during 2018. </p><p> The transformation programme in my Department is well under way with the internal teams and structures in place and an external support contract to be awarded to the successful bidder shortly.  </p><p> A technical Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 is required in respect of the courts Vote.  This is mainly to offset certain administrative costs by a projected surplus of &euro;600,000 in appropriations-in-aid arising from court fees.  It is also proposed that an underspend of &euro;2.5 million in capital will be carried forward under the capital carryover provisions in 2019 and utilised for the implementation of a number of key ICT and reform projects. </p><p> In conclusion, I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee and I am happy to address any queries or questions and listen to any observations the committee might have. </p></speech>

The Minister told us last year that one of the reasons a Supplementary Estimate was needed was Garda overtime because numbers were down due to of non-recruitment and that this year things were going to be much better because of all the new recruits.  The additional requirement we are now being asked to approve in respect of overtime is half what it was last year but it is still substantial.  Does the Minister think we might get to a point next year where there will not be a Supplementary Estimate for overtime?</p> <p>  Last April, he told us that ICT was a central component of Garda modernisation and renewal.  We have been told that &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million in additional funding under the capital programme, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  The 2018 budget for ICT was &euro;40 million.  The briefing note informs us that some of the Supplementary Estimate was allocated to ICT under the heading "Admin non-pay" and underspend in the capital budget elsewhere in the Garda Vote has been relocated to ICT.  How much extra did it get and what was it spent on?</p> <p>  We know about all the problems with PULSE over the recent period.  The special rapporteur for children, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, devoted a section of the appendix in his section 12 report last he asked to be done was made available to the Garda.  Has that been done now?  Was any of the additional money reallocated to ICT spent on plugging the massive holes in PULSE, or what was it spent on?  Perhaps the Minister could take those few question first, before I move on to other sections.</p></speech>

I am keen to obviate the need for one towards year end and will work towards ensuring that these issues can be addressed during the year through the original moneys allocated.  This is an issue particularly for Garda overtime which I have discussed, at an early stage, with the new Garda Commissioner, regarding the financial position of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We agreed it is essential that value for money be achieved within the resources available and I acknowledge what the Garda Commissioner himself has said to this committee in that regard.</p> <p>  Overtime is an issue.  In 2013, provision for overtime was &euro;50 million; in 2014, it increased to &euro;56 million; in 2016, it was &euro;91 million; and it has exceeded &euro;100 million this year.  We are anxious to ensure that value for money is attained.  There is a continuing recruitment campaign, which will result in a net intake of new garda&iacute; of the order of 500 per annum, with approximately 300 retirements.  That will result in a scenario where the overtime requirement should not be as marked.  However, arrangements for Garda overtime is not an issue for which I, as Minister, have direct responsibility.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;3 million has been moved to ICT in the Supplementary Estimate.  We have &euro;60 million allocated to ICT for 2019.</p><p>That should allow for the increased investment, which will help ensure the implementation of the various projects under way.  For example, we expect a phased implementation of the mobility project, aiming to secure mobile access to Garda systems.  There is also the roll-out on a pilot basis of the investigations management system, which will standardise, digitise and further support the management of all investigations arising from a PULSE incident. </p></speech>

The Minister said he does not have any direct responsibility for overtime but he justified last year's Supplementary Estimate on the basis that it was because of overtime, because the numbers were down.  My question, which I do not believe was answered, related to whether we could be confident that next year's Estimate will not address massive amounts of money, tens of millions of euro, for overtime payments.  I posed the question in the context of this year's budget allocating an extra &euro;60 million for Garda pay but only &euro;6 million extra for Defence Forces pay.  If we have already allocated that in next year's budget, will we be given another Supplementary Estimate, again on overtime?  I do not believe that this or the issues about PULSE were answered.  Has the ICT money gone into PULSE?  I am not sure if I misheard that.  There is the question of correcting some of the issues, particularly those highlighted by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.</p></speech>

I repeat it by saying that my intention is to ensure that the Garda budget, including overtime, is sufficient for the Garda Commissioner to arrange his planning and the execution of his programme without the need for a Supplementary Estimate.  Let me stress again that the funding provided for Garda overtime next year is &euro;95 million, which is entirely consistent with the budgetary measures recently introduced by the Garda Commissioner, as he referred to specifically when he came before this committee.  While this is less than this year's total, it is, nonetheless, a very significant level of funding by international standards and by reference to recent years.</p> <p>  I can assure Deputy Clare Daly that the PULSE system is regularly updated.  It is continually enhanced with new applications to meet the operational needs.  Recent upgrades include further enhancements in integration and a new property and exhibit management system and to ensure that the new ICT strategy is executed in a way that obsolete elements of PULSE can be replaced. </p></speech>

However, I am surprised that the Minister would say that PULSE is regularly enhanced and upgraded as though this always happened.  Many of the big headline issues over problems with PULSE have been well flagged and were a consequence of PULSE not being regularly enhanced and upgraded and the need to specifically do that.  I am a little surprised by that.</p><p>On child sexual abuse and child protection, the Department's children first sectoral implementation plan this year states:</p><blockquote>Consideration is being given to a co-location model for the management of child sexual abuse cases, combining the new Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) and Tusla social workers.  Four DPSUs have been established as at February 2018 and they will be put in place in all remaining Divisions as soon as possible.</blockquote></speech>

This is an enormous problem for society.  The 2012 Garda Inspectorate report recommended the establishment of these agencies.  I note that money was reallocated from the capital budget to ICT in these Supplementary Estimates and in that context, there was an underspend of &euro;6 million in the capital building programme in particular.  I hope I can take it from that that there has not been any movement beyond consideration of the establishment of specialist co-located centres.  Will money be made available for them?  Will they be built?  Where did the underspend come from that we are allocating?  I hope that it was not at the expense of children.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, told us recently that she hoped to have the first pilot open in 2019.  That would suggest that money should already have been spent on them, so I am unsure why there has been an overspend.  Has funding been made available in 2019 for the expansion of these DPSUs to other divisions beyond the four?  Obviously the units are crucial, they were sought in Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report and by the Garda Inspectorate.  Both found a lack of specialised training and of a single point of contact for multi-agency working left huge and dangerous gaps in child protection.  This is beyond urgent.  When will more be established?  When can we expect to have these units in every division?  How much money has been given over to establish them in this year's budget?</p></speech>

Phase 1 is in respect of the Dublin metropolitan region west, Louth and Cork city.  It was the pilot to which the Deputy refers.  The assessment of that pilot is informing a further roll-out to each Garda division.  The objective is to have the service across each division by the end of next year.  There is sufficient funding allocated for that.  It is expected that by this time next year, each Garda division will have a protected services unit.</p></speech>

I have two other issues on the budget.  There is an expected underspend of &euro;4.27 million in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, subhead.  I find this worrying.  Last year we talked about an underspend in INIS and last year the Minister told us:</p><blockquote>The underspend in INIS relates to staff recruitment.  Having regard to the ongoing programme of recruitment for INIS, it is envisaged that this will correct itself and it will be rebalanced for 2018.</blockquote> <p>Sadly, given the information the Minister has provided today, it has not been rebalanced.  First, why has it not been rebalanced?  Second, we know there are enormous delays throughout the whole immigration system and people are finding it appallingly impossible to get appointments, Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, cards, visas and so on.  What is the position in terms of getting staff to plug the gaps?  Why is this still an issue one year on, when the Minister told us last year it was going to be sorted out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#D01400"><p>I acknowledge there were staffing challenges.  Staffing numbers will increase considerably when the processing of intra-EU flights begins, which is expected towards the end of next year.  In respect of the savings, &euro;3 million of this will be realised from the INIS pay budget and that is as a result of what was a slower than anticipated filling of improved vacancies.  Half of this saving relates to the Irish passenger information unit, which has been established and currently processes extra-EU flights.  We require primary legislation before the intra-EU flights can be included but staff numbers will increase considerably when that processing begins.  Again, I would expect that before the end of next year, albeit towards the end of next year</p> <p>  Efforts are being made to increase staffing levels throughout this year.  That has a particular focus of targeting additional resources at areas where there is a backlog, including in the International Protection Office.  I acknowledge we have an increase in staff of the order of 156 this year, although this has been partially offset by the departure of almost 100, or 98, to be precise.  That is as a result of increased mobility across the Civil Service and across the economy more generally, given that increased mobility is becoming more of a feature.  However, every effort is being made to recruit appropriate numbers of staff and, as I said, we have 156 this year.  In addition to savings on the pay side, a saving of in excess of &euro;1 million will be realised from the non-pay budget.</p> <p>  I am very conscious of what Deputy Clare Daly has said about the perception of inordinate delays.  We are keen to ensure the system operates in an effective manner but also in an efficient manner.</p></speech>

The Minister said it is as a result of increased mobility and that recruitment is a problem across the Department, across the service and across the economy.  That is not the full picture.  It is a specific and acute problem in this area, as has been highlighted in successive budgets.  The Minister told us last year that recruitment would sort this out and that is kind of his answer again this time. The problem is that, while we wait another year, there are families and individuals who are going through an incredibly tortuous immigration system.  In some cases, families are looking to join family members or visit friends, and all of that good stuff that is a very serious consideration for people in our society.  I do not think this is being addressed.  There needs to be a specific analysis of why we have had such a problem with recruitment in this particular area.  It is a particular problem and if we do not address it, the problems will continue.  I will flag it for now but I seriously hope we are not back at this next year.  In some instances, we are talking about very vulnerable people in our society.</p> <p>  With regard to prisons, funding for 2018 included provision for the financing of a step-down facility for women.  I have a problem with this in some ways in that it is a little paternalistic.  It is a practice that has been moved away from in other jurisdictions, although I fully accept it is better than incarceration.  The step-down facility has not been opened.  Has the money been spent?  What is the status of the project?  Has the Department gone back to the drawing board and looked at alternatives?  What is the story?</p></speech>

This year we have seen year-on-year growth of the order of 10% and I would expect that will continue in respect of both visas and registrations.  As well as the staffing challenge and the ongoing recruitment, I expect improvements in the throughput of cases, with ICT investment of the order of &euro;1.5 million.  I expect that will deal with some of Deputy Clare Daly's concerns but, again, as the Deputy has flagged this as something she will monitor closely next year, I assure her that so will I.  It is an issue on which I would be very keen to see a greater level of engagement.  I will be happy to keep the committee informed.</p> <p>  On the matter of the prisons Vote in respect of the step-down facility, matters are being advanced.  I do not have a date upon which the facility is expected to be completed but I know work is in the course of being carried out and that it is a very important component of our prisons programme.  I would be happy to give a timeframe for completion of that facility.  Some work has already been undertaken.</p></speech>

There was a surplus of &euro;1.8 million with regard to Garda compensation.  I come from County Louth where in recent years two garda&iacute; were murdered.  Day in, day out in the Border area a Garda leaving his or her home is not always guaranteed to come home.  Are many claims outstanding?  In recent months, I have been speaking to garda&iacute; who have made claims, but there seems to be no movement.  All of a sudden there is a surplus of &euro;1.8 million.  How much money was spent in 2018?  In the area I am from there is fuel laundering and smuggling, and almost every week a Garda car is rammed.  I am sure there are a lot of compensation claims, particularly from the Border areas.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly touched on the next issue I will raise.  A total of &euro;92 million has been allocated for capital expenditure next year.  Does the &euro;92 million include the surplus of &euro;3.5 million being carried over?  A total of &euro;3 million is being reallocated from capital expenditure to ICT.  I have mentioned a few times at committee meetings the conditions of some of the Garda stations in my area.  They do not have the facilities to deal with people, in particular to be able to see to people given the violence of recent years.  That &euro;3 million would go a long way to alleviate this problem.  I am sure the Minister is aware of incidences where people have come to Garda stations after being battered.  Why allocate &euro;3 million to ICT and not keep it where the money should be spent?</p> <p>  I am delighted to see Templemore has reopened.  Its closure was a major mistake.  There is nothing as good as seeing garda&iacute; patrolling and walking the beat.  It is great to have a Garda presence in an area.  The Minister said money has been spent on the accommodation used in the training college.  How many recruits does the Minister hope will come out of Templemore in 2018 and 2019?  A few million euro are left over because, although the Minister said he expected more garda&iacute; to retire in 2018, they do not seem to be retiring.  They seem to be staying on the job.</p></speech>

It is not an issue that is unique to Border areas.  It is an issue that is of concern not only to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but to everybody involved in the criminal justice system throughout the country.  A sum of &euro;15 million is available for the settlement of such claims.  I acknowledge there is something of a delay but one must factor into this the need for the ongoing exchange of documentation and up-to-date medical reports.  While there are many cases in the system, a considerable number of them are not ripe for settlement because there are outstanding issues.  In many cases, outstanding medical treatment is a feature that forms part and parcel of medical reports that must be furnished to ensure a timely settlement of the claim.  I am satisfied that the sum of &euro;15 million expected expenditure means the absence of funds is not an issue in facilitating settlement.  We hope that as many cases as possible will proceed to settlement having regard to the issues involved.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's question on Garda recruitment, I was very pleased in the recent budget to receive an appropriate level of funding to facilitate entry into the Garda College at Templemore of 800 recruits for next year.  As I said earlier, with a retirement complement in the order of 300, this will result in a net intake of new garda&iacute; of approximately 500.  They will be posted throughout the country in accordance with the priorities of the Garda Commissioner and his team.</p></speech>

Why is &euro;3 million being allocated to ICT rather than updating some of the Garda stations that badly need it?  As I keep telling the Minister, most Garda stations in the country are not capable of dealing with violence, especially violence against women.  I have mentioned a number of times to the Minister that we have problems.  I am not just picking Dundalk but there have been a few incidents there in recent years.  The Minister came to Dundalk to look at the Garda station there.  It is not fit for purpose because so much is crammed in there at present.</p> <p>  I also asked the Minister how many recruits will come out from Templemore in 2018.  It is fantastic that 800 will come out in 2019.  The Minister stated he expects 300 garda&iacute; to retire.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#E00400"><p>The &euro;92 million is in addition to the sum already mentioned.  It is not included.  With regard to the intake to Templemore, I repeat that next year it is anticipated there will be 800 recruits.  I look forward to attending Templemore tomorrow for the last of this year's four graduation ceremonies that will see by the end of the year a further 800 recruits for 2018.  There will be 800 for 2019.  Allowing for retirements in the order of 300, we have a net intake of approximately 500.</p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;3 million, I would have preferred to spend it on building but it was contingent on projects being advanced by the Office of Public Works.  Diverting this money to IT gives more scope for the building budget next year.  It will see a release of funds.  It is important that we continue to advance the ICT programme in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am pleased, in the context of the budget, to see a facility to allow increased scope for spending on ICT on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na next year.  This was an issue that was the subject matter of the address to the committee by the Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>

I also asked how much was paid out in 2018 and the Minister replied that &euro;15 million was available and &euro;1.8 million was surplus.  I presume &euro;13 million was paid out in compensation in 2018.  Many garda&iacute; in my area have contacted me with regard to their claims, some of which go back three, four or five years.  I cannot believe information is awaited from doctors.  Any Tom, Dick or Harry would find the information a lot quicker than in three or four years.  These people leave their homes in the morning.  I speak to the wives of garda&iacute;.  Two garda&iacute; were murdered in recent years and families are very concerned.  If a Garda is injured in the line of duty, he or she should be looked after.  It is not acceptable that some of these claims could go back five, six, seven or eight years.  Are many claims outstanding?  How much money has been paid in 2018 so far?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#F00100"><p>I do not have the precise number of claims but it is significant.  It is important that the profile of these claims is factored in.  Many of them are not ready for settlement, and those that are ready are in the course of being settled.  This year we have had an expenditure of almost &euro;15 million.  I will try to get the Deputy a breakdown of the profile of claims.  Many of the outstanding claims of some years standing mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick relate to cases that are not ready for settlement because of ongoing negotiations and the exchange of paperwork between the claimants and the State.  However, every effort is being made to ensure that the cases ready for settlement can form a basis for settlement.  As I said, a sum of &euro;15 million has been expended this year.</p></speech>

On the issue of training, Deputy Clare Daly raised training in respect of child protection.  Another issue that was raised during the year was the ability of garda&iacute; to give chase.  I do not believe the Department ever provided figures on how many garda&iacute; were qualified up to CBD, competency based driving, level 2, although I might be mistaken.  My recollection is that the information available was the Garda Representative Association's, GRA's, view that less than half of front-line garda&iacute; had that qualification.  Is additional money being provided for training in that area for the coming year?</p> <p>  Second, money is allocated for new technologies next year.  I presume, and hope, some of that is related to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland's recommendations.  Is the proposal for body cameras to be included in that or will that be advanced in 2019?</p> <p>  Third, there are substantial waiting times for civil legal aid and it is difficult to get that aid.  There is a marginal improvement on 2017 in that regard but can the Minister outline what he intends to do to address that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#F00300"><p>In respect of driver training, garda&iacute; undertake a wide variety of roles involving different skills sets and driving is one that has been the subject of commentary.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not required to have advanced driving skills but I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have introduced a five-level suite of CBD courses with each level specifically catering for a required knowledge-based skills set.  It involves a three-week course.  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner - and I believe this issue was mentioned in the course of his recent engagement with the committee - that 6,000 members are qualified to drive using blue lights and sirens having completed the standard driving course CBD level 2.  There are varying degrees of skills and the Garda authorities are anxious to ensure there is a greater level of the optional course available.  This is important in the context of the increased resourcing for the Garda fleet and the fact that over the current six-year period, a sum of &euro;46 million has been available for investment in that fleet.  If we are ensuring the Garda has a modern, up-to-date fleet of vehicles it is important that there would be appropriate driving skills.  The CBD courses at level 2 and higher are available and over the course of next year, there will be a greater level of concentration on this, with further development of this important skills training.</p> <p>  On the body cameras, I am keen that the Garda would adopt this new and advanced technology.  I have discussed the matter with the Garda Commissioner, and the issue was mentioned specifically in recent Garda reports.  I cannot say for certain if the Garda Commissioner's budget for next year will allow for the roll-out of body cameras.  I expect that over the next few years it will form the basis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's plans but I cannot say that it will commence next year.</p> <p>  As regards civil legal aid, significant additional funding has been available to the Legal Aid Board in recent years and the total budget for next year will be in excess of &euro;40 million.  I acknowledge that there is an issue with waiting lists in some parts of the country and I accept what the Deputy said about improvements in some areas.  This is closely monitored.  Having regard to the fact that it is a demand-led scheme, every effort will be made to ensure that not only do we get value for money but also that waiting lists can be kept to a minimum.  The more than &euro;40 million for next year is a sizeable figure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#F00400"><p>I will ask my remaining questions together.  The first relates to an issue that arose on Question Time earlier.  A number of additional direct provision centres have been opened recently but it is difficult for people to travel from sites such as Moville, Kenmare and Lisdoonvarna to Dublin and back within a day.  Will the Minister elaborate on plans to relocate some of the facilities in Dublin to the centres?  In addition, are there plans to provide direct transport to services that cannot be moved such as an appeals tribunal hearing in Dublin, and will the Minister provide details on that?</p> <p>  Second, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland anticipates substantial time commitments for the Garda being transferred to other bodies, for example, the Courts Service in the case of the transportation of prisoners to court, as well as a number of other obligations.  Clearly that will create savings in time and money for the Garda but does this budget foresee any additional burdens on the Prison Service and the Courts Service arising from these organisations taking on responsibilities that were previously those of the Garda?</p> <p>  Third, a point that has been raised on a number of occasions by the National Women's Council of Ireland is the lack of contact centres for supervised access for family visitation and so forth.  Currently, there is funding from Tusla where there is a child protection issue, but where there is no such issue, there is no stream of funding or pilot scheme.</p><p>Some facilities and family resource centres have even done this off their own bat, but it means that where there is no child protection issue, it is very difficult for a judge in a family court to refer for supervised access in a contact centre of that kind.  It is different where there is a child protection issue involved.  Tusla would fund that.  Where there is not an issue, the option does not exist in practice unless they can finance it themselves, and these things are not cheap.  This is something that would be in the interests of the proper functioning of the family courts, in the interests of the family courts, and in the interests of these families.  Does the Department intend to do something to further that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#G00200"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to the distance of the direct provision centres from the capital city, and having regard to the fact that from time to time business should be transacted in a way that is sensitive to the needs of the persons, I am sympathetic to the point that the Deputy has made.  It is an issue that has been taken up by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  I would certainly like to see a greater level of flexibility and I would like to see a greater level of interaction on the part of officials on site.  I believe that we will be in a position to explore alternatives and opportunities on that matter.</p> <p>  With regard to the family law court funding and the relationship with the family resource centres, it is not something that would come under the Department of Justice and Equality.  Primarily it would come under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p></speech>

The Minister could put it onto the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but they are putting it back on the Minister's Department and they reckon that where there is a child protection issue, it is a matter for Tusla.  I do not mind particularly who it comes under as long as it is funded.  As far as the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is concerned, if there is no child protection issue involved, it is a matter for the Courts Service and therefore the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I will ask the question again.  The reference to family resource centres is because in some instances they have provided this service off their own bat.  Contact centres exist primarily for facilitating Tusla referred supervised access visits.  In any instances where there is a desire for a judge in a family court to direct for supervised access in circumstances other than where there is a child protection matter, Tusla is unwilling to fund it and Tusla believes it is a matter for the Courts Service if there is no child protection issue involved.  It is a decision of the court but the facilities and the funding do not exist to satisfy that direction.  I am very relaxed about who funds this but it is important.  They believe it is the Courts Service which funds it and maybe it is a matter for Tusla.  The discussion needs to be had between the two agencies.</p></speech>

It is an area where savings can be made, especially in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am anxious to ensure that if this imposes further spending obligations on the Prison Service, for example, then of course the funding could be met.  There is a legislative requirement too insofar as the criminal procedure Bill will allow for greater use of technology and video evidence, which would obviate the need for so many escorts.  Considerable savings in the overall budget can be made in this area.  I would be very happy to ensure that efficiencies can be forthcoming in a way that was not apparent in the past.  It would also free up garda&iacute; to engage in what might be regarded as more front-line duties.</p></speech>

The number in accommodation currently is 14% higher than at the end of 2017.  The Minister has also said increased costs arising from improvements in facilities generally, including implementation of the recommendations made in the McMahon report, have led to increased budgetary pressures.  Only recently, a worker in the centre in Ballaghaderreen contacted me and said the place was hell on earth.  Of late Deputy Clare Daly and I have been working with a number of refugees in direct provision centres.  From what we are being told, they seem to be soul-destroying places in which to live.  The Minister says improvements are being made.  Am I right in thinking most of the facilities are still being run by the private sector?  Who is making the improvements and how are they being managed?  Are private sector enterprises organising the improvements or does the State have a hand in making them?  Does it have any say in what is going on and what actually is being improved?  The Minister says the figures are going up, but what is being done to have fewer people in direct provision centres?  We know that there is a housing crisis, but we have had it for a long time.  Has any effort been made on the part of the State to actually build something proper for the people concerned or are we going to leave them and watch their numbers increase?</p></speech>

Of course, I have to say being in a direct provision centre is not compulsory.  Nobody is forced to stay in one.</p></speech>

I am really keen to ensure, as is the Government, that we will comply with our national and international obligations, but it is a challenge because the numbers are increasing.  There are in the order of 60 new entrants into the system every week.  I am very keen to ensure the State will provide the essential necessities of board and lodgings and shelter.  In that regard, I acknowledge the need for improvements and can safely say there have been improvements in recent times.  I acknowledge the contributions of people such as Mr. Justice McMahon who I met last week.  His independent report contained over 150 recommendations, many of which have been implemented.  Some have been partially implemented but are in the course of being implemented fully.  I want to continue to try to ensure applicants will have their needs met.  I acknowledge the improvements that have taken place during the course of the year, for example, providing for the right to work in certain circumstances and access to the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  </p> <p>  I do not want to underestimate the extent of the challenge.  I do not have a huge suite of alternatives in providing housing or more orthodox accommodation, if that is what the Deputy wishes to advert to.  I have an issue as far as accommodation provision is concerned.  The Reception and Integration Agency will shortly advertise again for appropriate accommodation which will be required to be of a certain standard.  There are in excess of 600 people in direct provision accommodation who have granted permission to remain in the State and who, in the normal course of events, might think of leaving it but who are are choosing not to do so.  Again, that represents an added challenge to the system.</p></speech>

That is because they have nowhere else to go.  The alternative is to live on the street, which is not very attractive.  Is there anyone monitoring conditions in the centres?  I know that it costs money to maintain them, but a lot of money is being handed to the private sector to run them.  By all accounts, from what we are being told, they are hovels.  Does the State actually monitor conditions in the accommodation the private entities are providing?</p> <p>  The Minister has made the point that we have international obligations to maintain.  Obviously, there are people coming into the country who are moving into direct provision centres.  The numbers are going up because so few are coming out of the centres.  The Minister can say they are choosing not to do so, but he cannot walk away from the fact that the Government has failed to deal with the housing crisis.  That is why 600 people who are free to walk out have nowhere else to go, apart from the street.  I think we all agree that direct provision centres leave a lot to be desired, but it also leaves a lot to be desired that the Government has done bugger all about actually trying to improve things or change the procedures through which the people concerned have to go.  Is there any forward thinking or plan to do things a little differently?</p></speech>

He used the word "hovel" in describing conditions in of some of the centres.  While I readily admit that the model of direct provision is not ideal, I do not have an immediate suite of alternatives.  What I can say is that there are minimum standards in the provision of accommodation and facilities in reception centres for applicants.  They most certainly cover the provision of education services nearby, healthcare services and labour market access, among other issues.  I acknowledge the independence of Mr. Justice McMahon in the work and duties he is undertaking.  Strenuous efforts are being made by those involved to fully comply with his recommendations.  It is an ongoing process.  It is expected that further expressions of interest in providing places will be sought between now and the end of the year.  Every effort is being made to ensure conditions meet our standards.  I very much regret the language used not only at this committee but also outside in which the most unfair analogies have been deployed.</p></speech>

The Minister indicated in his opening statement that because of increased demand, it has been necessary to open six new accommodation centres, providing 567 new bed spaces to date in 2018.  Will he identify the locations of the six new accommodation centres?  Is it the case that, for whatever reason, some subcontracting arrangement has been made in the securing of hotel accommodation across a number of hotel facilities that are not accommodation centres?  A significant number of asylum seekers are being accommodated in a range of hotels in different locations across the country but there has been no consultation with the host communities and very questionable consideration as to the suitability of the locations with respect to the needs and expectations of the asylum seekers.</p><p>The daily needs, hopes and expectations of asylum seekers for the future need to be properly evaluated but they do not appear to have been seriously considered according to some of the instances that have been flagged to me.  Can the Minister comment on that?  If six new accommodation centres have been designated, providing 567 new bed spaces to date this year, how many others are accommodated in non-accommodation centre facilities such as working hotels that may not have a 100% take-up of their capacity, which have been secured through a subcontracting arrangement?  I am anxious to know the full facts for same.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#K00200"><p>I reiterate that there is a challenge in respect of numbers on the basis that the total expected number for the end of the year will be approximately 3,500.  That presents us with a challenge.  As a result of the ongoing demand increase, six new accommodation centres opened this year providing 567 spaces.  Centres were opened in Lisdoonvarna, County Clare; County Westmeath; Monasterevin, County Kildare; Abbeyleix, County Laois, Mallow, County Cork; and Kenmare, County Kerry.  New centres are being planned to open in Moville, Donegal, and Wicklow.</p> <p>  The hotels to which the Chairman referred, other than the ones mentioned, to my knowledge would involve a form of temporary and emergency accommodation.  I do not have any knowledge of the subcontracting arrangement to which he referred.  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, has published calls for expressions of interest a number of times this year, having regard to the increased demands.  The response to such expressions involve a visit from members of the agency, and an assessment of all of the offers, the standards of accommodation and the ability to provide the type of services that are important in the areas of education, health and sports and recreation.  This is the manner of the challenge.  Having regard to the increase in numbers, I expect that there will be a further round of expressions of interest shortly.  There are minimum standards and they raise an element of local consultation, often with local public representatives.  Every effort is made to ensure comforts and basic requirements of those seeking international protection are fully met.  However, entry into the direct provision system, while not ideal in many circumstances, is not compulsory.</p></speech>

We could all agree that there is some toleration for short-stay needs but it is completely and wholly inappropriate for long stays.  I ask that, on behalf of the committee, that the Minister explores the issue that I have indicated.  The issue was brought to my attention and I have only recently received a response from him a to parliamentary question regarding one such instance.  The reply does not go beyond a limited provision of the information that I have sought.  I ask that the Minister checks because the reference to subcontracting suggests that the situation is getting worse rather than better.  The option is open to people who have no specific involvement and responsibilities to block-book rooms in hotels over specific periods.  Then we find that perhaps RIA is doing business with them but the point of contact is with these individuals.  I notice that all sorts of heads have nodded as I look from my left to right and right to left.  If it is not RIA, then the Minister can refer to his reply to my parliamentary question that he furnished only this week, or perhaps at the end of last week, check the details of that specific case and revert to me and advise on how that option is functioning when between 70 and 80 people are in a rural hotel with next to no facilities and no access to public transport.  That does not tick the box in terms of serious consideration of what those unfortunate people require.</p></speech>

If the Minister refers to my parliamentary question, he already has the information.  I ask him to relook at the reply and properly inform himself because I do not doubt that, he is not aware of what may be the methodology employed in this instance, but I want him to know and to be across it.  I would appreciate if he would reply to us because, bad and all as the situation has been throughout all of the years of direct provision, this has entered a whole new area, which only suggests a significant deterioration in standards.</p></speech>

The Minister listed six new places and one is in Monasterevin.  The facility in Monasterevin has existed for years.  Is there a new facility in Monasterevin?  Why did he mention Monasterevin?  The facility in Monasterevin has existed for a long period.  If it is the same facility, then it is not one of the six new centres.  If it is a new centre, that is grand.  The Minister's answers are unhelpful and lead to more questions.  I ask him to deal with my query because the facility in Monasterevin has existed for a long time.</p></speech>

I mentioned three centres that are in the course of preparation, with a view towards opening.  I have said that, furthermore, it is likely that there will be expressions of interest sought in respect of more new centres.</p> <p>  I am keen to ensure applications for international protection are dealt with in a more timely, effective and efficient way.  We reformed the system in 2015.  I acknowledge the fact that everybody seeking international protection has basic entitlements to legal advice and legal representation.  Oftentimes that legal representation entitles people to seek a number of avenues towards redress.  I refer, in particular, to the number of cases currently under judicial review.  I am keen to ensure that the delay in having these judicial reviews heard is minimised.  I am actively examining this with a view to ensuring that everybody who has a case before the courts, or has an application for consideration, can have that application dealt with in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

I was struck by the level of support by Deputies on Second Stage.  The Bill is a vital enhancement to current legislation.  It is important that the sentencing provisions for sexual offences be appropriate to the offence in question.  The Bill is of particular interest to me as I initially introduced a related Private Member&rsquo;s Bill setting out a presumptive minimum sentence for repeat sex offenders.  The Government agreed to take that proposal forward when I became Minister of State.  The Government is not proposing any amendments to the Bill.  I am interested to hear the views of Deputies on the proposals set out in the Bill.  I appreciate the support of Deputies, colleagues and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  I am happy to work with Deputies to address any concerns on the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 1 sought to insert new sections in the Bill to amend the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 in regard to the permissibility in court proceedings of adducing evidence or asking questions in cross-examination relating to the clothing worn by an alleged victim of rape or sexual assault.  It proposed that where an application had been made in advance on behalf of the accused to allow such questions to be asked or evidence adduced, the judge may permit that only where he or she was satisfied that it would be unfair to the accused to refuse.  It also proposed that the victim be entitled to be heard on the application and be legally represented during the hearing thereof.  The amendment was tabled in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  Although it bears my signature, I have been advised that the amendment cannot be allowed because it is not relevant to the provisions of the Bill as read a Second Time and must, therefore, be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 154(1).  I am not in a position to open the amendment to debate but I will allow Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to address it because he may be able to explore the possibility of revisiting it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Elements of it could be improved, but it deals with a matter which is the subject of significant public debate.  I will be seeking to re-enter it or a variation thereon on Report Stage.  I will appeal the mystifying decision to rule it out of order to the Ceann Comhairle.  The Bill addresses two discrete areas of criminal law sexual offences policy.  Under the reasoning employed to rule my amendment out of order, if the Bill only contained provisions on presumptive minimum sentencing and I presented an amendment in the form of the section of the Bill dealing with incest, that amendment would be ruled out of order.  The third Act set out in section 5 of the Bill is the same Act that amendment No. 1, dealing with the treatment of evidence in prosecutions for such offences, proposed to amend.</p><p>Sometimes entirely unrelated amendments are inserted but this is quite closely related to the debate.</p></speech>

It is valid that he would seek the ban but I will not invite the Minister of State to respond to this.  I am just being fair to the Deputy because he put the work in and expected he would have the chance to address it.  I call Deputy Clare Daly to make the last comment, though I am not opening a debate on the matter.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that we are finding this out now.  My office had prepared much work to deal with and try to address his amendment.  I am mindful that last June the Minister said there would be a review of how rape cases were conducted in Ireland.  He gave us a commitment that there would be a package of proposals by the summer but it is November and we have nothing.  The Deputy's initiative, therefore, is important and I do not think the amendment is out of order.  He should write to the Ceann Comhairle because it is regrettable that we are finding out only now, given that our offices have done much work to prepare to deal with it.</p></speech>

Nobody can be under any doubt but that we have a massive problem in how our criminal justice system deals with sexual crime.  One need not be a genius to work that out, from the inconsistent sentencing and the traumatising of victims by putting them on trial to the pathetically low conviction rates, the broader cultural problems and so on.  We should take as a given that it is an appalling situation.</p><p>The prevention of sexual offences, at the least, is not as simple as long prison sentences.  It is far too complicated to be handled by what is deemed to be the bluntest instrument in the criminal justice arsenal, namely, mandatory or presumptive minimum sentences, to which I have a strong opposition based on evidence and on information that tells us as a society that they do not work and that while they might make a nice media headline to make it look like we are doing something to deal with these issues, none of the evidence supports that view.  </p><p>It was interesting that in our deliberations on child sex offenders and putting the sex offender risk assessment and management initiative on a statutory basis yesterday, we as a committee dealt with those issues sensitively in terms of our key goal and what it should be, which is protecting the public.  These matters can whip up a significant emotional response to sexual predators but, in fact, how society is to be protected is more complicated.  Sure enough, the headline on the front page of today's edition of the<i>Irish Daily Mail</i>is, &quot;Should parents be told where predators live?&quot;,  Although the article was not as bad, that was a frenzied headline.  It is about whipping up and inciting emotional responses and so on, and this measure is in the same vein.  It is an emotional response to a problem that will not address the problem that it seeks to identify and it uses an instrument that will be problematic.</p><p>I made some points on Second Stage that I will repeat.  In general, years of evidence show us that presumptive or mandatory minimum sentences for any crime are not an effective deterrent.  This is reflected in the fact that the Law Reform Commission report of 2013 on mandatory sentencing and the 2014 strategic review of penal policy made clear recommendations that no new presumptive sentencing schemes should be introduced.  Why do we commission these reports if we ignore what they say?  The strategic review of penal policy, in particular, was a cross-agency report which included victims' representative groups alongside agencies tasked with crime prevention, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and so on.  While deterrents might be an appealing concept in theory, which sounds good as a headline for the tabloid press, the empirical evidence to support the theory is not there.  In fact, there is evidence that sanctions in general provide some deterrent, but there is none to suggest that the more severe the penalty, the greater the deterrent than a less severe one.  That is a fact.  We are having a feel-good session to vent the legitimate horror of the public to these appalling crimes and to give the appearance that something is being done, but it will not do anything.  </p><p>We must bear in mind the issues with the Judicial Council Bill.  The Judiciary has cried out for years for sentencing guidelines but it is entirely wrong-headed to introduce mandatory minimums <i>ad hoc</i>in advance of that.  Sinn F&eacute;in did a deal with the Government over the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, and those sentencing guidelines will be given, but why are we doing this in advance of that?  Judicial guidelines are a different matter as they are carefully considered, data based and evidence driven.  They are far more effective and a useful tool for the Judiciary to decide appropriate sentencing.  There is a problem with judicial sentencing but it is addressed by the guidelines, not by a blunt instrument like this.  The problem with the Bill, in common with other presumptive minimum sentence legislation, is that it allows for judicial discretion in the handing-down of a sentence.  If the court is satisfied that it would be disproportionate to impose one of the minimum sentences laid out in the Bill, the court may deviate from it, but that begs the question as to what is the point of having the Bill at all, given that the judge may ignore it if he or she sees fit.  Why do we not allow the judge who is in possession of all the facts of the case make his or her decision on what sentence is appropriate, as is done now?  What is the point of this window dressing?  </p><p>Furthermore, the evidence tells us the judges will ignore this legislation because they ignored the last one.  The Criminal Justice Act 1999 introduced a ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for possession of drugs valued over &euro;13,000 but over the years, convictions under the mandatory minimum legislation attracted a ten-year sentence in less than 4% of all cases.  As Mr. Tom O'Malley said about minimum sentencing for drugs offences, &quot;One suspects ... that [this section] seldom impinges on day-to-day practice, save to the extent that courts will have regard to relevant previous convictions as a matter of course.&quot;</p><p>From my experience in respect of the Coroners (Amendment) Bill, I know what a torturous process it is to get the Department of Justice and Equality to deal with legislation.  The Judicial Council Bill, which is necessary and which might address some of the matters this Bill attempts to highlight, has been 20 years in the making and has been languishing in the Seanad since last November.  Prioritising this Bill, however, which will not have any effect on repeat offenders, deter anyone or have any effect on the actual sentences handed down for repeat sexual crime, is taking time away from Bills like the Judicial Council Bill that would make a difference.  It is terrible.</p><p>It is interesting that on Second Stage while talking about on repeat sex offenders the Minister did not once say the Bill would make them less likely to reoffend or that it would be a deterrent.  Rather, he stated:</p><blockquote>By putting these provisions in place the Government is recognising the impact of sexual offences, both on individual victims and on society as a whole.  It is ensuring that appropriate measures are available to the Judiciary at sentencing in order to ensure that these crimes can be dealt with both appropriately and effectively.</blockquote><p>With respect, members of the Judiciary already have measures available to them at sentencing to ensure the crimes are dealt with.  The Bill will not change that or give the Judiciary any new powers.  It will have exactly the same powers after this Bill is passed as it has now.  The civil servants clearly know this.  I do not get it.</p><p> These sections do not make sense.  The provisions are arbitrary, which is unbelievable.  They provide that if someone commits a sexual offence that carries a sentence of five years and then goes on to commit another sexual offence within ten years of conviction, a presumptive minimum sentence applies.  What if an offender rapes somebody ten years and five days after the first offence?  If all we are doing in this legislation is sending a signal, as the Minister of State said, what kind of signal does it send to a victim when we treat the violent assault she experienced less seriously than we would have treated it if it had happened ten days previously?  That is the import of this legislation.  What if we were talking about a child victim of sexual abuse whose abuser was convicted of abuse of another child 12 years previously?  According to the bizarre logic of this Bill, the abuse suffered by the current victim would be less serious than it would have been if the abuser had committed it when the victim was two years younger because in such circumstances, the abuse would have fallen within the scope of this Bill.  That is the reason we have judicial discretion and the reason it is preferred in these matters to the blunt instrument of legislation and the kind of arbitrary cut-off point we have here, which has no logic to it whatever.  It is crazy.</p><p> What message are we sending?  Let us be generous and imagine that the Bill is seeking to right the wrongs of the past when we saw shocking sentences handed down for the worst crimes.  I believe that is the motivation of the Minister in this scenario and that it is the effect of terrible wrongs done in the past when terrible sentences were handed down for very serious crimes.  However, in constructing a Bill which provides that the suspended proportions of the sentence are not counted in calculating the minimum for the second offence, the Minister is not fixing that problem either.  The message in this Bill to those who got away with a suspended or partly suspended sentence for a first offence because of what the Minister of State correctly described as the deep-seated problems in our judicial system in dealing with sexual crimes is that they will have the slate wiped clean.  Nothing is changing in that regard.  Thankfully, judicial discretion will still apply and the hope would be that a judge will bear this in mind when an offender who has committed an offence previously and got away with it lightly comes before the court.  The point is that this Bill will not fix that as it excludes such offenders from its provisions.  </p><p> We have to move away from a model of criminal justice legislation that is knee-jerk and emotional to one that is evidence led.  That is what we tried to do yesterday at the committee and we saw how the media misrepresented it to get a headline.  We all know that sex sells papers.  A system that hoovers up people and spits them out again and does not deal with the greater societal problems is not doing anybody a favour.  It is not doing society or the victims a favour and I believe it sends out a bad signal.  The signal I want to send out is that this legislation will not work, will not help, is not based on evidence and is a knee-jerk reaction, which is what we have to move away from.  That might be a difficult comment to make, and all the political parties may disagree with that, but it is right.</p><p> We are talking about caring for victims of sexual crime.  It was only recently that a second sexual abuse and violence, SAVI, report was sanctioned.  We have a huge problem with sexual violence in our society but the Government reduced the funding for the Rape Crisis Network by half.</p><p> The final point I will make is critical.  It was also made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, in response to the Private Members' Bill that gave rise to this legislation.  The IPRT stated that "mandatory sentencing regimes are proven to be ineffective in reducing crime, are extremely costly to the Exchequer, and divert resources and attention away from where they are most needed."  It also set out a number of tangible measures that could make a difference in respect of dealing with sexual violence in our society.  These were the restoration of funding to victim support services; investment in child protection services; investment in crime prevention, detection and prosecution; investment in prison treatment services and regimes; and well-resourced post-release supervision and monitoring in the community.  The Bill, which I am sure was well motivated, will not achieve anything and it would be wrong to put it on the Statute Book.</p></speech>

We heard yesterday that recidivism in this area was much lower than we had thought.  In 2013, the Irish Prison Service conducted a study on re-offending which found that the offence groups with the lowest rates of re-offending were homicide, at 26.2%, followed by sexual offences, at 28.2%.  While it is obvious that the rate of re-offending would be low in cases of homicide, the re-offending rate for a sexual offender is also low compared with a crime like burglary where the re-offending rate stands at 79.5%.  We are concerned that this legislation is based more on anecdotal evidence than empirical evidence.  It is more likely fuelled by a crime reporting element in the media who whip up a frenzy at every chance they get.  We do not often make positive statements about the media but I want to read a short quote from an article written by Michael Clifford this week.  He stated:</p><blockquote>... policy is supposed to be made on the basis of research and evidence which points towards a better way of doing things.  Among many politicians - and many elements of the media - research in this area is to be avoided in case it unearths inconvenient truths.</blockquote> <p>He was referring to this very subject.</p><p>I have asked some members of the legal profession what they think of mandatory sentencing and there is not much goodwill towards it.  When it was introduced about 20 years ago it was a knee-jerk reaction to a drug problem that was not resolved by this approach.  Instead, it helped to fill up the prisons and drive up the cost to the State of looking after people who had been carrying drugs of one form or another.  The Law Reform Commission has done some serious research on that issue and I want to highlight a couple of points it made in its report.  It noted the need to ensure that the provisions achieved their stated objectives and facilitated a reduction in crime.  They did not do so, however.  The report also stated that many of those coming before the courts were low-level drug users rather than high-level drug barons and that we end up throwing the foot soldiers in jail, rather than addressing the real problem.  It pointed out that the aims of deterrence, punishment and rehabilitation are not being met by this approach and that the principles of consistency and proportionality are being ignored by mandatory sentencing.</p><p>So-called experts or people who do research, and Mick Clifford touched on this in his article this week, are sometimes frowned upon but we ignore them at our peril.  Anyone who tuned in to yesterday's committee proceedings would have been incredibly impressed by the lady from Limerick University who has done a good deal of research in this area.</p><p>I certainly do not agree with the notion that we should ignore these people.</p></speech>

The sections set out presumptive minimum sentences for repeat sex offenders and form the key provision of this Bill, as provided for by the House on Second Stage.  In opposing these sections the Deputies are essentially opposed to the core principle of the Bill.  These provisions will apply only in very limited circumstances where serial offences have been committed.  If an offender has been convicted of serial sex offences and received a sentence of at least five years and goes on to commit another within a further ten years, the presumptive minimum sentence will apply.  Many sex offenders manage their own release from prison through the Probation Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and do not go on to commit further crime.  However, some do offend again and by putting in place these provisions, the Government recognises the impact of sexual offenders on individual victims and on society as a whole.  It ensures that appropriate measures are available for the Judiciary when sentencing, to ensure these crimes are dealt with efficiently and appropriately.</p> <p>  There are very few instances where a mandatory or minimum sentence is specified in legislation.  There is a mandatory sentence for murder, which is life imprisonment, and for a number of serious offences such as crimes involving drugs or firearms.  Using the minimum sentence is intended to reflect the impact on society as a whole.  These provisions have been proposed by the Government as a reflection of the impact of serious sexual offences on victims and to ensure the seriousness of these crimes is reflected in how judges can deal with them.  These laws address serious sex offences.  I have met victims and the purpose of bringing forward this legislation is based on the evidence put in front of me by these people.</p></speech>

The substantive part of the legislation is about amending the Punishment of Incest Act 1908.  After the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act was enacted last year we had the anomalous position whereby men convicted of incest were subject to a term of imprisonment of life but this did not apply in respect of women.  Sections 2 and 3 of this Bill propose to harmonise that situation.  The inappropriate sentence of life imprisonment has been reduced to ten years and it applies to both men and women so there is equality in that regard.</p> <p>  We are discussing the points made by Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly against sections 4 and 5 of the Bill, which are the Minister's part of the legislation.  Sentencing is an extremely complicated area and politicians sometimes try to simplify it by introducing legislation.  A recent serious offence, the kind which the Minister wants to see dealt with vigorously, involved a woman, Leona O'Callaghan, who gave up her anonymity.  She was a complainant in a serious crime in which she was the victim of rape and the person accused was convicted of her rape.  That person was already serving a 15-year sentence for raping another girl and, when his sentencing came up, the judge was well aware of this.  The judge gave him a sentence of 17 years' imprisonment, which is very lengthy, but the Minister is proposing that the judge impose a sentence of at least ten years.  My concern is that, when judges have to impose ten years, they start at that level but a person convicted of rape, such as in the case of Ms O'Callaghan, deserve a very lengthy sentence.  Along with other people, I believe Ms O'Callaghan was satisfied with the sentence handed out to her rapist but she was concerned over another area of sentencing law to which we do not give consideration here, namely, that his sentences will not run consecutively but concurrently.</p> <p>  I agree with much of what Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace said to the effect that mandatory sentencing is very arbitrary.  It takes away the discretion of a court.  We all assume judges impose light sentences but they do not.  They have imposed many serious sentences for rape and other serious sexual offences in recent times and we have to stop the story getting out that the courts do not treat sexual offences seriously.  People get very lengthy sentences for rape and serious sexual offences.</p> <p>  We supported this legislation on Second Stage, though I did not have an opportunity to speak, and I will support it here, though I have some concerns.  It has been through the Office of the Attorney General, and that fact gives me some concern.  I have two issues.  We have to be very careful not to identify sex offenders as completely separate from other criminal offenders.  The Oireachtas asserts its disapproval of criminal activity through the sentences we say should apply.  Murder gets a mandatory life sentence but no other crime does.  If a person is convicted of murder and commits another serious offence afterwards, we would not contemplate forcing them to serve a life sentence.  The Oireachtas has decided that there should be a set period of imprisonment for some offences, as set out in the Schedule, with five years for some offences and ten for others, and that is how we set out our disapproval of certain actions.  We need to be careful about this.  The Minister could also be asked why these provisions do not also apply to all other serious offences.</p> <p>  We also need proper sentencing guidelines.  The guidelines, in the form of decisions of the criminal section of the Court of Appeal, are there to be looked at and convicts can have an understanding of what type of sentence they will get from the courts by looking at the thresholds set by the Court of Appeal.  However, we would benefit from the courts setting out sentencing guidelines in respect of these and other offences so that there is greater clarity.  No matter what guidelines we have, or what amount of harmonisation we aim for, there are always going to be different circumstances.  The victim will be different, as will the accused, and their circumstances will vary.  By bringing in mandatory sentencing we are taking away from the ability of the court to exercise its discretion.</p> <p>  I will not support the calls to repeal these sections but the points merit further consideration.  The way to do it is by enacting the Judicial Council Bill and getting the judicial guidelines up and running.</p></speech>

I agree with much of what Deputy O'Callaghan outlined so I will be reasonably brief.</p> <p>  The first point I would like to make is about whether the Judiciary decides to follow legislation that contains provisions relating to minimum sentences.  I do not think that is a reason to oppose legislation.  It raises a question about the Judiciary choosing to ignore legislation that contains such provisions.  It does not raise a question as to whether there should be legislation of this sort.  That is part of a larger debate for another day.</p> <p>  I share many of the reservations about the bluntness or effectiveness of guidelines relating to minimum sentences.  Overall, the legislation is moving us in the right direction.  I agree with what the Minister is trying to do.  There is more benefit in going forward with it than in removing sections 4 and 5, which would effectively gut the legislation.</p> <p>  Essentially, when everything else is stripped out, what we have here is a difference in viewpoints that are genuinely held by different people about how to tackle something.  From what I understood from Deputy Clare Daly's contribution, I do not think she would be supportive of any type of guidelines regarding minimum sentences and would leave it all to a process of judicial decision based on general sentencing guidelines.  I worry about the impact on sentencing of these much called for and much wanted sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary.  The passing of legislation that provides for minimum sentences is one of the strongest sentencing guidelines the Judiciary could be given.  However, we are informed, on more than one occasion, that the Judiciary chooses to ignore such guidelines.  In that context, we could be faced here with a situation whereby a very nice set of sentencing guidelines are not followed.</p> <p>  I will support the Bill.  I will not be supporting the removal of sections 4 and 5.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#P00300"><p>To respond to that last point, it has been shown elsewhere that, where guidelines are in place, it is not simply that the judges read them.  There is transparency and knowledge about the sentences being handed down across the board.  There is more information about sentencing.  Judges are better educated and better equipped as to what the standards are and what is expected of them.  There is more transparency in standards as to what are considered mitigating and aggravating factors.  That would be valuable.  I look forward to the Judicial Council Bill proceeding to Committee Stage in the Seanad in the near future.  I think it will bring about a significant change in sentencing policy that is measured and that will make a real difference.</p> <p>  In terms of the provisions that are specifically opposed, I take on board many of the points that Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly made.  I do not support mandatory minimums.  I would draw a distinction for presumptive minimums because it preserves an element of judicial discretion that I think is important.  Judges have exercised that discretion in areas in which presumptive minimums exist.</p> <p>  On the face of it, and in the abstract, what has been outlined here seems a relatively fair approach to sentencing.  When somebody who commits a serious offence within a reasonable amount of time of committing another relevant offence that is also quite serious - making him or her a repeat offender - the kind of approach that is outlined is very often the approach that a judge would take.  Having said that, there are points that have been made which I will consider.  I will not oppose the sections at this point, but I will keep an open mind as matters progress.</p> <p>  I am very wary of mandatory minimum sentences.  Presumptive minimum sentences are somewhat different.  It takes two or three readings of the formula outlined here in order to properly understand exactly what is proposed.  Time will tell what effect that will have, but we will certainly have to keep an eye on it.</p> <p>  The most significant reservation I have is one that I would like the views of both Minister of State and the Minister for Justice and Equality on, and perhaps there will be an opportunity for that on Report Stage.  Where there is a clear indication for what the sentence for a second offence might be, there is a disincentive for the accused to plead guilty.  I am slightly concerned at that because if the prospective sentence for the second offence is already relatively clear, it seems possible that an accused's lawyers will suggest there is no point in pleading guilty.  If a guilty plea is not entered, that means the complainant will potentially be brought through a court process, and the trauma involved, that would otherwise be avoided.</p> <p>  I will not be opposing the section at this point, but I would like the Minister and the Minister of State to address the point I have made.  I will keep an open mind until Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.1483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#P00400"><p>There are a lot of points to which to respond.  The first is that I feel my contribution and that of Deputy Wallace are very much in defence of the Judiciary in some ways.  I think Deputy O'Callaghan's example showed very clearly that judges are more than capable of taking previous crimes into consideration when they are giving their sentencing decisions.  Although there have been some appalling judgments given in cases of sexual offences and other instances, Deputy O'Callaghan's point that things are slowly beginning to change is fair.  It is absolutely not happening quickly enough.  We know that rape is the least likely of all violent crimes to go to trial.  Some 85% of alleged rapes go unpunished.  The figures suggest that for every 100 women who allege they have been raped and who get to trial, only eight will get to see a judgment in their favour.</p> <p>  There are major problems.  Deputy Brophy stated that there is a complete difference between mandatory minimum sentencing and judicial guidelines.  Judicial guidelines are a process of research, evidence-based education of judges and all interested groups.  They have been proven to be incredibly effective in guiding judges in sentencing.  Time would be better spent on this area, which is evidence based and worthy, and the Judicial Council Bill, which would deal with rogue judges who come out with some wacky, appalling and awful judgments, although they are a minority, but there is nothing we can do now without that Bill.  Instead of the Department dealing with those issues which would achieve what the Minister wants to achieve, it has been spending time on this, which the Minister acknowledged will apply in very limited circumstances - I might even say probably none.</p> <p>  On that basis, one could ask why are we bothering to oppose it, if we believe it is going to have no impact.  I do not believe it will be applied, to be honest, but I think we have a responsibility to challenge it because it should not be on the Statute Book on that basis.  The reason I say it does not even do what it says on the tin is because the Bill specifically states that if a judge feels it is disproportionate to impose one of these presumptive minimum sentences, he or she can do what he or she likes.  Judges can do what they like now as well so nothing is changing.</p> <p>  I would like to see the logic of this formula.  I want to talk through what we are talking about here.  We are not only talking about rape and so on.  I appreciate that rape is not the only crime involved and that sexual assault, child sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault and incest are all covered too.  However, the Bill only deals with crimes that attract sentences of five years or more.</p><p>If a person committed an offence but received a sentence of less than five years - the offence could have been bad, given the sentencing in sexual offences cases - that person will not fall within the remit of the Bill.  They will be out of the equation to begin with.  I would like that logic to be explained to me.  The Bill states that where someone was convicted on indictment of an offence specified in the Schedule - rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and so on - and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least five years, the Bill will not apply.  If that person is subsequently convicted of another scheduled offence committed within ten years of the first conviction, a presumptive minimum sentence will apply to the second conviction.  The sentence for the second offence has to be at least three quarters of the maximum sentence that can be imposed for it.  If the maximum term is life imprisonment, the minimum sentence should be at least ten years.  The Bill states any suspended portion of a sentence will not apply.  If a person was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven years for an offence, three of which were suspended, and commits another offence, they will not fall within the remit of the Bill, as they will have only served four years of the sentence.  The matter is complicated.  Sentence lengths and the reasoning are arbitrary and I have not heard a reason for it.  It is unworkable.  If I was a judge trying to calculate the formulas, I would just do what I would anyway.  I would look at it and say the person did something before and should not get away with it this time and increase the sentence.  What are we doing?  I support the bits about incest, which are fine and on which we all agree.  The matter was supposed to have been cleared up earlier, but these bits should not have been added.  I know that the Minister of State is sincere in his motivation, but we should not be engaging in this process.  It is completely wrong.  </p><p> It is not me who is going on about mandatory sentencing but the Law Reform Commission in the strategic review of penal policy.  Every organisation that has looked at this issue has stated we should be moving away from specifying it in legislation.  We should give judges discretion in dealing with all of the nuances in addressing these issues.</p></speech>

We all agree that most judges have no problem in working within the legislation.  However, we should all remember that, as legislators, we have a serious responsibility.  We can have a huge impact on people's lives in what we do and say here and the legislation we draw up.  I am not sure drawing up legislation which appears to be at odds with much of the empirical data and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and the Department of Justice and Equality is the route we should be going down, as legislators.  I have often heard the Government tell us that the courts are independent in carrying out their functions and that sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the Judiciary.  Why would we impose presumptive minimum sentences in sexual offences cases?  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made a brilliant case for our argument, but the confidence and supply agreement does not allow him to vote with us.  He is in the courts on a regular basis and knows what is going on.  He made a strong argument in favour of letting the judge use his or her discretion.</p></speech>

Deputy Wallace is well aware that there is a clear separation of powers.  The courts have always had discretion in sentencing, in which we cannot interfere.  However, the Oireachtas can introduce laws to express its revulsion at repeat sex offenders.  The Government makes no apology for trying to protect citizens, in particular women and children, from repeat sex offenders who refuse to make any attempt to reform their behaviour.  I have noted what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said and we will come back to him on it.  The objective of the Bill is to deal with sex offenders.</p></speech>

I would like to be convinced that the Bill will help them.  I hope any legislation would help.  Perhaps they know how the formula will work because I cannot see any logic to it.  That was the question, although I do not doubt in any way the Minister of State's motivation.  I do not doubt that there are people who are hurting badly because the criminal justice system has failed them, but the point is we do not want to repeat it by bringing forward a bad law that will not help them when we should have been spending the time in considering judicial guidelines and establishing a judicial council to make improvements in some of these areas.  I am trying to understand the logic behind the formula which does not make any sense to me as loads of people are excluded.  Hardly anybody will be covered by it.

The intention behind the provision is to target the more serious sexual offences.  That is why the minimum sentence of five years was put in place to specifically target serious rather than all sexual offences.  The additional provisions are to ensure it will apply to persons who have received a custodial sentence of five years.  That is why there is a discount if portions of sentences were suspended.</p></speech>
