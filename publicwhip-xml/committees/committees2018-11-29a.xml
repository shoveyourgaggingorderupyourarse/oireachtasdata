    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#B00600"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 3, lines 23 and 24, to delete &quot;an Irish-based risk&quot; and substitute &quot;a risk in the State&quot;.</blockquote> <p>This amendment is grouped with amendments Nos. 2, 5 and 6, so I will speak to all four.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are similar.  The objective is to have consistency within the Bill.  The change proposed in amendment No. 1 would need to be made again in section 3.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are linked because they replace the definition in question with a different one.  These amendments are about consistency.  The Minister of State will recall the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011, passed recently by these Houses, which makes provision for claims to be made for those who had insurance with Setanta or claims relating to that company.  I understand the payments are to be made later this week or early next week, which is very welcome.  The phrase &quot;risk in the State&quot; is consistently used throughout the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011.  Therefore, it would seem logical to use the same wording here rather than the phrase &quot;Irish-based risk&quot;.  Amendment No. 6 defines this as per the 2011 Act.  Amendment No. 5 deletes the definition in the Bill and replaces it with the one in the 2011 Act, the purpose being to have consistency in how we interpret risk.</p><p>The Minister's definition, which amendment No. 5 deletes, states that an Irish-based risk means &quot;a risk, falling within a relevant class of non-life insurance, that, by virtue of regulations under section 7(1), is regarded, for the purposes of this Act, as a risk based in the State&quot;.  The current text ends up defining the subject as a risk based in the State.  The definition I am suggesting is that used in the 2011 Act.  If my amendment is not accepted, this Bill will define Irish-based risks and another two Acts would be defining risks in the State.  There is a lack of consistency.</p><p>Section 7, which we will discuss in more detail later and which refers to risks based in the State, allows the Central Bank to make regulations specifying what counts as risk based in the State, but we already have a definition.  The only reason for a redefinition, which is what is included in this Bill, is to limit the range of insurance types that would be caught by the definition.  It seems confusing given that we have two Acts that define the risks as risks in the State as opposed to Irish-based risks, which we are now trying to introduce.  The  amendments make the point that we should be using the definition already established and used in numerous Acts.  Is there any reason non-life insurance should be excluded from the database?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#B00700"><p>I shall read my note and then deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.  Amendment No. 1 is opposed on the basis that it travels with a substantive amendment to section 4, which is also opposed.  It is intended that risks in the State would be defined by regulation, rather than in the primary legislation, to minimise the need to amend the legislation in future.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are opposed on the basis that the incremental way in which relevant classes of non-life insurance will be provided for by in the database over time &ndash; we are starting with motor insurance - means that much of the text of the amendments would not be initially relevant or appropriate.</p> <p>  The definition of a "risk in the State", which is used by the Deputy, is that which is used in the Insurance Act 1964 in respect of the framework for compensation in the event of an insurance insolvency or administration.  That 1964 Act definition is split out in terms of what risks are excluded and uses categories that may not be contemplated in terms of the database - for example, travel insurance.  The current drafting requires the Central Bank to provide for the definition of an Irish-based risk in this Bill to be analogous to the 1964 Act definition while providing flexibility to vary it where appropriate.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel believes the current drafting better serves the purpose of defining risk in the State for this Bill rather than using the definition in the 1964 Act.</p> <p>  It is matter of whether or which.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel believes that what we have in place is better than what the Deputy is proposing.  The aim is certainly is not to limit the definition in the legislation concerning what will be calculated by the Central Bank.  It is quite the opposite.  Rather than being prescriptive, we want to leave it open in order that all information from different streams can be calculated by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

We are now introducing a different category of risk, namely risk that is Irish based as opposed to what is already established, which is a risk to the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#B00900"><p>We are satisfied that it is not required.  The Bill is doing exactly what we require it to do, which is to provide for the collection and collation of the information for all the areas of insurance that might be relevant.  We are starting with motor insurance and over a period we will flow between other areas where calculation is required.  We are satisfied that what the Deputy proposes is not required.  We are satisfied there is no issue of consistency.  It is a matter of whether or which.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel believes what we are doing and how we are doing it comprise the better approach.</p></speech>

It is open in order not to be prescriptive.  Regulation can subsequently be used, if required, but the Act will be sufficient and we do not need any more or less.</p></speech>

The Deputy is proposing to delete "Irish-based risk".  We would be able to use this formulation for travel insurance but "risk in the State" potentially may not be usable.</p></speech>

The Minister gave the example of travel insurance, which sounds fine, but amendment No. 6 defines "a risk in the State", which is what is already included in the legislation.  It is not coming from my pen but from what we have already passed.  Subsection 2(f)(c) of the 2011 Act refers to "a risk relating to travel or holidays where the policy holder took out the policy in the State and the duration of the policy is 4 months or less".  How does that stack against the fact that the Minister of State is suggesting the existing criteria do not actually include travel insurance given that it is explicitly stated that they do?</p></speech>

This is what is defining the risk in the State.</p></speech>

There is no point in changing the criteria without including the definition relating to them.  It would obviously be necessary to delete section 5 because then there would be criteria for something that does not exist and, as a result, amendment No. 6 would have to be accepted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#C00300"><p>That is just one that could be used in the future.  I am only talking about amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and risks to the State.  I use that as an example of what would happen if the Deputy's amendments were accepted.  We are trying to leave it as open as possible and cover as much as possible.  Others could potentially be excluded by the Deputy's definition.</p></speech>

We have established that travel insurance would not be excluded because what is the risk to the State is explicitly outlined.</p></speech>

The purpose is to leave it open so that we can bring in others.  The full focus for now is motor insurance, employer liability insurance and public liability insurance.  If others come into scope subsequently, that can be used.  I do not know if travel insurance will be used in the future - perhaps it will.</p></speech>

The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel believes its wording is better than being as prescriptive as the Deputy wants.  We do not want to have the legislation prescriptive to allow any future change that might be required to happen by regulation.

I hope it can be expanded sooner rather than later.  I do not want to put on the record a date if I am unsure it can happen.  The Central Bank is carrying out a feasibility study incorporating a ten-year look-back at settlement channels and different categories of motor insurance claims.  This would include windscreen damage, theft, fire, accidents and personal liability.  There is a large body of work to get through in the context of that exercise.  When it is completed, the database will be updated annually.  I cannot say for certain when it will be possible to expand beyond motor insurance into the next section.</p></speech>

That said, I will deal with them together.</p><p>The blue book contains specific headings defining business expenses.  This is a critical issue because it sets the parameters insurers must follow.  Otherwise we would effectively be allowing them to self-declare.  For example, returns in respect of non-life insurance business must not be distorted by agreements between the companies concerned or by arrangements which could affect the apportionment of expenses.  Management expenses should not be charged to underwriting accounts, including directors' fees and foreign exchange gains or losses related to investments other than those attributable to the underwriting account.</p><p>The amendment seeks to tighten up on what can be declared as expenses and to distinguish between what are genuine business expense costs and what are distortionary bookkeeping exercises.  I will give an example of how they can be inflated.  We need to do this in primary legislation.  It is important that parameters are set down here at this time.  Responsibility should not be delegated to the Central Bank; we need to decide on certain parameters.</p><p>When dealing with people trying to get insurance, we must do everything to ensure that the database helps them get insurance at a reasonable price.  This is about tightening up and ensuring that there cannot be an inflation of or a bookkeeping exercise in terms of expenses that can be declared.</p><p>As stated, I do not believe amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are related.  Amendment No. 7 outlines a number of steps which can be counted in the context of the section.  It deals with the issue of transparency which is at the core.  It also deals with out-of-court discussions through unofficial channels that are not recorded in any way.  By adding these two additional non-formal steps I am trying to ensure the data collected include these informal discussions which are not captured in the Bill at the moment.  The additional informal discussions to be captured if the amendment is accepted would be:</p><blockquote>(c) direct negotiation after registration of the claim by the claimant under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 but before the respondent consents or declines a formal assessment progressing,<br /><br />(d) direct negotiation after consent by the respondent to a formal assessment but before a final award is made under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 or final determination of the claim by the acceptance of both parties, or by default of rejection by the respondent, of the formal award under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003.</blockquote><p>These areas are not currently captured by the Bill.  It is important to have the full data available in order that we know what is happening through informal channels and other parts of resolutions to ensure all of the data are captured in the database.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#D00200"><p>The items mentioned in amendment No. 3 already fall within the existing definition.  The approach of individually specifying this level of detail is not in keeping with the general drafting approach taken in the Bill.  We propose to set down in primary legislation a framework within which the Central Bank will establish an administrative claims database that will allow the specific approach to evolve over time.  It is intended that the data to be collected from insurers will be defined by regulation, rather than in the primary legislation, to minimise the need to amend the legislation as the level of data collected in the future becomes more detailed.  The Central Bank has informed me that it will take the substance of the amendment into account when it finalises its data specification in order that the data outlined are collected in this way.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about distortion in bookkeeping exercises, they are not going to be acceptable to anybody, let alone the Central Bank.  It is a sharp practice that certainly could not be accommodated anywhere.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 is being opposed on the basis that it comprises detail which is unnecessary to drill down into the primary legislation and that is appropriately covered in the existing text.  In that regard, the existing provision which provides for "the employment of the procedures under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board" covers all of the cases which come within its scope, including those set out in the amendment.  It is similarly covered already.  </p> <p>  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has also highlighted in respect of this provision that there are deficiencies in the terminology used in the amendment.  As such, it does not properly reflect the wording of the original Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 which is referenced.  In addition, in trying to break down the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process into a series of component parts we run the risk of missing out on certain elements.  For example, having consulted directly with it, we understand the proposed amendment may not cover cases that the board releases almost immediately under section 17 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 where consent has not been sought from the respondents.  These may be cases such as psychological bullying, abuse, etc. that may ultimately be settled after concluding the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process.  This means that there is a possibility that it would not allow for all settlements made in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process to be captured, thereby unintentionally decreasing the scope of the information that might be requested.  On the basis that the existing text captures all scenarios within the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process, I do not think it advisable for the committee to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

On being prescriptive, the reality is that insurance companies are not to be trusted.  They are under investigation for engaging in cartel-like activities and were raided by European authorities.  I have no qualms in saying they are ripping people off.  I received an email late last night from a person who was being fleeced in seeking to get motor insurance.  It is not possible to pay insurance premiums upfront.  The insurance companies are then allowed to add additional charges because people pay in monthly instalments.  No matter what way they turn, they feel under serious pressure.  To tell the Minister of State God's honest truth, I would not trust insurance companies as far as I could throw them.  We know that this happens.  We know that businesses and accountants look at how expenses can be offset from a subsidiary here to one elsewhere to present figures in a different way and that best suits it.  Amendment No. 3 would not limit how business expenses would be defined, but it sets out clearly what needs to be included.  I do not, therefore, hear any reason it should not be included.  The Minister of State, rightly, talked about it not being in keeping with the Bill, as drafted.  He will see, however, in a number of my amendments, that I believe that, as legislators, after what we have come through and given the reasson we know that this is needed, we do not need to agree to loose legislation that allows the Central Bank which I trust to interpret what we would like to do.  The Central Bank is independent in implementing Acts and using powers passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is interaction where we set down the ground rules for how this issue will be dealt with.  Therefore, we do need to be more prescriptive.  The reality is that this has been happening and the Central Bank has not been the great protector of consumers who have witnessed increases of 70% over a period of three years.  The Central Bank was also not the great protector of consumers when it came to the scandal of tracker mortgages, etc.  There is, therefore, an onus on us to be prescriptive to a certain degree.  That is what amendment No. 3 attempts to do.  It tries to ensure, in so far as is possible, that we will not see the industry using its accountants to try to cook the books.  I refer to the use of business expenses as a way to reduce the figures that the industry will present in the claims database.</p></speech>

I will not pretend that I am pleased with the method by which the Central Bank has taken consumers into its bosom.  The reality is that it is much more concerned about prudential regulation than consumer protection.  I think the Deputy's criticism is fair and I agree with his point.  </p> <p>  On business expenses, I do not have the exact figure offhand, but awards account for more than 90% of funds paid out by insurance companies.  In talking about business expenses the Deputy used the term "cooking the books".  It is not one I will use, but in the scheme of things business expenses actually come to a small amount.  In this jurisdiction awards constitute the much larger amount.  We have had this conversation before and I have made the point to the Deputy.  If he is satisfied, I am prepared to give a commitment that what he is asking for can be captured by regulation, rather than primary legislation.  The legislation has been designed in that way in order that we do not have to be prescriptive.  There is flexibility to enable the Central Bank to capture everything we want it to capture in the future.  It is much easier to alter a regulation rather than legislation.</p></speech>

The current definition of &quot;direct negotiation&quot; in subsection (4) is very limited.  It is more a definition of formal negotiation than direct negotiation.</p><p>I believe we need a full picture.  What the amendment does, simply, is make clear that this would involve not only negotiation involving in whole or in part the services of a solicitor or counsel as happens at present and would add "by either the claimant or the insurance undertaking or by both".  This will make it clear that if there is only one side with a solicitor or counsel, then it is deemed as direct negotiation and it can be captured.</p></speech>

The Bill is designed in a particular way so that if alterations are required in the future then regulations can be changed far easier than the legislation.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, is satisfied that the point is already covered.</p></speech>

The definition can only be changed by the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The definition in this case has direct negotiation as including in whole or in part the services of a solicitor or counsel.</p> <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to reflect on this.  The amendment does not take away from the provision unless I am unaware of some legal issue arising from the Office of the Attorney General.  If that is the case I would be happy to hear it.  In any case, this amendment makes clear that this is by either the claimant or the insurance undertaking or by both.  The interpretation of the provision could lead to what would be defined as a more formal negotiation between two sets of counsel or solicitors, as opposed to an individual making contact with an insurance solicitor or insurance company's legal representatives in an agreement or settlement that would not be captured.</p></speech>

The point is similar to the point I was making with amendment No. 4.  It relates to the Mediation Act.  I wish to reflect on the Long Title and what it tells us about the purpose of it.  It refers to an Act "to facilitate the settlement of disputes by mediation, to specify the principles applicable to mediation, to specify arrangements for mediation as an alternative to the institution of civil proceedings or to the continuation of civil proceedings that have been instituted".  The question arises as to why this would not be included in the Bill as a step to take into account.  Basically, the amendment inserts in page 5 an additional term: "or mediation as per the Mediation Act 2017".  Obviously the process is now legally underpinned by statute and should be included as part of the steps that would be taken into account.</p></speech>

Section 6(1) states that the relevant information will be made available to the State to enable us to identify factors that influence the cost of insurance.  To what end?  Who will actually get this information?  What are such persons going to do with the information?  That is my first point and it is a fundamental issue.  There must be transparency.  Will a potential new competitor have access to the information referred to in section 6(1)?</p> <p>  The section also brings up questions of delegation.  This is the trend in the legislation.  The language of this section includes phrases like "in the opinion of the bank", "special consideration of any views expressed by the Minister" and "shall be carried out from time to time as occasion requires".  This is the opposite of what we need to be doing, which is to bring in far more robust legislation that is not as opaque as this section appears to be.  There is concern &ndash; it arises throughout the Bill &ndash; that notwithstanding my support for the purpose of the Bill, the language is rather opaque.  My fundamental question relates to the information in section 6(1).  What is the State going to do with this information upon getting it?  To what end will the State collect the information?  Will new competitors have access to the information referred to?</p></speech>

This allows for the extension of the scope of the database to different classes of non-life insurance in future on foot of an assessment by the Central Bank of the appropriateness of such an extension after consultation with the Minister for Finance without requiring further amendments to the legislation.</p><p>The section, therefore, provides for several principles and policies, in which one of the guiding principles in any potential extension of scope relates to the cost of that class of insurance.  As per the recommendations of the cost of insurance working group, it is intended, in the first instance, that the database will focus on the private motor insurance sector.  Consequently, it is proposed that this area will be the subject of the first set of regulations to be developed by the bank.  It is important to give this matter appropriate consideration before expanding into other classes of insurance.</p><p> A report will be published at least once a year.  When the first report is published, we will have a decade of information.  Some 20%, 30% or 40% of cases might be settled without a medical report.  If a significant number are being settled without a medical report, it falls to those of us who set policy, namely, the Department of Finance and the committee, to examine why insurance companies are settling injury claims in such a way.  They have different methodologies for calculating what they pay out and at what stage.  Some settle claims very early, while some do so without a medical report.  Some settle them too early, while others challenge people with a very clear and obvious case for damages through no fault of their own every step of the way.  We are trying to access the data to understand the flow of information.  We have information on 30% of claims which are publicly settled in court or by the Personal Injuries Assessment Bureau but none on the remaining 70% of settlements.</p></speech>

Section 8(3) states: &ldquo;In relation to the data to be collected by the Bank from an insurance undertaking under <i>subsection (2)</i>, the insurance undertaking shall use its best endeavours to provide the information to the Bank in such a form so that no individual is identifiable from it&rdquo;.  That gives significant latitude to the insurance industry.  It is not held to any standard in providing the information.  As a company has the information, for what reason does the section state it &ldquo;shall use its best endeavours&rdquo; to provide it?  It should read, &ldquo;the insurance undertaking shall provide the information to the Bank in such a form so that no individual is identifiable from it&rdquo;.  Why are we letting insurance companies off the hook by allowing them to state they have used their best endeavours but that it was difficult and that they could not find the file?  We should make it very clear insurance companies have a responsibility to provide the information in the required form.</p></speech>

It might be easy to identify a very large claim settled publicly by a small insurer.  If we were to set the very high threshold suggested in the amendment, it could cause insurers to take an overly conservative view of the information they were comfortable in sharing with the bank, which would result in a deficit in usable data.  The amendment is also opposed on the basis that it is unnecessary in the context of data protection, as an appropriate safeguard has been included in the section to protect personal data.  Where an insurer provides information from which an individual is identifiable, the Central Bank is mandated under subsection (3) to ensure the information is not disclosed by it.  That requirement is in addition to, rather than in substitution for, any other data protection requirement in the Bill or the Data Protection Act 2018.  We do not want insurance companies to propose giving aggregated information to the Central Bank in order to avoid the potential identification of an individual from among a smaller number of claims, bearing in mind data protection requirements.  That is why the section provides that insurers shall use their best endeavours to provide the information.</p></speech>

It is not appropriate to include that provision as we should be facilitating transparency.  The identification of an insurance undertaking is appropriate in certain circumstances.  I accept that as a result of the blanket deletion proposed in the amendment, it would also delete the protection for individuals, which is not its aim.  I will, therefore, examine the issue further on Report Stage.</p> <p>  We have discussed the issue of &ldquo;best endeavours&rdquo; in the context of the provision of data under the section.  The Minister of State will be aware that under recommendation No. 4 made in the report of the cost of insurance working group, a data template was sent to the insurance industry in May.  The intention was that it would respond to him by quarter 3 in order that the data could be published before the end of the year.  However, it told him that that would not be possible but that it had begun to collect the data.  In certain respects, I do not trust the industry as far as I could throw it.</p><p>There is language in this Bill that we need to examine on Report Stage that looks at some of these issues.</p><p> An amendment of mine on this section that was ruled out order would have given a greater breakdown of each expenditure type in the settlement channels and would have empowered the Central Bank to correct public statements from insurers that are not accurate.  I think those amendments should be considered by the Department.  The Minister mentioned consumer protection.  The Central Bank should be empowered to correct public statements by insurers that are not accurate because they are deeply misleading.</p><p> Another amendment of mine was ruled out of order.  The Chairman is becoming very strict in respect of disallowing all my amendments and is becoming very soft on the insurance industry.  I have the letter with his signature to prove it.  I am only joking.  I know it is not the Chairman.</p></speech>

It is whoever is pulling his strings.  A number of amendments were ruled out of order.  One of them was ruled out of order for reasons beyond my understanding.  The official response as to why it was ruled out of order was that it would impose a charge on the State.  This was to specify that motor insurance or public liability insurance would be subject to this database.  We all know here that the intention is that motor insurers would be subject to this database but it does not say that in the Bill.  That is what the amendment sought to do.  It sought to ensure that the Central Bank does do that because it is not in the legislation.  It was ruled out of order because it would be a charge on the State.  How the hell could it be a charge on the State unless it was not intended to do it in the Bill in the first place?  If this is what the Bill is all about, let us state the obvious and say that under no circumstances can motor insurance not be included in respect of this database.  The amendment has been ruled out of order because that could be a charge on the State.  It cannot be a charge on the State if it is going to happen.  When this legislation passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President, it goes to the Central Bank.  No harm to it but we cannot go in and go through this again.  This is our opportunity to be tight and to make sure that what we want is there.  I will talk to those responsible for ruling these amendments out of order and get a better understanding of the reasons for doing so but I make those points to say that the Minister of State should look at clarifying these issues by looking at some of the amendments that have been ruled out of order.  I ask the Minister of State to look at them before Report Stage.</p></speech>

After all, the Central Bank is part of the European system of banks.  The problem with Central Bank reports is that from the point of view of ordinary people, many of them are inevitably highly technical.  Would the Minister of State be agreeable to providing broadly based information and comparators, including all other countries in the European banking system because they all collect data, so that is not putting any big burden on anybody?  In respect of the ongoing conversation about insurance and how expensive it is, it would enable us to build up comparators over time that would be useful to policymakers here and give us insights into how much value for money is provided by insurance in Ireland compared with how much it costs.  We have a lot of anecdotal information.  In many European countries that are part of the same European central banking system, financial services like insurance are simply not as expensive as they are in Ireland.  Would the Minister of State be open to discussing or even showing us what this report is likely to look like?  Given that the Central Bank is a member of the European system, can we not see how it shapes up in terms of this kind of regulation compared with other European banks?  Would the Minister of State accept an amendment like that?  I appreciate that this is a Finance Bill so the ball is entirely in the Minister of State's court as to whether he accepts or rejects an amendment.</p></speech>

The Bill is about doing a job, namely, to collect the Irish information - not information relating to France, Spain, Germany or anywhere - and make comparisons.  The Deputy made the point that insurance value in Ireland is poor compared with other jurisdictions.  There is a single reason for that.  We have the highest awards in the world.  That is the reason it is expensive here and much less expensive in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

In terms of motor insurance, we are down 23% since the peak, according to the CSO.  This will be a very important aspect of further reducing premia.  The Deputy asked me how I know about the awards.  We have benchmarked awards in Ireland through the report of the Personal Injuries Commission chaired by Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.  On average, a soft tissue award in Ireland is 4.4 times greater than elsewhere, so if a person gets &euro;10,000 in the UK, he or she will get &euro;44,000 here.  This is not an attractive jurisdiction for insurance companies.  How do I know that?  Quite a few of them have left.  They have left because the sector is expensive, the awards are high and many of those companies were not profitable.  It is very easy for them to move their capital and go to another jurisdiction where things are better operationally.  This is important legislation to get through the Houses.</p> <p>  According to Mr. Justice Kearns, the recalibration should be undertaken by the judicial council when it is established.  I met the Minister for Justice and Equality and the expectation is that all of that will be concluded - the legislation for the establishment of the judicial council, the establishment of the council and the work on recalibrating the book of quantum, which will reduce the awards.  This is when we will see a further decrease in premia.  That is the objective of everybody in this room.</p></speech>

What amount of information will the public - ordinary consumers - be given regarding this section?  If we are setting up a database under which we will eventually have anonymised data, I cannot understand why it would not be part of the Central Bank's function to put information about what has been gleaned into the public domain regularly, as is done in many European countries.</p><p>I am not asking for personal details about anything.  I am asking for information that is useful to consumers.  The Minister of State's concern, I understand, is with the insurance industry but there needs to be concern about the consumers who are paying high premiums here.</p></speech>

The information flow will benefit the consumers based upon policy direction.  As I stated a moment ago, we have sight of 30% of the settlement channels.  We have no sight over exactly how the awards are affecting the premia but we will have sight over them when this legislation is passed.</p> <p>  When we pass the legislation, potentially, there will be more information.  The 70% of the settlement channels of which we have no knowledge at present will be available and we will be able to see whether a percentage of companies are settling too earlier and whether some companies are settling without a medical report because it is probably cheaper commercially.  If that is the case, it falls within the ambit of the Oireachtas to do something about it.  We will not see until we get the information flow.  The information flow will be a ten-year look backwards.  Some of that work, in terms of the types of insurance and the types of flow, is done already.</p></speech>

In response, the ECB invited the Minister to clarify through appropriate amendments that any anticipated or actual shortfall of funds to defray the bank's expenses under the draft law will always be granted by the Minister on a regular and prompt basis as the costs arise to ensure that the bank does not have to fund the cost of its task under the draft law from its own funds.  Further information on this was provided to members in the briefing sent to the committee.</p><p>As a result, I am introducing this technical amendment to section 11(3) to reflect that the Minister shall, rather than may, on the written request of the bank, advance to the bank such sums he or she thinks proper to enable the bank to defray all of its expenses, arising in that year, associated with the function the bank is required to perform under the legislation.</p><p>I believe that this amendment, on balance, is sufficient to address any hypothetical concerns around future monetary financing raised by the ECB in its opinion.</p></speech>

This consideration took into account the need for balance and constitutional proportionality and has been signed off by the Attorney General.  Therefore, while legislation can always be challenged, we are satisfied that constitutional issues should not arise in the context of these two limited amendments and that there should not be any unintended negative consequences for genuine claimants.</p><p>On section 8, the amendment deals first with the letter of claim and the potential consequences of a failure to serve a notice in writing on the alleged wrongdoer within a prescribed period from the date of the cause of action &ndash; currently two months.  The cost of insurance working group formed the view that section 8 should be amended to enhance the effectiveness of this statutory requirement.</p><p>The key aim of this amendment is to reduce the notification period for the serving of a letter of claim from two months to one month, to align the time period with data protection legislation and the new general data protection regulation, GDPR, which came into force on 25 May 2018 and which provides that data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is obtained &ndash; generally no more than one month.</p><p>However an exception to this rule is where information on CCTV footage, video footage or digital footage is held in the context of an investigation, such as a personal injuries claim.  Consequently, by requiring a plaintiff to notify a defendant within one month of an alleged incident under section 8, the defendant will be given the opportunity to identify within the data protection time limits any footage the defendant may have of the incident, and keep it beyond the one-month period for investigation purposes where the defendant believes the claim is questionable.  This earlier notification period will also help a defendant prepare his or her defence in a range of other ways such as being able to put together more accurate employee witness statements where this is relevant.  It also may help the defendant in accepting his or her liability as early as possible, thus enabling the claim to be settled quickly with minimal legal fees incurred.</p><p>The existing wording of section 8 needs to be strengthened in order to ensure it is used more effectively by the courts.  In this regard, it is proposed that instead of a court having the option to draw inferences from the failure to serve a letter of claim on the alleged wrongdoer within the prescribed period of time through the use of the word &quot;may&quot;, it should be required to do so as a matter of course through the use of the word &quot;shall&quot;.  It should be noted that these inferences may not always be negative as the court may conclude that there was reasonable cause for the delay in notification.  However, where the inference is negative, the court may make no order as to the payment of costs to the plaintiff or deduct such amount from costs that would, but for this section, be payable to the plaintiff as it considers appropriate.</p><p>Finally, on this part of the amendment, the working group believes that the words &quot;or as soon as practicable thereafter&quot; should be deleted as this allows arguably too much latitude to a plaintiff to delay unnecessarily before notifying the defendant.  The working group, however, is of the view that with the deletion of these words, sufficient protection still remains for the plaintiff in this section, as only where there is a failure &quot;without reasonable cause&quot; can a court draw a negative inference.  That refers to section 8.</p></speech>

I do not have an issue with that as such.</p> <p>  I have an issue with the other parts of what the Minister of State has done here.  The Minister of State has removed the words "or as soon as practicable thereafter", which allows for the court to decide whether it is practicable.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has then determined in law that the court shall draw an inference and while the note he provided to us states that such inference can be positive, the language is negative and it is designed to be a negative conclusion.  The court has the power, if it so wishes, to draw an inference.  The reason it is written in that way is because inferences are negative so that it can draw a negative view in relation to this.  Now the Minister of State is saying they shall do it but it kind of states this is good and there is nothing negative there.  There is a serious issue in that regard.</p><p>The amendment to section 14 of the 2004 Act is tinkering around the edges.  I am not sure about it.  I have not heard any reasonable explanation for why a fraudulent claimant would delay his or her own proceedings.  I do not understand why that would be the case, but that is not the core issue, which relates to a number of steps that are being taken in the amendment.  We all want fraudulent claims to be stamped out.  I will give the Minister of State the opportunity to outline to us his conversations with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on the establishment of a funded insurance fraud squad within the Garda force.  The official position is that such a body should be funded by the industry.  A number of steps are specified in the amendment.  It specifies a reduction in the notice period from two months to one month and proposes the deletion of the phrase "as soon as practicable thereafter".  Another phrase is used that is still more restrictive.  A further proposed change is that the court "shall" as opposed to "may" draw an inference.  The penalty for genuine claimants who fail to fulfil the terms of subsection (4) is that an order of costs could be made against them or the costs for that part could be made against them.  The change is far-reaching and for this reason, I cannot support the amendment.</p><p> I support the core principle of the amendment, namely, the proposed change in the term from two months to one month.  I do not have a problem with that, but the Minister of State needs to revisit the amendment on Report Stage.  If a court decides there is a reason for the claim not being been served on an individual, it is up to the court to draw a conclusion.  Courts are empowered to draw conclusions and we should allow them to make such decisions rather than dictating to them by using the word "shall".  The problem is that the change would make it harder for genuine claimants.</p><p> We are correctly coming at the legislation with the intention of stamping out fraudulent claims and driving down insurance premiums.  However, there is also a responsibility on us to look through the lens of people who are making genuine claims.  We must ask whether this is proposal will create three further hurdles that will allow insurance companies, which are multi-billion industries with lawyers akin to Goliath, to go up against individuals who were genuinely injured having been involved in a motor or other accident.  The Bill provides additional ammunition for the industry to tackle fraudulent claims but the approach would also have an effect on genuine claims.  We have got the balance wrong here.</p></speech>

It has been customary for Ministers for Finance to provide detailed notes if Members request them.  We received the text of the amendment at short notice.  This is potentially a very big change.  Did the Attorney General give advice on it?  It is a very overt direction to a court.  If, for instance, an honest claimant is caught out by the proposed change, does he or she have a mechanism to appeal what is becoming an automatic process which the Minister is trying to impose on the court?  If we could get the detailed note, we could get advice on it.</p> <p>  What mechanisms, if any, does the Minister of State have in mind to ensure that honest claimants do not lose out?  The vast majority of people are honest.  We all have a problem with fraudulent claims and we are united in wanting to stamp them out, but this is a big step up and we did not hear much about it beforehand.  We were handed copies of the proposed amendment the other day.  I would like more detailed information from the Minister of State.  Will he outline what will happen to an honest claimant who, for whatever reason, does not meet the one month deadline?  What recourse, if any, will he or she have?  Usually in such cases there is an inbuilt system akin to an appeals mechanism which would allow someone to seek a remedy if, for some reason, it was not possible to comply with the regulation.</p></speech>

The change which requires a court to draw inferences is subject to the caveat that if there is a reasonable cause for the delay, the provision mandating the court to draw inferences does not apply.  The implication of the court drawing inferences relates to costs, as set out in subsection 3(<i>b</i>)(i) and (ii), but that is only where the interests of justice so require.  That is a matter of interpretation and judgment for the judge.  Accordingly, there are caveats and safeguards.  However, it is important that the measure is properly discussed and teased out.</p><p>What practical difference will this make in a scenario where a claimant does not notify a business owner of an incident and waits until the eve of the two year anniversary to lodge a claim?  That could be the first the policyholder would have heard of it.  This practice will still be permitted and a claimant will still not have to notify a business of an alleged incident and may still take a claim on the eve of the second anniversary of the alleged incident.  In practical terms, what difference will this change make in such a scenario?</p></speech>

Many business owners have informed me of claims being made against their businesses 18 months after the event.  This practice is common in the hospitality sector, for example, in respect of nightclubs.  A business is not able to defend itself in cases where no report of an incident of any nature has been made to a staff member.  I will tie this in with Deputy Doherty's point about why a fraudulent claimant would delay proceedings.  The best ploy available to a fraudulent claimant is to make a late claim because there may no evidence of an incident on the part of the business owner and, subsequently, to drag out the case for between three and five years.  This potentially leaves an open claim on a business's books for that entire period.  Business owners have frequently told me it is cheaper to pay off a claimant, even though they have no knowledge of any incident having taken place because as long as there is an open claim on their books, their insurance premium will increase.</p></speech>

For this reason, Deputy McGrath's question is relevant.  I was referring to section 14 and cases where proceedings have already been served.</p></speech>

If a fraudulent claim has begun, why would it be to the advantage of a fraudulent claimant not to swear their pleadings?  They have to do so before the court anyway at some point.  All it does is delay the case.  That is my point; I was not referring to the delay. A period of one or two months is beneficial, notwithstanding the impact of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#K00200"><p>I will discuss section 14 afterwards, if the Deputy does not mind.  In my view and in the view of several businesses who have presented to me, this is almost 100% complete.  The number of occasions when fraudulent claims show up and they have no evidence that an incident did not happen is significant.  Heretofore, before the change in the data protection laws on 25 May, they could keep the footage for as long as they wanted - months, two years, whatever.  Now the law of the land says that footage must be deleted after one month.  It is only appropriate that we equalise the period for which the footage must be retained and the period within which people have to be notified of a case.</p> <p>  We are in no way removing the court's flexibility in dealing with somebody making a legitimate claim.  It is important to put on the record that whenever I meet businesses or groups who are concerned about insurance, everybody wants to ensure that the legitimate claimant is compensated, as we in this House do.  We provide for reasonable cause in the section to ensure that if somebody has a legitimate and reasonable cause for not notifying the party against whom they are making a claim, the court will consider that.  This does not impact upon that.</p> <p>  However, the matter of inference arose in the working group.  In this amendment, the inference pertaining to the plaintiff remains in cases where there has been a failure to notify without a reasonable cause.  If somebody rocks up with an insurance claim one year, 11 months, three weeks and three or four days later, we are again in a situation where the person against whom claims are being made has no evidence.  Staff members might be gone.  The respondent might not even know who was working on the night in question.  This situation could last for two, three or four years.  Drawing a negative inference in cases where there is no reasonable cause is a matter for the court.  It is important that we have enough protection for claimants with a reasonable cause for not giving notification.  We are here to protect the individual who has a legitimate case for damages against his or her person.  We are all at one in wanting to protect those people.  However, we have to move to a new space.  The period of one or two months and the provision for inference is crucial to make an impact.  We could pretend to make an impact and make a provision that is not legitimate.  I am not about that and I do not believe this committee is.  If we want to make an impact, this section is crucial.</p> <p>  We are not imposing on the courts.  Yesterday, the Attorney General gave his opinion and he is comfortable with this.  I am meeting Garda Commissioner Harris on 11 December.  I continually have to say that I am not opposed to the establishment of a Garda insurance section within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  As a personal view which I aired a long time ago, very early in the job, I am opposed to the industry funding the section directly.  If the industry provides the money to the Minister and the Minister provides it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I am 100% comfortable with that.  That arrangement does the same thing.  Funding is provided to the Exchequer, which, in turn, provides the same funding.  I would look for additional funding to establish the insurance section.  That is what I would prefer.  The cost of insurance working group, which was present before I came into the job, also highlighted that.  It is the UK model.  However, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  He will speak with the Minister for Justice and Equality about the establishment of the section and how it is funded. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112900002#K00300"><p>From historical experience, the deterrent to fraud is the capacity to investigate it and for the perpetrators of the fraud to be prosecuted.  That is the critical issue, whether we are talking about company directors or bankers misbehaving or fraudulent insurance claims.  I do not understand why a structure that allows action has not been developed.  We hear all the time about cases where a person comes into a restaurant, stages an incident some time later and then makes a claim.  As the Minister of State said, nobody has much knowledge of the incident at issue.  The only way to deter that is for the fraudsters to be prosecuted, as happens with fraud in other areas of business.  I do not know if the Minister of State has addressed that.  It is a scandal.  Judges openly say it in court and claims are withdrawn.  We must bear in mind that the vast majority of people are honest, but they see fraudulent claimants being admonished by judges and then just walking away.  We do not know, but it does not appear as though everything ever happens to them.</p></speech>

We need to get this up and running as quickly as possible.  As we have talked about in reference to section 14, personal injury claims should not be delayed.  That needs to be part of the database.  Personal public liability needs to be part of it, not just motor insurance.</p> <p>  I have made one point on a number of occasions to the Minister of State's predecessor and to the line Minister.  Any instance of big private business directly or indirectly funding our police service is inappropriate.  It does not matter if it passes through the Minister's hands before it gets to the Garda.  It is not acceptable.  It would also not be acceptable if a philanthropist came to the Minister and offered to fund a section of the Garda to investigate rogue or corrupt politicians, or if a big businessman decided he wanted something investigated and passed money through the Department of Finance.  It would not be done.  We need to establish this as a matter of principle.  Everybody on this committee and in the Houses of the Oireachtas believes the Garda should have an insurance fraud squad.  Then we need to publicly resource it.  Before the Minister of State meets the Garda Commissioner, he should get a commitment from the Minister and make it clear to him that the Houses of the Oireachtas stand four-square behind him.  The Garda Commissioner is independent in how he structures the Garda.  However, it is the view of the Oireachtas and of this committee that there should be such a unit within the Garda and the necessary resources should be made available.  Whether we want to raise additional money through taxes or levies on the insurance industry should be a secondary issue.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments about his personal view on this.  From my point of view, even if funding passed through the hands of the Minister before getting to the Garda, a precedent would be created.  It is just not right.</p> <p>  I can understand how frustrating it is to see people who have had their claims dismissed as fraudulent by a judge and who have taken up court time walking away without a worry in the world  because they are not going to be prosecuted.  We need to deal with this quickly.  I ask the Minister of State to take that issue off the table and to get a commitment from his Cabinet colleagues to make the resources available.</p><p>I can only speak for my own party but the Minister of State will have its full support because this needs to be done urgently.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#A00700"><p>I am pleased to be present for this Supplementary Estimate.  I am joined by Mr. Donncha O'Sullivan, Mr. Seamus Clifford, Mr. Frank Maher and Ms Downey, who is in the building and may be joining us shortly.  I thank members of the committee for making time available for this consideration.</p> <p>  The net amount of the Supplementary Estimates is &euro;59 million for the Garda Vote, &euro;10 million for the Prisons Vote and &euro;8 million for the Department of Justice and Equality Vote.  The Courts Service Vote does not require additional Exchequer funding but requires that surplus receipts of &euro;600,000 are used to offset current expenditure requirements in a technical Supplementary Estimate.  The remaining Votes in the group for the Policing Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will remain within budget and have surrender balances of approximately &euro;2.7 million at the end of the year.</p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;59 million arises in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote this year.  This comprises a gross expenditure requirement of &euro;76.2 million, which is offset by a projected surplus in appropriations-in-aid of &euro;17.2 million giving a net additional requirement of &euro;59 million.  An additional &euro;46.4 million is being made available to meet payroll and overtime costs, including the Garda College subhead.  The additional requirement for pay and allowances is &euro;23.7 million and &euro;22.7 million relates to overtime.  I am pleased that in budget 2019, an additional &euro;72 million will be provided for Garda pay and allowances, which provides for the costs of accelerated Garda and civilian recruitment and costs associated with pay agreements.  There are additional requirements under a number of other administrative and operational subheads, including travel and subsistence, expenses associated with road traffic policing, maintenance of Garda premises, certain other station services, and clothing and operational equipment amounting to &euro;30 million after offsetting underspends in other areas.</p> <p>  The offsetting underspends arise across subheads such as superannuation due to fewer retirements than expected, at &euro;2.5 million, and compensation, at &euro;1.8 million.  There are surplus receipts of approximately &euro;17 million, mainly accounted for by pay-related pension deductions.  This is directly related to the increased expenditure on pay and overtime and the Supplementary Estimate is making these additional receipts available to offset a proportion of the overtime and payroll cost.  The Supplementary Estimate also includes the reprofiling of &euro;6.649 million in the capital building and refurbishment programme, &euro;3.581 million which it is proposed to carry forward to next year under the capital carryover provisions, and the balance of &euro;3.068 million being reallocated to ICT capital.  This is to balance a similar reallocation at the end of last year when a corresponding amount from the ICT budget was reallocated to the building programme.</p> <p>  A total capital allocation of more than &euro;92 million is being made available to the Garda Vote next year.  This will facilitate significant further investment in leading edge ICT of &euro;64.8 million, &euro;10 million for transport, and &euro;17.5 million for the capital building and refurbishment programme.  The current Supplementary Estimate process and the increased budgetary provision for the Vote in 2019 provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the financial resources to address the challenges it faces and, significantly, to support the ongoing reform programme, which will gain further momentum from the implementation of the recommendations in the report on the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The recommendations in the report are comprehensive and far-reaching and provide a blueprint for future development of the policing service in Ireland.  Specifically, on the financial front, it recommends the production of a costed policing plan presented in a multi-annual framework.  While the details have yet to be fully worked out, this has the potential to significantly change the way in which budgets and expenditure are presented in the future, including to this committee.  I look forward to the output from this process.</p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;10 million is required for the Prisons Vote.  The requirement arises across a number of subheads, including pay and additional allowances of &euro;1.997 million, travel and subsistence of &euro;548,000, staff training and recruitment of &euro;1.1 million, building and equipment, mainly maintenance costs, of &euro;2.6 million, prison and operational services at a cost of &euro;2.3 million and compensation payments of &euro;2.4 million.  There are offsetting underspends available of &euro;2.129 million, including surplus appropriations-in-aid of &euro;1.5 million, which has reduced the net funding requirement to &euro;10 million.  There have been pressures on a number of the non-pay subheads in question in recent years but it has been possible to offset some of the costs from underspends in other subheads, including payroll.  This is not possible in 2018 as there are increased payroll costs arising from a pay agreement integrating rent allowance with basic pay.  While recruitment is ongoing in the Prison Service, it is not yet at the point, coupled with retirements, that all vacancies are covered.  It is necessary to fill some of the staffing shortfall through increased additional hours payments.  A number of once-off costs arose this year in respect of training expenditure, for example, where alternative accommodation had to be used while the training college in Portlaoise was being renovated.</p><p>In addition, particularly in respect of the maintenance expenditure, the severe weather conditions earlier in the year, the collapse of the Mountjoy circular roof and certain other unplanned works gave rise to some additional expenditure.  </p><p> Turning to the justice and equality Vote, there is a requirement for an additional &euro;8 million in the current year.  This mainly arises across criminal legal aid and asylum accommodation with a combined projected overspend of just under &euro;26 million.  However, in a Vote with in excess of 60 subheads across five programmes, there are a number of underspends and overspends against budget which have contributed to reducing the additional Exchequer funding requirement to &euro;8 million.  </p><p> The budgetary arithmetic underpinning the Supplementary Estimate requirement takes account of the various under and overspends across the budget.  As outlined, the areas of overspend relate to criminal legal aid, &euro;15.7 million, and asylum accommodation, &euro;10 million.  The volume of cases arising from criminal activity before the courts is increasing and this has a proportionate increase in the criminal legal aid budget.  The upward trend in the number of legal aid certificates granted increased by 18% in 2017 and this trend is continuing in the current year.  There is also evidence that the length and complexity of cases is contributing to the increased costs.</p><p> Another demand-led area of the Vote relates to asylum accommodation.  The number in accommodation is approximately 14% higher than this time last year.  The number of persons seeking international protection has increased significantly in the past 12 months, which has a direct impact on the numbers in accommodation.  Arising from the increased demand, it has been necessary to open six new accommodation centres providing 567 new bed spaces to date this year.  This contributes to additional budgetary costs. </p><p> An additional provision of &euro;2.4 million is being provided to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  This brings the total the total allocation to &euro;6.7 million for 2018 and the budget mainly relates to the payment of awards made by the tribunal.  The areas that have reduced the additional Exchequer funding required to &euro;8 million include surplus receipts in respect of immigration registration and visa fees of about &euro;7 million, underspends on payroll across a number of subheads, including Probation Service, &euro;2.5 million; Data Protection Commissioner, &euro;2.2 million; and Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, &euro;3 million.  This is mainly due to the delays in recruitment such that a full year staffing cost is not reflected in 2018. </p><p> There is also an underspend of &euro;5 million in the capital budget for the forensic science laboratory, after proposed capital carryover to 2019, pending the issue of an updated request for tender which is now expected to issue shortly with commencement of the main construction works in 2019.  Preparatory works on the site of some &euro;2 million were carried out during 2018. </p><p> The transformation programme in my Department is well under way with the internal teams and structures in place and an external support contract to be awarded to the successful bidder shortly.  </p><p> A technical Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 is required in respect of the courts Vote.  This is mainly to offset certain administrative costs by a projected surplus of &euro;600,000 in appropriations-in-aid arising from court fees.  It is also proposed that an underspend of &euro;2.5 million in capital will be carried forward under the capital carryover provisions in 2019 and utilised for the implementation of a number of key ICT and reform projects. </p><p> In conclusion, I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee and I am happy to address any queries or questions and listen to any observations the committee might have. </p></speech>

The Minister told us last year that one of the reasons a Supplementary Estimate was needed was Garda overtime because numbers were down due to of non-recruitment and that this year things were going to be much better because of all the new recruits.  The additional requirement we are now being asked to approve in respect of overtime is half what it was last year but it is still substantial.  Does the Minister think we might get to a point next year where there will not be a Supplementary Estimate for overtime?</p> <p>  Last April, he told us that ICT was a central component of Garda modernisation and renewal.  We have been told that &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million in additional funding under the capital programme, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.  The 2018 budget for ICT was &euro;40 million.  The briefing note informs us that some of the Supplementary Estimate was allocated to ICT under the heading "Admin non-pay" and underspend in the capital budget elsewhere in the Garda Vote has been relocated to ICT.  How much extra did it get and what was it spent on?</p> <p>  We know about all the problems with PULSE over the recent period.  The special rapporteur for children, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, devoted a section of the appendix in his section 12 report last he asked to be done was made available to the Garda.  Has that been done now?  Was any of the additional money reallocated to ICT spent on plugging the massive holes in PULSE, or what was it spent on?  Perhaps the Minister could take those few question first, before I move on to other sections.</p></speech>

The Deputy initially asked a question about the need for such a Supplementary Estimate on an annual basis.  I am keen to obviate the need for one towards year end and will work towards ensuring that these issues can be addressed during the year through the original moneys allocated.  This is an issue particularly for Garda overtime which I have discussed, at an early stage, with the new Garda Commissioner, regarding the financial position of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We agreed it is essential that value for money be achieved within the resources available and I acknowledge what the Garda Commissioner himself has said to this committee in that regard.</p> <p>  Overtime is an issue.  In 2013, provision for overtime was &euro;50 million; in 2014, it increased to &euro;56 million; in 2016, it was &euro;91 million; and it has exceeded &euro;100 million this year.  We are anxious to ensure that value for money is attained.  There is a continuing recruitment campaign, which will result in a net intake of new garda&iacute; of the order of 500 per annum, with approximately 300 retirements.  That will result in a scenario where the overtime requirement should not be as marked.  However, arrangements for Garda overtime is not an issue for which I, as Minister, have direct responsibility.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;3 million has been moved to ICT in the Supplementary Estimate.  We have &euro;60 million allocated to ICT for 2019.</p><p>That should allow for the increased investment, which will help ensure the implementation of the various projects under way.  For example, we expect a phased implementation of the mobility project, aiming to secure mobile access to Garda systems.  There is also the roll-out on a pilot basis of the investigations management system, which will standardise, digitise and further support the management of all investigations arising from a PULSE incident. </p></speech>

The Minister said he does not have any direct responsibility for overtime but he justified last year's Supplementary Estimate on the basis that it was because of overtime, because the numbers were down.  My question, which I do not believe was answered, related to whether we could be confident that next year's Estimate will not address massive amounts of money, tens of millions of euro, for overtime payments.  I posed the question in the context of this year's budget allocating an extra &euro;60 million for Garda pay but only &euro;6 million extra for Defence Forces pay.  If we have already allocated that in next year's budget, will we be given another Supplementary Estimate, again on overtime?  I do not believe that this or the issues about PULSE were answered.  Has the ICT money gone into PULSE?  I am not sure if I misheard that.  There is the question of correcting some of the issues, particularly those highlighted by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.</p></speech>

I repeat it by saying that my intention is to ensure that the Garda budget, including overtime, is sufficient for the Garda Commissioner to arrange his planning and the execution of his programme without the need for a Supplementary Estimate.  Let me stress again that the funding provided for Garda overtime next year is &euro;95 million, which is entirely consistent with the budgetary measures recently introduced by the Garda Commissioner, as he referred to specifically when he came before this committee.  While this is less than this year's total, it is, nonetheless, a very significant level of funding by international standards and by reference to recent years.</p> <p>  I can assure Deputy Clare Daly that the PULSE system is regularly updated.  It is continually enhanced with new applications to meet the operational needs.  Recent upgrades include further enhancements in integration and a new property and exhibit management system and to ensure that the new ICT strategy is executed in a way that obsolete elements of PULSE can be replaced. </p></speech>

However, I am surprised that the Minister would say that PULSE is regularly enhanced and upgraded as though this always happened.  Many of the big headline issues over problems with PULSE have been well flagged and were a consequence of PULSE not being regularly enhanced and upgraded and the need to specifically do that.  I am a little surprised by that.</p><p>On child sexual abuse and child protection, the Department's children first sectoral implementation plan this year states:</p><blockquote>Consideration is being given to a co-location model for the management of child sexual abuse cases, combining the new Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) and Tusla social workers.  Four DPSUs have been established as at February 2018 and they will be put in place in all remaining Divisions as soon as possible.</blockquote></speech>

This is an enormous problem for society.  The 2012 Garda Inspectorate report recommended the establishment of these agencies.  I note that money was reallocated from the capital budget to ICT in these Supplementary Estimates and in that context, there was an underspend of &euro;6 million in the capital building programme in particular.  I hope I can take it from that that there has not been any movement beyond consideration of the establishment of specialist co-located centres.  Will money be made available for them?  Will they be built?  Where did the underspend come from that we are allocating?  I hope that it was not at the expense of children.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, told us recently that she hoped to have the first pilot open in 2019.  That would suggest that money should already have been spent on them, so I am unsure why there has been an overspend.  Has funding been made available in 2019 for the expansion of these DPSUs to other divisions beyond the four?  Obviously the units are crucial, they were sought in Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report and by the Garda Inspectorate.  Both found a lack of specialised training and of a single point of contact for multi-agency working left huge and dangerous gaps in child protection.  This is beyond urgent.  When will more be established?  When can we expect to have these units in every division?  How much money has been given over to establish them in this year's budget?</p></speech>

Phase 1 is in respect of the Dublin metropolitan region west, Louth and Cork city.  It was the pilot to which the Deputy refers.  The assessment of that pilot is informing a further roll-out to each Garda division.  The objective is to have the service across each division by the end of next year.  There is sufficient funding allocated for that.  It is expected that by this time next year, each Garda division will have a protected services unit.</p></speech>

I have two other issues on the budget.  There is an expected underspend of &euro;4.27 million in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, subhead.  I find this worrying.  Last year we talked about an underspend in INIS and last year the Minister told us:</p><blockquote>The underspend in INIS relates to staff recruitment.  Having regard to the ongoing programme of recruitment for INIS, it is envisaged that this will correct itself and it will be rebalanced for 2018.</blockquote> <p>Sadly, given the information the Minister has provided today, it has not been rebalanced.  First, why has it not been rebalanced?  Second, we know there are enormous delays throughout the whole immigration system and people are finding it appallingly impossible to get appointments, Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, cards, visas and so on.  What is the position in terms of getting staff to plug the gaps?  Why is this still an issue one year on, when the Minister told us last year it was going to be sorted out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#D01400"><p>I acknowledge there were staffing challenges.  Staffing numbers will increase considerably when the processing of intra-EU flights begins, which is expected towards the end of next year.  In respect of the savings, &euro;3 million of this will be realised from the INIS pay budget and that is as a result of what was a slower than anticipated filling of improved vacancies.  Half of this saving relates to the Irish passenger information unit, which has been established and currently processes extra-EU flights.  We require primary legislation before the intra-EU flights can be included but staff numbers will increase considerably when that processing begins.  Again, I would expect that before the end of next year, albeit towards the end of next year</p> <p>  Efforts are being made to increase staffing levels throughout this year.  That has a particular focus of targeting additional resources at areas where there is a backlog, including in the International Protection Office.  I acknowledge we have an increase in staff of the order of 156 this year, although this has been partially offset by the departure of almost 100, or 98, to be precise.  That is as a result of increased mobility across the Civil Service and across the economy more generally, given that increased mobility is becoming more of a feature.  However, every effort is being made to recruit appropriate numbers of staff and, as I said, we have 156 this year.  In addition to savings on the pay side, a saving of in excess of &euro;1 million will be realised from the non-pay budget.</p> <p>  I am very conscious of what Deputy Clare Daly has said about the perception of inordinate delays.  We are keen to ensure the system operates in an effective manner but also in an efficient manner.</p></speech>

The Minister said it is as a result of increased mobility and that recruitment is a problem across the Department, across the service and across the economy.  That is not the full picture.  It is a specific and acute problem in this area, as has been highlighted in successive budgets.  The Minister told us last year that recruitment would sort this out and that is kind of his answer again this time. The problem is that, while we wait another year, there are families and individuals who are going through an incredibly tortuous immigration system.  In some cases, families are looking to join family members or visit friends, and all of that good stuff that is a very serious consideration for people in our society.  I do not think this is being addressed.  There needs to be a specific analysis of why we have had such a problem with recruitment in this particular area.  It is a particular problem and if we do not address it, the problems will continue.  I will flag it for now but I seriously hope we are not back at this next year.  In some instances, we are talking about very vulnerable people in our society.</p> <p>  With regard to prisons, funding for 2018 included provision for the financing of a step-down facility for women.  I have a problem with this in some ways in that it is a little paternalistic.  It is a practice that has been moved away from in other jurisdictions, although I fully accept it is better than incarceration.  The step-down facility has not been opened.  Has the money been spent?  What is the status of the project?  Has the Department gone back to the drawing board and looked at alternatives?  What is the story?</p></speech>

This year we have seen year-on-year growth of the order of 10% and I would expect that will continue in respect of both visas and registrations.  As well as the staffing challenge and the ongoing recruitment, I expect improvements in the throughput of cases, with ICT investment of the order of &euro;1.5 million.  I expect that will deal with some of Deputy Clare Daly's concerns but, again, as the Deputy has flagged this as something she will monitor closely next year, I assure her that so will I.  It is an issue on which I would be very keen to see a greater level of engagement.  I will be happy to keep the committee informed.</p> <p>  On the matter of the prisons Vote in respect of the step-down facility, matters are being advanced.  I do not have a date upon which the facility is expected to be completed but I know work is in the course of being carried out and that it is a very important component of our prisons programme.  I would be happy to give a timeframe for completion of that facility.  Some work has already been undertaken.</p></speech>

There was a surplus of &euro;1.8 million with regard to Garda compensation.  I come from County Louth where in recent years two garda&iacute; were murdered.  Day in, day out in the Border area a Garda leaving his or her home is not always guaranteed to come home.  Are many claims outstanding?  In recent months, I have been speaking to garda&iacute; who have made claims, but there seems to be no movement.  All of a sudden there is a surplus of &euro;1.8 million.  How much money was spent in 2018?  In the area I am from there is fuel laundering and smuggling, and almost every week a Garda car is rammed.  I am sure there are a lot of compensation claims, particularly from the Border areas.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly touched on the next issue I will raise.  A total of &euro;92 million has been allocated for capital expenditure next year.  Does the &euro;92 million include the surplus of &euro;3.5 million being carried over?  A total of &euro;3 million is being reallocated from capital expenditure to ICT.  I have mentioned a few times at committee meetings the conditions of some of the Garda stations in my area.  They do not have the facilities to deal with people, in particular to be able to see to people given the violence of recent years.  That &euro;3 million would go a long way to alleviate this problem.  I am sure the Minister is aware of incidences where people have come to Garda stations after being battered.  Why allocate &euro;3 million to ICT and not keep it where the money should be spent?</p> <p>  I am delighted to see Templemore has reopened.  Its closure was a major mistake.  There is nothing as good as seeing garda&iacute; patrolling and walking the beat.  It is great to have a Garda presence in an area.  The Minister said money has been spent on the accommodation used in the training college.  How many recruits does the Minister hope will come out of Templemore in 2018 and 2019?  A few million euro are left over because, although the Minister said he expected more garda&iacute; to retire in 2018, they do not seem to be retiring.  They seem to be staying on the job.</p></speech>

It is not an issue that is unique to Border areas.  It is an issue that is of concern not only to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but to everybody involved in the criminal justice system throughout the country.  A sum of &euro;15 million is available for the settlement of such claims.  I acknowledge there is something of a delay but one must factor into this the need for the ongoing exchange of documentation and up-to-date medical reports.  While there are many cases in the system, a considerable number of them are not ripe for settlement because there are outstanding issues.  In many cases, outstanding medical treatment is a feature that forms part and parcel of medical reports that must be furnished to ensure a timely settlement of the claim.  I am satisfied that the sum of &euro;15 million expected expenditure means the absence of funds is not an issue in facilitating settlement.  We hope that as many cases as possible will proceed to settlement having regard to the issues involved.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's question on Garda recruitment, I was very pleased in the recent budget to receive an appropriate level of funding to facilitate entry into the Garda College at Templemore of 800 recruits for next year.  As I said earlier, with a retirement complement in the order of 300, this will result in a net intake of new garda&iacute; of approximately 500.  They will be posted throughout the country in accordance with the priorities of the Garda Commissioner and his team.</p></speech>

Why is &euro;3 million being allocated to ICT rather than updating some of the Garda stations that badly need it?  As I keep telling the Minister, most Garda stations in the country are not capable of dealing with violence, especially violence against women.  I have mentioned a number of times to the Minister that we have problems.  I am not just picking Dundalk but there have been a few incidents there in recent years.  The Minister came to Dundalk to look at the Garda station there.  It is not fit for purpose because so much is crammed in there at present.</p> <p>  I also asked the Minister how many recruits will come out from Templemore in 2018.  It is fantastic that 800 will come out in 2019.  The Minister stated he expects 300 garda&iacute; to retire.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#E00400"><p>The &euro;92 million is in addition to the sum already mentioned.  It is not included.  With regard to the intake to Templemore, I repeat that next year it is anticipated there will be 800 recruits.  I look forward to attending Templemore tomorrow for the last of this year's four graduation ceremonies that will see by the end of the year a further 800 recruits for 2018.  There will be 800 for 2019.  Allowing for retirements in the order of 300, we have a net intake of approximately 500.</p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;3 million, I would have preferred to spend it on building but it was contingent on projects being advanced by the Office of Public Works.  Diverting this money to IT gives more scope for the building budget next year.  It will see a release of funds.  It is important that we continue to advance the ICT programme in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am pleased, in the context of the budget, to see a facility to allow increased scope for spending on ICT on the part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na next year.  This was an issue that was the subject matter of the address to the committee by the Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>

I also asked how much was paid out in 2018 and the Minister replied that &euro;15 million was available and &euro;1.8 million was surplus.  I presume &euro;13 million was paid out in compensation in 2018.  Many garda&iacute; in my area have contacted me with regard to their claims, some of which go back three, four or five years.  I cannot believe information is awaited from doctors.  Any Tom, Dick or Harry would find the information a lot quicker than in three or four years.  These people leave their homes in the morning.  I speak to the wives of garda&iacute;.  Two garda&iacute; were murdered in recent years and families are very concerned.  If a Garda is injured in the line of duty, he or she should be looked after.  It is not acceptable that some of these claims could go back five, six, seven or eight years.  Are many claims outstanding?  How much money has been paid in 2018 so far?</p></speech>

It is important that the profile of these claims is factored in.  Many of them are not ready for settlement, and those that are ready are in the course of being settled.  This year we have had an expenditure of almost &euro;15 million.  I will try to get the Deputy a breakdown of the profile of claims.  Many of the outstanding claims of some years standing mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick relate to cases that are not ready for settlement because of ongoing negotiations and the exchange of paperwork between the claimants and the State.  However, every effort is being made to ensure that the cases ready for settlement can form a basis for settlement.  As I said, a sum of &euro;15 million has been expended this year.</p></speech>

On the issue of training, Deputy Clare Daly raised training in respect of child protection.  Another issue that was raised during the year was the ability of garda&iacute; to give chase.  I do not believe the Department ever provided figures on how many garda&iacute; were qualified up to CBD, competency based driving, level 2, although I might be mistaken.  My recollection is that the information available was the Garda Representative Association's, GRA's, view that less than half of front-line garda&iacute; had that qualification.  Is additional money being provided for training in that area for the coming year?</p> <p>  Second, money is allocated for new technologies next year.  I presume, and hope, some of that is related to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland's recommendations.  Is the proposal for body cameras to be included in that or will that be advanced in 2019?</p> <p>  Third, there are substantial waiting times for civil legal aid and it is difficult to get that aid.  There is a marginal improvement on 2017 in that regard but can the Minister outline what he intends to do to address that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#F00300"><p>In respect of driver training, garda&iacute; undertake a wide variety of roles involving different skills sets and driving is one that has been the subject of commentary.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not required to have advanced driving skills but I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have introduced a five-level suite of CBD courses with each level specifically catering for a required knowledge-based skills set.  It involves a three-week course.  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner - and I believe this issue was mentioned in the course of his recent engagement with the committee - that 6,000 members are qualified to drive using blue lights and sirens having completed the standard driving course CBD level 2.  There are varying degrees of skills and the Garda authorities are anxious to ensure there is a greater level of the optional course available.  This is important in the context of the increased resourcing for the Garda fleet and the fact that over the current six-year period, a sum of &euro;46 million has been available for investment in that fleet.  If we are ensuring the Garda has a modern, up-to-date fleet of vehicles it is important that there would be appropriate driving skills.  The CBD courses at level 2 and higher are available and over the course of next year, there will be a greater level of concentration on this, with further development of this important skills training.</p> <p>  On the body cameras, I am keen that the Garda would adopt this new and advanced technology.  I have discussed the matter with the Garda Commissioner, and the issue was mentioned specifically in recent Garda reports.  I cannot say for certain if the Garda Commissioner's budget for next year will allow for the roll-out of body cameras.  I expect that over the next few years it will form the basis of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's plans but I cannot say that it will commence next year.</p> <p>  As regards civil legal aid, significant additional funding has been available to the Legal Aid Board in recent years and the total budget for next year will be in excess of &euro;40 million.  I acknowledge that there is an issue with waiting lists in some parts of the country and I accept what the Deputy said about improvements in some areas.  This is closely monitored.  Having regard to the fact that it is a demand-led scheme, every effort will be made to ensure that not only do we get value for money but also that waiting lists can be kept to a minimum.  The more than &euro;40 million for next year is a sizeable figure.</p></speech>

The first relates to an issue that arose on Question Time earlier.  A number of additional direct provision centres have been opened recently but it is difficult for people to travel from sites such as Moville, Kenmare and Lisdoonvarna to Dublin and back within a day.  Will the Minister elaborate on plans to relocate some of the facilities in Dublin to the centres?  In addition, are there plans to provide direct transport to services that cannot be moved such as an appeals tribunal hearing in Dublin, and will the Minister provide details on that?</p> <p>  Second, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland anticipates substantial time commitments for the Garda being transferred to other bodies, for example, the Courts Service in the case of the transportation of prisoners to court, as well as a number of other obligations.  Clearly that will create savings in time and money for the Garda but does this budget foresee any additional burdens on the Prison Service and the Courts Service arising from these organisations taking on responsibilities that were previously those of the Garda?</p> <p>  Third, a point that has been raised on a number of occasions by the National Women's Council of Ireland is the lack of contact centres for supervised access for family visitation and so forth.  Currently, there is funding from Tusla where there is a child protection issue, but where there is no such issue, there is no stream of funding or pilot scheme.</p><p>Some facilities and family resource centres have even done this off their own bat, but it means that where there is no child protection issue, it is very difficult for a judge in a family court to refer for supervised access in a contact centre of that kind.  It is different where there is a child protection issue involved.  Tusla would fund that.  Where there is not an issue, the option does not exist in practice unless they can finance it themselves, and these things are not cheap.  This is something that would be in the interests of the proper functioning of the family courts, in the interests of the family courts, and in the interests of these families.  Does the Department intend to do something to further that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#G00200"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to the distance of the direct provision centres from the capital city, and having regard to the fact that from time to time business should be transacted in a way that is sensitive to the needs of the persons, I am sympathetic to the point that the Deputy has made.  It is an issue that has been taken up by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  I would certainly like to see a greater level of flexibility and I would like to see a greater level of interaction on the part of officials on site.  I believe that we will be in a position to explore alternatives and opportunities on that matter.</p> <p>  With regard to the family law court funding and the relationship with the family resource centres, it is not something that would come under the Department of Justice and Equality.  Primarily it would come under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p></speech>

The Minister could put it onto the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but they are putting it back on the Minister's Department and they reckon that where there is a child protection issue, it is a matter for Tusla.  I do not mind particularly who it comes under as long as it is funded.  As far as the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is concerned, if there is no child protection issue involved, it is a matter for the Courts Service and therefore the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I will ask the question again.  The reference to family resource centres is because in some instances they have provided this service off their own bat.  Contact centres exist primarily for facilitating Tusla referred supervised access visits.  In any instances where there is a desire for a judge in a family court to direct for supervised access in circumstances other than where there is a child protection matter, Tusla is unwilling to fund it and Tusla believes it is a matter for the Courts Service if there is no child protection issue involved.  It is a decision of the court but the facilities and the funding do not exist to satisfy that direction.  I am very relaxed about who funds this but it is important.  They believe it is the Courts Service which funds it and maybe it is a matter for Tusla.  The discussion needs to be had between the two agencies.</p></speech>

It is an area where savings can be made, especially in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am anxious to ensure that if this imposes further spending obligations on the Prison Service, for example, then of course the funding could be met.  There is a legislative requirement too insofar as the criminal procedure Bill will allow for greater use of technology and video evidence, which would obviate the need for so many escorts.  Considerable savings in the overall budget can be made in this area.  I would be very happy to ensure that efficiencies can be forthcoming in a way that was not apparent in the past.  It would also free up garda&iacute; to engage in what might be regarded as more front-line duties.</p></speech>

The number in accommodation currently is 14% higher than at the end of 2017.  The Minister has also said increased costs arising from improvements in facilities generally, including implementation of the recommendations made in the McMahon report, have led to increased budgetary pressures.  Only recently, a worker in the centre in Ballaghaderreen contacted me and said the place was hell on earth.  Of late Deputy Clare Daly and I have been working with a number of refugees in direct provision centres.  From what we are being told, they seem to be soul-destroying places in which to live.  The Minister says improvements are being made.  Am I right in thinking most of the facilities are still being run by the private sector?  Who is making the improvements and how are they being managed?  Are private sector enterprises organising the improvements or does the State have a hand in making them?  Does it have any say in what is going on and what actually is being improved?  The Minister says the figures are going up, but what is being done to have fewer people in direct provision centres?  We know that there is a housing crisis, but we have had it for a long time.  Has any effort been made on the part of the State to actually build something proper for the people concerned or are we going to leave them and watch their numbers increase?</p></speech>

Of course, I have to say being in a direct provision centre is not compulsory.  Nobody is forced to stay in one.</p></speech>

I am really keen to ensure, as is the Government, that we will comply with our national and international obligations, but it is a challenge because the numbers are increasing.  There are in the order of 60 new entrants into the system every week.  I am very keen to ensure the State will provide the essential necessities of board and lodgings and shelter.  In that regard, I acknowledge the need for improvements and can safely say there have been improvements in recent times.  I acknowledge the contributions of people such as Mr. Justice McMahon who I met last week.  His independent report contained over 150 recommendations, many of which have been implemented.  Some have been partially implemented but are in the course of being implemented fully.  I want to continue to try to ensure applicants will have their needs met.  I acknowledge the improvements that have taken place during the course of the year, for example, providing for the right to work in certain circumstances and access to the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  </p> <p>  I do not want to underestimate the extent of the challenge.  I do not have a huge suite of alternatives in providing housing or more orthodox accommodation, if that is what the Deputy wishes to advert to.  I have an issue as far as accommodation provision is concerned.  The Reception and Integration Agency will shortly advertise again for appropriate accommodation which will be required to be of a certain standard.  There are in excess of 600 people in direct provision accommodation who have granted permission to remain in the State and who, in the normal course of events, might think of leaving it but who are are choosing not to do so.  Again, that represents an added challenge to the system.</p></speech>

That is because they have nowhere else to go.  The alternative is to live on the street, which is not very attractive.  Is there anyone monitoring conditions in the centres?  I know that it costs money to maintain them, but a lot of money is being handed to the private sector to run them.  By all accounts, from what we are being told, they are hovels.  Does the State actually monitor conditions in the accommodation the private entities are providing?</p> <p>  The Minister has made the point that we have international obligations to maintain.  Obviously, there are people coming into the country who are moving into direct provision centres.  The numbers are going up because so few are coming out of the centres.  The Minister can say they are choosing not to do so, but he cannot walk away from the fact that the Government has failed to deal with the housing crisis.  That is why 600 people who are free to walk out have nowhere else to go, apart from the street.  I think we all agree that direct provision centres leave a lot to be desired, but it also leaves a lot to be desired that the Government has done bugger all about actually trying to improve things or change the procedures through which the people concerned have to go.  Is there any forward thinking or plan to do things a little differently?</p></speech>

He used the word "hovel" in describing conditions in of some of the centres.  While I readily admit that the model of direct provision is not ideal, I do not have an immediate suite of alternatives.  What I can say is that there are minimum standards in the provision of accommodation and facilities in reception centres for applicants.  They most certainly cover the provision of education services nearby, healthcare services and labour market access, among other issues.  I acknowledge the independence of Mr. Justice McMahon in the work and duties he is undertaking.  Strenuous efforts are being made by those involved to fully comply with his recommendations.  It is an ongoing process.  It is expected that further expressions of interest in providing places will be sought between now and the end of the year.  Every effort is being made to ensure conditions meet our standards.  I very much regret the language used not only at this committee but also outside in which the most unfair analogies have been deployed.</p></speech>

The Minister indicated in his opening statement that because of increased demand, it has been necessary to open six new accommodation centres, providing 567 new bed spaces to date in 2018.  Will he identify the locations of the six new accommodation centres?  Is it the case that, for whatever reason, some subcontracting arrangement has been made in the securing of hotel accommodation across a number of hotel facilities that are not accommodation centres?  A significant number of asylum seekers are being accommodated in a range of hotels in different locations across the country but there has been no consultation with the host communities and very questionable consideration as to the suitability of the locations with respect to the needs and expectations of the asylum seekers.</p><p>The daily needs, hopes and expectations of asylum seekers for the future need to be properly evaluated but they do not appear to have been seriously considered according to some of the instances that have been flagged to me.  Can the Minister comment on that?  If six new accommodation centres have been designated, providing 567 new bed spaces to date this year, how many others are accommodated in non-accommodation centre facilities such as working hotels that may not have a 100% take-up of their capacity, which have been secured through a subcontracting arrangement?  I am anxious to know the full facts for same.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#K00200"><p>I reiterate that there is a challenge in respect of numbers on the basis that the total expected number for the end of the year will be approximately 3,500.  That presents us with a challenge.  As a result of the ongoing demand increase, six new accommodation centres opened this year providing 567 spaces.  Centres were opened in Lisdoonvarna, County Clare; County Westmeath; Monasterevin, County Kildare; Abbeyleix, County Laois, Mallow, County Cork; and Kenmare, County Kerry.  New centres are being planned to open in Moville, Donegal, and Wicklow.</p> <p>  The hotels to which the Chairman referred, other than the ones mentioned, to my knowledge would involve a form of temporary and emergency accommodation.  I do not have any knowledge of the subcontracting arrangement to which he referred.  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, has published calls for expressions of interest a number of times this year, having regard to the increased demands.  The response to such expressions involve a visit from members of the agency, and an assessment of all of the offers, the standards of accommodation and the ability to provide the type of services that are important in the areas of education, health and sports and recreation.  This is the manner of the challenge.  Having regard to the increase in numbers, I expect that there will be a further round of expressions of interest shortly.  There are minimum standards and they raise an element of local consultation, often with local public representatives.  Every effort is made to ensure comforts and basic requirements of those seeking international protection are fully met.  However, entry into the direct provision system, while not ideal in many circumstances, is not compulsory.</p></speech>

We could all agree that there is some toleration for short-stay needs but it is completely and wholly inappropriate for long stays.  I ask that, on behalf of the committee, that the Minister explores the issue that I have indicated.  The issue was brought to my attention and I have only recently received a response from him a to parliamentary question regarding one such instance.  The reply does not go beyond a limited provision of the information that I have sought.  I ask that the Minister checks because the reference to subcontracting suggests that the situation is getting worse rather than better.  The option is open to people who have no specific involvement and responsibilities to block-book rooms in hotels over specific periods.  Then we find that perhaps RIA is doing business with them but the point of contact is with these individuals.  I notice that all sorts of heads have nodded as I look from my left to right and right to left.  If it is not RIA, then the Minister can refer to his reply to my parliamentary question that he furnished only this week, or perhaps at the end of last week, check the details of that specific case and revert to me and advise on how that option is functioning when between 70 and 80 people are in a rural hotel with next to no facilities and no access to public transport.  That does not tick the box in terms of serious consideration of what those unfortunate people require.</p></speech>

If the Minister refers to my parliamentary question, he already has the information.  I ask him to relook at the reply and properly inform himself because I do not doubt that, he is not aware of what may be the methodology employed in this instance, but I want him to know and to be across it.  I would appreciate if he would reply to us because, bad and all as the situation has been throughout all of the years of direct provision, this has entered a whole new area, which only suggests a significant deterioration in standards.</p></speech>

The Minister listed six new places and one is in Monasterevin.  The facility in Monasterevin has existed for years.  Is there a new facility in Monasterevin?  Why did he mention Monasterevin?  The facility in Monasterevin has existed for a long period.  If it is the same facility, then it is not one of the six new centres.  If it is a new centre, that is grand.  The Minister's answers are unhelpful and lead to more questions.  I ask him to deal with my query because the facility in Monasterevin has existed for a long time.</p></speech>

I mentioned three centres that are in the course of preparation, with a view towards opening.  I have said that, furthermore, it is likely that there will be expressions of interest sought in respect of more new centres.</p> <p>  I am keen to ensure applications for international protection are dealt with in a more timely, effective and efficient way.  We reformed the system in 2015.  I acknowledge the fact that everybody seeking international protection has basic entitlements to legal advice and legal representation.  Oftentimes that legal representation entitles people to seek a number of avenues towards redress.  I refer, in particular, to the number of cases currently under judicial review.  I am keen to ensure that the delay in having these judicial reviews heard is minimised.  I am actively examining this with a view to ensuring that everybody who has a case before the courts, or has an application for consideration, can have that application dealt with in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

I was struck by the level of support by Deputies on Second Stage.  The Bill is a vital enhancement to current legislation.  It is important that the sentencing provisions for sexual offences be appropriate to the offence in question.  The Bill is of particular interest to me as I initially introduced a related Private Member&rsquo;s Bill setting out a presumptive minimum sentence for repeat sex offenders.  The Government agreed to take that proposal forward when I became Minister of State.  The Government is not proposing any amendments to the Bill.  I am interested to hear the views of Deputies on the proposals set out in the Bill.  I appreciate the support of Deputies, colleagues and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  I am happy to work with Deputies to address any concerns on the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 1 sought to insert new sections in the Bill to amend the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 in regard to the permissibility in court proceedings of adducing evidence or asking questions in cross-examination relating to the clothing worn by an alleged victim of rape or sexual assault.  It proposed that where an application had been made in advance on behalf of the accused to allow such questions to be asked or evidence adduced, the judge may permit that only where he or she was satisfied that it would be unfair to the accused to refuse.  It also proposed that the victim be entitled to be heard on the application and be legally represented during the hearing thereof.  The amendment was tabled in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  Although it bears my signature, I have been advised that the amendment cannot be allowed because it is not relevant to the provisions of the Bill as read a Second Time and must, therefore, be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 154(1).  I am not in a position to open the amendment to debate but I will allow Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to address it because he may be able to explore the possibility of revisiting it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Elements of it could be improved, but it deals with a matter which is the subject of significant public debate.  I will be seeking to re-enter it or a variation thereon on Report Stage.  I will appeal the mystifying decision to rule it out of order to the Ceann Comhairle.  The Bill addresses two discrete areas of criminal law sexual offences policy.  Under the reasoning employed to rule my amendment out of order, if the Bill only contained provisions on presumptive minimum sentencing and I presented an amendment in the form of the section of the Bill dealing with incest, that amendment would be ruled out of order.  The third Act set out in section 5 of the Bill is the same Act that amendment No. 1, dealing with the treatment of evidence in prosecutions for such offences, proposed to amend.</p><p>Sometimes entirely unrelated amendments are inserted but this is quite closely related to the debate.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that we are finding this out now.  My office had prepared much work to deal with and try to address his amendment.  I am mindful that last June the Minister said there would be a review of how rape cases were conducted in Ireland.  He gave us a commitment that there would be a package of proposals by the summer but it is November and we have nothing.  The Deputy's initiative, therefore, is important and I do not think the amendment is out of order.  He should write to the Ceann Comhairle because it is regrettable that we are finding out only now, given that our offices have done much work to prepare to deal with it.</p></speech>

Nobody can be under any doubt but that we have a massive problem in how our criminal justice system deals with sexual crime.  One need not be a genius to work that out, from the inconsistent sentencing and the traumatising of victims by putting them on trial to the pathetically low conviction rates, the broader cultural problems and so on.  We should take as a given that it is an appalling situation.</p><p>The prevention of sexual offences, at the least, is not as simple as long prison sentences.  It is far too complicated to be handled by what is deemed to be the bluntest instrument in the criminal justice arsenal, namely, mandatory or presumptive minimum sentences, to which I have a strong opposition based on evidence and on information that tells us as a society that they do not work and that while they might make a nice media headline to make it look like we are doing something to deal with these issues, none of the evidence supports that view.  </p><p>It was interesting that in our deliberations on child sex offenders and putting the sex offender risk assessment and management initiative on a statutory basis yesterday, we as a committee dealt with those issues sensitively in terms of our key goal and what it should be, which is protecting the public.  These matters can whip up a significant emotional response to sexual predators but, in fact, how society is to be protected is more complicated.  Sure enough, the headline on the front page of today's edition of the<i>Irish Daily Mail</i>is, &quot;Should parents be told where predators live?&quot;,  Although the article was not as bad, that was a frenzied headline.  It is about whipping up and inciting emotional responses and so on, and this measure is in the same vein.  It is an emotional response to a problem that will not address the problem that it seeks to identify and it uses an instrument that will be problematic.</p><p>I made some points on Second Stage that I will repeat.  In general, years of evidence show us that presumptive or mandatory minimum sentences for any crime are not an effective deterrent.  This is reflected in the fact that the Law Reform Commission report of 2013 on mandatory sentencing and the 2014 strategic review of penal policy made clear recommendations that no new presumptive sentencing schemes should be introduced.  Why do we commission these reports if we ignore what they say?  The strategic review of penal policy, in particular, was a cross-agency report which included victims' representative groups alongside agencies tasked with crime prevention, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and so on.  While deterrents might be an appealing concept in theory, which sounds good as a headline for the tabloid press, the empirical evidence to support the theory is not there.  In fact, there is evidence that sanctions in general provide some deterrent, but there is none to suggest that the more severe the penalty, the greater the deterrent than a less severe one.  That is a fact.  We are having a feel-good session to vent the legitimate horror of the public to these appalling crimes and to give the appearance that something is being done, but it will not do anything.  </p><p>We must bear in mind the issues with the Judicial Council Bill.  The Judiciary has cried out for years for sentencing guidelines but it is entirely wrong-headed to introduce mandatory minimums <i>ad hoc</i>in advance of that.  Sinn F&eacute;in did a deal with the Government over the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, and those sentencing guidelines will be given, but why are we doing this in advance of that?  Judicial guidelines are a different matter as they are carefully considered, data based and evidence driven.  They are far more effective and a useful tool for the Judiciary to decide appropriate sentencing.  There is a problem with judicial sentencing but it is addressed by the guidelines, not by a blunt instrument like this.  The problem with the Bill, in common with other presumptive minimum sentence legislation, is that it allows for judicial discretion in the handing-down of a sentence.  If the court is satisfied that it would be disproportionate to impose one of the minimum sentences laid out in the Bill, the court may deviate from it, but that begs the question as to what is the point of having the Bill at all, given that the judge may ignore it if he or she sees fit.  Why do we not allow the judge who is in possession of all the facts of the case make his or her decision on what sentence is appropriate, as is done now?  What is the point of this window dressing?  </p><p>Furthermore, the evidence tells us the judges will ignore this legislation because they ignored the last one.  The Criminal Justice Act 1999 introduced a ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for possession of drugs valued over &euro;13,000 but over the years, convictions under the mandatory minimum legislation attracted a ten-year sentence in less than 4% of all cases.  As Mr. Tom O'Malley said about minimum sentencing for drugs offences, &quot;One suspects ... that [this section] seldom impinges on day-to-day practice, save to the extent that courts will have regard to relevant previous convictions as a matter of course.&quot;</p><p>From my experience in respect of the Coroners (Amendment) Bill, I know what a torturous process it is to get the Department of Justice and Equality to deal with legislation.  The Judicial Council Bill, which is necessary and which might address some of the matters this Bill attempts to highlight, has been 20 years in the making and has been languishing in the Seanad since last November.  Prioritising this Bill, however, which will not have any effect on repeat offenders, deter anyone or have any effect on the actual sentences handed down for repeat sexual crime, is taking time away from Bills like the Judicial Council Bill that would make a difference.  It is terrible.</p><p>It is interesting that on Second Stage while talking about on repeat sex offenders the Minister did not once say the Bill would make them less likely to reoffend or that it would be a deterrent.  Rather, he stated:</p><blockquote>By putting these provisions in place the Government is recognising the impact of sexual offences, both on individual victims and on society as a whole.  It is ensuring that appropriate measures are available to the Judiciary at sentencing in order to ensure that these crimes can be dealt with both appropriately and effectively.</blockquote><p>With respect, members of the Judiciary already have measures available to them at sentencing to ensure the crimes are dealt with.  The Bill will not change that or give the Judiciary any new powers.  It will have exactly the same powers after this Bill is passed as it has now.  The civil servants clearly know this.  I do not get it.</p><p> These sections do not make sense.  The provisions are arbitrary, which is unbelievable.  They provide that if someone commits a sexual offence that carries a sentence of five years and then goes on to commit another sexual offence within ten years of conviction, a presumptive minimum sentence applies.  What if an offender rapes somebody ten years and five days after the first offence?  If all we are doing in this legislation is sending a signal, as the Minister of State said, what kind of signal does it send to a victim when we treat the violent assault she experienced less seriously than we would have treated it if it had happened ten days previously?  That is the import of this legislation.  What if we were talking about a child victim of sexual abuse whose abuser was convicted of abuse of another child 12 years previously?  According to the bizarre logic of this Bill, the abuse suffered by the current victim would be less serious than it would have been if the abuser had committed it when the victim was two years younger because in such circumstances, the abuse would have fallen within the scope of this Bill.  That is the reason we have judicial discretion and the reason it is preferred in these matters to the blunt instrument of legislation and the kind of arbitrary cut-off point we have here, which has no logic to it whatever.  It is crazy.</p><p> What message are we sending?  Let us be generous and imagine that the Bill is seeking to right the wrongs of the past when we saw shocking sentences handed down for the worst crimes.  I believe that is the motivation of the Minister in this scenario and that it is the effect of terrible wrongs done in the past when terrible sentences were handed down for very serious crimes.  However, in constructing a Bill which provides that the suspended proportions of the sentence are not counted in calculating the minimum for the second offence, the Minister is not fixing that problem either.  The message in this Bill to those who got away with a suspended or partly suspended sentence for a first offence because of what the Minister of State correctly described as the deep-seated problems in our judicial system in dealing with sexual crimes is that they will have the slate wiped clean.  Nothing is changing in that regard.  Thankfully, judicial discretion will still apply and the hope would be that a judge will bear this in mind when an offender who has committed an offence previously and got away with it lightly comes before the court.  The point is that this Bill will not fix that as it excludes such offenders from its provisions.  </p><p> We have to move away from a model of criminal justice legislation that is knee-jerk and emotional to one that is evidence led.  That is what we tried to do yesterday at the committee and we saw how the media misrepresented it to get a headline.  We all know that sex sells papers.  A system that hoovers up people and spits them out again and does not deal with the greater societal problems is not doing anybody a favour.  It is not doing society or the victims a favour and I believe it sends out a bad signal.  The signal I want to send out is that this legislation will not work, will not help, is not based on evidence and is a knee-jerk reaction, which is what we have to move away from.  That might be a difficult comment to make, and all the political parties may disagree with that, but it is right.</p><p> We are talking about caring for victims of sexual crime.  It was only recently that a second sexual abuse and violence, SAVI, report was sanctioned.  We have a huge problem with sexual violence in our society but the Government reduced the funding for the Rape Crisis Network by half.</p><p> The final point I will make is critical.  It was also made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, in response to the Private Members' Bill that gave rise to this legislation.  The IPRT stated that "mandatory sentencing regimes are proven to be ineffective in reducing crime, are extremely costly to the Exchequer, and divert resources and attention away from where they are most needed."  It also set out a number of tangible measures that could make a difference in respect of dealing with sexual violence in our society.  These were the restoration of funding to victim support services; investment in child protection services; investment in crime prevention, detection and prosecution; investment in prison treatment services and regimes; and well-resourced post-release supervision and monitoring in the community.  The Bill, which I am sure was well motivated, will not achieve anything and it would be wrong to put it on the Statute Book.</p></speech>

We heard yesterday that recidivism in this area was much lower than we had thought.  In 2013, the Irish Prison Service conducted a study on re-offending which found that the offence groups with the lowest rates of re-offending were homicide, at 26.2%, followed by sexual offences, at 28.2%.  While it is obvious that the rate of re-offending would be low in cases of homicide, the re-offending rate for a sexual offender is also low compared with a crime like burglary where the re-offending rate stands at 79.5%.  We are concerned that this legislation is based more on anecdotal evidence than empirical evidence.  It is more likely fuelled by a crime reporting element in the media who whip up a frenzy at every chance they get.  We do not often make positive statements about the media but I want to read a short quote from an article written by Michael Clifford this week.  He stated:</p><blockquote>... policy is supposed to be made on the basis of research and evidence which points towards a better way of doing things.  Among many politicians - and many elements of the media - research in this area is to be avoided in case it unearths inconvenient truths.</blockquote> <p>He was referring to this very subject.</p><p>I have asked some members of the legal profession what they think of mandatory sentencing and there is not much goodwill towards it.  When it was introduced about 20 years ago it was a knee-jerk reaction to a drug problem that was not resolved by this approach.  Instead, it helped to fill up the prisons and drive up the cost to the State of looking after people who had been carrying drugs of one form or another.  The Law Reform Commission has done some serious research on that issue and I want to highlight a couple of points it made in its report.  It noted the need to ensure that the provisions achieved their stated objectives and facilitated a reduction in crime.  They did not do so, however.  The report also stated that many of those coming before the courts were low-level drug users rather than high-level drug barons and that we end up throwing the foot soldiers in jail, rather than addressing the real problem.  It pointed out that the aims of deterrence, punishment and rehabilitation are not being met by this approach and that the principles of consistency and proportionality are being ignored by mandatory sentencing.</p><p>So-called experts or people who do research, and Mick Clifford touched on this in his article this week, are sometimes frowned upon but we ignore them at our peril.  Anyone who tuned in to yesterday's committee proceedings would have been incredibly impressed by the lady from Limerick University who has done a good deal of research in this area.</p><p>I certainly do not agree with the notion that we should ignore these people.</p></speech>

The sections set out presumptive minimum sentences for repeat sex offenders and form the key provision of this Bill, as provided for by the House on Second Stage.  In opposing these sections the Deputies are essentially opposed to the core principle of the Bill.  These provisions will apply only in very limited circumstances where serial offences have been committed.  If an offender has been convicted of serial sex offences and received a sentence of at least five years and goes on to commit another within a further ten years, the presumptive minimum sentence will apply.  Many sex offenders manage their own release from prison through the Probation Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and do not go on to commit further crime.  However, some do offend again and by putting in place these provisions, the Government recognises the impact of sexual offenders on individual victims and on society as a whole.  It ensures that appropriate measures are available for the Judiciary when sentencing, to ensure these crimes are dealt with efficiently and appropriately.</p> <p>  There are very few instances where a mandatory or minimum sentence is specified in legislation.  There is a mandatory sentence for murder, which is life imprisonment, and for a number of serious offences such as crimes involving drugs or firearms.  Using the minimum sentence is intended to reflect the impact on society as a whole.  These provisions have been proposed by the Government as a reflection of the impact of serious sexual offences on victims and to ensure the seriousness of these crimes is reflected in how judges can deal with them.  These laws address serious sex offences.  I have met victims and the purpose of bringing forward this legislation is based on the evidence put in front of me by these people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#O00400"><p>The Minister of State is not the first Independent Member to have an interest in justice legislation but, unlike the others, he has a good chance of getting agreement in certain areas.  The substantive part of the legislation is about amending the Punishment of Incest Act 1908.  After the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act was enacted last year we had the anomalous position whereby men convicted of incest were subject to a term of imprisonment of life but this did not apply in respect of women.  Sections 2 and 3 of this Bill propose to harmonise that situation.  The inappropriate sentence of life imprisonment has been reduced to ten years and it applies to both men and women so there is equality in that regard.</p> <p>  We are discussing the points made by Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly against sections 4 and 5 of the Bill, which are the Minister's part of the legislation.  Sentencing is an extremely complicated area and politicians sometimes try to simplify it by introducing legislation.  A recent serious offence, the kind which the Minister wants to see dealt with vigorously, involved a woman, Leona O'Callaghan, who gave up her anonymity.  She was a complainant in a serious crime in which she was the victim of rape and the person accused was convicted of her rape.  That person was already serving a 15-year sentence for raping another girl and, when his sentencing came up, the judge was well aware of this.  The judge gave him a sentence of 17 years' imprisonment, which is very lengthy, but the Minister is proposing that the judge impose a sentence of at least ten years.  My concern is that, when judges have to impose ten years, they start at that level but a person convicted of rape, such as in the case of Ms O'Callaghan, deserve a very lengthy sentence.  Along with other people, I believe Ms O'Callaghan was satisfied with the sentence handed out to her rapist but she was concerned over another area of sentencing law to which we do not give consideration here, namely, that his sentences will not run consecutively but concurrently.</p> <p>  I agree with much of what Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace said to the effect that mandatory sentencing is very arbitrary.  It takes away the discretion of a court.  We all assume judges impose light sentences but they do not.  They have imposed many serious sentences for rape and other serious sexual offences in recent times and we have to stop the story getting out that the courts do not treat sexual offences seriously.  People get very lengthy sentences for rape and serious sexual offences.</p> <p>  We supported this legislation on Second Stage, though I did not have an opportunity to speak, and I will support it here, though I have some concerns.  It has been through the Office of the Attorney General, and that fact gives me some concern.  I have two issues.  We have to be very careful not to identify sex offenders as completely separate from other criminal offenders.  The Oireachtas asserts its disapproval of criminal activity through the sentences we say should apply.  Murder gets a mandatory life sentence but no other crime does.  If a person is convicted of murder and commits another serious offence afterwards, we would not contemplate forcing them to serve a life sentence.  The Oireachtas has decided that there should be a set period of imprisonment for some offences, as set out in the Schedule, with five years for some offences and ten for others, and that is how we set out our disapproval of certain actions.  We need to be careful about this.  The Minister could also be asked why these provisions do not also apply to all other serious offences.</p> <p>  We also need proper sentencing guidelines.  The guidelines, in the form of decisions of the criminal section of the Court of Appeal, are there to be looked at and convicts can have an understanding of what type of sentence they will get from the courts by looking at the thresholds set by the Court of Appeal.  However, we would benefit from the courts setting out sentencing guidelines in respect of these and other offences so that there is greater clarity.  No matter what guidelines we have, or what amount of harmonisation we aim for, there are always going to be different circumstances.  The victim will be different, as will the accused, and their circumstances will vary.  By bringing in mandatory sentencing we are taking away from the ability of the court to exercise its discretion.</p> <p>  I will not support the calls to repeal these sections but the points merit further consideration.  The way to do it is by enacting the Judicial Council Bill and getting the judicial guidelines up and running.</p></speech>

I agree with much of what Deputy O'Callaghan outlined so I will be reasonably brief.</p> <p>  The first point I would like to make is about whether the Judiciary decides to follow legislation that contains provisions relating to minimum sentences.  I do not think that is a reason to oppose legislation.  It raises a question about the Judiciary choosing to ignore legislation that contains such provisions.  It does not raise a question as to whether there should be legislation of this sort.  That is part of a larger debate for another day.</p> <p>  I share many of the reservations about the bluntness or effectiveness of guidelines relating to minimum sentences.  Overall, the legislation is moving us in the right direction.  I agree with what the Minister is trying to do.  There is more benefit in going forward with it than in removing sections 4 and 5, which would effectively gut the legislation.</p> <p>  Essentially, when everything else is stripped out, what we have here is a difference in viewpoints that are genuinely held by different people about how to tackle something.  From what I understood from Deputy Clare Daly's contribution, I do not think she would be supportive of any type of guidelines regarding minimum sentences and would leave it all to a process of judicial decision based on general sentencing guidelines.  I worry about the impact on sentencing of these much called for and much wanted sentencing guidelines for the Judiciary.  The passing of legislation that provides for minimum sentences is one of the strongest sentencing guidelines the Judiciary could be given.  However, we are informed, on more than one occasion, that the Judiciary chooses to ignore such guidelines.  In that context, we could be faced here with a situation whereby a very nice set of sentencing guidelines are not followed.</p> <p>  I will support the Bill.  I will not be supporting the removal of sections 4 and 5.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#P00300"><p>To respond to that last point, it has been shown elsewhere that, where guidelines are in place, it is not simply that the judges read them.  There is transparency and knowledge about the sentences being handed down across the board.  There is more information about sentencing.  Judges are better educated and better equipped as to what the standards are and what is expected of them.  There is more transparency in standards as to what are considered mitigating and aggravating factors.  That would be valuable.  I look forward to the Judicial Council Bill proceeding to Committee Stage in the Seanad in the near future.  I think it will bring about a significant change in sentencing policy that is measured and that will make a real difference.</p> <p>  In terms of the provisions that are specifically opposed, I take on board many of the points that Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly made.  I do not support mandatory minimums.  I would draw a distinction for presumptive minimums because it preserves an element of judicial discretion that I think is important.  Judges have exercised that discretion in areas in which presumptive minimums exist.</p> <p>  On the face of it, and in the abstract, what has been outlined here seems a relatively fair approach to sentencing.  When somebody who commits a serious offence within a reasonable amount of time of committing another relevant offence that is also quite serious - making him or her a repeat offender - the kind of approach that is outlined is very often the approach that a judge would take.  Having said that, there are points that have been made which I will consider.  I will not oppose the sections at this point, but I will keep an open mind as matters progress.</p> <p>  I am very wary of mandatory minimum sentences.  Presumptive minimum sentences are somewhat different.  It takes two or three readings of the formula outlined here in order to properly understand exactly what is proposed.  Time will tell what effect that will have, but we will certainly have to keep an eye on it.</p> <p>  The most significant reservation I have is one that I would like the views of both Minister of State and the Minister for Justice and Equality on, and perhaps there will be an opportunity for that on Report Stage.  Where there is a clear indication for what the sentence for a second offence might be, there is a disincentive for the accused to plead guilty.  I am slightly concerned at that because if the prospective sentence for the second offence is already relatively clear, it seems possible that an accused's lawyers will suggest there is no point in pleading guilty.  If a guilty plea is not entered, that means the complainant will potentially be brought through a court process, and the trauma involved, that would otherwise be avoided.</p> <p>  I will not be opposing the section at this point, but I would like the Minister and the Minister of State to address the point I have made.  I will keep an open mind until Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-29a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018112900002#P00400"><p>There are a lot of points to which to respond.  The first is that I feel my contribution and that of Deputy Wallace are very much in defence of the Judiciary in some ways.  I think Deputy O'Callaghan's example showed very clearly that judges are more than capable of taking previous crimes into consideration when they are giving their sentencing decisions.  Although there have been some appalling judgments given in cases of sexual offences and other instances, Deputy O'Callaghan's point that things are slowly beginning to change is fair.  It is absolutely not happening quickly enough.  We know that rape is the least likely of all violent crimes to go to trial.  Some 85% of alleged rapes go unpunished.  The figures suggest that for every 100 women who allege they have been raped and who get to trial, only eight will get to see a judgment in their favour.</p> <p>  There are major problems.  Deputy Brophy stated that there is a complete difference between mandatory minimum sentencing and judicial guidelines.  Judicial guidelines are a process of research, evidence-based education of judges and all interested groups.  They have been proven to be incredibly effective in guiding judges in sentencing.  Time would be better spent on this area, which is evidence based and worthy, and the Judicial Council Bill, which would deal with rogue judges who come out with some wacky, appalling and awful judgments, although they are a minority, but there is nothing we can do now without that Bill.  Instead of the Department dealing with those issues which would achieve what the Minister wants to achieve, it has been spending time on this, which the Minister acknowledged will apply in very limited circumstances - I might even say probably none.</p> <p>  On that basis, one could ask why are we bothering to oppose it, if we believe it is going to have no impact.  I do not believe it will be applied, to be honest, but I think we have a responsibility to challenge it because it should not be on the Statute Book on that basis.  The reason I say it does not even do what it says on the tin is because the Bill specifically states that if a judge feels it is disproportionate to impose one of these presumptive minimum sentences, he or she can do what he or she likes.  Judges can do what they like now as well so nothing is changing.</p> <p>  I would like to see the logic of this formula.  I want to talk through what we are talking about here.  We are not only talking about rape and so on.  I appreciate that rape is not the only crime involved and that sexual assault, child sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault and incest are all covered too.  However, the Bill only deals with crimes that attract sentences of five years or more.</p><p>If a person committed an offence but received a sentence of less than five years - the offence could have been bad, given the sentencing in sexual offences cases - that person will not fall within the remit of the Bill.  They will be out of the equation to begin with.  I would like that logic to be explained to me.  The Bill states that where someone was convicted on indictment of an offence specified in the Schedule - rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and so on - and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least five years, the Bill will not apply.  If that person is subsequently convicted of another scheduled offence committed within ten years of the first conviction, a presumptive minimum sentence will apply to the second conviction.  The sentence for the second offence has to be at least three quarters of the maximum sentence that can be imposed for it.  If the maximum term is life imprisonment, the minimum sentence should be at least ten years.  The Bill states any suspended portion of a sentence will not apply.  If a person was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven years for an offence, three of which were suspended, and commits another offence, they will not fall within the remit of the Bill, as they will have only served four years of the sentence.  The matter is complicated.  Sentence lengths and the reasoning are arbitrary and I have not heard a reason for it.  It is unworkable.  If I was a judge trying to calculate the formulas, I would just do what I would anyway.  I would look at it and say the person did something before and should not get away with it this time and increase the sentence.  What are we doing?  I support the bits about incest, which are fine and on which we all agree.  The matter was supposed to have been cleared up earlier, but these bits should not have been added.  I know that the Minister of State is sincere in his motivation, but we should not be engaging in this process.  It is completely wrong.  </p><p> It is not me who is going on about mandatory sentencing but the Law Reform Commission in the strategic review of penal policy.  Every organisation that has looked at this issue has stated we should be moving away from specifying it in legislation.  We should give judges discretion in dealing with all of the nuances in addressing these issues.</p></speech>

We all agree that most judges have no problem in working within the legislation.  However, we should all remember that, as legislators, we have a serious responsibility.  We can have a huge impact on people's lives in what we do and say here and the legislation we draw up.  I am not sure drawing up legislation which appears to be at odds with much of the empirical data and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and the Department of Justice and Equality is the route we should be going down, as legislators.  I have often heard the Government tell us that the courts are independent in carrying out their functions and that sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the Judiciary.  Why would we impose presumptive minimum sentences in sexual offences cases?  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made a brilliant case for our argument, but the confidence and supply agreement does not allow him to vote with us.  He is in the courts on a regular basis and knows what is going on.  He made a strong argument in favour of letting the judge use his or her discretion.</p></speech>

Deputy Wallace is well aware that there is a clear separation of powers.  The courts have always had discretion in sentencing, in which we cannot interfere.  However, the Oireachtas can introduce laws to express its revulsion at repeat sex offenders.  The Government makes no apology for trying to protect citizens, in particular women and children, from repeat sex offenders who refuse to make any attempt to reform their behaviour.  I have noted what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said and we will come back to him on it.  The objective of the Bill is to deal with sex offenders.</p></speech>

I would like to be convinced that the Bill will help them.  I hope any legislation would help.  Perhaps they know how the formula will work because I cannot see any logic to it.  That was the question, although I do not doubt in any way the Minister of State's motivation.  I do not doubt that there are people who are hurting badly because the criminal justice system has failed them, but the point is we do not want to repeat it by bringing forward a bad law that will not help them when we should have been spending the time in considering judicial guidelines and establishing a judicial council to make improvements in some of these areas.  I am trying to understand the logic behind the formula which does not make any sense to me as loads of people are excluded.  Hardly anybody will be covered by it.  Therefore, I would like to know a little more about it.</p></speech>

The intention behind the provision is to target the more serious sexual offences.  That is why the minimum sentence of five years was put in place to specifically target serious rather than all sexual offences.  The additional provisions are to ensure it will apply to persons who have received a custodial sentence of five years.  That is why there is a discount if portions of sentences were suspended.</p></speech>
