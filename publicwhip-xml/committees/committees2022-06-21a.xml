    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#A00200"><p>Apologies have been received from Senator Fiona O'Loughlin.  Senator Malcolm Byrne is attending in her place.  I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment of the House, even when on silent mode.</p> <p>  The draft minutes of the meeting of 14 June have been circulated.  Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The first session will be with the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, Deputy Josepha Madigan.  The second session will be with F&oacute;rsa, the trade union, and a representative group of special needs assistants, SNAs.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and her officials to discuss the need for revised criteria for the qualifications of special needs assistants.</p><p>As for the format of the meeting, I will invite the Minister of State to make a brief opening statement for five minutes, which will be followed by questions from members.  Each member will have a five-minute slot because the Minister of State has to leave at noon.  We have about 55 minutes.  I ask members and the Minister of State to stick rigidly to their five-minute slots.  If I interject, it is because I want to give every member an opportunity to ask their questions.  As everyone will be aware, the committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.</p><p> I remind Members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  That applies to all members.</p><p> I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I remind members that I want to stick to the topic we are here to discuss, namely, the revised criteria for special needs assistants, because we only have 55 minutes and we have another group appearing before us later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to be here today.  I am accompanied by Ms Martina Mannion, assistant secretary for special education and inclusion; Mr. Mark Bohan, principal officer, external staff relations; and Ms Andrina Donovan, assistant principal officer, special education section.  The topic before the committee is the revised qualifications for special needs assistants.</p> <p>  I would like to acknowledge the important work and significant role of SNAs in schools in supporting some of the country&rsquo;s most vulnerable children.  The work and commitment of SNAs ensure that children with special educational needs, SEN, can attend school and participate in school life to the fullest possible extent.</p> <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I am committed to making a difference for students who have special educational needs as part of an inclusive education system.  Children with SEN should be supported to access the education system.  As a Government, we fully recognise the importance of an inclusive and all-embracing education system.  Never is it more important than in the case of children with special educational needs.  I fundamentally believe that our most vulnerable children in society must be prioritised.</p> <p>  Government policy on supporting children with special educational needs aims to ensure that all children with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.  Our policy is to provide for inclusive education and to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools.  Where pupils require more targeted interventions, special class or special school placements are also provided.</p> <p>  Working collaboratively with teachers and parents, SNAs ensure that children with special educational needs are educated alongside their peers in mainstream class settings, special classes and special schools.  Being able to access education in an inclusive way is key to living life to its fullest.  In doing so, we are helping these children to grow, develop and be as independent as possible.  The work of an SNA with children with special educational needs is key in this regard and we have evidence of this from the National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s, NCSE, comprehensive review, which was undertaken in 2018.</p> <p>  That review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs, including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at level 5 of the national qualifications framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The policy advice was considered by the Department.  It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.</p> <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs.  The contract was awarded, as the committee knows, to University College Dublin, UCD, school of education, in conjunction with the UCD school of nursing, midwifery and health systems.  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.</p><p>Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  This is a major educational initiative, which will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs who are crucial to the inclusion of students with additional care needs in the education system.  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.  The programme began in January 2021 recruiting the first cohort of 500 SNAs.  A second cohort of approximately 900 SNAs is currently completing the programme with recruitment under way for a third cohort to begin in September 2022.  That has a target recruitment of 1,000 SNAs.</p><p> This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs.  Part of that consideration will include accreditation.  Officials in my Department have recently received two reports of the programme from UCD, namely, a report of review on the SNA programme conducted by the teaching and learning committee in UCD school of education and an evaluation report.  The reports are under review and will inform our consideration on accreditation.</p><p> On the minimum qualification, I am aware of F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s campaign to have the minimum essential qualification for SNAs reviewed.  The Department has communicated to F&oacute;rsa that it is open to reviewing the position.  However, the Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.  There has been initial engagement between the Department and F&oacute;rsa on the matter and the issues of the scope and actual approach of the review are being considered by the Department.</p><p> This year, the Department of Education will spend over 25% of our total educational budget.  By the end of the year, there will be 19,169 SNAs, which is an increase of 81%.</p><p> I do not want to go too far over my time so I will conclude.  Providing support and training for SNAs is a major priority for me and the Department.  I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I call Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who is standing in for Deputy Conway-Walsh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#C00300"><p>For far too long, the SNA has been very much the poor relation in the education system and is often an afterthought.  The role was created almost 40 years ago and over that time, it has evolved enormously.  SNAs play a crucial role and I hope this hearing and the review of minimum qualifications can be a new beginning for them in the Irish education system.  The importance of the SNA role is underlined by the fact that every Deputy and Senator is inundated each year with queries from schools and parents who are unhappy at the allocation of SNAs for their school compared with what the children in the school needs.  It reflects the feeling among schools that they are under severe pressure.  They are unable to ensure that children can reach their fullest potential if they do not have an adequate allocation of SNAs.</p> <p>  Over the past four or five years, an additional 1,000 or 1,500 SNAs have been announced every year.  That is one element in the budget that I have welcomed.  However, I made the point to the Minister of State last week that the number announced is usually not realised.  Around 800 SNAs are usually recruited.  Part of the difficulty is that the job is not attractive enough for people to either enter as a career or stay in, despite how rewarding it is in several respects.  That is one issue we need to crack.</p> <p>  I note the comment in F&oacute;rsa's opening statement that the Minister of State with responsibility for special education had indicated to F&oacute;rsa, through her private secretary, that she was open to considering the accreditation of the UCD programme but that F&oacute;rsa had not been informed of any further developments.  The Minister of State commented on two reports she will review which will inform considerations on accreditation.  That seems to at least indicate an openness to the accreditation question, which I welcome.  Will the Minister of State like an opportunity to expand on that?  Is she keen to see accreditation happen?</p><p>What type of timescale does she have in mind for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  In terms of the allocation of SNAs generally, there was provision for an allocation of 1,165 in budget 2022.  For the information of the Deputy and the committee, 623 of those SNAs have so far been allocated, with the balance of 542 to be allocated by the end of the year.  That probably will be done through the exceptional review process and there will be posts for special schools and special classes.</p> <p>  On accreditation, as I said in my opening statement and as I have said before at this committee and in exchanges with the Deputy in the D&aacute;il Chamber, one of the first things we wanted to do, following the comprehensive review the NCSE did of the SNA scheme, was to make sure we put training in place, which we did.  I referred to the UCD course, in which 3,500 SNAs will take part.  As it is the first instance of this programme, it is important that we take time to review the course and its outcomes.  Part of the consideration under that review will be looking at accreditation of SNAs.</p> <p>  Two reports have come in to us, the first being the review of the SNA programme, which was conducted by the teaching and learning committee within the UCD school of education.  The second report was an evaluation based on data gathered from the first cohort of students who completed the programme.  The feedback of these SNAs who participated in the course is going to be extremely important.  Both reports are under review by officials at present and they will inform our consideration of accreditation.  It is important to say that.  It certainly is not something that is being ruled out, but there is a process to follow and we need to take it step by step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  She did not give a timescale for that process, which, time allowing, she might do later.  My second question relates to her position on minimum qualifications, which is that the review of the SNA contract, as part of the Building Momentum action plan, should be carried out and implemented first.  I have put it to her before that this is putting the cart before the horse.  Surely the contract should reflect the work that is being done at this time.  It would be most logical to have an independent review of the current qualifications, which could have been begun some time ago, in order to inform a future contract.  The Minister of State might be able to give us a timescale in this regard.  Surely the carrying out of a review of the SNA contract and its implementation could take two or three years.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#D00400"><p>I am going to call the next member because I am very conscious that the Minister of State has to leave by noon.  That was the agreement.  I will give her five minutes at the end to sum up and deal with any questions she has not answered.  She might take a note of those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#D00500"><p>If I may, Chairman, I will answer Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#D00600"><p>I ask the Minister of State to do so quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#D00700"><p>I will.  It would be impossible to remember all the questions.  I assure the Deputy that the review will be done this year.  Although we are looking for a review of the SNA contract first, there is a separate ongoing discussion with UCD.  We do not necessarily have to wait for agreement on the contract; there is a separate conversation going on with UCD around the minimum qualifications.  The ideal situation is to have the contract review first and then review the minimum entry qualifications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#D00800"><p>I thank the Minister of State and the witnesses for attending the meeting.  To echo Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point, while it is welcome that the accreditation issue is being addressed, the sooner it is resolved the better.  As the Minister of State will understand, if people are entering into a course or programme of study, they would like some certainty as to the nature of the award and recognition they will receive at the end of that process.  Can she give us any timeframe in this regard?  Is it fair to say that all of this could be completed within the next academic year or even for the students starting the next programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#E00100"><p>Clearly, I would like it done as expeditiously as possible.  It is my personal preference that there would be accreditation for SNAs.  The role they play in our schools is extremely important and, in fact, children's additional needs simply would not survive without their assistance.  To a certain extent, over the years they may have been undervalued and I want to change that, but there is a process that needs to be followed through.  We are looking actively at the two reports at present and part of that consideration is accreditation.  I hope it will be done as soon as possible.  As the Senator knows, it can be difficult to give definitive timelines but I hope it will be done as expeditiously as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#E00200"><p>I appreciate the Minister of State may not necessarily be able to get into the details of the SNA contract negotiations.  She referred to the specialised nature of the work and we all appreciate the work SNAs do.  As the Minister of State herself said, those students with special educational needs in many cases would not survive without the support of SNAs.  One thing that is important as part of any contract is that there is a requirement that the SNAs would specifically focus on the needs of those students with special educational needs and, in other words, that they are not seen as part of an overall staffing cohort within a school.  I ask for the Minister of State's view with regard to that specific provision within the contract, namely, that the focus must be on the students with special educational needs as opposed to more general duties within the school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#E00300"><p>That is a very pertinent point.  Clearly, children with the greatest level of needs need to be looked after, and that is the role of the SNA.  It is primarily at the discretion of the school management authority how it deploys the SNAs within the school, but it is vital they are used for that purpose and only that purpose.  It can be difficult to be prescriptive as to exactly the role of an SNA is.  There is a primary role around, for example, feeding and primary care issues like that, and then there are more secondary roles around classwork, tidying desks and that sort of thing, but it is important they are treated with they respect they deserve and that the teachers treat them in that manner.  They are recruited specifically to assist schools in providing the necessary non-teaching services to pupils with special educational needs.  The SNA contract does set out the duties but, as I said, there can be flexibility around that.  The most important thing is that the children's additional needs receive the support from the SNA and the SNA is not used for any purpose other than that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#E00400"><p>That is critical.  I am conscious that the new system of post allocation that is planned is based on current student needs and a range of criteria, and it is for a two to three-year period.  My question relates to new schools for rapidly-expanding schools where a significant number of new students are enrolled within the school at any one time.  This can be in areas of high population growth or where, for example, a significant number of Ukrainian students may be taken on board.  Will the Minister of State outline what provision will be made for schools in those circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#E00500"><p>Schools that are prioritised, particularly around the exceptional review, are developing schools and also schools that have no SNAs.  As the Senator knows, the allocations have not changed since 2019.  However, approximately 1,000 extra SNAs were given in 2020 and also an extra 1,000 in 2021.  The exceptional review process is there if a school feels it does not have sufficient allocation.</p> <p>  With regard to the Ukrainians, we now have 7,000 Ukrainian children in schools and part of the unified allocation under the special education teaching, SET, allocation will go towards assisting those children.  They can also avail of summer provision but it is important they are looked after in the same way.  We also have the regional education and language teams, REALT, which will assist with Ukrainian pupils as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#F00100"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is great to see the number of SNAs.  Will she comment on the increases in recent years?  In my local area of Roscommon and Galway the increase has had a huge impact.  Many more schools offer special needs classes and more children are being brought into the mainstream.  We are dealing with inclusion.  This is what all of this is about.  It is that we treat people in the same way, that they get the same access and that we have special supports in place.  SNAs provide us with the opportunity to be able to include children in our mainstream classes.  How many SNAs have we had in the past year or two?  I would also like information on the budgets.</p> <p>  As with so many roles in society, qualifications are a way to acknowledge the work and effort made by people.  The work of SNAs, as with healthcare assistants, can go unseen.  SNAs work with teachers in the classroom and with principals and they are integral part of a school.  They may be a new addition to the teaching staff in a school.  Many courses, particularly those provided by education and training boards, recognise prior learning.  SNAs should be acknowledged for the role they play.  Certain training programmes have been rolled out recently for SNAs.  Will the Minister of State comment on the training programmes in place to support the people in these roles to provide the best care they can and reach their potential?</p></speech>

Since 2011, there has been an increase of 81% in the number of SNAs.  By the end of the year we will have 19,169.  There are 15 special classes in Galway and five in Roscommon.  I have figures from 31 May.  We have 11,174.79 SNAs in mainstream education, 4,613.92 in special classes and 2,775 in special schools.  This gives an indication of how they are spread out among the various types of placements that we have.</p> <p>  We know what the minimum qualifications are.  People must have at least a pass in mathematics, Irish and English at junior certificate or equivalent.  This has not taken away from the calibre of the SNAs we have.  It is important to point this out.  The Senator mentioned the training programme.  The main training programme is in UCD.  We have invested &euro;2.54 million in it and 3,500 people will be trained.  There are six modules covering inclusive education for children, language, communication, autism, dealing with medical and complex needs, promoting positive behaviour and self-regulation.  There is also the professional development of the SNAs themselves.  We have promoted it primarily through the NCSE programme teams and social media.  We have a four-year contract with UCD.  It is the start of what we can do in this area.</p></speech>

It is very good to hear.  It is good to get a breakdown of the numbers.  Ballinasloe has a number of primary schools with special classes.  We also have one of the 120 special needs schools in the country.  It deals with children with severe to profound special needs.  It is crucial that we have these services.  There are more than 11,000 SNAs in mainstream classes and more than 4,500 in special classes.  This shows how crucial it is to have SNAs.  As the Minister of State said, we have 19,000 SNAs who deal with almost 16,000 children.  She has provided a breakdown of the service offered.</p><p>It is important we continue with the supports for our schools.  I refer especially to encouraging our schools to take on special classes and to ensure they have the resources and capacity to be able to take children in.  This has been a major issue.  I thank the Minister of State for the work she is doing with schools in ensuring there is capacity for children with special needs.</p></speech>

I congratulate F&oacute;rsa and the individual SNAs who have brought this conversation to the heart of the Houses of the Oireachtas today.  It shows the power of joining a union.  The tag line or slogan the SNAs are using is "Respect for SNAs".  In my work in this area over several years, the lack of respect has become clear to me.  I wish to link this back to the basic requirements.  In an individual school, for example, the teachers can often be called by their second names while the SNAs will be called by their first names.  This is a clear message to everybody in the school regarding who is deserving of more respect.  Everybody can see and hear that and the children, more effectively and profoundly, can see that.  It does not happen in every school, but it is the case in many schools.  It would be "Mr. Kehoe" or "Ms Dolan" and then "Bernie" or "Michael".  This sends a strong message.</p> <p>  SNAs have told me that the continuing professional development, CPD, available to teachers is not available to them.  We have had the conversation around the allocation for next year only being released on 31 May.  There are other issues in the system regarding July provision and the different rates of pay for doing the same job.  On a day-to-day basis as well, SNAs are tasked with doing some pretty menial jobs in the classroom or school setting.  Much of this is based, I believe, on the connection between the basic requirements to become an SNA and their status in the school and in the system.  Therefore, this situation does not just depend on how a teacher or a school treats SNAs.  It is about how the Department treats them.  Would the Minister of State accept there is a link between the day-to-day disrespect some SNAs have experienced and this minimum requirement issue?</p> <p>  To give the Minister of State time to answer my questions, my other query concerns whether she is in a position to say she wants to get the accreditation recognised and change the minimum requirements for SNAs, and that she will go through a process of a review.  Is it her stated objective, as the Minister of State, to change these things?  I ask this because there are two types of ministerial responses in my experience.  One type of response from a Minister or Minister of State is passive and states there is a review and he or she will see what happens after that.  The other type of response from a Minister or Minister of State, however, states the outcome he or she wants and, while he or she will listen to what the Department is saying, he or she fundamentally believes the accreditation needs to be recognised and the minimum requirements need to change.</p> <p>  Those are my two questions.  One was on the link between the minimum qualification requirements and the basic respect SNAs do or do not get.  The second concerned the Minister of State's personal conviction in this area.</p></speech>

I said I think SNAs should be accredited.  My personal view is important, but it is not everything either.  There is a process that must be followed.  As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in knows, the issue around the minimum requirements is already with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Department is engaging with that process.  Of course, if a Minister or Minister of State expresses a view, then it means that makes a difference.  It cannot, however, change everything.  I have, however, made it clear to the Department that I do think we must look at the minimum qualifications and at the issue of accreditation.  This is important.</p> <p>  Turning to the parity of esteem issue the Deputy spoke about, as he is aware, there is an industrial relations forum in place that provides a structured process to manage any industrial relations issues that arise in this sector.  That forum provides a dedicated channel for F&oacute;rsa to raise matters of interest or concern.  There is a sectoral aspect to this context, which the union has used in the past.  F&oacute;rsa has sought a range of additional leave for SNAs through the industrial relations mechanisms and the Department is engaging with the union on these claims as well.  The fact that one public service grade has access to certain leave or other conditions of employment, however, does not automatically mean other grades should.  Each claim is examined on its own merits and in the context of the impact on the system of increased leave in respect of cost.</p><p>The fact one particular public service grade has access to certain leave or other conditions of employment does not automatically mean other grades should.  Each claim is examined on its own merits and with regard to the impact on the system of increased leave and cost.</p><p> I get the point around the link, nonetheless, and having respect for special needs assistants.  I also get the point about them being called by their first name rather than their surnames.  Perhaps guidance could be given around that.  Circulars exist but perhaps they could be revisited so it could be emphasised with schools that there should be respect for SNAs at all times.  Neither principals nor staff would be in the position to look after the children with additional needs without the SNAs, who are an integral part of the process.  To a certain extent they are perhaps the most important part of looking after children with additional needs.</p></speech>

In preparing this morning, I had a look at Circular 30/14, which is still the central circular in terms of SNA allocation.  It speaks a little to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point, which is about the professionalisation of this workforce.  I do not for a second question the professionalism of any of the SNAs with whom I have worked, who were exemplary in their professionalism.  It is a question of how they are treated within schools and how their roles are understood.</p> <p>  I had a look at that circular from 2014, which cited a review from the then Department of Education and Skills that found the deployment of SNAs in schools had, in practice, moved away from the objectives originally envisaged, which were to provide for children's care needs, and had moved towards SNA involvement in behavioural, therapeutic, pedagogical, teaching and administrative duties.  I wonder if we held that review today would there be any less confusion around the roles that SNAs play within schools.</p> <p>  One of my concerns is that we are seeing expansion of SNA numbers, which is extremely welcome, but we saw a retrenchment in 2011.  That review was titled a value for money and policy review.  We found the number of SNAs being cut because we began to perhaps more strictly define or implement criteria under which SNAs were employed in schools.  One of the worries I have if we do not professionalise and put this career on a more solid professional footing is that we could lose people from our schools again.</p> <p>  I have reviewed some of the primary care needs.  I know members of F&oacute;rsa will come before the committee and SNAs will speak about what they do in schools.  To give a flavour of the work, I point out "administration of medicine".  What a huge responsibility that is to put on somebody.  There is also reference to assistance with toileting and general hygiene, including catheterisation.  I have had SNAs contact me who feel that is a big request for somebody who really does not enjoy a great deal of security, either in terms of tenure or pay and conditions.  There is also reference to assistance with moving and lifting children and the operation of hoists and equipment.  Some of the duties we ask SNAs to carry out in our schools carry huge responsibility and are very onerous.  There should be a reflection of that.</p> <p>  My time is short and I am using much of it.  Will the Minister of State tell me more about the course being run out of UCD?  Will she detail the intake and educational background of SNAs coming into the course.  F&oacute;rsa has provided some figures about the level of qualifications within the SNA workforce but there is no detail as to whether these are specifically education-based.  Who are the people turning up to this course?  How long is the programme?  We could compare or contrast different benchmarks in qualifications so where would I find myself with a course of this length?</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State provide some detail on what is included in the curriculum of the course?  When the SNAs emerge from this course what will they have been trained in?  Does this speak to our understanding of the role within schools?</p></speech>

It is a four-year contract.  Some 3,500 SNAs will take part in it.  The first cohort of 500 began in January 2021.  I understand approximately 460 of those met the programme requirements in full.  Some 900 have completed the programme since May of this year.  In September, another 1,000 will commence.  Recruitment has been under way to make sure we get that number of participants.

Those are the different modules they study.  Each module consists of six two-hour online sessions over a six-week period followed by two weeks of consolidation and tutorial support.  I understand there is one tutor for every 56 pupils who take part.  The feedback, particularly from the first cohort, is included in one of the reports the Department is considering <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>moving on to accreditation.  The feedback, overall, has been extremely positive.  I hope SNAs see it as being something positive for them and that we can do more of it into the future.</p></speech>

We should re-emphasise the establishment of the SNA has probably been one of the most significant political achievements of the past 25 years.  It shows the commitment of the political system to having an inclusive educational system.  What concerns me when I hear other committee colleagues talk of how SNAs may be undervalued within a school is not so much the treatment of the SNAs, although that is important, but it signifies the school in question undervalues the children with special needs.  That is why it is very important we introduce policies to ensure SNAs are treated equally and respectfully.</p> <p>  The committee is particularly interested in two issues and, in fairness, the Minister of State has dealt with them.  One is the system of accreditation and the other is the raising of the minimum essential qualifications for SNAs.  I am aware of the Minister of State's views but is there a hesitancy within the Department or elsewhere in government to the introduction of these measures, whether it is accreditation or the increase in essential qualifications, because it will necessarily or probably increase costs?  What is her honest assessment of that?</p></speech>

There is an SNA industrial relations forum.  The system and Departments will follow through on the normal processes available to them.  The Deputy is a lawyer and he understands due process sometimes that has to take place.  It provides a structured process to manage any industrial relations issues that arise in this particular sector.</p><p>It is a dedicated channel so that F&oacute;rsa and other can raise matters and issues of concern.  The Building Momentum agreement is currently in place and will be in existence until the end of 2022.  At this point, pay and workplace reform measures for public servants have been governed by a framework for many years. </p><p> I mentioned earlier that at one point F&oacute;rsa availed of sectoral bargaining.  That was to apply an increase of 1,100 current long-service increments in pay in order to raise the maximum pay level for an SNA.  There is not a reluctance on behalf of the Department.  It also knows my views on this.  It is my understanding that that review will be completed this year.  The preference is for the Department to review the SNA contract first, and then we will look at the minimum qualifications.  As well as this, separate conversations are happening with University College Dublin, UCD.  We hope to have that and the accreditation resolved as soon as possible.  </p></speech>

Their educational needs are enormously important.  They have made the Minister of State aware of the shortcomings of the stakeholders group and what needs to be done there.  It is my hope that we will have an agreement on the terms of reference for the inquiry this week.  Those children have been failed over and over again.</p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of accreditation with the Minister of State.  I would argue that no review is needed.  The fact that training is not accredited should be addressed immediately.  At the time, the decision to deliver the course through UCD struck me as an unusual approach.  I say this because to my understanding UCD as a university is not able to offer courses that will potentially lead to accreditation below a level 8.  UCD no doubt has the expertise to deliver the high-quality training programmes.  It had to deliver a lot in its development of the content of the course.  Yet, the delivery is a separate question.</p> <p>  I raised this issue with the Minister of State in the past, after the first intake of the SNAs onto the training course.  She informed me that a public procurement competition was held and that accreditation by the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, was not a requirement.  This strikes me as a substantial oversight.  This is despite the fact that one of the key recommendations in the 2018 review by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, was for the training programme to be introduced at a minimum of a level 5 on the national framework of qualifications.   The Government even addressed the issue of formal qualifications in the terms of reference of the review.  What was the rationale for not including accreditation in the procurement process that was won by UCD?  Is UCD able to offer accreditation at level 5 or level 6 that would be appropriate?  Does the Minister of State believe that this can be worked around, or is it necessary to deliver the training of SNAs in a different setting?  Has that been addressed?  Is the current agreement with UCD a barrier to providing the training where the accreditation could be offered?  There will be 1,000 SNAs going through the ten-month programme in September.  We need to look at all options that are available in order to attach an accreditation to the course before then.  Can the Minister of State let us know what exactly is being done?  </p></speech>

There was a public procurement competition.  The outcomes are being reviewed by the Department, with a view to seeing what further training programmes we can introduce.  It is important to emphasise that this is the first one that has ever been done in UCD.  That does not mean we cannot have training programmes in other universities or further and higher education venues.  The NCSE recommended that it be at level 5 of the national qualifications framework, which is what the training does.  The outcomes in terms of accreditation are being examined.  As I said, there is an ongoing conversation, which I do not want to jeopardise, with UCD around accreditation.  That is at an intense stage.</p></speech>

I refer to the role of the SNA in the move from primary into secondary school.  Does the responsibility change?  There is a major change in moving from a primary to a secondary school setting.  How does the qualification come into play in that regard?  What percentage of pupils retain their SNA when moving from primary to secondary school?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#L01700"><p>The qualifications do not change, in essence.  It is up to a school as to how to deploy a particular SNA allocation.  An SNA is not designated to a particular child; rather, he or she is designated to a particular class, whether a special or mainstream class, with a view to the children developing independent living skills.  The children in primary school can, understandably, become quite attached to their SNA.  That can happen in post-primary, and again that depends on the level of need of a child.  The role of an SNA is as important in post-primary as primary schools.  The qualification does not necessarily change.  Whether the same SNA works in a primary or post-primary school depends on his or her contract and whether he or she is moving or changing roles or was on a panel at some point.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State speak to that?  If it is the case, which I believe it is, that needs to be changed.</p></speech>

I refer to Circular 0030/2014 and Circular 0030/2020.  The scheme was put in place in the first instance for a minority of students, as the Deputy knows, who had significant care requirements and who would not be able to attend school without their SNA to give them additional support.  As I said in reply to the Chairman, it was with a view to developing independent living skills.  It was originally called a scheme.  That circular is still in place.  If the name was to change, a new circular would have to be drafted and sent to schools.  That is something that could be considered.  I am not sure whether people have an objection to the word "scheme".</p></speech>

She mentioned training in UCD and I wanted to follow up.  Her opening statement referred to 80 hours of teaching and written assessments.  That is a significant commitment.  Approximately 500 people have done the course to date and another 1,000 are starting in September.  Does the Minister of State believe this course could be rolled out to any other colleges around the country, if we are going to roll it out to the 19,000 SNAs?  Does she have any thoughts on that?</p></speech>

As I said in reply to Deputy Conway-Walsh, it is my view, not necessarily the Department's view, that since this is the first training programme in UCD, I do not see what barriers there would be to have that training programme for SNAs in other parts of the country in the future in different universities and higher and further education facilities.  As the Deputy said, this provides for 3,500 and there are 19,000.  However, some of them can avail of the UCD course, which is online.  Anyone, wherever they are located, can access it online.  Certainly if there was an appetite for a similar type of programme, now that the precedent and the model has been set, it is something that could be looked at.</p></speech>

It goes to security of tenure.  SNAs are often watching for care needs within their schools.  As the care need graduates to secondary school or beyond, the job within the primary school evaporates.  The Minister of State might comment on that.  There is a need to establish it as a profession.  It is about professionalism.  There is a need to give security for people working within schools.  They are not on a scheme.  They should be employees within a school and within our education system.  They should be able to plan a career that way.  Does the Minister have a view on that?</p></speech>

It is enshrined to a certain extent or set out in that circular, which is still appropriate, still exists and is still relevant and applicable.  It can be looked at again.  We have moved on a lot since that circular was originally issued.  I am open to listening to the views of SNAs themselves because they are the assistants.  If they feel that having that adjunct word, "scheme", is not appropriate for them, it is something that could be looked at.  All those issues can be raised through the industrial relations forum anyway, where there is an opportunity for F&oacute;rsa and other unions to discuss the issues they have for SNAs and represent them.  If there is an objection to that, it can certainly be looked at.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of the minimum essential qualifications required to become an SNA.</p><p>All occupations are to a great extent defined and perceived according to the qualifications required to enter that particular workforce.  The required essential qualification for SNAs has not been reviewed or changed since 1979.<br/><br/>Our delegation includes SNAs who are best placed to inform the committee of the reality of the work carried out by SNAs in our schools for thousands of students who rely on their SNA to complete their education alongside their friends and peers.  Once I have concluded this opening statement, the four SNAs before the committee can explain the reality of their daily working life in different school settings.  We hope this will provide a valuable insight for them into the complex role of our SNAs.<br/><br/>The development of the role of the SNA started in 1979 when the then Minister for Education, John Wilson, established the child care assistant scheme.  In 1979, the focus was on labour market activation, encouraging women to re-enter the workforce in a caring role to assist students with special educational needs in schools.  The entry requirements were set at three D-grade passes in the then junior certificate.  It is likely the qualification bar was set at this level to facilitate women entering the workforce, regardless of educational background or achievement.  While this initiative was the first tentative step along the developmental pathway our SNAs have followed since, it was perhaps unfortunate the initiative was described as a scheme.  In 2022, 43 years later, the categorisation of SNA support as a statutory scheme is still in place.  This description reflects the perceptions of some that our SNAs are carrying out menial work where no formal educational achievement is required to carry out the role.  It implies precarious employment, which is still a problem, and the use of the term is derogatory and demoralising for SNAs.<br/><br/>In the early years of the 21st century, we saw an unprecedented growth in the number of students with special educational needs in schools and an expansion in the number of SNAs. In 1999, there were 300 SNAs.  By 2004, that number had increased to 5,800 and in 2022, provision has been made for 19,000 SNA posts.  However, the minimum essential qualification has still not been reviewed, changed or modernised.<br/><br/>F&oacute;rsa is not alone in asking for a review of the qualification.  The list of stakeholders who believe the time has come to change the <i>status quo</i>includes management bodies, the Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, the teaching unions, the Second-Level Students' Union, a range of academic experts and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  All of us believe the role of the SNA has developed to the extent that a new qualification to enter the workforce is required.<br/><br/>It is important to examine the level of academic achievements of the existing SNA workforce before forming a firm opinion on future requirements.  In 2015, the National University of Ireland, Galway, published research on the training needs of special needs assistants in the Border, midland and western Region.  This research highlighted that from 2012 onwards, the NCSE had been calling for mandatory training for SNAs.  NUIG recommended that a level 7 qualification become mandatory for SNAs, leading to a level 8 qualification to be obtained during employment through career development.  It has announced that such a programme will continue to be available during the next academic year.  F&oacute;rsa recently surveyed more than 4,000 SNA members on the level of their educational qualifications.  Approximately 80% of respondents stated they held qualifications at Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 or above.<br/><br/>The NCSE's Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme, which was published in 2018, found that SNAs were in many instances expected to meet more complex needs without any training, qualifications or clinical oversight.  It recommended that this work, along with the desired greater focus on the provision of therapies and building social skills, should only be carried out by trained staff who had benefited from an educational programme set at least at QQI level 5.  In response to the NCSE review, the Department consulted F&oacute;rsa on the development of the first national SNA training programme.  The programme was delivered by the UCD school of education.  Despite the first cohort of 500 students completing the programme in February 2022, the course remains unaccredited.  SNAs completed this complex programme, consisting of 80 hours of teaching with written assessments, without any academic recognition of their achievements.<br/><br/>In April 2021, UCD published its preliminary evaluation report following completion of module 1 of the programme.  The data, which are set out in this opening statement, show that at the start of the programme 98% of students had already progressed beyond the minimum qualification stipulated by the Department of Education and that 62% of the students had already progressed to a level 6 QQI qualification or higher award.  Recently, the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion indicated to F&oacute;rsa she was open to considering the accreditation of the programme.  Until today, we had not been informed of further developments.  Perhaps we might discuss the Minister of State's comments later in the session.</p><p> In summary, the role of our SNAs should not be described as a scheme nor should they be described as a vocational workforce who do not need professional standards.  The role of the SNA is somewhat unique in that it covers both the health and educational needs of young people.  During the pandemic attempts were made to redeploy SNAs into the health sector.  It is abundantly clear the HSE would never agree to employ someone to carry out the range of complex duties required of an SNA in a healthcare setting when the limit of the required educational achievement is set at only 3 D level passes in the junior certificate.  The labour market implications of revising the qualification can be managed through a transition process lasting several years.  Conferring a more professional status would make the role of the SNA a more attractive career option.  </p><p> The committee will hear this afternoon that we have yet to find a school that does not state in an SNA job advertisement that a qualification at a level much higher than the minimum is not desirable.  The expectations of parents and students also matter.  The parents of a child with additional needs want their SNA to form a bond and to be empathetic and caring.  They also have an expectation that the SNA has appropriate education and training to meet the needs of their child.  Finally our request and pending claim with the Department is for an expert review of the minimum SNA qualification with agreed terms of reference and a commitment from the Minister to implement the recommendations.  SNAs have been waiting a long time to have their say.  They have been waiting for 43 years for proper recognition, which simply will not be achieved without a change to the minimum essential qualification.</p></speech>

Every day it can be vastly different and it always keeps us on our toes.  Over my time there I have worked with wonderful children who have additional needs but no matter what challenges some of the children may face, our school community is committed to keeping the needs of each child at the centre of all that we do.  That is why in our school, and in schools throughout the country, SNAs cater for much more than care needs on a day-to-day basis.  We help to carry out speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy programmes.  We help the children to access the curriculum through resources, games and extra help.  We help with programmes such as Literacy Lift Off, Edmark and many others.  We support children emotionally and partake in positive behaviour sports strategies.  We work together as a team to ensure that all our children receive an excellent education and to help them reach their full potential.  We can do this because we are supported by the school to partake in learning opportunities and accredited courses that will support and enhance the lives and education of those children with whom we work.  Our school is not unique.  SNAs throughout the country are highly skilled professionals but we need the Department of Education to recognise this and raise the entry qualifications so that this is the standard across all schools in Ireland because every child deserves to have access to professional and qualified staff.</p></speech>

As Mr. Pike said, 43 years ago the educational standard to become an SNA was three grade Ds at group or intermediate certificate level.  By the 1990s, a movement was growing towards having children with additional educational needs integrated into mainstream schools.  Today, there are 19,000 SNAs.  In 2018, there were about 930,000 students in primary and secondary schools, of whom one in four had an additional educational need.  This is 230,000 students.  We ask the Department to stop referring to these 19,000 employees as a "scheme" or to SNAs as "SNA resources".  We are an integral part of the education system.  Inclusion for all students is a stated ambition of the school inclusion model and we expect to grow in number and expertise in the years to come.  The range of conditions for which SNAs are employed is great and includes complex medical, physical, sensory, cognitive, social, communication, behavioural and neurological conditions.  Some of the conditions include autism, Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, diabetes, visual and auditory impairment, cystic fibrosis and fragile x.  The list goes on and it is not exhaustive.</p><p>For SNAs to provide the support that students in their care need then they must have a comprehensive understanding of complex conditions.  For the successful inclusion of these students, they must have the necessary skills to support them.</p><p> SNAs in many schools are very far from being respected.  This is largely due to the perception that they do not have a high level of education.  It is entirely unacceptable for the Department of Education to persist with this assertion that the current academic standard of three Grade Ds is sufficient to work as an SNA.  It is nothing short of insulting to the students that the Department deems it unnecessary for SNAs to have a qualification that reflects the level of care and support required for these students to succeed in school.  The Department is fully aware of this and allows a situation to prevail where it does not have to acknowledge the academic standards required to meet the needs of the students with additional educational needs while at the same time knowing that schools will only employ SNAs who have relevant qualifications.  This is a very disingenuous position for the Department to hold. </p><p> It is long past time for the educational standards to be revised upwards.  SNAs have always known this.  Teachers and principals know this too.  Parents and students deserve it.  Finally, the Department also knows it and has done for a long time.  The Minister for Education, and the Minister of State who has responsibility for special education and inclusion, both need to do the right thing.  Raise the minimum qualification and show SNAs the respect that they have deserved for so long. </p></speech>

I am based in a nurture room, which was introduced in September 2021.  The nurture room is a short-term focused intervention for children with particularl social, emotional and behavioural difficulties.  We address the children's needs and prevent exclusion from the classroom, and any distress caused by them not having the coping skills through no fault of their own.  I work alongside the teacher and assist her with modelling self-regulation skills, co-operative play and promoting self-esteem.</p> <p>  The zones of regulation are used daily in our room and they are an important tool for all children.  From time to time all of us find it hard to manage strong feelings such as worry, anger, restlessness, fear or tiredness, which stops us from getting on with our day.  My daily routine differs every day and depends on the zone the child is in when they arrive.  The nurture room is a safe place where children are given the freedom to express themselves.  I celebrate their achievements every day no matter how small that might seem.  When someone tells us that we have done a good job then that makes us feel positive about ourselves, which is what nurture is all about.</p> <p>  To help the children self-regulate I start the day with Braincalm.  I do Braincalm Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. with three groups of three pupils who are aged between seven years and ten years.  The Braincalm programme is for children with sensory issues, ASD, ADHD, anxiety and behavioural issues.  We complete 20 minutes a day of a variety of therapy-based and fun activities to help children become calm, organise their brains and return to their classroom calm, focused, alert and ready to learn.  Although Braincalm is not a replacement for therapy it gives parents and school staff a programme to help the child while he or she is on the waiting for therapy or as an add-on to therapy received outside the school.</p></speech>

My day begins with bringing children into the room for Aistear and free play.  After speaking to the parents at the school gate I am aware of issues that might trigger their children during the day such as poor sleep or behaviours.  After this, we bring the children to the sensory room.  Depending on the children, my colleagues and I may offer to separate the best care possible to meet the high needs of the children.  We meet back in the classroom and do one-to-one work with them, which varies depending on the individual needs that range between general assistance to accessing the curriculum.  We then move to the occupational therapy room where the children do a variety of exercises.  We break for lunch and the first period of assisting with yard duty.  The SNAs then attend to the care needs of the children before we start our next activities, which in general are sensory play and music.  We break for lunch and the second period of assisting with yard duty before home time.</p> <p>  I wish to mention that this is a very brief synopsis of my regular day in so much as there is a regular day.  Given the complex needs of the children with whom we work, it should be noted that the work which I and the others undertake is very much dependent on what the children need at any given time throughout the day.  The work and duties undertaken by special needs assistants have drifted far beyond the needs outlined in circular 30/2014, the contract of employment and the other circulars that govern these jobs.  There is an assumption, and a fostered idea, by the Department of Education re the low educational qualification for entry into our occupation.  Please note that it is not classed as a profession, which is a situation that belies the complexity, skills and training needed to do our jobs.</p></speech>

They deserve huge credit for the campaign they have run that has brought them this far.  Most people in this room and many of our colleagues have been contacted by SNAs in their local areas too.  The principles behind the campaign have been very well articulated.  I think the committee is united in trying to bring our pressure to bear to try and get this moved along.  It has been well articulated over the past hour.  From when the role began the scale, scope and complexity of what an SNA has to do has increased maybe 20-fold or however much you care to state.  For instance, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh gave the example of administering medical assistance.  These are very significant roles.</p> <p>  I will direct my first question to Mr. Pike and Ms O'Mahony but also to anyone else who wants to take it.  It may be a bit boring but process cuts to the heart of the matter.  The Minister and the Minister of State say that we must do the review of the contract first.  We must implement that.  How long will it take not only to review but also to implement?  Will people explain in their own words why that is the wrong approach for the review to take place before a review of the qualifications?  </p></speech>

We hope that work will start shortly.  It is well behind schedule.  It will not be easy because you cannot negotiate a national contract for a staff group in the public sector without specifying what qualification you need to do the job.  In our list of things that need to be negotiated in and around the contract, no. 1 is what qualification a person needs to do the job.  If the Department of Education is taking a view that it will not discuss the qualification until after the contract talks are over then I am sorry to inform them that the contract talks will include a negotiation on the qualification or otherwise those negotiations will fail and there will be a failure to agree.</p></speech>

If I looked back to how long it took to negotiate the agreement on school secretaries, we could be back here in a year's time and talks about a new SNA contract could still be ongoing.  I could be wrong and it could take six months but I do not see it as being a quick process.  </p></speech>

Generally the level of responsibility is dictated on the level of competency you need to do the job and everything else stems from that.  That is how you design a contract of any type of role.  It really is putting the cart before the horse.  What we seek is to reflect the current practice that is already in existence.  There is not a school in the country that does not seek to hire the best qualified staff that they can in a recruitment process, and no one could fault them.  They are doing that year in year out at levels far above the current minimum qualification.</p><p>This needs to be tied up and rectified.  Then we can look at issues such as a contract review.  There is no need for it to be linked to a contract review.  It is a separate stand-alone issue.  We are looking to reflect current practice with employers at present.</p></speech>

Something I find strange from an educational perspective is commencing a course without formal accreditation being sorted in advance.  Any learner entering a course should know the level of accreditation.  I am entirely in agreement with the witnesses on many of their concerns and I hope this matter is expedited.  I share the concerns of colleagues regarding the treatment of SNAs.  No SNA deserves to be mistreated.  The witnesses heard the discussion earlier.  I believe the overwhelming majority of schools treat their SNAs with respect.  To refer to my earlier question, there should be a specific focus on the special educational needs of the child or young person.  If possible, will the witnesses quantify the proportion of schools they believe may not treat SNAs with respect?  Are there very specific concerns they have about the way they are treated by certain schools that they hope will be addressed in the contractual negotiations?</p></speech>

This gives rise to a lot of discontent and a lot of menial work being allocated.  We have a situation where half of schools have realised they need to be a little more respectful towards SNAs but we still have a job to do as a union to persuade the other half of the sector to follow suit.  We do not run a survey because if we did, the number of people complaining that they are not respected would be pretty high.  Going on the complaints that come through to the union office, we are looking at approximately half and half.  Perhaps that is being a bit optimistic.  The specific focus we want SNAs to have is on students with additional educational needs and the complex needs the committee has heard about.  When we hear the Department and the NCSE mention that SNAs could be an all-school resource we worry that the message going to principals means they could be allocated work that has nothing to do with meeting the needs of students with additional educational needs.  Ms O'Sullivan will speak about the UCD course and accreditation.</p></speech>

It was a ten-month course with five modules, as the Minister of State outlined earlier.  What she did not speak about were the statistics from the first 500.  According to a survey conducted by UCD, 2.14% of the 500 SNAs are working with the minimum educational requirement.  This represents those who attained three grade Ds in the junior certificate.  A total of 60% work with QQI levels 5 and 6.  SNAs are highly skilled professional workers.  It quite insulting to suggest that a course run in conjunction with the Department of Education would not be accredited.  The 500 SNAs who started the course believed it would be accredited.  Having graduated from UCD in February, it is simply not good enough to find it is not accredited.  A total of &euro;2.4 million was invested by the Department in the course.  It is free for the students and we have heard time and again from the Department how grateful we should be.  We are grateful for the training but it most certainly was not free from the Department.</p> <p>  In its review, the NCSE recommended that a training programme be introduced at level 5 on the national framework of qualifications.</p><p>Therefore, to think of UCD having to run a course with no formal accreditation undermines the recommendation.  A UCD communications office spokesperson stated that the programme is being delivered at a level of contents, assessment, and governance that will meet accreditation criteria of the programme, if subjected to such criteria.  UCD has been very supportive.  Many Deputies and Senators have been very supportive of the cause.  It was great to hear the Minister say it in April, but we are very aware that we are going towards the end of June and there is no end in sight in relation to the accreditation.  Some 500 SNAs have completed and graduated.  The next cohort will graduate in October.  Before anyone else gets onto that course, we need to see formal accreditation given.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate what the witnesses have outlined in that, in other words, we need sort of a minimum qualification for SNAs in our sector.  You would see something similar even in the healthcare assistant side, where the level 5 Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, would be very important.</p> <p>  Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan mentioned that she just did the course.  She is an SNA and she did the first course through UCD.  There seems to be a certificate that is provided through the course.

Does Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan have any feedback?  I am just curious about the course itself.  My earlier questions were around rolling this out, perhaps across other colleges in the country.  I am curious about the online elements of that.  Would there be any sort of idea of a hybrid type course? </p> <p>  I thank Mr. Pike and Ms O&rsquo;Mahony for their submission and opening statement.  I would know many SNAs and I have family members who work as SNAs as well.  I have always seen, and what I have heard anecdotally, that it is very much a team environment.  From what I have heard, you would very much see that teachers are working with SNAs.  To be honest, everybody wants to have a classroom where children are working to their potential and are being looked after, especially if they have significant care needs.  Would Mr. Pike or Ms O&rsquo;Mahony have any guidance in terms of SNAs working within particular schools?  Do SNAs engage with the school board or in staff meetings?  Are there representatives of SNAs on these groups as well?  It is just that this cohort has now grown larger.  As we heard from the Minister of State, there has been an 80% increase and more than 25% of the Department of Education&rsquo;s budget has been spent on children with special needs this year.  Can Mr. Pike or Ms O'Mahony give an example of how they would see it working in a school?</p></speech>

In a good school, SNAs are involved in staff meetings and are seen as part of a team wherever students with additional educational needs are studying.  It can often be a multidisciplinary team because of the inputs necessary from allied health professions and others.  In a good school, there is very much a team ethos where everyone is valued.  However, in a school that is perhaps not quite so good, that is where we find the terms and conditions for SNAs militate against the SNA being respected, included or considered as a part of the team.  That is part of the problem with the qualification.  In the school, the teachers are all educated to a minimum of level 8, yet there is a huge disparity in the educational requirement for SNAs.  Historically, from the start of the childcare assistants scheme, SNAs were seen as unskilled labour.  That is still a problem that we see in a school that is not as good.</p></speech>

I suppose the training that has been rolled out would be a way for all SNAs across the board to sort of get that additional experience perhaps and some of the elements and modules that were mentioned last time as well just around the needs.  Some of the people here have identified all of the work that is done around healthcare needs and professional development.</p></speech>

To be honest, the course was world-class.  Out of all the courses I have undertaken during my career as an SNA, I put UCD's course above any of the others.  Another point is that the last module we did was the professional development of SNAs, which was ironic because during all the time we were studying on the course, for some ten months, we were still not being recognised as students on a course that was worthy of a QQI award.  Therefore, I certainly recommend the course, but based on the Minister or Minister of State finally accrediting it and giving the course the recognition it deserves.  I cannot thank UCD enough for providing it.  I have never heard any SNAs speak badly of the course.  It is needed, and needed across every school and for every SNA, but, again, we can only recommend that SNAs do this course if it gets accredited and receives the recognition it deserves.</p></speech>

This is to their credit.</p> <p>  The opening remarks placed great emphasis on the classification of the SNA role as being part of a scheme.  I had previous conversations with Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan in meetings about this issue.  It is front and centre as part of the problem.  While the Minister of State gave a level of comfort regarding the work that is ongoing to deal with the essential accreditation we spoke about and the basic requirements, I was a bit taken aback by her apparent surprise that the classification of the role as a scheme was problematic.  She said that it was dealt with by circular, as if circulars cannot change, evolve or be reissued.  Therefore, the emphasis the SNAs have placed on this scheme, when compared with the response from the Minister of State, is the biggest thing I took away from this session.  </p> <p>  I ask Mr. Pike and Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan to flesh out the issue concerning the scheme and its classification.  Regarding my comments around the late date for the allocation of SNAs, namely, 31 May, the issue of CPD that teachers get but SNAs do not, July provision, the different rates of pay and the individual stories in schools, that we also know about, do all these issues lead back to the lack of certainty found in these roles and to the lack of respect for them?  It is not difficult to ask a school to respect an SNA, but it is hypocritical of the Department to demand respect for SNAs if it is not respecting the people in these roles itself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andy Pike" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#W00600"><p>The problem with the description or designation of the service provided to the students as a statutory scheme is that it implies and signifies impermanence.  This is the case for the students because over the years the scheme has resulted in SNA supports being withdrawn from students.  The parents have appealed, but the exceptional review process has a success rate that is very low in respect of the overall number of appeals submitted.  The impermanence for the SNAs themselves stems from this being insecure and precarious employment.  The people in these roles do not know from year to year if they will have a job.  We were hoping that a new front-loading approach, which would give at least three years of certainty, would be introduced, with negotiation and agreement, at some stage, and potentially this year.  Apparently, this cannot now happen and SNAs are therefore still in a quandary.  They are part of a scheme where resources can be provided and then taken away.  Where an SNA post is lost, there is no redeployment mechanism.  There is a redundancy scheme, but there is no right to keep a post.  Almost uniquely among our 350,000 public servants, therefore, we have this group of SNAs in insecure, impermanent and precarious employment.</p> <p>  I turn now to the July provision and the interesting issues the Deputy raised in this regard.</p><p>I will hand over presently to my colleague, Ms O'Mahony, to speak further on this.  The late allocations should not be happening.  We should not be waiting until 31 May for 18,000 SNAs to find out whether they have  job.  That is a very disrespectful way to treat not just a few people but the entire workforce.  We must find a better way of handling it next year.  It would be different if there were a redeployment scheme whereby someone who is losing a post in a school would have the certainty that as more posts are added to the system, there will be a job for him or her not too far away.  We do not have that, however, and it is one of the reasons the current allocation model is so unsatisfactory.</p></speech>

When the pandemic hit, SNAs were allowed to go into pupils' homes to work with them.  However, we were told they were doing it for less than half the standard rate.  This is not all about the money by any means.  It is about SNAs doing the exact same job and parents all over the country finding it hard to get either teachers or SNAs.  I do not think the July provision is working as a programme.</p></speech>

The role has changed significantly in terms of what we do and the types of complex needs we are now seeing.  When it comes to qualifications, there is a slight academic snobbery from the Department of Education because it has set the bar so low in terms of the minimum educational requirement for people to work in the SNA role.  We see that time and again.  Non-teaching staff in schools, including secretaries and SNAs, are treated as somehow less than in comparison with teachers.  We deserve the same respect as our teaching colleagues and principals.</p> <p>  Regarding the insecure nature of the role, one example of this is having to wait until 31 May to find out whether we have a job.  We have all heard about SNAs who have had to wait until that date before they can move to the next level in their lives, whether that is signing for a mortgage, planning a wedding or deciding to have a family.  It just cannot continue like that.  We are going to drive people out of the profession, which is what the role of SNA is.  It is a profession we love and want to protect.  We want to ensure the role gets better for SNAs across the country.</p></speech>

In fact, it is not; it is a job that is done under a scheme.  How can people plan for a mortgage, starting a family, developing career pathways or anything like that when they are on a scheme rather than being enrolled in a profession?</p> <p>  I spent 15 years in a classroom and for approximately ten of those years, I had an SNA in the room with me.  I will be killed stone dead if I do not remember all their names.  There was Vicky, Kathleen, Sandra, Fionnuala, Ciara and Eileen but I am sure I have forgotten somebody.  The very first year I taught after becoming qualified, I had an SNA in my classroom, but I was given no direction or education in terms of how to work with that person.  As far as I was concerned, I had another educator inside the classroom but there was no guidance given to me on how I was to structure that person's working day.  How the role of the SNA works in practice is very dependent on the relationship with the teacher.  I will not ask the SNA witnesses to comment but I am sure they found their working situation changed from year to year as the teacher changed.  Teachers are quite constrained in how they can make use of the talent of the person who is in the room with them and what they can ask that individual to do within the guidelines of the description of the job.  If we really allowed SNAs to fulfil their role as professionals within the education system, we could derive a lot more benefit from the role.</p> <p>  I have a couple of specific questions for Mr. Pike on some of the statistics he gave us regarding the level of qualifications in the SNA workforce.  He set out all the percentages but I wonder if we changed that to look at the percentage with an education qualification or something that is specific to what is happening in the classroom, would we see a significant change.</p><p>I was a little taken aback by what Mr. Pike said.  A question I was going to put to him was where he thinks the UCD course would land in terms of accreditation.  He said it was level 7 or level 8, which would be to a degree standard.  Is he happy to stand over that in terms of the input?  It is essential that we provide an accreditation but we have to make sure it is at the right level.</p><p> On a more general question, how does one choose to be an SNA at this point?  What is the career pathway for new entrants?  As a final comment, I am struck that all of the names I listed out are of women.  I wonder what the percentage is across the workforce.  The witnesses might be able to tell me what the gender breakdown is in total and in terms of new intake.  I have a suspicion that if it was a predominantly male profession, the accreditation scenario would have been sorted out before now.</p></speech>

I can tell him he is not notorious among the people he used to work with, so one forgotten name will be forgiven.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Galster to come in on the route to being an SNA and Ms Jordan can chip in around how people choose to be an SNA.</p> <p>  We think the UCD perspective on the value of its course is probably quite accurate.  We would also say that moving from three D-grades in the old junior certificate straight to level 7 or level 8 would need some careful expert consideration.  We pitched our claim to the Department at level 6 because we think that is a step up from where SNAs are at the moment in terms of the minimum essential qualifications, and it reflects the generality of the qualification that they hold in terms of an overall look at the sector.</p> <p>  As to managing the change, that would have to be done carefully.  There are examples from the early years sector as to how that has happened and how it has been managed.  We think it would turn the job into a viable career pathway, whereby people get training and get that piece of education done, and they would be better equipped to meet the needs of students in schools.</p> <p>  In terms of how people choose to be an SNA and the motivation, I will ask Ms Galster to comment.</p></speech>

I came in contact with an autistic child and I was completely fascinated by her and everything about her, so I did a course in the College of Progressive Education, which was an online course at the time, and I became an SNA in 2008.  I have since studied a lot of courses, not just on autism, although that is my principal interest.  I have also just completed the UCD course and I would back everything that Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan said.  It was an excellent course.  I would love it if there was a pathway from that course on to doing a full degree.  I agree with Mr. Pike that the level of education involved is probably level 7 or level 8, but maybe that would be a component part.</p> <p>  Having worked as an SNA, I feel the whole area of inclusion, on which the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has a ministerial remit, does not just apply to the student body but also applies to the whole school community &ndash; principals, teachers, caretakers, SNAs and cleaners - and they are all entitled to feel they belong in the workplace.  In order to belong and to feel connected to others, there must be mutual respect.  There is no place for hierarchies.  There is certainly no place for schools where a significant number of staff are made to feel they are very firmly at the bottom of the ladder and that is where they are going to stay, or that they are a resource to be used at the discretion of the principal in order to carry out a variety of inappropriate or meaningless tasks which have nothing to do with students.  That is something I know drives SNAs crazy.  Inclusion must encompass full understanding among staff and students of the different roles the staff members have and a greater respect for the need for all staff to work together in order for that inclusive school to prosper into the future.  The whole area of inclusion is something we are probably only at the very beginning of, but it involves collaboration, not hierarchy.</p></speech>

It is important we keep a focus on the reason we want to see accreditation and minimum qualifications, which is the importance of the role SNAs play in the education and development of children.  I do not look on this from the point of view of SNAs as individuals but on the importance of the child who is so dependent upon them.</p> <p>  Where do Ms Galster or Ms Jordan they think the children to whom they provide care and education would be if they did not have an SNA?  Would they be able to stay within mainstream schools and what would be the missing part in their educational day if they did not have an SNA?</p></speech>

They move on to special classes and special schools and often to mainstream schools.  Most of the children at that age would not be in a regular preschool because they just would not be able to cope.  What we do is essential to get them on the path to a full education.  It is not enough for the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to say we are there to increase the independent living skills of children in schools.  That is not what we are there to do.  We are there to help them to access the education they are entitled to by constitutional right.</p> <p>  Many of our students will go on to have successful and independent lives, to have jobs and to succeed.  In the absence of SNAs being there to support them, they would be back where they were in 1979 or prior to it, which is not being educated at all or being put into special schools.</p></speech>

The majority of the children in my school are well able to be in my school with the assistance of an SNA.  Without that assistance, it would not be possible.  Especially now with Covid-19 and all that has happened, we find our children need this assistance more so, and it is not only special needs children but all children who need this assistance.  You could actually have an SNA in nearly every classroom to enable the children to avail of that assistance.  Without it, I do not think it would work.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure last night with some of the team here of speaking to Involve Autism, which has done phenomenal work for its children and the children in Dublin 6W.  This group said that, without the support of SNAs, its children would not have got through mainstream education.  We hear time and again reference to the circular on care needs.  All of us in this room know we do far more than that and, without us, the children would not be able to access the curriculum or attend school.  We saw that, as Ms Jordan mentioned, throughout Covid-19 and trying to work with these children through lockdowns.</p> <p>  The crux of the matter, and at times I feel the Department of Education forgets this, is that the reason we are here is for the children with whom we work.  We want to give the best care possible to those children.  All we want is for them to be able to come to school and be supported by an SNA.  The respect element comes in when we are left time and again waiting to find out whether we have jobs and whether children have school places in September.  Without our crucial role in a classroom, many children in this country would not have a school place, and that is a fact.  Most parents, if not all, would back us on that.</p></speech>

A Deputy said earlier that best practice is we all work together as part of a team.  The children would not be able to do Literacy Lift Off, for example, because they have different stations in the classroom while this is going on.  The extra bodies are needed in the classroom to do this, to break things down and to explain it.

First there would need to be consultation with the sector and clarity around what the requirements are.  An accredited qualification at level 7, if that is the level, would be a requirement for new SNAs.  They would probably need two years' notice that if they want to come and work in a school as a SNA, they will have to obtain the qualification.  For existing staff, there are two ways it can go.  There could be credit for experience, which would mean they would not have to do the qualification.  If the decision at the end of the day is that the existing workforce has to undertake a qualification, there are grandparenting arrangements and transitional processes in health and early years where the existing workforce has had to upskill over a period of time.  There are examples we can follow.  It would have to be introduced in a careful manner, in stages, with absolute clarity about what would be required and from whom.</p></speech>

The Minister of State was very fair in her comments to the committee.  We welcome the commitment to discuss proactively and, I hope, pursue and obtain accreditation for the UCD course.  We welcome her comments around the need to review the minimum essential qualification.  The concerns we have are that getting the Department of Education to do anything is extremely difficult.  The Department reflects the current academic snobbery that has been mentioned around SNAs.  Because it is not a graduate profession, they do not worry about them.  I accept the sentiments and bona fides of the Minister of State.  The problem we are going to have is dragging the Department of Education into a space where it will actually deliver.  That is the concern I have.  Colleagues may have something to add.</p></speech>

We are not there to assist schools.  We are there to assist children with additional needs.  They have to be kept front and centre in all of this.</p></speech>

As Mr. Pike said, the concern is the when, the time and how long this will take.  To put it from the child's perspective, at the moment, the expectation any child can have when he or she accesses the curriculum and gets the support of an SNA is that the SNA would have three Ds in the junior certificate.  That is the expectation.  However, the reality on the ground, as shown in my examples, is that they are required to have FETAC level 5 or 6 and they must engage in continuing professional development, CPD.  There are disparities with what is happening on the ground throughout the country.  We need to standardise that.  We need to look towards future-proofing the service.  I do not need to labour the point.  We know the evolution of special education from 1979 to now.  It does not mean it stops here.  This could be the beginning of something where we could lead the way and have a world-class service.  We are not going to do that if we ponder too much over a minimum qualification when we know the reality on the ground is dramatically different from it.</p> <p>  To respond to a couple of things that were covered around the view of unskilled labour, we have had SNAs on to us in the past week who have been asked to clean fish tanks, clean out lockers, laminate things, mop floors and things like that.  This has taken the SNAs away from the role they should have with the children.  It breaks down goodwill in the school and damages relationships.  A lot of that would be solved by putting in a minimum education qualification which would set the tone of respect they deserve.</p><p>While the vast majority of schools have very much come on board and have shown over the years that they have evolved and value their SNAs, this would eliminate the potential in those areas, which are minor but still create significant problems.</p><p> On the piece around continuous professional development, how can SNAs continuously develop and look to enhance their role and move with the times when there is no standard from which they are moving or that that standard is so low?</p></speech>

Ms Galster has said that she has a special interest in autism, in particular, and that she has done a great deal of training around that.  She knows that in working with children and young people with autism that there are enormous skills in some places which go above and beyond what she, I, and others who are non-autistic students would be able to do.  These students may have a specific flair for maths, for art or for other things.  Does Ms Galster see in her role that potential being used?  Is there a potential for an autistic child with a unique or specific talent to grow and to fulfil their full potential as things stand at the moment?</p></speech>

Usually, the children come to us and they either do not talk or do not have reciprocal conversation skills and are not able to tell us what they need.  Our children are at a very early stage and the majority of them would have the same types of IQ that the Deputy or I would have.  It is a matter, however, of channelling that in a classroom situation so that the child is in a position to be able to learn.  They do not learn the same way we do.</p> <p>  One can take the education cycle further to secondary school but I feel that the training of teachers to teach autistic children is deficient.  Teachers have an amount of training in special education but not necessarily in autism and there are many autistic children who need to be taught.</p></speech>

First, I welcome all of our guests to the committee today and it is an absolute privilege to be involved with the respect for SNA campaigns, if even at a small level.  Some 43 years on, we are all more open now around disabilities in Ireland.  We are no longer ashamed at having a child who has a disability or want to shy away from it.  I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, was in all of the newspapers looking to establish educational centres for people with additional educational needs.  We know that putting the Traveller community into boxes has never worked and we also know that putting people with disabilities or with extra educational needs into such boxes does not work either.</p> <p>  Speaking to Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan, I have a qualification but I do not see myself as someone who has completed a scheme.  I completed a qualification in Ballyfermot College of Further Education for ten months, like Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan did, where we studied junior growth and development, psychology, etc., and how to work with young people in an educational setting.  Kathleen Noone was in charge of the course, it is still available in Ballyfermot College of Further Education and it was brilliant.  I completed the course in 2010.  </p> <p>  I went on to work in a school in Ballyfermot for nearly two years and I know I am giving myself credit in saying this but it was great to work with that young person.  I was not just a carer but was also an educator, that is, someone that young person could speak to.  I became an SNA because when I was ten years of age I lost my mother and a few days after that I was in an accident.  I had SNAs myself from time to time when I was in bad places, although I do not usually speak about that publicly.</p><p>Times have changed in our society and we need to change with them.  We need to recognise SNAs as professionals.  We also need to avoid labelling young people who are assigned SNAs.  We now have 19,000 SNAs in our country and we must respect them by recognising their profession.  It is not an easy course to do.  In terms of mainstreaming equality for young children to enable them to reach their full potential, sometimes there can be barriers in our school settings and the SNAs help to break down those barriers.  I know that from personal experience.  </p><p> It is the right thing to do and I urge the SNAs here not to give up hope because community development work was only recognised as a profession relatively recently.  That said, I have no doubt that the witnesses will be back here next year looking for SNAs to be recognised as a profession.  Unfortunately, the political will is not there yet but the witnesses have run a brilliant campaign.  It is important to continue to put pressure on the Department.  Of course, a review needs to be done but we need to recognise SNAs as a profession first.</p><p> If there are any outstanding comments that the witnesses would like to make on the record, they have a minute to do so.  I will leave open-----  </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for putting on the record all of the work they do.  Most of us here have experience in education.  I have been chair of a school board of management myself and we had an SNA on the board.  However, it should not be on a school-by-school basis.  What can we do to have a more standardised approach?  There is a standard approach for how we treat teachers.  It does not make any sense for the work plans for SNAs to be decided on a school-by-school or teacher-by-teacher basis.  It is not just about the accreditation but also about standardised contracts and terms and conditions.  The pandemic has shown us that SNAs are invaluable.  We have seen that other things can change and that many people can work from home, including teachers but the one cohort for whom we needed the schools to be open was children with special needs.  We all know it now and the public is on board.  We must now make sure that the politicians are on board.  I am going to have to dash off but will listen in to the responses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andy Pike" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#CC00400"><p>I thank Senator Flynn for her comments.  All of our members who are SNAs, and there are many thousands in F&oacute;rsa, will recognise Senator Flynn as a friend.  I am not going to make too many comments about the proposed SEN centres.  There has been a lot of discussion around that.  It is our policy to try to deliver and support an education system that is really inclusive but we do not see the establishment of SEN centres as being necessarily inclusive.  The problem of children with additional educational needs not being able to find an appropriate school place is a very real one but we do not necessarily think that the SEN centre is the way to resolve that problem.  While we would be critical of the Department of Education on a daily, if not hourly, basis from time to time, I am not at all certain that all of the fault lies with the Department.  A lot of schools that do not want to accept students with additional needs should have a damned good look at their own policies and their consciences.  It should not be the case that they worry that providing school places for students with different educational needs will lower the tone or the academic standing of the school.  Senator Flynn used the term "mainstreaming equality".</p><p>It is the best way that I have ever found of looking at equality issues because every decision an organisation makes is viewed from the perspective of how we can increase equality and equity and what will be the consequences of what we do for disadvantaged groups.  That is mainstreaming equality and it is central to everything we do.  At the moment, many schools have to be given a wake-up call by the Minister, through the enactment of legislation, to get them to take seriously their responsibilities to provide school places to members of the Traveller community, students with additional education needs and anyone else who needs a place, rather than adopt a selective admissions policy which does so much damage. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andy Pike" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#DD00300"><p>The standardised approach the Senator advocates is something we would agree with.  It probably starts with a new contract with a new minimum essential qualification but there are other things the committee will have heard today that would help.  Circular 0030/2014, which sets out the role of the SNA, clearly needs to be reviewed and changed to reflect the complexity of the role.</p> <p>  There are other issues as well.  In schools that are administered by education and training boards, SNAs, as well as teachers, can stand for election to become the staff representative on the board of management, which is great, but that is not the case in independent schools.  A change to statutory arrangements is needed to allow that to happen.  Under the handbook, only teachers can stand to become members of the board of management in a school.  I will conclude in case anyone else has something to add.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane Lambert" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062100002#DD00400"><p>On standardising, there are items that need to be updated and reviewed but there is a national standard contract.  In many ways, the difficulty can be getting independent schools to adhere to that contract or at least its principles.  There is too much flexibility and independence in independent schools that enables them to step outside the terms of the contract.  There is very little accountability because of the way the employment relationship is structured with the Department of Education in a kind of tripartite system.</p> <p>  The point about disparities was mentioned and it is important.  We have been very clear that we are not saying that just because a particular public service grade gets a benefit or entitlement, it should automatically apply to SNAs.  However it should apply to them when there is no objective justification as to why it should not.  An example is bereavement leave.  SNAs currently receive significantly less bereavement leave compared with that enjoyed by other civil and public servants.  There is no difference between the grief an SNA in a school will experience when he or she loses a loved one, whether it be a partner, parent or a member of his or her extended family, and that of a teacher colleague who can get more bereavement leave.  However, the teacher and SNA both get less bereavement leave than the civil servant who might be sitting in a Department office.  If we want to talk about inclusion, we need to lead by example and eliminate these disparities where they have no justification.  If there is a legitimate and objective justification, that is fine and one stands over that principled position.</p></speech>

On what grounds did a teacher, principal or someone else instruct the SNA to perform that function?  I find that totally degrading.  I do not know what the background was but any principal or teacher who instructs an SNA doing a fantastic job to carry out such a task, unless it is part of an exercise to teach children how to do it, does not deserve to be a principal or a teacher.</p></speech>

Dealing with that puts individual members in a very difficult position.  They must first say "No" and they then find themselves in conflict with the employer.  We tell them that is where we come in, that is why they pay their union subscriptions and we will represent them.  In general, we will lodge a formal grievance or make representations to the employer but the damage to the employment relationship can sometimes be irreversible, particularly where a principal or manager takes the view that this presents a challenge to them.  There is a feeling of "How dare this person who has only three D-grades in the junior certificate challenge me, someone who is professionally qualified?"</p><p>Do you find these issues are arising in bigger schools, or is there a mix right across the board?</p></speech>

There can be peaks and troughs at times, and when these issues raise their head we end up dealing with a lot of queries of a similar nature. Then all of a sudden they calm down or disappear for a while.</p></speech>

One of my main questions is whether we know if much of the fall in SNA numbers is because people are leaving due to the pay and conditions.  As Mr. Lambert has outlined, sometimes there is a bit of conflict that goes with the job.  Do we have any indication of numbers that are leaving?  Is this the issue we have with teachers where recruitment and retention is a huge issue?   Do we have the same with our SNAs?</p></speech>

Various reasons are mentioned but those that Deputy Nolan has said are front and foremost.</p></speech>

They are a very important part of our education system and are vital in helping children with special needs within the classroom environment.  I know, as a former teacher, I was blessed to work with a number of terrific SNAs and I could not have managed without them.  What needs to be done to change that?</p></speech>

It has to start at the Department of Education and then it will flow down.  The best classes I have worked in are the collaborative classes where people work together as part of a team.  You see a problem and you come up with a solution.  That is going on all across the country.  As everyone is saying today, it is standardising that is needed, setting a bar and leaving it that high.</p></speech>

I am very interested to hear her praise for UCD and I think that is very good.  Does she have any idea of the spread across the country of the participants on that course?  In terms of the delivery online, is there any impediment to learning there or would it be better - in her opinion - as a combination of blended and online?</p></speech>

It started in January during that horrendous lockdown so in some regards that was a good time to start because we were at home and we were able to get on with our studies.  I do not think it impedes learning.  The work of secondary school SNAs might not finish until 4 p.m. or 4.30 p.m. and then they were attending college for a lecture from 6 p.m. onwards every Tuesday.  The online part throughout the lockdowns was invaluable really because they did not have to worry about coming up to UCD and getting to Belfield.  UCD has done tremendous work with guest speakers etc. on autism and various modules and to be able to run it online so smoothly.  I have to give credit where credit is due to UCD for that.  As some of my colleagues here who are going to complete the course, or have just completed the course, have said, it really is a terrific course but I feel it should be accredited.  It should have never gotten to this stage that we have the second cohort in and we are still nowhere near getting accreditation.  There were no issues with it being online.  It was helpful to SNAs who were working to be able to just log on.  Who knows in the future if it will be face-to-face?</p></speech>

Deputy Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh from the Green Party joins us to represent his party instead of Deputy Brian Leddin.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh is very welcome.</p><p>This afternoon we will engage with representatives of D&oacute;chas to discuss its pre-budget submission and the global food crisis, with particular focus on the Horn of Africa and the west Africa area.  We welcome Ms Jane Ann McKenna, CEO of D&oacute;chas, to our committee room and Ms Assalama Sidi, regional director from West Africa who, I hope, is joining us from Niger via Microsoft Teams.  She is very welcome and we will see her on our screens.  I also welcome Mr. Colm Byrne, humanitarian manager of Oxfam Ireland; Mr. Paul O'Brien, CEO of Plan International Ireland; and Ms Mary Van Lieshout, deputy CEO of Goal, who is no stranger to our committee.  I thank all the witnesses for representing their organisations this afternoon.  They will discuss their work in response to what is regrettably once again a global food crisis.</p><p> The format of the meeting will be in the usual manner.  We will hear opening statements which will be followed by a discussion and questions and answers with members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise and direct in their questions to allow everybody an opportunity to participate.  Hopefully, we will have an opportunity for a second round should members so desire.  </p><p> Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as in any way damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if any statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Needless to say it is not expected that any such direction will be warranted.  </p><p> For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present within the Leinster House complex does.  I remind members they are only allowed to participate if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex. </p><p> I am pleased to call on Ms Jane Ann McKenna to make her opening statement, followed by Ms Assalama Sidi whose opening statement will provide us with immediate context on what is currently happening in west Africa.</p></speech>

Over the last few months, the committee has heard from me, D&oacute;chas members and their partners about the war in Ukraine, the humanitarian crisis affecting people in the region, and the impact on global food prices, which is particularly affecting those in low-income countries.  The disruption to food, fuel and fertiliser markets has exacerbated an existing food crisis in the Horn of Africa and in west Africa, which has been driven by conflict, climate shocks and economic pressures.  I am joined today in person by Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Brien, CEO of Plan International Ireland, Ms Mary Van Lieshout, deputy CEO of Goal, Mr. Colm Byrne, humanitarian manager with Oxfam Ireland, and virtually by Oxfam&rsquo;s regional director for west Africa, Ms Assalama Sidi.</p> <p>  Before I hand over to my colleagues, let me give an overview of why this year&rsquo;s pre-budget submission and our engagement with the committee today is crucial.  Last week D&oacute;chas members held a briefing to sound the alarm on famine in the Horn of Africa.  We were heartened to see many Oireachtas colleagues present and engaged.  The figures are stark.  Some 23 million people are at risk of severe hunger; 350,000 children are at risk of death in the coming months in Somalia alone; and one person dies from hunger every 48 seconds.  Equally horrifying is the fact that up to 38 million people are at risk of hunger in West Africa and I am very grateful Ms Sidi can join us today to talk though what is happening in that region.</p> <p>  It is incomprehensible in 2022 that we are in a situation where the risk of famine is a reality for hundreds and thousands of people, especially children.  However, the deadly combination of climate change, conflict and the economic impact of Covid-19 has left lives hanging in the balance.  The situation is not just affecting those living in traditionally arid landscapes or those in conflict affected communities.  Its reach is much greater and far wider.  I was briefed by one of our members, Brighter Communities Worldwide, in Kenya last week.  Everywhere they work, they are seeing people moving closer and closer to food insecurity daily as a result of fields that were not sown due to the cost of inputs; irregular rains, so the growth is not there; and then rising prices.  The price of flour in Kenya has almost trebled in six months and this is not sustainable.</p> <p>  There is action that can be taken however.  As a rich nation, Ireland can lead by example both internationally and domestically.  As will be illustrated in our submission, our overseas aid programme is not keeping pace with the need or indeed the targets Ireland has committed to.  To this end, D&oacute;chas is recommending incremental targets to 0.7% from 2023 to 2030.  Increasing Ireland&rsquo;s investment in overseas development assistance, ODA, in 2023 to meet 0.37% of GNI would put the country on track towards 0.7% and move Ireland into the top ten donors of the OECD development assistance committee, DAC.  </p> <p>  We recognise the pressure on budget 2023 and on the Irish people given the impact of the global food crisis, rising inflation and the subsequent cost of living increases.  However, we urge that Ireland shows support and solidarity to those in crisis-affected communities, through our commitment to and delivery of overseas development assistance.  Research has show that 77% of Irish people believe ODA is vitally important and is a way for Ireland to clearly demonstrate its global solidarity, shared humanity and respect for human rights.  It is imperative that we acts urgently on four key areas.  These are hunger, climate, conflict and Covid-19.  Increasing our investment in these key areas allows Ireland to leverage its knowledge, influence, reputation and expertise on a global stage and to tackle structural and root causes through very practical action.  </p> <p>  We are asking the committee members, and all Oireachtas Members, to support our call to action and the recommendations set out in the D&oacute;chas pre-budget submission.  We recommend scaling up our ODA investment in 2023 and beyond to meet the commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2030.  We ask that we ensure we release flexible multi-year funding to meet the current humanitarian appeals for the Horn of Africa and west Africa regions.  We ask that we advocate at the UN Security Council for accountability for those who seek to use starvation as a weapon of war.  We ask that we support the scale up of investment in social protection programmes and sustainable livelihoods to protect and strengthen hard-won development gains.  We ask that we act to protect World Food Programme supply chains and that we do more to lower CO2 emissions and to support climate adaptation measures.  We need political action and we need leadership.  Every day of delay exacerbates human suffering, increases the scale of the crisis we are seeing and raises the cost of the response.  </p> <p>  I will now hand over to Oxfam&rsquo;s regional director for west Africa, Ms Assalama Sidi, after which I and my colleagues will welcome committee members' input and any questions they may have.</p></speech>

It is a real honour and opportunity for Oxfam to be before such an audience and to speak about west Africa and the food crisis that is happening right now.</p> <p>  In west Africa, 27 million people were suffering from hunger already in April.  The likelihood of this number growing to 38 million is high if nothing is done.  While we are seeing support here and there, we are afraid that target will be met and I will develop on that point.</p> <p>  This crisis is actually an historic high in terms of increase.  It is an increase of 40% from June to August 2021 - that is a year.  Between 2015 and 2020, the number of people in need of emergency food assistance nearly quadrupled from 7 million to 27 million.  Right now, 6.3 million children under five are acutely malnourished.  That is an increase of 28% from last year.</p> <p>  In west Africa, especially in countries where we are observing conflicts of differing natures, communities are abandoning their agricultural land.  This is not only due to conflicts but also due to droughts and flooding.  Of course, climate change is behind the droughts and the recurring flooding that we are seeing in west Africa.  As the committee members all will be aware, west Africa is not part of the world which is polluting but it is being crucially hit by climate change effects from pollution.</p> <p>  Some 61 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection in west Africa in 2022.  Unfortunately, in the case of any type of humanitarian crisis, girls and women suffer the most.  We witness all types of gender violence.  In the Sahel, as food becomes scarce and conflict persists, more girls are forced into early marriage and, of course, are victims of all types of violence, including sexual abuse.</p> <p>  It is important to share some of the underlying root causes of this crisis and the structural factors of the food crisis.  Earlier I mentioned climate change.  Climate change is threatening already fragile livelihoods and will continue to negatively impact the food system.  All west African countries are countries with a high level of vulnerability to climate change but, of course, unfortunately, a low level of readiness.  Under a business-as-usual scenario worldwide, climate change is projected to be higher in west Africa than the global mean with a rise in average temperatures of 3&deg;C to 6&deg;C by 2101.  The Sahel is the most likely to experience the largest changes with an increase of extreme weather events and the depletion of water.</p> <p>  In addition to climate change, any time we watch media we see the conflicts in the Sahel, in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.  Protracted conflicts and displacement is a vulnerability multiplier for the food and nutrition crisis in central and Sahel Africa.  Violent conflicts continue to limit humanitarian space while increasing the number of displaced persons in the region and the negative impact of conflict dynamics on the protection of civilians and on their access to infrastructure that is critical for their survival and well-being, including humanitarian assistance, cannot be overstated.  We, as humanitarian actors, have difficulties accessing those people in need and providing them with the assistance that they require.</p> <p>  Other aggravating factors include cereal production.  This year, in Sahel, it has been declining steadily.  For instance, in Niger, where I am currently based, the production has decreased by approximately 36% from last year.  This, of course, makes food stock run out very fast and the hunger season starting very early.  Normally, in this region, the hunger season starts in May or June but this year in October and November we already saw people suffering and leaving because of the food crisis.</p> <p>  Of course, there is also the residual effect of Covid-19.  While west Africa did not suffer from this pandemic as the other parts of the world, it is important to remember that with a global world, any difficulties in trade in one part of the continent could affect all the others.  West Africa has been suffering from the residual crisis of Covid-19 because of the high importation of goods from countries, such as China and European countries.</p> <p>  Another important factor is the crisis in Ukraine.  The crisis in Ukraine is likely to make the situation dangerously worse.  We are seeing commodity prices increasing already and the trend is worrying for us.  The price may cause a decrease in wheat availability for six countries.  Six of the west African countries rely on Ukraine and Russia for wheat importation.  They import 30% to 50% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine.  One of the most concerning aspects is that many donors have already indicated that they may cut funding to Africa to finance the reception of refugees in Europe.  We have seen cases of countries in Europe which have taken such a grave commitment.</p> <p>  The asks would not be different from what my D&oacute;chas colleague says.  Donors are slow to disburse the urgently needed funds for a timely response.  More than two months after the EU high-level conference to address the food and nutrition crisis in the Sahel, the average funding for the UN humanitarian response plan is below 20%.  For instance, for countries such as Burkina Faso, it is 15%.  For Chad, it is 16%.  For Mali, it is 11%.  Oxfam urgently needs &euro;35.6 million to support 1.1 million during the three months of the rainy season in west Africa.  Without timely long-term assistance, the vulnerable population will be forced to take negative action that especially affects girls, such as early marriage and dropping out of school, and, of course, impoverishing families.  Donors need to ensure their response to the Ukrainian conflict is funded by additional funds that do not jeopardise funding for other, less visible crises such as the one happening in west Africa.  Other countries, such as Norway, have already committed to do this.  Of course, we must continue to address the growing humanitarian needs while investing in the root causes of the inequality, poverty and poor governance.  I will stop here.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for this opportunity.  It is a great honour to speak about west Africa because for weeks and months, west Africa was not really on the radar.</p></speech>

They highlight a stark and real crisis that, unfortunately, is not unfolding; it is happening before our eyes.  The call has to go out again that the world must act.  We have no option.</p> <p>  I refer to the four key areas that Ireland needs to act on.  There is an onus on the world to act.  I reiterate the four are hunger, climate, conflict and Covid.  Coming out of our last major crisis here in this country which was Covid, the vaccine inequality is real and still hard hitting.</p><p>I heard of the experience in west Africa but that is not a shared experience.  Covid may not have hit as badly in west Africa as elsewhere but it is still a major challenge.  I reiterate my call for vaccine equity right across the developing world.</p><p> I will not go through all of the points because I agree with everything the witnesses have outlined.  I also have some specific questions.  I agree that the onset of the brutal and barbaric war in Ukraine has had an impact, obviously in Ukraine but also right across the globe.  Starvation should not be used in any circumstance as a weapon of war.  Unfortunately, we are seeing this with more than 22 million tonnes of grain locked and held hostage in this game of chess being played out by Putin.  It is absolutely grotesque.</p><p> We also had gross underfunding of the World Food Programme before the onset of the Covid pandemic.  Many projects are being cut in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Uganda, and down through Mali, Mozambique, the Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.  The list is endless.  Reference was made to some other projects that are also being cut in Yemen.  There is a crisis in funding for food programmes.  I fear the situation in Ukraine will be used by donors to divert funding elsewhere, in all probability to buy weapons of war.  That is understandable given the brutal conflict in Ukraine, but I appeal to nations to provide additional funding.  Critical programmes such as this should not be cut.</p><p> I would like to get some comments on a broader issue.  We heard some commentary about not cutting critical funding.  Will our guests comment on the needs the challenges around funding that has been cut in other programmes?  Will they also touch on the situation with Covid and the need for vaccine equity, including the impact this issue is having?  I agree with all of the witnesses' asks, none of which I will challenge.  I thank them very much for attending.</p></speech>

I will defer to my colleague Mr. Byrne on the impact of the funding cuts.  One of the effects we are seeing is with the suppliers to the World Food Programme.  The ration portions are getting smaller and what is being distributed is getting smaller.  It is getting more expensive to give the same amount of food.  This is directly impacting people on the ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022062100002#D00300"><p>I acknowledge Deputy Brady's support for the Overseas Development Institute, ODI.  It is a very important expression of support for us as a group, for the NGO community at large and for our partners on the ground.<br/><br/>More broadly, on the question of funding, I will just put the issue in very practical terms.  As the supply goes down, the price of food goes up, and as the price of food goes up, households are simply unable to meet their basic food requirements.  It is a very simple economic equation.  As the Deputy has rightly described, the problem right now is a perfect storm.  We have disruption of food production at the global level, a global climate crisis and the very localised experience of communities which have an immediate lack of access to water and the basic means of survival.<br/><br/>I want to put this into perspective.  This is a political choice.  We have had plenty of warnings about this food crisis.  It is a perfect storm and it has certainly been accentuated by the conflict in Ukraine, but we have had plenty of warnings.  This is the fifth failed rainy season in east Africa and west Africa.  Last year, the number of people in need and in acute crisis was estimated to be 10 million.  This year, the figure has more than doubled to 23 million people.  It has doubled because we failed to act early.  The statistics we have suggest - and we feel very confident in this - that if we respond early, we rapidly reduce the cost of humanitarian response.<br/><br/>I do not want to get too caught up in the numbers.  It is not just about reducing the cost of the humanitarian response.  Our estimates suggest that every &euro;1 invested in preventing a crisis saves &euro;3 in launching a humanitarian response.  We all agree that prevention is better than cure.  Humanitarian aid is a <b>B</b>and-Aid.  It is hugely expensive and it does not address the root causes of the problem.  When we delay in responding to the problem, it gets bigger and when the problem gets bigger there is more conflict over resources.  When there is more conflict over resources there is more population displacement.  With more population displacement, there are more people in need, and on and on we go in this downward spiral of really negative experience.  It is not just at a country or regional level; it goes right down to the individual household level.<br/><br/>The one thing I would really like to highlight is that every &euro;1 we spend in prevention prevents &euro;3 needed for the cure.  This is at a time when we have never been more concerned about financial prudence.  The opportunity is there.  There is a political will that if we release funding early, we can prevent this crisis.  When we come here, we are often asked whether we have any good news.  Currently, the answer is &quot;Not now&quot;, but the opportunity is to create good news and make good news.  We talk about a three C's of Covid, climate and conflict.  I would add a fourth C, complacency.  We will not be forgiven if we delay any further.  We will not be forgiven by our communities and the partners we work with if we make more excuses to divert overseas aid for other purposes, particularly for domestic needs in the European environment.  I must underline that we have an opportunity to correct what is already a great injustice and a great wrong.</p></speech>

My contribution is not so much have a question but an acknowledgement of the witnesses' presence and the detail they have given to the committee, including the stark detail on hunger, climate, conflict and Covid.  The witnesses are making a pitch to the Government to respond, insofar as it can, in the ongoing budgetary process, which is eagerly awaited on many fronts, not least with the demands on the Exchequer to meet the response that is necessary as a result of Covid and war and the impact of war on the cost of living.  Thankfully, we have never failed in our duty and responsibility in the area of overseas aid, from many difficult times through to the even more difficult times we currently face.  As my colleague from Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Brady, noted, there is an onus of responsibility not just on us but also on the wider European Union and the world's powers to respond accordingly.</p> <p>  I hear and acknowledge what the witnesses have said.  I hope we can impress that on those in power who have a duty to help those worse off than ourselves.  Although we may also be impacted presently, as many of our people believe, it is never on the scale that has been relayed to us by our guests today.  We will do our best to impress upon our colleagues who have that duty, responsibility and privilege the need to look favourably on some of the recommendations the witnesses have made and insist that our representatives on the UN Security Council ensure they highlight these issues with those who are a lot more powerful than us.  We need to ensure the complacency Mr. Byrne referred to is arrested and a genuine effort is made by those who have the capacity to respond to do so.</p></speech>

I hope to be speaking in the D&aacute;il on some of these issues during the pre-European Council statements shortly.  As a result, I apologise if I have to leave straight away after receiving the witnesses' answers.</p> <p>  I very often try to understand these matters through the prism of the strategic development goals because they comprise a multifaceted, cross-departmental way of understanding them.  It was said that, owing to Covid, we lost ten years of progress on the sustainable development goals.  I wonder how much more we are losing due to the conflict in Ukraine.  The goals that jump out are goal 1, which is to have no poverty.  How quickly we are travelling backwards on this.  Goal 2 is to have zero hunger.  Goal 5 relates to gender equality.  As Ms Sidi said, it is always women and girls who suffer most in conflicts.</p> <p>  I will try to be reasonably brief.  I will outline two concerns I have and then ask three questions.  The two concerns were outlined by previous speakers.  There is genuine concern that our overseas development aid expenditure will be directed towards our Ukrainian response.  A very clear message has to go out, including in our pre-budget preparations, that we must retain a significant proportion of our overseas development aid for the work in the least-developed countries.  We can be rightly proud of this work in Ireland.  My second concern is that an emergency response is absolutely required in the Horn of Africa.  I fully accept Mr. Byrne's comment that if we spend early, we will spend less.  We are at a point where an emergency response is absolutely necessitated, but we have to make sure that does not undercut our long-term response, of which Ireland can be rightly proud in terms of its overseas development aid expenditure.  We cannot afford to lose that type of progress because, in the longer term, we need to build capacity in our partner countries, particularly on social protection measures and aspects of gender.</p> <p>  My three questions may not relate 100% to our own budget preparations.  One of the great failures of COP26 was loss and damage.  Ahead of COP27, which will happen on the African continent, what moves would the delegates like to see emanating from the Irish State to prepare the ground for something significant and meaningful regarding a loss-and-damage facility?  My second question is related.  Where can we make progress on climate finance?  I am not just talking about leveraging our own overseas development aid but also about building a climate finance facility that will be fit for purpose to do the job.  Third, how can we leverage the UN Security Council seat?  I am acutely aware that we hold the pen on the conflict and hunger file.  Has there ever been a time when that has been more pertinent and important?</p> <p>  I have a fourth question.  I have talked a little about gender.  There must be an emergency response.  That is probably a blanket response.  Is there anything specific we should be doing in respect of gender to tackle what we see unfolding in the least developed countries?  I thank the Chairman again for allowing me to put these questions.</p></speech>

Much to our shame, we are having an impact on what other people are living with.  Our actions are having a very real and tangible impact on other people's ability to simply stay alive.  The disproportionate impact of climate change, whether it involves conflict, drought, flooding or the need for humanitarian aid, needs to be called out.  It needs to be carried out in area 4  If possible.  Ultimately, the potential global impact is much greater than what most people realise.  Our actions and other people's suffering have potential on a global scale, and the response needs to be global.</p> <p>  Deputy John Brady mentioned a very good example of where the global response failed, and that was in respect of access to vaccines when required.  We must not allow that again.  Mr. Byrne mentioned simple economics earlier.  Another simple economic fact is that one cannot do more with less; it is just not possible.  One may stand still for a period but certainly will not be able to do more.  More needs to be done.</p> <p>  I have a specific question for Ms Sidi.  I may have misheard her when she referred to a hunger season.  I would like her to correct me if I picked her up incorrectly.  We have four seasons in our world.  Have we now got to the point where hunger lasts for a season as an everyday eventuality in people's lives?  Seasons last for three months.  Is this issue planned for?</p> <p>  The question I have is in some ways rather simple but it is important to ask it.  There has been talk of the UN Security Council.  Last April, there was the on-boarding session that Ireland hosted at the Security Council to develop a greater understanding of conflict and hunger.  It is important to do that work but understanding an issue and taking action to address it are very different.  From an Irish perspective, I see a need for us to act immediately to address the problem facing us.  Also, we have a very important role in prevention and long-term intervention.  Regarding the response to the threat multipliers, irrespective of whether they relate to nutrition, hunger or security, is there a greater or new role emerging for Ireland in addition to the existing one and the aid already made available?  How do we harness the knowledge and influence we have to meet the new and emerging needs?</p> <p>  The delegation was absolutely correct to call out the disproportionate impact on women and children.  Very often, they are the first to be impacted upon, but they are also the last to benefit from any positive and meaningful change.</p></speech>

I thank the presenters.  This is Ms McKenna's third or fourth time here, so none of the delegates have shirked their responsibility to ensure their organisations are considered favourably in the budget negotiations.</p> <p>  Much of this is about the Irish public and where it is at.  Many people probably do not know there is such a crisis in the offing.  It is probably up to us, as public representatives, to let people know there is a catastrophe coming down the road.  It is really upsetting.  It seems so far away.  The way it is being spoken about, it seems as if it is a case of them and us.  It is amazing how something small that we can do can have such a great impact if we put the funds in place.  However, it is important to have a better public awareness campaign on the crisis in the Horn of Africa.  As others have said, politicians' focus is on the war in Ukraine.  The funds follow the public sentiment, unfortunately.  There is a body of work to be done to move the public sentiment back to other crises around the world.</p><p>Hopefully that is something we can do as a committee.  Others have said we should utilise our role on the Security Council but is there anything else we could do?  We will all be lobbying our own finance spokespeople and Ministers to ensure overseas development aid is not cut and is increased.  If there is anything the witnesses can think of for us to do, we are listening.  We all feel helpless listening to the contributions today but meetings like this in small rooms like these can have an impact on people's lives far away.  If every country had put a little more in, many more lives would be saved.  I thank the witnesses again for all their work.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for having us in today.  As a sector, we are struggling to get this message across and sound the alarm.  We need political support to that.  It is not just about us as international organisations but about having the political will here in Ireland to be able to scale up what we are doing.  There is a huge amount of public support in Ireland for overseas development assistance.  D&oacute;chas monitors that on a regular basis and we can see that level of support there.  What we require is the energy at a political level to actually draw attention to the crises.  We need to use our position on the UN Security Council, our position within the EU and our reputation on a global stage to sound the alarm a bit more strongly.  We must scale up ourselves but also advocate for others to do so.</p> <p>  There were a number of questions so I might divide them up between my colleagues.  Mr. O'Brien might answer the question about gender and the impact on women and girls, not only from because of this food crisis but a number of other areas we have touched on today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022062100002#F00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity, as well as Ms McKenna.  I also thank the members for their questions.  It is great to hear that there is such receptivity to the issues we are raising, even though many of us feel quite powerless in this situation.  We are extremely proud of Irish overseas aid development, the work done by Irish Aid and the way Irish Aid acts as a donor.  We do not have tied aid and we have great flexibility.  Even at the time of Covid, Irish Aid showed great flexibility in allowing the agencies to repurpose money in order to deal with the Covid crisis.</p> <p>  I also want to talk about the hunger crisis.  I am 37 years in the sector at this stage.  I went to Kenya in the mid-1980s, which seems fad&oacute; fad&oacute;, as my daughter would say to me.  This is the worst crisis we have faced.  I do not ever remember a crisis cutting right across the whole of Africa.  Ms Sidi spoke about west Africa and we are talking about the Horn of Africa, east Africa and the Sahel.  We did not even mention Afghanistan and women.  We have not even mentioned places like Haiti and so on.  I do not think we have ever seen a crisis as large at a time when aid budgets across many countries are under so much pressure.  We have talked about the Ukraine crisis, the availability of wheat and oil and what that has done for food availability.  There is also the money issue.  A lot of European donors are cutting their overseas aid budgets and doing exactly as people feared by putting the money into dealing with the Ukrainian refugee crisis in their countries.  That has a worrying impact.  The numbers are so great there and that is the big challenge.</p> <p>  What we are starting to talk about here is also very interesting.  It is a question of empathy.  Are we losing our empathy as a nation?  I am very encouraged by the words I am hearing from the members of this committee but there is an issue with the media.  There has been a huge focus on Ukraine.  It is impossible for us as aid agencies to get the media to look at this crisis and present it as the crisis it is, that is, one of the biggest crises to face us in our generation.</p> <p>  It is very easy to go into the millions of people and children so I might give some anecdotal evidence instead.  I was talking to our country director in Somalia yesterday and she told me stories of women having to make choices as to which child they feed that day.  I have never heard that before.  I have also heard of young girls being very worried when they see their mothers having a chat with a man on the street, because they are worried that conversation will revert to marriage and that they will be married off before the night is done.  We are seeing those coping mechanisms coming into play.  Ms Sidi has talked about the length of the hunger season and things coming earlier.  We are seeing coping mechanisms coming much earlier.  We have a massive crisis on our hands.  In previous crises, we were confident that if we got the money we might be able to deal with them.  With this crisis, we are not so confident because the price of food is going up and the availability is going down.  When we look at famine in different countries, we always look at two issues.  One is access to food.  Sometimes by putting cash in people's hands, they can go and buy food.  The other issue is availability and whether food is available on the local market.  It is about getting the combination of those two things right.  People have to have access through money in their pockets but food also has to be available at a price that is reasonable for people.</p> <p>  I could go on about the hunger season because it is a very interesting question.  Ms Sidi will talk about that as well.  In my 37 years, people talking about a hunger season is something we got used to.  The hunger season is essentially the time between the last harvest and the new harvest coming in.  People in different places have coping mechanisms to deal with that.  In some places I have seen people resort to making local brew and things like that to numb the hunger at that period.  In some places that period is getting longer for people.</p> <p>  I know there are questions around the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  For us as agencies the SDGs have almost gone off the agenda a bit.  I hate saying that because they are so important.  That is probably because we have realised we are going to struggle to meet those exact ones that were mentioned, namely, goals 1, 2 and 5.  Those are the ones relating to eradicating poverty and hunger and getting gender equality.  I saw a figure recently stating that it will take 137 years to get gender equality at the current pace of progress.  I am sorry I could not be more positive but that is the reality we are facing and dealing with at the moment.</p></speech>

Maybe she could describe a little more of the reality of what that is like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Assalama Sidi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022062100002#F00600"><p>I am in a unique position to talk about that because not only am I the regional director but I am also a west African living in Niger.  It is a good question.  We talk about the hunger season or lean season.  Of course, the word "hunger" is stronger.  In west African countries, especially in the Sahel area, a food crisis is not something new.  For decades, people in west African countries, especially in the Sahel part, lived at least a hunger season.  That hunger season, as described by my predecessor, is the time between the last harvest and the new one.  This year, the Covid crisis has made both the world and west African countries more fragile and some of the coping mechanisms community members use are no longer available.  It could be something as simple as communities gardening or using tree leaves in a positive way.</p><p>There are good tree leaves that some communities use to cope before reaching the next harvest season.  Due to climate change in the Sahel region, fewer trees are growing and, due to less food growing, many community members are cutting trees and selling them to cope.  It is a vicious circle.  To be succinct in my answer, we are seeing the lean or hunger season starting earlier and lasting longer.</p><p> Regarding the question on gender, this is what we have witnessed for years.  Unfortunately, it is growing worse.  The conflict situation is making it worse.  Climate change is not new in this part of the world, but conflict is a new factor.  During times of conflict, men are the ones who go to battle or are the ones who are targeted by extremist violence in west Africa and the Sahel.  In either case, women find themselves being abandoned and must find solutions for feeding their children.  Sometimes, this means leaving the community, going from one village to another and exposing themselves to all types of gender-based violence and sexual violence.  I would not insist on girls marrying early.  It is already a major issue in countries like Niger, where more than 70% of girls are married before their 18th birthdays.  Unfortunately, during conflicts and food crises, girls are sometimes more likely to get married even earlier as a coping mechanism.</p></speech>

I will hand over to Ms Van Lieshout to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Van Lieshout" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022062100002#G00300"><p>I will divide that question into a number of sections, consider different ways in which we can act and pick up on some of the other issues that have been raised.</p> <p>  One of the issues that has arisen relates to climate finance.  D&oacute;chas has welcomed the Taoiseach's commitment to providing an extra &euro;225 million in climate financing by 2025.  We agree with the Deputy that this amount needs to be in addition to existing ODA commitments.  We have discussed a separate finance stream for loss and damage to be committed at COP27 in support of low-income countries.  A number of the points that the Deputy has raised are points for which D&oacute;chas is advocating, so Ireland will be showing real leadership at COP27.</p> <p>  It is interesting to have Ms Sidi here from Niger.  One of the unsung successes of Ireland's term at the UN Security Council, where we have a further six months, was the Irish and Nigerian resolution on the connection between climate and conflict.  We came very close to winning that resolution, through which there would have been overall understanding across the General Assembly of the connection between climate and conflict and its impact on hunger.  The resolution did not go through because of petty politics at the Security Council, but that does not mean that that time was wasted.  Ireland, along with Niger, can stand proud for building that consensus behind the scenes and for nearly getting a new resolution on the issue.  This kind of leadership from our time on the council is very important.  Ireland needs to continue speaking to UN Security Council Resolution 2417 on climate and security.  When we depart the Security Council, we do not depart leadership at the UN.  We can leverage that time, just as other former members of the Security Council did with Ireland, sharing their knowledge and experience of the difficult issues and how to bring them a step closer to success.  There is much more that can be achieved on the foot of these two years at the Security Council.  I just do not want people to see our departure as an end.  It is only the beginning of taking advantage of consensus building, which is important in our multilateral relationships.</p> <p>  My final comment is on the questions relating to Covid and vaccine equity.  We are aware that the committee has supported vaccine equity.  D&oacute;chas has called for vaccine equity since the beginning of the pandemic.  We are well aware that vaccination and booster rates in the global south are far behind the global north's.  The longer it takes vaccines to reach the global south, the longer we will have new variants emerging and vaccine hesitancy, fuelled by misinformation, taking a deeper hold.  Vaccine equity cannot be more urgent than it is.  Despite this, the discussions at the World Trade Organization that concluded this week did not go far enough.  We need to see the transfer of technology to the global south.  We need to see much more courage being shown in answering the call from the public, this committee and the Seanad on supporting vaccine equity.  This pandemic will not go away until we are all safe.  None of us is safe until we are all safe.</p> <p>  I hope that I have answered at least three parts of the many questions that were asked.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022062100002#G00500"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh for that question.  I share the sense of helplessness that everyone feels, but I also share the sense of opportunity for Ireland to act that Ms Van Lieshout underlined.</p> <p>  Regarding loss and damage, I will first set out the current state of affairs.  The wealthiest 1% are responsible for twice the carbon emissions of the world's poorest 50%.  When we talk about loss and damage, we are talking about redressing an imbalance in the global system.  Most of the people who are affected by climate change are in the global south.  To put it in perspective, they are estimated to number approximately 3.6 billion, or almost half the planet.  We are seeing a widening gap between climate pledges and climate action.  We are not just discussing targeting countries, but also corporations that are responsible for carbon emissions.</p> <p>  To be practical, I will offer some simple pointers about what we can do.  First, we can reduce carbon emissions.  There is a responsibility on us all to do this.  Second, we can provide grants for adaptation, for example, water conservation, drought-resistant crops and better quality seed.  Third, we can target women, noting their particular responsibility for decision making within the household, including household food production.  By this, I predominantly mean domestic food production, but women also do the large bulk of hard agricultural labour, which is often unpaid.  They also have responsibility for childcare and caring for disabled and sick family members.</p> <p>  Regarding climate finance, Ms Van Lieshout has welcomed the &euro;225 million contribution from the State.  Many calculations suggest that Ireland's contribution could even be as high as over &euro;800 million.  Importantly, the &euro;225 million should be over and above ODA that has already been committed.</p> <p>  There has been a great deal of discussion around the establishment of a loss and damage fund in advance of COP27.  Notably, COP27 is being held in Cairo this year, a part of the world that is very familiar with the impacts of climate change and water shortages.  We are asking for the establishment of a non-voluntary loss and damage fund that is based on the principles of justice and equity and is guided, not by the interests of donors, but by the interests of those who need this funding the most.</p><p> In terms of targets for COP27 and reducing carbon emissions, we should also look to revise our targets conscious of the need to respond at speed and at scale.  I underline what Ms Van Lieshout said.  It is really important to acknowledge that Ireland was very active and very outspoken at the Security Council in trying to secure a resolution that recognises the links between climate change and conflict.  That resolution was not successful but the opportunity now is for Ireland to remain active on that file and to pass the baton to those who will be on the Security Council in the years to come.  This battle goes well beyond the Security Council but we should underline that climate change now is a very serious threat to international peace and security.</p></speech>

We are moving towards the business end of these projections.  The witnesses present the path in what appears to be a reasonable manner but it does illustrate the job Government must do between now and 2030, which is really significant.  Having regard to the witnesses' projected increase, where stands the provision of the &euro;225 million per year of climate finance to developing countries by 2025?  Is that included in the projections or is it separate money?  Where does the &euro;225 million to which the Taoiseach referred stand within the new loss and damage finance stream?  Is it part of that?  Are we looking at a new stream in addition to that which has been committed by the Taoiseach in the context of loss and damage?  It is the desire of this committee that not only would Ireland be represented at COP27 in Cairo by a high-level delegation but that would include the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

When the Taoiseach announced the commitment to climate finance, that was part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which commits donor countries to provide new and additional finance resources for the full incremental cost of climate change.  We cannot afford to displace funds that are needed for all of the different elements about which we have spoken today in the context of humanitarian funding that is needed, funding to support sustainable food systems etc.  Funding for all of those elements, which are very much needed, cannot be moved aside and put into a climate finance budget.  We do need this in addition.</p></speech>

We touched on access, availability and these new and not always positive coping mechanisms, for want of a better term.  I am very concerned that there is a real risk of normalising the abnormal where copying mechanisms become so ingrained in communities they become the norm despite the fact that they were anything but for previous generations.  If we see a cutback in aid donations and in tandem with that, a cutback in development aid programmes, there are people who are hungry and at risk of dying but there are also communities and societies that will not truly benefit from any loss or damage fund.  Let us imagine that loss and damage will be agreed at the next COP and that a price or value will be put on it.  That money would simply go back into communities and it would bring them back to where they were beforehand.  There would be no substantial, meaningful benefit from that level of funding.  In terms of the difficulties experienced in respect of access, because aid needs to be delivered in a timely fashion and to a proportionate scale, is there is a risk that accessing medical aid could be withdrawn?  We focused on food today but food is not the only aid delivered to countries.  Aid comes in very different shapes and sizes.  Are we looking at the entire package of aid potentially being reduced or is it specifically around food?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022062100002#H00600"><p>The Deputy's question is very interesting.  Her description of making what is very abnormal and very negative coping mechanisms normal is a really interesting way of looking at it.  Let us be clear.  Food is only one part of an overall package.  You need medicines to go with it.  Even at the very severe end of treating malnutrition, you are treating with a cocktail of drugs, particularly in the case of severely malnourished children, so it is not just about food and making sure it is the appropriate food.  The overall mantra from a humanitarian would be that it is the humanitarian imperative, which is fundamentally about saving lives and easing suffering.  If you get into chats with some of us, that is really what we would look at.  It is about saving lives and easing suffering.  That is mostly about food, having the right food that is locally available and making sure people can access that in sufficient quantities.  The real challenge with the Ukraine crisis is the availability of wheat and sunflower oil, which were being used to feed significant proportions of populations, particularly around east Africa but also in areas like Lebanon and Egypt.  The other side of it is the funding that is being diverted into defence budgets, particularly by the countries in eastern Europe and even central Europe.  We have seen what Germany is doing in terms of its defence budget and what Finland is having to do with its defence budget.  I have heard some talk here, and I know this committee is concerned with defence as well, about the need to look at defence, although I know it is not as related to the issue of Ukraine compared with some of those other countries.  We are seeing the diversion of aid to defence as well aid to Ukrainian refugees in the countries to which they are coming to live.</p></speech>

The reason we were very keen to have this meeting in June was to give us the opportunity to reflect on the witnesses' submissions and to produce  a report for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in the context of the forthcoming budget.  Unusually, we seem to be having a very intense and sharp national debate on the budget in the context of issues in our economy and society.</p><p>We are very keen to produce a submission to the Government not only to protect the budget of these organisations but also to acknowledge increasing food prices and needs, as well as what Mr. Byrne has said in respect of the widening gap between pledges and action.  Unfortunately, that may not be solely related to climate and it could well be referred to in terms of our aggregate increases in the overseas development aid budget.</p><p> We will revert to the organisations about the overall messaging they can provide us with and how best they see the ever-increasing needs being met against the background of ever-competing interests, and the need for us at least to ring-fence budgets.  We must also acknowledge the fact that ring-fencing of budgets just for this year will not be sufficient, having regard to climate on the one hand and conflict on the other in more and more areas around the world.</p></speech>

This is clear evidence that the committee cares about what is going on in Africa and a willingness to provide support, which is really meaningful for Oxfam and all of us, particularly me as an individual sitting here and witnessing concretely with evidence everything happening around me.</p> <p>  If I have a key message it is really around insisting that if donors do not invest more than what they have already committed to, they should not reduce the envelopes they have committed to.  That is one message.</p> <p>  We are really living in a global world.  We used to say that in the media but it is becoming more of a reality.  We have seen with Covid-19 we all became a global world, frightened by a microscopic virus nobody could see and suffering in the same way.  That was regardless of where we lived on the planet.  Covid-19 has really shed light on the inequalities that are happening in the world, and the Ukraine crisis is doing the same thing.  Living in this part of the world, we have seen that donors and governments can easily mobilise billions of dollars to support a cause.  In the same way with the humanitarian principle, which is a question of ethics, if people are suffering in Afghanistan and eastern and western Africa, they should be seen as human beings and their suffering should not be ignored.  Ultimately, what matters is saving lives.</p> <p>  That is what I have to say.  Again, I thank the committee for having me virtually in the room along with other colleagues.</p></speech>

These are the climate crisis, conflict and Covid-19.  It is important to note the fragility of global food systems has been deeply laid bare and exposed by these converging crises, highlighting dangerous dependencies and unequal power relations in food systems that have been at the centre of repeated food crises for decades.</p> <p>  We cannot get away from the fact the failed rainy season of 2022 in the Horn of Africa is predicted to be the driest on record.  This represents the most severe drought in 40 years.  There are 181 million people facing food insecurity around 41 countries, but many of them, numbering in the millions, in the Horn of Africa will die unless we act.  We heard at the outset that one person is likely to die every 48 seconds in that region.  That anyone should die of hunger in the 21st century is unacceptable.  I know we all agree on that and this is an opportunity to act.  We are asking the committee today to support the recommendations in our pre-budget submission across these various dimensions.  It is not a one-dimensional response and we are asking the committee's support and to take political action while exercising leadership to prevent a catastrophic humanitarian disaster.</p></speech>

Ultimately, starvation is a political choice, and we should really underline that point.  It is a mistake to enter this conversation of us versus them and domestic versus international.  I do not believe it is impossible to do both.  As Ms McKenna has said, Irish people are very supportive of Ireland's aid budget and Irish people have always stepped up.  It is not always just about money but the opportunity to walk in solidarity with people and join them where they are.  All of us are affected by the global food security crisis in one way or another, but standing up and walking tall in partnership with people experiencing crisis is an extraordinarily important gesture and a major source of hope.</p> <p>  There is the aid target of 0.7% of gross national income.  We have spoken about protecting the aid budget but we are not even halfway there yet.  We have made a commitment to that 0.7% figure and the closest we have come is 0.59% around 2008.  We have already fallen backwards, so do not pull the rug from underneath people at their time of greatest need.</p> <p>  I will speak about who ultimately bears the brunt.  We have spoken about people in the global south but we have also referred to women and girls.  We are talking about a reversal of development gains, child marriage, sexual exploitation and abuse, and girls not having access to education.  We should remember that a lack of access to education has lifelong implications, as does being a victim and survivor of sexual violence.  Let us hold this ground firmly and not let people down when they need us most.</p></speech>

Living in Ireland, we are very aware there are many competing priorities and there will be very difficult choices to make over the coming months as the budget is prepared.  We are aware of the cost of living and energy, along with so many different elements.</p> <p>  It is about keeping the political will because we have seen what this country could do during the Covid-19 crisis.  We have seen an amazing response by the country in ensuring people's incomes were not affected.  It was amazing to be part of that and living in Ireland during that time.  We have also seen the amazing response to Ukraine and how we have welcomed literally thousands of Ukrainians here and found the money to be able to support them.  We are saying we should it take it that step further and retain the commitment to the 0.7% figure.  There is a plan to reach that and I suppose it is really within the competing priorities to retain the political will to reach it.</p> <p>  The final point is about that leadership question.  It is about Ireland's leadership within itself and within Europe and the United Nations.</p><p>There is the adage of punching above our weight.  We have always managed to do that in terms of example.  It is a real challenge to be able to do it now with so many different things happening.  I encourage that to happen.</p></speech>

I recall how useful the engagement was this time last year in terms of our preparation for budgets.  I dare say the challenges this year are even more acute.  I acknowledge what members have said.  In particular I want to refer to the brief but strong contribution of Deputy Cowen.  He said clearly that Ireland has a duty and a responsibility to act in these circumstances.  So does the committee.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of Irish Aid and all of the associated agencies and the leadership of the Department of Foreign Affairs in this regard.  I acknowledge the most positive contribution of D&oacute;chas and all of the NGO development organisations under its umbrella.  We propose to draft a brief report in the form of a submission to the Government, the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This is to outline to them in the context of the budgetary preparations, if indeed it is necessary to do so, the need to ensure, in the words of Mr. O'Brien, that Ireland continues to punch above its weight in circumstances that are most challenging.</p> <p>  I acknowledge what Ireland continues to do at the UN Security Council.  In particular I reference what Ms Van Lieshout said, that perhaps not all of the resolutions are successful but that is not to say they are meaningless.  At a number of levels, there remain opportunities for us to strongly commit and to influence.  I acknowledge what Ireland is doing on the International Fund for Agricultural Development.  Often we hear of the need to address the causes rather than the symptoms.  Sometimes this is even more challenging when we hear statistics on record drought.  Nevertheless it is important that we share our leadership in the area of expertise in these pursuits.  There is the work Ireland is doing on Nutrition for Growth in terms of funding and expertise.  There is also the good and positive relationship between Ireland and the World Food Programme and the many Irish experts who are part of the World Food Programme.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for sharing their concerns with us.  This meeting has been timely.  It is very important that we hear from the witnesses on the very serious challenge that lies ahead in attempting to tackle the multiple crises across the continent from the Horn of Africa to west Africa.  In particular to Ms Sidi I say how grateful we are to her for joining us from the front line in Niger.  We acknowledge her work and wish her continued good fortune in the challenges she deals with on a daily basis.  We  also wish her colleagues well under the stewardship of Ms McKenna in Ireland.  I thank the witnesses for being with us.  We will be happy to share our submission to the Government with them as soon as we have it prepared.  It will certainly be well in advance of any agreement on Estimates or budgets the Government might contemplate.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies Pringle and Martin Kenny and Senator Ruane.  We may be joined by other committee members over the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  I remind everyone to turn off their mobile phones so that they do not interfere with the recording.  We have a number of items on our agenda today, the first of which is the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020.  We have waived the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill so today's meeting is best described as an engagement with stakeholders to better inform the committee of the provisions contained in the Bill.  For clarity, we have already waived the scrutiny requirement so no further steps are necessary in order for the Bill to proceed to the next Stage.</p> <p>  We are joined by Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gubbins and Mr. Kevin McMeel from the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  From the Department of Justice, we are joined by Ms Rachel Woods, assistant secretary and head of legislation for criminal justice, and Mr. Brendan Bruen, principal officer.  We are joined remotely by Mr. William Browder from the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign.</p><p>Mr. Browder is joining us online and is very welcome to the committee.</p><p> I think all witnesses will be familiar with privilege and the rule that we do not criticise or make charges against any person who, or entity that, does not have a right to defend themselves in the committee.  That is particularly so in the case of Mr. Browder.  As he is online, we cannot guarantee that privilege will extend to any comments he may make.  Please be mindful of that when giving evidence.  Unfortunately, he cannot benefit from the same protections that accrue inside the committee room as may accrue outside it. I am sure Mr. Browder is very aware how all that works.</p><p> I will invite each of the three organisations before the committee today to make an opening statement.  As per usual committee practise, we will ask that each statement be curtailed to three minutes per organisation.  Then we will have further questions and answers between the members and witnesses as the meeting goes on.  We are going to have a slightly shorter time for questions and answers than we might usually allow.  I will ask each member to keep their questions and answers to three minutes.  We can do a second round if needs be but we will try to keep the meeting moving expeditiously.</p><p> We will begin with the Criminal Assets Bureau and Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gubbins.  There is a clock in the corner.  He can keep an eye on it, if he wants to mind his time.  He has three minutes to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

While CAB acknowledges the positive intentions behind the advancement of the Bill, it has concerns that those intentions may not be realised under its terms.  The Proceeds of Crime Act is a statutory scheme which essentially provides for the freezing and confiscation of assets which have been proved on the civil standard to be the proceeds of crime.  No prior conviction is necessary.  If CAB can provide evidence which, on the balance of probabilities, persuades the High Court that an asset is the proceeds of crime, then that asset shall, subject to an exemption for injustice, be confiscated.  Belief and hearsay evidence are, to a limited extent, permitted in such applications.  Proceedings taken under the Proceeds of Crime Act are referred to as &quot;in rem&quot;.  In basic terms, this means they are taken against the property itself as opposed to from the person in possession or control of the asset.  This has significant implications within the context of the EU restrictive measures against Russia and Belarus which seek to freeze assets on the basis of the identity of their owner and not on the basis of their provenance.  It appears that the Bill at least in part seeks to confiscate assets seized under the restrictive measures.<br/><br/>The concerns of CAB in relation to the efficacy of the Bill are twofold.  First, the Bill presupposes the existence of an identifiable category of assets which have been acquired by or in connection with conduct &ndash; amounting to or in connection with a gross human rights abuse, as defined in the Bill - which is a recognised offence in this jurisdiction but not in the jurisdiction in which it was committed.  In the absence of any clear examples, CAB has significant doubt as to whether such a category of assets exists.  While CAB recognises assets can be acquired through a limited number of offences which can take place in connection with gross human rights abuses - for example, corruption - this is almost certainly going to be recognised as a criminal offence <i>per se </i>in the jurisdiction in which it occurred.  The dual criminality provision under the Proceeds of Crime Act as currently drafted does not require the home jurisdiction to acknowledge a specific offence or offences as having taken place, it merely requires corruption <i>per se</i>to be recognised as a criminal offence in that jurisdiction.  The Bill will have no practical benefit in such circumstances.  Second, even assuming such a category of assets intended to be targeted by the Bill exists, it is the view of CAB that the evidential challenge of proving the occurrence of criminality in an unco-operative jurisdiction would likely render the chances of Ireland successfully confiscating such assets insurmountable.</p></speech>

As members are aware, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, has recognised the very important principles behind this Bill and has made absolutely clear that Ireland must not be a safe haven for illicit gains.  The Department recognises the vital importance, particularly in light of the situation in Ukraine, of ensuring public officials can be held accountable to the greatest possible extent for human rights abuses they commit.  A detailed submission has been provided to the committee and my colleagues and I are happy to address specific areas in more detail where that would be useful.  I will refer to some central points at this stage.</p> <p>  The first is the distinction between the political and judicial approaches to targeting assets.  The critical feature of the US Magnitsky Act, and indeed that of the more recent EU global human rights sanctions regime, is that a determination may be made at political level to freeze the assets of a person linked to human rights abuses.  Freezing does not require proof of a legal standard that the person has committed a specific abuse or that the assets in question result from such abuses.  On the contrary, the measures act against the person concerned, and any assets held by or for the benefit of that person.  Measures can be taken quickly and can target both those committing abuses along with those directing them.</p> <p>  This political approach is distinct from the judicial one taken in this Bill which hopes to use proceeds of crime legislation.  Seizures would be based on a court finding on a legal standard that an asset results from conduct which is both criminal in Ireland and a gross human rights abuse within the definition provided.  There is no difficulty in treating gross human rights abuses committed by public officials as criminal conduct and this, of course, applies even where an official might be somehow protected under their domestic law.  However, in most cases, gross violations of human rights will already be serious crimes under the law of the state concerned.</p> <p>  The question that arises is whether a person has done the conduct rather than whether the conduct constitutes a crime.  The major practical challenge is providing sufficient evidence to meet that legal standard.  However, the more fundamental difficulty is that human rights abuses do not usually create profits in and of themselves.  They may be committed by a person who is also committing other crimes that generate profits, such as corruption or fraud, or they may be committed to cover up such crimes.  However, the asset will still flow from the profit-generating crimes rather than from the human rights abuses.  Ultimately, it will be the link to the profit-generating crime that will need to be proven to support a proceeds of crime action.</p> <p>  In our initial assessment of the Bill, the Department identified four conditions that would need to apply in any given scenario for the Bill to yield a practical benefit: first, when conduct is an offence under Irish law but not in the other state; second, when the relevant asset is the proceeds of a human rights abuse rather than another form of crime; third, that sufficient evidence would be available to support a court finding; and fourth, that no other means of recovery is available.  The challenge we have faced is identifying situations where these conditions all apply.</p> <p>  We look forward to hearing from other witnesses and from members on this issue in particular.  If there is something that can genuinely be done to help target assets and counter abuses, then the Minister has been very clear that she will progress that.  In passing, I note that amending legislation to the Proceeds of Crime Act is under development and there is certainly further work to be done in this area.</p></speech>

It is great to see him again.  I thank members of the committee for this opportunity to discuss this hugely important legislation.  I am the head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign.  My work for the last 12 and a half years has stemmed from the murder of my lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, after he uncovered a massive Russian Government corruption scheme.  He exposed it and in retaliation he was arrested, tortured for 358 days and killed on 16 November 2009.  I have made it my mission since then to get justice for him and one of the main tools for justice is the legislation called the Magnitsky Act.  The Magnitsky Act was designed to freeze the assets and ban the visas of the people who killed Sergei Magnitsky, the people who profited from his crime and the people who commit similar types of crime in Russia and around the world.</p> <p>  The United States passed the Magnitsky Act in December 2012.  At that time, it was specifically for Russia.  The Magnitsky Act was then broadened in 2016 - it is called the Global Magnitsky Act - to apply to human rights abusers all over the world.</p><p>After that, the Canadian Parliament unanimously passed its own Magnitsky Act, as did the UK, European Union and Australia.  Norway has a Magnitsky Act, as do Kosovo and Montenegro.  I am hoping that this legislation being considered today will become the Irish Magnitsky Act to be passed in due course.</p><p> I wish to say a couple of things regarding what is happening in Ireland.  Some may ask why Ireland needs a Magnitsky Act or some version of it when the European Union has one.  I have seen the dysfunction of the European Union when it comes to sanctions.  Every country has a veto right over the sanctions list.  In the Magnitsky case the Hungarian Government vetoed any Magnitsky killers being sanctioned in the EU, so only the United States, Canada, the UK and Australia, along with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, have sanctioned Magnitsky's killers.  Those same individuals could travel to Ireland right now and open bank accounts in Ireland.  They could transact business and buy property in Ireland.  Ireland has an opportunity to have a Magnitsky Act whereby it can operate its own sovereignty, so Ireland is not a soft touch for people such as Magnitsky's killers and they cannot come to this country.</p><p> I also wish to respond quickly, if I have the time, to the statement by previous speakers.  The way the Magnitsky Act is structured in other countries is that a person is identified and any assets that belong to that person are subject to freezing.  It is next to impossible to prove that assets coming from a human rights abuse are in a jurisdiction.  It relies on the offending jurisdiction to provide evidence, which is often impossible.  However, it is not so impossible to provide evidence of human rights abuse, so it is very much in Ireland's interest to have a legislative measure similar to that of all the other countries which states that if a person is guilty of human rights abuse based on whatever legal standard Ireland decides to apply, that person's assets in Ireland's jurisdiction will be frozen.  Anything more complicated than that will make it an inoperable legislative measure.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

It is very interesting.  There will be a number of questions for Mr. Browder from around the table as regards understanding how this works elsewhere.  We have received submissions as to what difficulties and concerns exist from a legislative perspective so his input may be very useful in terms of how they have been overcome elsewhere.  I look forward to that discussion.</p> <p>  Each member will have approximately three minutes for their questions and answers.  I will give Deputy Howlin, as proposer of the Bill, greater latitude because I am sure he will have plenty to say about it and, in fairness, he has worked very hard to get it to this stage.  I invite Deputy Howlin to make some opening remarks and then put his questions.  I will not have him on the clock in the same way as others because he is the sponsor of the Bill.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome the written and detailed submissions from the Department of Justice, CAB and Mr. Browder, with whom I have had conversations.</p> <p>  I will make a few general points.  First, Magnitsky is a general heading.  When I looked at this some years ago, and this predates any current human rights abuses ongoing in Ukraine, I wanted to see how we could have something effective in our jurisdiction.  I was a member of the Government when the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 was enacted.  I remember many of the arguments made at the time, with all due respect to some of the arguments I have heard just now, about how impractical that unique new legislation would be to confiscate assets from people without a criminal conviction.  It was groundbreaking at the time, and impractical.  In fact, I had a discussion last night with Mr. Greg Sparks to refresh my memory - he was programme manager for Mr. Dick Spring at the time - and he gave me chapter and verse on how difficult it was to convince people, including senior officials in the Department of Justice, that this was actually a very practical thing.  It is now regarded as the most practical legislative measure we have to combat crime.</p> <p>  I will briefly go through the purpose of the Bill.  The purpose is to do a couple of simple things.  One is to enact that the conduct that takes place outside the State would be criminally unlawful if it occurred within the State and can be declared as criminal conduct if it would constitute an offence under the law of the State if it is connected with a gross human rights abuse and some property obtained or received as a result of or in connection with that conduct, that is, the gross human rights abuse, is situated within the State.  The rule would relieve CAB of the dual criminality issue.  CAB addressed that fairly in its submission.  I do not think it has a difficulty with the issue of removing the dual criminality test.  If it has, it should let me know.  In terms of gross human rights abuses, it would be a vacuous thing to try to do in some jurisdictions where obviously human rights abuses will never be made illegal and, in fact, are part of the normal operation of government.</p> <p>  In the CAB submission, it has adopted the argument that was put forward in the written submission from the Department of Justice which, at its core and is the core argument against it, is that while abuses may be committed by a person who is engaged in other profit-generating criminal activities such as corruption, fraud or embezzlement, the assets will flow from other crimes rather than from the human rights abuses themselves, and that the primary provisions of the existing 1996 legislation, in common with other confiscation frameworks, can only be used against the assets that are obtained from such criminal conduct.  That is the core of its case.  Even in situations where the human rights abuse is committed to cover up such profit-generating crimes, it is still essential, in CAB's contention as I read it, that the assets to be seized are the product of those crimes.</p> <p>  I challenge the Department's contention that the confiscation powers can only be used against assets that are the result of criminal conduct.  The definition of "proceeds of crime" is set out in section 1 of the 1996 Act as meaning "any property obtained or received at any time ... by or as a result of or in connection with" criminal conduct.  The passage quoted in the submission concentrates on two of those six tests, any one of which must be satisfied before property can be the proceeds of crime under the Act - if it was obtained by criminal conduct, if it was obtained as a result of criminal conduct, if it was obtained in connection with criminal conduct, if it was received by criminal conduct, if it was received as a result of criminal conduct and if it was received in connection with criminal conduct.  They are the definitions set out.  I contend, contrary to the point that was made, that it is not necessary that it flows from crime.  It is sufficient, and I was at the Cabinet table when these matters were discussed and agreed, that they were obtained or received in connection with crime, which obviously is a less onerous test.</p> <p>  If an individual or an official of a foreign state routinely abuses his or her position to commit gross human rights abuses, whether he or she is acting licitly or illicitly in connection with the office, it is our contention that if there are goods got in connection with the commission of those human rights abuses, he or she would be liable to have those goods confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act.  If the definition in the Bill I have drafted is not sufficiently clear, it is possible to amend it to make it sufficiently clear.</p> <p>  More troublingly, and I will end on this point, the submission goes on to assert that the seizure of assets arising from criminal conduct outside the State generally requires the co-operation of the authorities of that state.  Where gross human rights are alleged against persons in positions in authority, it is self-evident that this would present significant challenges.  The submission is willing to contemplate scenarios where a foreign state is co-operating with Irish authorities and in seeking Irish assistance to recover those assets that were corruptly obtained that are now located in Ireland, generally a legal issue with dual criminality does not arise in these cases, which are dealt with by way of mutual legal agreements.</p><p>My concern is this argument is unwilling to consider a scenario where the official in question serves under an uncooperative foreign state.  However, that is precisely the whole concept of what the Magnitsky laws are designed to deal with, namely, an uncooperative abusive foreign state where there are officials trying to act properly and whistleblow on that activity.  It seems the two contentious points that have been raised can be addressed.  First, by making it clear this direct connection of proceeds to a human rights abuse is not the definition intended in the original 1996 Act and, second, the co-operation of a foreign state will obviously not happen in this instance.</p><p> I am conscious the legislation I am proposing has universal application.  It is not simply confined to Russia, about which there has been some commentary today.  Mr. Browder is generally concerned with that but this Bill pre-dates the current activities of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.  It deals with any human rights abuser who wants to stash goods in Ireland.  Bluntly, the points made about the difficulties in getting evidence, or the challenges in following through on the legislation, have never been an impediment to us as legislators.  If were dealing with, for example, domestic abuse, it would never be a matter for us to say we could not deal with it because it is too difficult to get into the home to find out about the abuse or get a witness statement.  If something needs to be legislated for because it is the morally right thing to do, we should enact legislation no matter how challenging or difficult it is. </p></speech>

The question of at what point assets can be considered the proceeds of crime is very much at the root of this.  In the situations we have looked at, the human rights abuse does not generate the asset.  Even in the Sergei Magnitsky case, I do not think the argument is that the abuse itself generated the asset; the key question in that situation is what generated the asset.  In those cases where it is clearly corrupt behaviour, or the argument is that it is corrupt behaviour, embezzlement or fraud, there is no current impediment to being able to chase or freeze those assets.  The question of could it be connected else-----</p></speech>

I will respectfully say there is a slight disparity between the submission made by Mr. Browder and what is intended by the Bill.  As I understand it, Mr. Browder talked about - I do not mean this in a pejorative sense - the intention of the Magnitsky movement being to target the assets of gross human rights abusers worldwide, regardless of how those assets have been acquired.  In fact, Mr Browder alluded to the fact it is often just too difficult to be able to pinpoint a particular asset derived specifically from an act of gross human rights abuse.</p></speech>

It is important to recognise CAB does not object to the Bill in any way.  We are here to try to assist and point out difficulties we see.  That is important when we pointed to the evidential challenge.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  If there are evidential difficulties in bringing about a Bill, that is not necessarily a reason not to bring it about, but it is important for us as the people who will utilise the legislation to point out there are potential difficulties in realising practical benefits from the Bill.</p> <p> On what the Deputy pointed out, he is saying there would be a lower threshold in connection with the conduct than what asset can be specifically derived from it.  I have been involved with CAB for ten years and have been in my current role for three years.  I have looked at the jurisprudence in respect of proceeds of crime cases conducted by CAB over the full 25 years of its existence.  I have not seen a case that distinguishes specifically between what the Deputy pointed out.  I am not saying it is not included in the Bill but the courts always look to see whether the asset was derived specifically from the criminal conduct.  It does not need to be specific criminal conduct, but if we are saying that criminal conduct is now to be expanded and will not include the dual criminality provisions when that conduct constitutes a gross human rights abuse, or is in connection with a gross human rights abuse, the question then arises as to whether a gross human rights abuse in of itself can generate proceeds.  That is the point we are trying to make.  </p></speech>

I thank all the contributors for their presentations.  I will make a couple of general points.  I commend Deputy Howlin on bringing forward this legislation that is very apt in the present climate we find ourselves in.  The Magnitsky Act was mentioned, which was first introduced in the US in December 2012.  It was introduced in different jurisdictions around the globe thereafter.  How does this Bill compare to that?  Is there anything in the Magnitsky Act and not in this Bill that the witnesses believe would add strength to that legislation?</p> <p>  The CAB representative talked about co-operation and non-co-operation from offending States.  How big an issue is that?  If there is, as one would imagine, zero co-operation from an offending state, is that a game deadener?  Is there any life thereafter, if that is the case?</p> <p>  On assets more generally that are held by individuals from wherever - I may be slightly off tangent but I hope the Chair will bear with me - how do we find out, or what mechanism do we use as a State to find out, what individuals from what countries hold assets within this jurisdiction?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin McMeel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022062100002#E02000"><p>I am happy to deal with two of those questions regarding co-operation from a State in which the offence took place.</p><p>In a general context, we have dealt with corruption cases in Thailand and Nigeria in the last six to eight years.  We have been successful in those cases without the co-operation of the state in which the corruption occurred.  That was not because the state was unco-operative, but because we were able to get the evidence from elsewhere, from other international law enforcement partners.  I think the US authorities assisted in providing evidence in both those cases.  We were able to present that to the High Court to seize assets situated in this country that were the proceeds of corruption in the two jurisdictions I referred to.</p><p> This is part of the point we are trying to make.  Regarding the legislation as currently enacted, we had corruption in the example I gave.  Corruption is recognised as a criminal offence in Nigeria and Thailand.  Corruption is recognised as an offence, I would suspect, in virtually every jurisdiction we are seeking to target.  The question as to whether a particular act is recognised as corruption in a country is of little consequence in the High Court.  In the Magnitsky case, the case which brought about this whole affair, my understanding is that there was corruption which led to the generation of approximately $230 million worth of assets and that it was not recognised as an act of corruption in the jurisdiction in which it occurred.  In that case, under our current legislation, if there were assets in this jurisdiction which were identifiable and if we had evidence of corruption, we would still be able to seize and confiscate those assets, provided we had enough evidence to convince, on the balance of probabilities, the High Court that they were, in fact, the proceeds of that corruption.  Whether a gross human rights abuse occurred in connection with that corruption, or otherwise, would be immaterial because both would be recognised as a criminal offence in this jurisdiction and in the jurisdiction in which the offence occurred, although I recognise that the specific offence may not be recognised as having been an offence of corruption in the jurisdiction in which it occurred.</p><p> Co-operation is important, but it is not necessarily that important in the jurisdiction in which an offence occurred, provided the offence is an offence in the jurisdiction in which it occurred.  This Bill does not actually help us in that scenario.  The difference between the provisions of the 2012 Magnitsky Act in the US and the one we are dealing with here is as highlighted in the submission.  One is concerned with political sanctions and the other is legislation in the realm of the civil law, but it straddles the criminal law as well.  We must show an Irish court before a judge, and convince that judge, that the proceeds in a case are the proceeds of criminal conduct, whatever the definition of that criminal conduct might be.</p></speech>

I will bring him in now to give us his views.</p></speech>

I have seen this because I have worked now with many different governments and parliaments on these sanctions.  The Magnitsky case is all about, as was said, the uncovering by Sergei Magnitsky of a $230 million scam.  He exposed it and he was then arrested by the people he exposed and tortured to death.  A number of people were then involved in the cover-up of his murder and the financial crime he had exposed.  When we went to get sanctions imposed, certain countries, such as the UK, originally passed a Magnitsky Act that just went after human rights abuses.  They did not go after kleptocracy or corruption, and that meant they could only go after about 25 of the 50 people who had been sanctioned in America.  That was obviously not very helpful.  The people committing the human rights abuse tended to be some of the low-level officials, whereas the high-level officials were the ones who were involved in ordering the crime and in benefiting financially from it.  Eventually, the UK added a series of new provisions so that its legislation could capture corruption.  We ended up getting all the perpetrators, including those involved in the cover-up after the murder.</p> <p>  As far as this law goes, it is important that the definitions are not so tight that one cannot capture the people involved in a crime.  If one can prove that people are benefiting financially from a human rights abuse, that is great, but that is a very small subset of people.  To prove that somebody is involved in kleptocracy is much easier.  To prove that somebody has been involved in human rights abuse is not that hard, but to connect kleptocracy to human rights abuse is almost impossible.  Therefore, it is extremely important that the definition, however it ends up being defined, captures as many of these participants in the crime as possible.  When it comes to proving it, there are probably 500 people or entities now on the global Magnitsky list of the US.  I cannot say this with certainty, but I believe all those people were sanctioned not because there was any co-operation from any foreign government, but because of information provided by the victims, NGOs or by the US Government itself, which found ways of acquiring such information, through intelligence sources, etc.  If the burden of proof is on the balance of probabilities, that proof can come from wherever it needs to come from and it does not need to rely on the co-operation of a foreign government.  It would be naive and unrealistic to expect to expect one would get such co-operation from those people.</p></speech>

I have several questions.  The point made by the representatives of the Department was that the revenue from a human rights abuse might be derived from what is called a profit-generating crime as opposed to human rights abuse.  I would like to understand and flesh that out a little.  If people were engaged in human trafficking and then using those trafficked people in the commission of further crimes, be that drug distribution or other activities, is the relevant fact that they are incidental to the crime?  Is it incidental to the offence in this regard that the perpetrators are treating people in a way that violates their human rights?  Is the actual crime committed the drug trafficking or whatever other illegal activity it might be?  Is there a link if people&rsquo;s rights are being violated, in cases where that violation of rights does not generate a profit in itself?  I invite Mr. Browder to elaborate on that distinction a little further in respect of the statement that I think came from the Department.  That is why I am looking at Ms Woods.  I think she may have said it was a profit-generating crime rather than a human rights abuse.  Are they not interlinked?</p></speech>

The point, however, is that the assets generated by the profit-generating crime can already be seized.  We do not need further legislation.  If there is human trafficking or drug trafficking, then we already have the powers to seize those assets.  In those cases, we do not need to prove the much more difficult human rights abuse link.  This is the distinction.</p></speech>

Drug trafficking, in and of itself, involves human rights abuse.  In a narrow conception of human rights abuses, as set out in the definition, that is somewhat separate to those other offences.  To return to Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s point, when we are looking at an asset that results or is obtained from a certain type of conduct, we are also looking to see if that asset was obtained from drug trafficking, corruption, embezzlement or fraud.  I refer to the asset, in and of itself, not having resulted or having been obtained from the human rights abuse aspect of such an offence.</p></speech>

The difficulty, as it has been put to us, is that there may be assets within the jurisdiction generated by what are called existing crimes, shall we say, or more common or garden crimes, as opposed to human rights crimes.  Assets in those cases are already subject to the laws of the State and to seizure by CAB and similar agencies.  We may then have another scenario where a human rights abuser is resident in a different country but who happens to hold assets in this jurisdiction.  Our question in that scenario, which would appear to be the category at which this legislation is directed, is how we can be sure that those assets were generated or that wealth was created through activity involving human rights abuse.  Is this the central difficulty?</p></speech>

Let us say a human rights abuser is resident in another jurisdiction - it can be anywhere - and that human rights abuser is well chronicled and well documented and we would say that the burden of proof is met for the purpose of this consideration and that we have evidence that would arise in a prosecution, and that abuser has assets within the State of Ireland.  Is there a difficulty in moving on those assets and would this Bill help us to do that?</p></speech>

Mr. Browder talks about the intention of the movement as opposed to this particular Bill being concerned with the seizure of all assets that are owned by a human rights abuser regardless of how those assets are generated.  I hope I am not misinterpreting what was the intention.  I think Mr. Browder agrees with me.  If that is the case, then this provision, to my mind, will not achieve that result.  That is my concern and the concern of CAB, and I think it is also the concern of the Department in this regard.</p></speech>

The Department of Justice submission made it crystal clear.  I made a decision in crafting this legislation to modify the proven proceeds of crime legislation and to broaden the definitions of criminality to include abuses of human rights.  This is our stab at it.  It is different from many of the legislative pieces that are enacted in other jurisdictions that go under the banner of Magnitsky because I think this is an effective way of doing it.  It will not be uniform and it will not capture everything, but it does a number of things.  First, it is a signal that we regard human rights abuses as a very serious matter, if people want to have assets here.</p> <p>  If we look at the definition in the Bill, the conduct is connected with a gross human rights abuse if it involves acting as an agent for another in connection with a gross human rights abuse, directing or sponsoring such an activity that is a human rights abuse, and profiting from such an activity or providing material assistance in support of or connection with carrying on a human rights abuse, including by providing goods or services, or financial or technological assistance.  It is a broad definition.  My understanding is that the Department had two difficulties with the Bill from a practical point of view.  One was the dual criminality issue and I am not clear of the Department&rsquo;s stand on that now.  Does it still think the dual criminality test is an essential part?</p></speech>

I am going to wrap up the discussion shortly because we have other issues to discuss.  To elucidate that further, and I hope I do not complicate it further, if there is an individual who has clean money and dirty money, the clean money is accumulated through a legitimate business interest and the dirty money is accumulated through criminal activity or certain activity in another jurisdiction which has involved human rights abuses.  As I understand it, our objective in this Bill is to render that dirty money available to CAB and other agencies to be able to move on it.  There is a difficulty in the sense that the distinction must be made between how the money has been generated and whether it is the clean or dirty money.  Is that the issue?</p></speech>

He was the kleptocrat leader of the Republic of Nigeria in the 1990s and would have been guilty of, or certainly would have come within the definition of, gross human rights abuse.  His crime was embezzlement and corruption and, therefore, we were able to seize the moneys.  We were agnostic to the fact he was a gross human rights abuser and that did not come into it, other than that it added context to the embezzlement and corruption.  We were able to return those funds, which I think were somewhere in the region of $5 million, although I do not want to misquote.</p></speech>

We are now moving on to the next item.  All of our guests are very welcome.</p><p>I particularly welcome the sponsor of the Bill, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, whom I will be inviting to make some opening remarks shortly.<br/><br/>The purpose of this session of our meeting is to begin the pre-legislative scrutiny of a Private Members' Bill, the Ban on Sex for Rent Bill 2022.  We are joined by a number of witnesses, whom I believe are all here in person.  I am not sure if we have anybody online; I think everybody is in the building.  The witnesses are Ms Caroline Counihan, legal policy director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland; Ms Ann Murphy, a journalist from the <i>Irish Examiner</i>who has covered this area in a number of pieces; Mr. Gavin Elliott and Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly from Threshold; and Ms Rachel Woods, assistant secretary in the legislation division of the Department of Justice; and Ms Lisa Doherty, principal officer in the criminal legislation division of the Department of Justice.  They are all very welcome.<br/><br/>Since we are under pressure for time, I am going to take it as read that the witnesses joining us and the members are <i>au fait</i>with the rules on privilege and procedure in terms of not defaming anybody in their remarks or identifying or speaking unduly about another individual or entity that may be outside the remit of the committee today or may not have a right to respond.  There is a long preamble but it is really just good manners and common sense.  I will take it as read that members are <i>au fait</i>with all that.<br/><br/>I will invite Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, the sponsor of the Bill, to make some opening remarks.  When he has done so, I will proceed to the witnesses.  Some of them are here on their own steam and some, such as those from Threshold, are here as a group.  Each organisation will have a three-minute slot in which to make an opening statement.  Once we have taken opening statements from each group, we will go around the table.  The members will have different questions to put.  Each member will have three minutes in which to put questions and receive answers.  We will keep it moving because we are under pressure for time.  At the end of the public session, we will have a private session in which we will take some legal advice on the items we discussed.  The advice has been prepared by the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers.<br/><br/>I invite Deputy Cian O'Callaghan to address the committee.  He can take perhaps five minutes if he wishes to set the scene for the Bill and outline how he hopes it might be advanced.</p></speech>

I very much welcome that it is taking place.  I thank the organisations and individuals taking part.  I very much welcome any constructive suggestion as to how the Bill can be improved.  I am very open to amendments that members of the committee or other Members of the Oireachtas may have to strengthen it on Committee Stage.  It has two specific intentions, the first being to introduce a specific criminal offence for anyone who demands sex in lieu of rent or for reduced rent and the second being to introduce a specific offence for advertising sex in lieu of rent, for individuals placing an advertisement, a platform or publication or anyone involved in facilitating it.</p><p>To give the background to why I introduced the Bill, there have been many reports, particularly in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>by Ann Murphy, who has done very good work on this, and also RT&Eacute;'s &quot;Prime Time&quot; on the practice of putting renters under pressure to offer sex for a reduced rent or making available of accommodation in this regard.  There have been reports over a number of  years.  More recently, and very disturbingly, we have heard about some people trying to exploit people fleeing war in Ukraine.  We can all agree this is an abhorrent practice.  We must ask whether legislation is necessary.  In the D&aacute;il the Minister of State for Justice confirmed that no specific criminal offence exists for the practice, and the Garda confirmed for the housing committee that the PULSE system does not specifically record sex-for-rent complaints as a specific category.  That is not surprising given that it is not a specific criminal offence.  The point was made on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il by nearly all contributors that while this Bill would be welcome, no one is suggesting it would sort out all the problems and that there are not wider problems related to housing, renting and power imbalances.  It would be helpful all the same.  The potential value of the Bill is that it would act as a deterrent.  It would also assist renters and organisations that support renters in bringing forward complaints.  At present, any complaints would have to be made to fit the criteria of other legislation.  The Bill, if passed and strengthened, would be successful if it led to a reduction in the practice of putting pressure on renters.</p><p>We do not have full data on the extent of the problem.  We lack research in Ireland.  There is some evidence that migrants, in particular those with less access to support networks, have been targeted.  This has been seen from certain advertisements placed on platforms mostly used by migrants.  More extensive research has been done in the UK by the housing charity Shelter.  It suggests that 59,000 women in the UK were propositioned for sex in lieu of rent in a period of a year and a half between March 2020 and September 2021.  There is no equivalent quantitative research in Ireland at this point.</p><p>On Second Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il, the Minister of State raised a number of issues constructively that the Government felt needed to be addressed to tighten the wording, make the wording more precise and ensure the terms in the Bill are properly defined.  Concerns were also raised over the proportionality of the fines suggested in the Bill.  I welcome that input and am very much committed to working with members of the committee to address these concerns and improve and strengthen the Bill.  I very much look forward to hearing people's comments.</p></speech>

I am the legal director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  So-called sex for rent is a serious form of sexual exploitation and abuse of some of the most vulnerable people.  The opportunities for this form of abuse are multiplying as the shortage of affordable housing for rent becomes ever more acute.  This issue also needs to be addressed if the problem is to resolved effectively.</p> <p>  Rape Crisis Network Ireland is glad to see from the Second Stage debate that there is a consensus that this Bill needs to be enacted to deter future abusive sex-for-rent offers and also mark the gravity of this behaviour by criminalising it.  This legislation, if enacted, will also send a strong message that it is unacceptable to exploit a person's acute need for a roof over their head by making offers to supply accommodation and-or a reduced rent in return for sexual services.  If such an offer is not accepted, as the law stands now the offerer cannot be criminalised unless the other person is a prostitute.  This gap needs to be closed.</p> <p>  Rape Crisis Network Ireland urges all Members of the Oireachtas to work together to ensure first that it is legally robust and workable and second that it is passed and commenced as soon as possible.  It is needed urgently.</p> <p>  I have a few remarks on drafting, which I am going to truncate.  The full picture is set out in our detailed submission.  With regard to section 2, on the offence of requiring or accepting sex as a condition of accommodation, the words "require" and "accept" may not cover the situation where there is no explicit demand for sexual services but instead a suggestion that providing sexual services might unlock access to the accommodation or provide that accommodation at a reduced rent, or even no rent, or prevent eviction.  It should also criminalise advertising, offering, seeking to provide or providing any accommodation-related benefit in return for sexual services.  The term "sex" is too vague.  It must be possible to identify which sexual acts are criminalised.  The wording "as a condition of access to or retention of" does not necessarily cover where there is an offer to forgive all or part of the rent, including rent arrears, in return for sexual services.</p><p>The wording "as a condition of access to or retention of" does not necessarily cover the situation where there is an offer to forgive all or part of the rent, including rent arrears, in return for sexual services.  Either the wording should list all of the situations in which the landlord might seek the sexual services of a tenant in return for a housing benefit or it should use a blanket term such as "housing advantage", "housing benefit" or "accommodation-related benefit" to the tenant.  A wording broader than one involving a condition of acquiring some form of housing advantage is desirable.  For example, "in return for" is easier to prove and is clearer.  The term "accommodation or related services or transactions" should be defined so that it is clear what is and is not accommodation or related services or transactions.</p><p> In subsection (2), "provider of accommodation" is not defined.  With respect, we suggest that it ought to be.  It is not clear as to whether this offence can be committed by a company or other any other legal entity that is not a person.  It must also be clear as to whether it includes landlords who enter tenancy agreements, licensors renting rooms, people offering accommodation free of charge in return for certain non-sexual services, for example, caretaking, and so on.</p><p> With regard to-----</p></speech>

In September 2019, the then Solidarity Deputy, Ms Ruth Coppinger, highlighted a case in which a constituent had been offered a sex-for-rent arrangement when she could not afford a rent increase.  In January 2020, this reporter discovered a sex-for-rent arrangement being advertised in the Lough, Cork city, on a website called Locanto, which carries a wide variety of classified advertisements from Ireland and across the world.  One of the properties advertised in Limerick late last year on the same website was for a single lady &quot;with a twist&quot;.  The ad read: &quot;Can do reduced rent for occasional fun&quot;.  When contacted by this reporter posing as a prospective tenant, the landlord made it clear that sexual activity was required on a weekly basis in return for rent of &euro;200 for the first month and &euro;250 per month thereafter.  To establish the veracity of the landlord and the existence of the property, this reporter went to the house in the guise of the prospective tenant and met the landlord at the door.<br/><br/>In particular, foreign women have been offered reduced or no rent in return for sex or bed-sharing with landlords in different parts of the country.  In recent weeks, a number of advertisements have appeared online targeting Ukrainian women with offers of accommodation in Ireland in return for sex.  One relating to a property in Cavan was titled, &quot;Seeking a Ukraine woman&quot;, and was explicit in nature, offering a &quot;free bed in exchange for sexual pleasure for me&quot;.  The advertiser added: &quot;I can pick you up in Cavan if you can't drive need this asap please???&quot;  Such advertisements are still to be found online even as we discuss this legislation today.  Some are explicit in their content, as above, with recent ads offering &quot;friends with benefits&quot; arrangements or a room for rent for a sweet girl in Dublin, for example.<br/><br/>Testimony has been provided to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>by women offered sex-for-rent arrangements after they responded to rental accommodation advertisements on Facebook groups, classified advertisement websites and some more streamlined accommodation websites, including <i>daft.ie</i>.  In these instances, the offer was not mentioned in the advertisement.  Testimony from women previously targeted by such arrangements shows a reluctance to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make complaints for reasons including a fear that they will not be believed or taken seriously.  On some occasions, those offering sex-for-rent arrangements are people who are subletting rooms unknown to their own landlords.<br/><br/>Information on the precise nature and extent of sex-for-rent arrangements in Ireland is sporadic and anecdotal, unlike in the UK where research has been conducted by the homeless organisation, Shelter.  The findings of that study suggested that 30,000 women in Britain were propositioned with sex-for-rent arrangements between March 2020 and January 2021.  No such research has yet been carried out in Ireland.</p></speech>

We welcome the introduction of this legislation, which seeks to prevent the exploitation of people who are seeking a secure and safe home to rent.  I agree with and echo the comments that have already been made.  We are taking this opportunity to make comment on the Bill and recommend several changes, which we suggest would make it more victim friendly and ensure that protection and support were available to victims.</p> <p>  As Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has stated, the full extent of the issue is unknown.  A small number of private renters have spoken publicly, and none of us can be anything but horrified by what we have read in the press.  Few of Threshold's clients have reported such propositions by their landlords or prospective landlords to us.  This may not be particularly surprising, though, as it may not be the sort of issue that a renter would contact Threshold or, indeed, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, about.  No reporting mechanism is in place and, as we have heard from Deputy O'Callaghan, it is not an offence at the moment to engage in such behaviour.</p> <p>  While reliable evidence on the prevalence of the issue in Ireland is not available, international comparators can provide us with some troubling indications that the recent press reports on this issue may only be the tip of the iceberg.  Of particular concern is research from England, a jurisdiction that shares a similar rental culture to Ireland.  It would be a mistake not to regard the evidence that has been gathered in England about this practice as significant and an indication that the practice might not only be occurring in Ireland, but might be worse.  England is not experiencing an across-the-board housing crisis to the extent Ireland is.  Evidence of the prevalence of the issue in England must be viewed in light of a similar rental culture and a much more constrained rental market in Ireland.  We have heard about the research conducted by Shelter in England.  If those proportions were replicated in Ireland, it would equate to almost 4,000 renter households.  Obviously, there is a major caveat with this figure, but it is significant nonetheless.</p> <p>  The legislation in England has not been successful in tackling the issue despite attempts to do so, partly due to an attempt to prosecute offenders under more general legislation dealing with prostitution offences.  Since the issuing of prosecution guidelines in the UK in 2019, there has been just one successful prosecution.  The lesson from the UK is that shoehorning sex-for-rent offences into existing offences risks mislabelling the offences and obscuring the nature of both crimes.  Threshold suggests that the reporting of such offences be incorporated into existing victim-friendly processes, such as those created by the report, Supporting a Victim's Journey.  NGOs working with people who may be victims of these offences should be empowered to provide mechanisms through which people may make such disclosures.</p> <p>  We are particularly concerned for sitting tenants who report such practices.  As it stands, many private renters do not report wrongdoing by their landlords for fear of eviction.  In such precarious situations, a tenant may fear retaliation or penalisation by his or her landlord if he or she reports the landlord for requesting sex or sexual favours in exchange for accommodation.  A tenant may have no other housing options available and may be forced to remain under these circumstances, the only other option being homelessness.  We suggest that the Bill be made coherent with section 14 of the Residential Tenancies Act, which prohibits penalisation for making a report to certain bodies.  Incorporating in this Bill the making of a report might be sensible.</p> <p>  As currently drafted, the Bill will offer relatively little support to people who may be, or previously have been, in situations where there has been a sex-for-rent exchange.  Satellite supports for victims need to be considered and put in place to aid the effectiveness of the Bill.  This could include an expansion of domestic and-or sexual violence services to provide support for victims of these offences.  For example, people who are reporting such offences could, where necessary, be supported by an extension of the recent rent supplement protocol between the Department of Social Protection and Tusla, counselling and housing supports.  It is Threshold's experience that people, even in extreme housing difficulty, are sometimes forced to make a choice between unacceptable housing conditions and homelessness.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022062100002#L00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present the Department of Justice's views on this Private Member's Bill.  As the committee will be aware, during the debate on Second Stage, the Government did not oppose the Bill.  In his remarks the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, noted the Government's support for the objectives of the Bill, which aims to create an offence of requiring or accepting sex as a condition of accommodation or of facilitating same.  Both the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, are engaging on how best to address this unacceptable behaviour and are in agreement with the principle of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  The Attorney General has advised there are some concerns of a legal and drafting nature to be addressed to ensure it is legally sound and achieves its objectives.  The Minister of State outlined those concerns on Second Stage and they are detailed in the Department's submission, so I will not go over them again.  I will just reiterate that any agreement to pay for accommodation with sexual acts is invalid and not enforceable under contract law.  Additionally, sexual offences legislation makes it abundantly clear that consent must be freely and voluntarily given.  Submission when a person is forced or has no other choice is not the same as consent, and sex without consent is rape and punishable on conviction by up to life imprisonment.</p> <p>  The Department agrees with Deputy O'Callaghan and other stakeholders here, including Rape Crisis Network Ireland, that the behaviour this Bill aims to target is unacceptable and exploitative and should be subject to criminal sanction.  The Minister recognises there is a gap in the law here that has to be addressed, so any concerns we express are just about the manner in which that gap should be addressed.  The Department has some concern that the level of the penalty proposed risks blurring the lines between a sexual act which takes place in an exploitative situation and a non-consensual sexual act.  The proposed seven-year penalty in the Bill approaches that for sexual assault.  It may be that the offence we are considering is more closely aligned to the offence of purchasing sexual services, which is one of exploitation targeted at people, predominantly women, in vulnerable and sometimes desperate circumstances.  The penalty for that offence, however, is considerably lower.</p> <p>  The Department has highlighted the need to ensure any new offence created in this area takes account of the existing legislative framework.  The Department believes further consideration is required in that regard.  In that respect, the committee may wish to note that a review is under way of Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which deals with the purchase of sexual services.  Recommendations on strengthening the safety and well-being of persons who engage in sexual activity for payment are awaited and will inform further legislative efforts in this area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022062100002#L00400"><p>I have a number of observations and just one question.  I congratulate Deputy O'Callaghan on this piece of work.  It is important the committee has been able to provide further scrutiny of it.</p> <p>  Sex without consent is clearly rape.  Consent cannot be coerced.  Consent cannot be purchased lawfully.  Consent cannot be transacted.  Consent is consent; it is freely given.  The nature of this, however, is whether a person will be believed.  I am very glad Ms Murphy referred to that.  The nature of sexual exploitation is very rarely what we perceive as being directly violent and very rarely involves a stranger.  The vast bulk of sexual exploitation or abuse, as we know, is committed by somebody known to the victim.  It goes beyond agreed boundaries.  It is nuanced.  It is delicate.  It is practically always a surprise, practically always in the moment and practically always something that - and this is very important - creates doubt in the mind of the victim and a sense of surprise along the lines of "Did that really just happen?", or more specifically "Did I really just get asked that question?", or "Did that physically just happen?", or "Am I actually in this situation?".  There is always that moment of creating doubt.  The question of whether they will be believed is one all victims of sexual abuse and exploitation ask themselves.  That is particularly important when it comes to this issue.  It is already incredibly difficult to get a successful prosecution for any sexual offence.  It is already very difficult to reach the evidential standard relative to the number of offences we know are committed and the range of experiences of women in particular.</p> <p>  What is the Department's thinking on the evidential standard for this offence?  How does that compare with the other forms of sexual exploitation and efforts to purchase sex, which we know we are having difficulties with?  One thing I will draw to the attention of the committee is the group established by the National Women's Council called Beyond Exploitation.  Beyond Exploitation is run principally by the National Women's Council and Ruhama but is also linked in carefully with Dr. Ruth Breslin, who works in the sexual exploitation research programme in the Geary Institute of UCD.  These are serious programmes to highlight the nature of the difficulty of people forced by coercion or circumstance to sell sex.  This is especially the case with trafficked and vulnerable women.</p> <p>  I appreciate I have very little time, but that is my question to the Department as to how it thinks this offence will be proved if we get it into legislation, which I firmly believe we will.</p></speech>

All sexual offences are difficult to prove in certain circumstances.  It is quite clear that, no matter how an offence is constructed, there will be an element of "he said, she said" or two stories and two sides.  The position is difficult to prove.  However, the evidential standards will be those that apply in every other sexual offence.  In this case, where advertising is available, there can be actual physical evidence.  Often there are email, text or phone contacts.  Those would be the kinds of evidential supports available, but that will be a difficulty no matter how the offence is constructed.  That is inherent in almost all sexual offences.</p></speech>

As Deputy Carroll MacNeill stated, exploitation, including sexual exploitation, takes very many forms and is a spectrum.  It was interesting that in Ms Murphy's testimony she said testimony from women previously targeted shows a reluctance of victims to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for various reasons, including a fear they will not be believed.  It is important we send a message out from this committee that women - not just women, but mostly women - will be believed.  We should encourage them to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a pity no research on that has been carried out in Ireland.  It has come up time and again in this committee that the lack of proper statistics compared with what they have in England causes the way we deal with things to fall down in a lot of ways.  I reiterate a call for more effort and more funding to be put into that.</p> <p>  I agree with what Threshold said about victim-friendly processes and supporting the victim's journey.  That should be done.  Unfortunately, many private renters do not report landlords' wrongdoing.</p> <p>  As for RCNI's testimony, the point that stood out, because it tallies with the OPLA's opinion on this, is that we should all work together to ensure first that this legislation gets through, whether or not it has to be amended slightly.  It probably does.  RCNI's view is that it must be legally robust and workable and that it is important that it be passed as soon as possible.</p><p>Having said that, there are concerns in the OPLA advice about drafting, making sure that it is precise and maybe some amendments on the lack of definitions and clarity.  There is no point in sending it forward if we know there are likely to be constitutional difficulties with it.  Having spoken to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, I think he is open to amendments on that point.  There are also some concerns around the penalty clauses where more flexibility could be shown on that.  </p><p> I thank Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for his efforts and Ms Murphy for all the work she has done on this.  I have spoken to her in the past on it.  </p><p> The only question I have is for Ms Woods.  Given the OPLA report - I do not know if she has had a chance to look at it - has she any specific ideas where definitions could be tightened up or made more precise in order to ensure the Bill's successful passage through the Houses?</p></speech>

In many cases, there are other definitions on the Statute Book that would serve as a precedent.  The definitions might be fixed through amendment.</p></speech>

It is an important hole that needs to be plugged.  I endorse what my colleagues have said about consent and its non-transactional nature.</p> <p>  Given time, I will raise a couple of issues.  I do not accept what Threshold has said about the extrapolation from the British report.  However, given that we know anecdotally that this is happening, will the Department conduct research to establish what the extent of the problem is?  Second, Threshold mentioned that in the UK there has been a failure to achieve convictions in relation to its legislation.  Can we identify what the issues were?  Is it the old chestnut around sexual offences that there are difficulties believing people?  How do we address that?  I also agree with sending out the message that people will be taken seriously when they bring these offences to Garda attention and potentially in a way that they never have been before.  People need to understand there is a listening ear for this kind of thing.</p> <p>  I am conscious of what was said about the extent of the penalty that is available.  The point made was reasonable but I understand from Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that there was a certain openness to amendments around that.  However, the offence under section 2 does not cover asking where someone simply asks someone to enter into that arrangement.  The offence as currently structured refers to a requirement.  I think that it is important that we send out the message that any kind of discussion on this subject is not acceptable.  If we solely rely on the requirement we are saying that it is okay if someone has the strength and presence and the circumstances to be able to push back and reject the requirement.  However, the danger is that a vulnerable person, faced with this option would feel obliged to take it at any level.  Is there room in the Bill for simply asking that equally would be an offence under section 2?</p></speech>

We are not suggesting that they are particularly reliable but if they were extrapolated, they would give an idea of what the numbers might be in Ireland.</p> <p>  With the English experience, it was the attempt to use existing legislation that dealt with other issues, prostitution offences, to try to prosecute this particular offence that seemed to be the issue.  There was an attempt in the House of Lords to pass an amendment recently which I understand failed more for political reasons than for any reasons to do with the amendment itself.  The UK Government does seem to acknowledge that it has not been successful in achieving what it was supposed to and amendment is required to create a specific offence as this Bill seeks to do. </p></speech>

The kinds of tenancy should also be identified; are they landlord-tenant relationship or rent-a-room schemes?  Developing these proposals would benefit from research and a fairly careful understanding of the exact problem that we are trying to address.</p></speech>

In some cases, it is in private correspondence when someone applies to see a room.  In other cases it is a subletting arrangement where a person who was renting a room from their own landlord makes an arrangement with somebody else to enter into a sex-for-rent arrangement.  It is not always the landlord that is making the arrangement.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, there are often advertisements on websites but in many cases it is when private correspondence is entered into.  There might be a situation where someone has seen a room advertised as normal on a classified website or Facebook group and it is after that.  We have one case in Waterford where a woman made an arrangement to move and it was only after she got there, after moving in on the very first night that she was approached and offered a sex-for-rent arrangement.  She left in panic with her boyfriend who was with her.  When she went to work the next day the person who had required the sex-for-rent arrangement from her followed her to work.  He knew where she worked and he turned up at her workplace at lunchtime the following day.   There is a wide range of ways in which these arrangements are being offered to people.  </p></speech>

It is always depressing that any crisis is an opportunity for someone to exploit others who are the most vulnerable.  It is beyond shocking that this sort of thing exists.</p> <p>  I am obviously interested in the legislation being effective rather than simply enacted.  My question to the Department of Justice is whether there is similar legislation in other jurisdictions that captures this issue and has proven effective that we can look at as a model?  We have been grappling with general sexual offences legislation for a very long time.  It is always difficult to get convictions for sexual offences.</p> <p>  Second, in the review of the 2017 Act which we have been told is imminent, will this issue be part of any amending legislation that would come forward or does the Department support this stand-alone piece of legislation because of the urgency of the situation if the very clear evidence presented to us is happening right now? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-21a.332" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022062100002#N00100"><p>The two questions were quite closely linked, as it happens.  Very few other jurisdictions have an offence in this area.  Those that do, such as Britain, prosecute it as part of payment for sexual services or prostitution because they have defined prostitution as any payment or consideration including accommodation.  I was interested to hear the comments from other witnesses before the committee that they are not happy with that and that they believe it is not working.  It should be examined to determine why it is not working.</p> <p>  Northern Ireland also uses the same legislation for payment for sexual services, and it does not define that in terms of prostitution at all.  It refers to any consideration exchanged for sex and it does not define it in terms of prostitution.  Again, it would be worth considering how that is working there given that jurisdiction has not based the issue on prostitution.  Our legislation is not suitable in this area because the provision is very much defined as for the purposes of prostitution, but we could look at amending that area of law and widening what is in that legislation.  Waiting for the review to see whether what is there is working would be sensible before amending the legislation because amendments may be required following the review.</p> <p>  The alternative is to proceed with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill.  The Department does not have a firm position on what the best way to do this is because we do not have the review of the 2017 Act.  As for what we have looked at in other jurisdictions, nobody seems to have gone that way.  We are probably just not in a position where we know, or have a view on, what the better policy option is.</p></speech>

I am on the same page as Ms Woods from the Department of Justice; I am not sure what the best way to proceed is, either.  I love the idea of research, which speaks to the researcher bit of my soul, but I am also conscious, having had many conversations with Ms Murphy on this and having heard about it on the ground as well, that there is an urgent need for this.  If it is, after all, decided it is best to proceed with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill and to amend it, it will be important that it be drafted in such a way that it will capture the wide variety of cases Ms Murphy laid out for us.  What we see all the time is that sexual exploitation and abuse is a horrible amoeba.  It adapts to fit a shape that suits whatever the situation is.  Somebody who is determined to abuse another person sexually will find some way to do it.</p></speech>

I might put a few points before the committee for consideration.  What we are dealing with is, clearly, a first cousin of prostitution and pimping, whereby somebody is induced to provide sexual services by being offered some consideration in exchange.  Other types of offences that could also be closely related to this, such as the seeking of sexual favours in exchange for offering employment or a Harvey Weinstein situation whereby sexual favours are sought in exchange for recruitment, the offering of a contract or other things like that.  Whichever choice the Department makes, there is something to be said for widening the concept of prostitution to cover what I call the first cousin of prostitution and pimping, namely, what we are dealing with here.</p> <p>  I fully agree with Deputy Carroll MacNeill in that proving this is going to be very difficult.  Unless there are, say, text messages or a printed advertisement, it will be practically impossible to prove it because the offer will have been during an oral conversation, by innuendo or something like that.  Nevertheless, the fact it is difficult to prove does not mean it should be legal or that there should be no consequence to doing it.  As an example, if a male were to suggest to a female that she move in with him into his gaff and share his rent, while it may be clear from the circumstance that there is to be a sexual dimension to her moving in and that she will have to pay a portion of the rent in shared accommodation or whatever, it may not be so easy to prove.  It is essential, therefore, that the language of the legislation be very clear as to what it will or will not catch.  For instance, in Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's brave effort to work out who such an offender could be, the Bill refers to providers of accommodation or employees, agents or contractors of a provider, but in a lot of cases involving house-sharing, it will be very difficult to work out who is or is not a sharer and what his or her status is.  That is something we will have to bear in mind.  In England, there was recently a successful prosecution for incitement to prostitution, based on the English definition.  It was the case of a 53-year-old man who had made very explicit demands of a prospective tenant.</p> <p>  I am in two minds, like the Department of Justice, as to which is the correct way to go but I am equally convinced, as has been noted by others, that something should be done reasonably urgently about this, one way or the other.  I appreciate the Department is looking at the measures that were taken recently to make prostitutes immune from prosecution but the customer liable to be prosecuted.  I would love to see the Department take a simple step and  carry out a survey on the extent of prostitution in Ireland.  Unless I have a very prurient imagination, it seems a high number of odd-looking massage establishments are cropping up everywhere.  Unless there is very high demand for massage, I think prostitution is much more widespread now and that it is going under the flag of massage much more often than it used to.</p> <p>  I return to my main point.  Whatever language is put into the legislation has to be sufficient to capture me-too situations where people are asked to provide sex for a job or other things.  It should be in the context of revising the concept of prostitution and bringing in this cognate, first cousin of prostitution, whereby the concept of consideration can cover situations like this.  We cannot just long-finger it.  We cannot just say that because it is complicated, we should do nothing.  Clearly, the most vulnerable people are being exposed to this demand now.  Moreover, the Bill should extend to lodgers, given many people are now sharing homes on the tax-free lodger system and that must be wide open to the issue.</p> <p> I reiterate my congratulations to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan on taking the initiative in bringing the Bill before us.</p><p>It requires careful but nonetheless urgent work in order to make it effective.</p></speech>

As no other members are indicating, that concludes our witness engagement for this session.  We will have a legal briefing shortly, therefore, I ask members to hang on.  As regard the engagement with witnesses, it has been very helpful.  In addition to their oral testimony, we have their written submissions, which are extremely useful and will feed into our deliberation of the Bill as we consider it at the next stage.  I ask the members to remain <i>in situ</i>.  The witnesses can now leave the meeting as we have concluded our engagement.  I thank everyone for their input.</p></speech>
