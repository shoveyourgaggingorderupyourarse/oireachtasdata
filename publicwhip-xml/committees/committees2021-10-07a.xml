Apologies have been received from Deputy Hourigan, who has other committee duties this morning.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is attending remotely this morning but will join us in person for this afternoon's meeting.</p> <p>  As we return to participating in committee meetings in person, I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are advised to leave one vacant seat between themselves and others, to use sanitisers, etc., and to wear masks at all times except when speaking. </p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.</p> <p>  From this week onwards, the committee will conduct its public business on Thursdays.  As is the case today, we will engage in a three-hour session on Thursday mornings, suspend for lunch at 12.30 p.m. and resume at 1.30 p.m. to deal with correspondence and other business of the committee.</p></speech>

Today's meeting will focus on the NTMA's 2020 financial statements, chapters 15 and 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2020 report and chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2019 report.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the NTMA: Mr. Conor O'Kelly, chief executive officer; Mr. Frank O&rsquo;Connor, director of funding and debt management; Ms Susan O&rsquo;Halloran, chief legal officer; Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency; and Mr. Ian Black, chief financial and operating officer.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.  </p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Cathaoirleach, to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#A00600"><p>As members are aware, the National Treasury Management Agency is a very complex organisation with multiple important functions that extend beyond its original and core role in managing Ireland&rsquo;s national debt.  This wide range of functions is reflected in the scale and detail of the annual report and of the financial statements, which were published in June.  Separate financial statements are provided for the different key functions.</p> <p>  Chapter 15 provides an overview of the NTMA&rsquo;s operations in 2020, and highlights a number of key developments in the year.</p> <p>  As I have already stated, the NTMA&rsquo;s primary function is to manage borrowing on behalf of the State.  The results of that borrowing activity are reported in the national debt account.  After a long period of relative stability, Ireland&rsquo;s national debt increased significantly in 2020.  At the end of the year, the national debt stood at &euro;219.5 billion.  This represented a net increase of &euro;12.75 billion, or 6%, on the end of 2019 national debt.  The increase in 2020 was largely attributable to the additional funding requirements as a result of the deterioration in the public finances related to the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  While the debt level increased, the cost of servicing the national debt continued to fall in 2020, due to refinancing of the stock of debt at the prevailing low interest rates.  Total debt servicing costs in 2020 amounted to &euro;4.7 billion.  This was over &euro;500 million less than in 2019.</p> <p>  The financial statements of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, show a reduction of &euro;2.3 billion, or 15%, in the value of the fund&rsquo;s net assets between the end of 2019 and the end of 2020.  The assets were valued at &euro;12.7 billion at the year end and were held in two portfolios: a directed investment portfolio, accounting for 31% of the net assets and a discretionary investment portfolio, accounting for 69%.  The loss incurred by the fund in 2020 was due to a drop of just over &euro;3 billion in the value of the directed portfolio, offset by an increase of just under &euro;700 million in the net asset value of the discretionary portfolio.  The fall in the value of the directed portfolio in 2020 followed a drop in value of over &euro;1 billion in 2019.  These losses were related to the fund&rsquo;s shareholding in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.</p> <p>  In 2020, the Minister instructed the NTMA to make a &euro;2 billion fund available within the ISIF discretionary portfolio to support medium and large enterprises affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, through the provision of lending on a commercial basis.  Known as the pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, this facility was availed of by four businesses in 2020, to a combined value of &euro;237 million or just under 12% of the available fund.</p> <p>  The financial statements of the State Claims Agency record claims awards and settlements, and related expenses, totalling &euro;430 million in 2020.  This was similar to the level of expenditure incurred in 2019.  These costs are recovered by the agency from the relevant State authorities within its scope of operation.  The agency&rsquo;s estimate of the value of claims liabilities outstanding at the end of 2020 was &euro;4.03 billion.  This has been rising steadily over recent years.  Health sector bodies accounted for 92% of the estimated outstanding liability.  This includes claims related to the HSE&rsquo;s CervicalCheck programme.  During 2020, the HSE received notification of 100 such cases, bringing the total notifications to 234.  Of these, 22 had been concluded by the end of 2020.  Also during 2020, the scope of claims within the agency&rsquo;s remit was expanded to include the management of potential claims against private healthcare providers assisting in the public health response to the Covid-19 pandemic and in providing acute care generally under temporary contracting arrangements.</p> <p>  In late 2020, the Minister directed the NTMA to transfer assets to the value of &euro;1.5 billion from the national surplus reserve fund, also known as the "rainy day fund", to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  This amount represented the total balance on the rainy day fund, originally transferred from the ISIF in late 2019.</p> <p>  Members will recall the circumstances that gave rise to the creation of the Ireland Apple escrow fund in 2018, into which Apple deposited &euro;14.3 billion.  In terms of value, this fund is on the same general scale as the ISIF.  The NTMA has been delegated by the Minister for Finance to carry out, on his behalf, a range of functions in respect of the escrow fund.  This includes production of the annual audited financial statements of the fund, which are published separately from other NTMA accounts.  In line with the conservative investment policy agreed between the NTMA and Apple representatives, the escrow fund is invested in highly-rated, euro-denominated, fixed-income securities, or held as cash and cash equivalents.</p><p>These tend to be low-yielding investments.  In the current interest rate environment, some of these assets yield negative returns.  As at the end of 2020, the net assets of the escrow fund were &euro;13.984 billion.  This represents a decrease of &euro;36 million from the 2019 net assets balance of &euro;14.02 billion.  The operating costs of the fund for 2020 were &euro;7 million.</p><p> "State savings" is the combined named applied by the NTMA to a range of Government savings products offered to savers in Ireland.  Such savings include balances held in An Post deposit accounts.  These are accounted for in the financial statements of the post office savings bank fund.  The level of deposits by savers in their An Post accounts has been growing steadily in recent years, notwithstanding the reduced returns that can be earned due to the prevailing low-interest environment.  At end 2020, total deposits by savers were &euro;3.9 billion, up almost 15% from &euro;3.4 billion at end 2019.  The fund&rsquo;s net interest income and returns on investments have fallen significantly.  This is in contrast to the operating expenses incurred, which have been relatively static at approximately &euro;28 million a year.  As a result, the fund has incurred deficits each year since 2015, with the exception of 2019.  The deficit for 2020 was &euro;13.8 million.  As a result, the retained earnings of the fund continued to fall in 2020, standing at just under &euro;72 million at end 2020.  This compares with a peak of &euro;190 million in retained reserves in the fund reported at the end of 2014.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Kelly has five minutes, which I understand he wants to share with Mr. Breen.  Mr. O'Kelly's opening statement, which I read yesterday, is quite long.  I ask the witnesses to take two and a half minutes each and to give a summary of the opening statement, which is available to members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to appear.  I will summarise the opening statement, as the Chairman has suggested.</p> <p>  Starting with the funding and debt management area, which was the original business of the NTMA, it has been a pretty significant period post the pandemic and the unprecedented pro-cyclical response, which was the first pro-cyclical fiscal response in the history of the State, when the Government took the action it did post the pandemic.  That action has had the impact of keeping a floor under the economy and that policy has been enormously impactful.  All of that pandemic spending has been funded through borrowing and since the pandemic began we have borrowed just under &euro;36 billion at an average interest rate of 0.16%, or just under two tenths of 1%.</p> <p>  The fiscal responses that were replicated right across Europe were complemented by the activities of the European Central Bank, ECB, and that is a critical point for everybody to understand in terms of the context and environment in which we are operating.  It is not a single credit response from Ireland; this is Europe-wide.  In that context, the European Central Bank's actions have been extraordinary.  One of the things members will have read recently in the newspapers is that after the financial crisis, it took the ECB seven years to introduce quantitative easing but that, with the onset of the pandemic, it took only seven days for it to intervene with its bond-buying programmes.  That is not far from being exactly what happened.  The extent of the bond-buying engaged in by the ECB has been extraordinary.  European sovereigns are estimated to have issued &euro;1 trillion in total in 2020 and will issue approximately the same amount in 2021.  The ECB's bond-buying programmes have been expanded to almost the equivalent of that issuance.  The net issuance to investors is almost zero.  In essence, the ECB is buying sovereign bonds almost one for one and that is what has allowed Ireland and other sovereigns to borrow so much so cheaply and effectively.  The ECB, with its language and actions, is ensuring that that environment is likely to stay like that for quite a few years to come.</p> <p>  The other advantage we have is that we have termed out Ireland's debt significantly during this low-rate period.  We have one of the longest maturities in Europe, at just under 11 years, and we have one of the smoothest profiles in terms of our debt.  What I mean by that is that there is no one year where there is a significant disproportionate funding chimney or cliff .  The environment has allowed us to do that as well.  We also have significant amounts of cash in hand.  As a result, the debt profile and locking in those low interest rates for a very long period gives us significant-----</p></speech>

My apologies but I have to try to keep it to the five minutes in order to allow questions afterwards.</p></speech>

I had read the opening statements twice, and I know that members are diligent about these things.  I respect the fact that Mr. O'Kelly has outlined the big picture in terms of the debt.  Mr. Breen has just over a minute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#B00700"><p>The State Claims Agency, as our annual report has disclosed, was managing 12,000 active claims against State bodies in 2020, with an estimated outstanding liability of more than &euro;4 billion.  Some 3,500 of these relate to clinical cases, with an estimate of approximately &euro;3 billion, and 8,500 non-clinical ones, with an estimate of &euro;1 billion.  We resolved more than 3,200 claims in 2020 despite the impact of Covid restrictions, which resulted in the courts being effectively restricted to trials relating to urgent personal injury claims for most of the year.  Our focus during 2020 and 2021 has been on supporting the system's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, by ensuring that indemnity was not a barrier to that response.</p></speech>

My apologies for having to cut them short.  They will understand that we have to get through a lot during this meeting.  I thank them for the information and for their opening statements.  The lead speaker today is Deputy Devlin.  He will have 15 minutes and every other speaker will have ten.  I ask for members' co-operation, particularly we want to make sure that each member gets to contribute.  If there is time for it later, I will allow a second round of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#B00900"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening statements and for the information provided to the committee in advance.  I will start with the escrow fund.  I note Mr. O'Kelly's comments in his opening statement.  The total net assets in the fund decreased by an alarming &euro;36 million in 2020 and, I think, &euro;16 million in 2019.  That brings the fund to &euro;13.98 billion, which is approximately 87.6% of its original value.  The matters before the European courts may take a few years -  and Mr. O'Kelly might offer his own opinion on that - but in terms of the exposure for the State, if this were to decrease further or go on for a number of years does Mr. O'Kelly estimate the amount in the fund dropping further?  Is there an exposure to the State if the fund is not managed and is decreasing in value all the time?  There is an equal relationship between Apple and the NTMA in managing the fund.  I ask Mr. O'Kelly to comment on that matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#B01000"><p>The fund is operating in a negative interest rate environment, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said earlier.  While it is quite difficult to get our heads around it, even for those of us who are professionals in the market, this fund is investing in sovereign bonds for the most part and the lowest-risk securities.  Its investment strategy is designed to protect the capital as much as possible in order that there is very little risk involved.</p><p>As I said in my statement, it is designed to produce a return of capital, not a return on capital.  It is not investing for returns; it is investing to protect that capital.  However, even in protecting capital in today's world, German Government bonds and even many Irish Government bonds trade at negative yield.  We benefit from that when we are borrowing, of course, but when we are saving or investing, as we are in this fund, that is the other side of the same coin.  In fact, when we designed and looked at the scenario analysis for this fund, when we first looked at the portfolio, we thought that the average yield on the fund, given the securities in which we were investing, would be minus 50 basis points.  On a portfolio of &euro;14 billion, that would be a loss of &euro;70 million per annum, so it was designed at the outset to potentially lose that amount unless the interest rate environment changed, and it has not.  That is the investment process.</p><p> I will ask Ms O'Halloran to talk about the timelines in terms of the Apple escrow, which is an important feature of determining our investment strategy.  Of course, Deputy Devlin is correct to say that this fund is currently owned by Apple and Ireland together, but I will ask Ms O'Halloran to touch on the time span that we have ahead of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan O'Halloran" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#C00200"><p>The moneys that are in the escrow fund will remain in escrow until there has been a final determination of the appeal by the European courts.  At the moment, we do not know how long that will be.  What I can say to Deputy Devlin is that in July 2020 the General Court in Europe made its decision annulling, effectively, the Commission's decision and finding, therefore, in favour of the State and Apple, but the Commission subsequently appealed the ruling of the General Court to the European Court of Justice.  That litigation is being managed by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Attorney General's office and legal advisers.  At this point, we do not have a clear picture as to how long it will take for that case to run its course.  We suspect it will probably be another couple of years.  We understand that there has not been a date set for the oral hearing as yet.</p></speech>

I presume, given that answer, that the NTMA will be back before the committee and we will be discussing escrow several times between now and a final determination by the European courts.  Is there any liability for the State if the fund goes below a certain level?  I accept that the NTMA is looking for a return, and it is not for investment purposes but just to manage the fund, but if that fund were to continue to fall, is there any stipulation in the agreement that there is any further liability to the State?</p></speech>

There are a number of charges in respect of that annual fee for managing the money.  We appoint in the public procurement process three global asset managers, if you like, to manage three separate tranches of that, and they are paid a fixed fee for doing that.  Then we also have a custodian appointed entity, which is Bank of New York Mellon.  It was appointed following a public procurement process.  In the context of a &euro;14 billion fund, &euro;7 million is quite a modest fee in terms of a percentage of the assets under management and would be quite attractive for the kinds of assets we are talking about.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses elaborate on that tax, please?</p></speech>

What that relates to is US withholding tax.  Under the US tax rules, as a general matter, withholding tax is deductible from interest from a US source that is payable to a non-resident.  There are various exemptions and situations in which that does not apply.  Deputy Devlin will see that the withholding tax that is referred to there was repaid and refunded in full to the fund in 2020.  The reason it was deducted in the first place was that our escrow agent custodian, Bank of New York Mellon, has the obligation to make the deduction, so it is its obligation to look after that, and it notified the NTMA and Apple that it had made a mistake in its classification of the escrow fund for US tax purposes.  It corrected that and it has confirmed the classification as an escrow settlement fund for US tax purposes, which effectively means that no US withholding tax will be deducted until such time as the escrow fund is released from escrow.</p></speech>

I have one last question about the escrow fund.  I note that there is a formal investment meeting or deliberation in November and that there was another one in 2019, if I am not mistaken.  The use of the word "formal" suggests there are informal, ongoing discussions or meetings regarding this fund.  Can one of the witnesses elaborate on that element, please?</p></speech>

With a fund of this size, with this sort of complexity and with the amount of securities that are owned, there could be daily discussions about issues that might emerge.  We regularly have formal investment meetings of all parties, of Apple and Ireland, which are minuted, of course, throughout the year.  We also have our own internal escrow Apple committee in the NTMA, of which I am the chair.  That meets regularly and, of course, all those meetings are minuted also.</p></speech>

I note that there were 12,175 active claims by the end of 2020.  That was a 5% increase on the figure for 2019, with an estimated total of &euro;4 billion in potential liability.  Can somebody give a breakdown sector by sector?  I note there was some breakdown.  I think it was 92% for Tusla and the Department of Health and, I think, 6% encompassing the Departments of Justice, Defence and Education.  Is there a breakdown of that 92% between the Department of Health and Tusla?  Do the witnesses have that with them?</p></speech>

It would be helpful for all the various sectors.  I know it has been broken down for us but it would be nice to see it broken down further.  From the initial establishment in 2012, I think the liability at that stage stood at about &euro;1 billion, so we have increased it rapidly over the years.  What is the main reason for those continuous increases year on year, bearing in mind, as I said, that we had a 5% increase from 2019?</p></speech>

Critically, during that period we also had the alteration in the real rate of return in a case called Gill Russell <i>v</i>. the HSE.  That had a very dramatic effect of increasing the potential liabilities and the actual liabilities of both schemes, but particularly the clinical negligence scheme.  There are other issues.</p><p>If we look at clinical negligence, the costs of those claims are rising for a number of reasons.  I mentioned the real rate of return.  Life expectancy for many claimants has vastly improved.  This is reflected in the amount of damages.  For all of these reasons, it is a rising cost.  We expect it to rise more significantly over the coming years as our actuaries have predicted and told us it will.</p></speech>

I note that 53% of the cases were resolved in 2020 without court proceedings being instigated, which is worthy of compliment.  Mediation forms a large part of this.  What other steps are being taken to reduce the liability and the number of claims year on year by the NTMA and the individual Departments and State agencies concerned?</p></speech>

One deals with non-clinical risks arising and the other deals with clinical risk.  One of the principal issues we deal with is how we feed back into the system the lessons learned from the occurrence of claims.  We work with Departments and healthcare facilities.  The whole aim is to reduce the risk so that, most importantly, there will be no harm to people and in order that we can reduce the cost of claims to the State.</p></speech>

By way of introduction, of course we do.  We have performance analysis and take account of an enormous number of variables in making decisions with regard to which primary dealers to choose to use for various syndications.  We have constant reviews and appraisals of the performance of all of our dealers.  Monitoring is a key part of what we do in the NTMA, and what the team does.  Mr. O'Connor will give more detail.</p></speech>

In the late 1990s, there were approximately six primary dealers.  Over time, we peaked at 18.  At present, we have 14 primary dealers.  All of these dealers have various metrics to meet in terms of hours of quoting, bond prices, their activity and their obligations to bid at auctions.  We have a range of criteria to assess them.  When they compete, it is on a syndication as this is the only time they earn fees.  They do not earn fees for auction participation.  We have a range of criteria.  The dominant criteria are auction performance and taking down bonds.  There is also secondary market turnover.  There are other categories for their treasury bill performance, market research, how they deliver on roadshows, hours of quoting and compliance with quoting in the market.  It will not surprise the Deputy to hear that every day there is interaction from our bond team and short-term team with all of these primary dealers.  There are also regular meetings throughout the year.  In the next week or two, we will have a senior executive meeting with the senior people in each of these institutions.  Again, it all comes back to criteria throughout the year and constant review and feedback.</p></speech>

Is this considered to be good value for money?</p></speech>

I spoke to the clerk and the Chair before the meeting.  I have a personal interest in this matter but we think it is a matter of public interest and not a conflict of interest, as such.  I wanted to mention that at the outset.  I will ask about the scheme and, in particular, how it relates to maternity hospitals.  There was a report by Mr. Peter Boylan in recent years about the scale of injuries that occur in neonatal situations, either to women or young babies, with life-altering consequences in some cases.  The State Claims Agency manages the clinical indemnity scheme.  What have been the costs of that scheme in recent years?  Is the costs profile changing and, if so, how?  I would like to understand that better.  I will also ask about the national incident management system, NIMS, but I ask Mr. Breen to respond first?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#E00900"><p>The clinical indemnity scheme is a particular challenge in terms of its cost, as the Deputy knows.  As she mentioned, there have been incidents involving catastrophic injuries to babies and, indeed, generally in clinical negligence.  The fact of the matter is that the costs associated with these cerebral palsy cases are very high and, obviously, there is significant injury to children and families have to carry the cost of future care and looking after children over a period of time.</p> <p>  The profile has not changed terribly over the number of years we have been dealing with it, except that the costs have continued to increase fairly dramatically.  I will break down incidents of cerebral palsy for the Deputy, by way of an example.  In 2016, there were 21 such cases.  In 2017, there were 24 such cases.  In 2018, there were 17 cases.  In 2019, there were 27 cases.  In 2020, there were 12.  In this year to date, there have been six.  That is a total of 107 to date.  That shows that a fairly consistent incidence rate is being notified to us.  </p> <p>  One of the difficulties that sometimes arises is that for families, the diagnosis of cerebral palsy takes some time and the claim is not made for many years until there is some knowledge as to how the child might be progressing, what the child will require and what his or her life expectancy might be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#E01000"><p>It is interesting that a similar number of cases has been reported.  It does, of course, take time for a brain injury diagnosis of some kind to manifest and for people to become aware of it.  I am interested in the risk notification by the hospitals.  I do not presume to know about all cases, but in many of them, there are circumstances in which the injury could have been avoided.  From the State's perspective, for the protection of its citizens and from a financial perspective, it wants to avoid as many of those cases as possible.</p> <p>  I have two questions, the first of which is around the risk register and NIMS.  When something happens, it may not be apparent to the hospital or the parents that a brain injury has occurred.  Are hospitals consistently reporting incidents that were risky and concerning, and where they possibly do not know the outcome?  How is that translated then to what actually happens in terms of litigation?  Let us imagine a difficult birth with questions around it.  No one is sure how the child is.  The child may or may not be in the neonatal unit.  Are the hospitals consistently referring those things to the State Claims Agency in a way that allows the agency to analyse whether the hospitals have been responding correctly, sufficiently or accurately?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#E01100"><p>I will give the Deputy an idea of the overall number of incidents, covering clinical and non-clinical.  In 2018, there were 200,000 incidents on NIMS.  There were 213,000 incidents in 2019, 211,000 in 2020 and there have been 150,000 to date this year.  The Deputy is right.  What normally happens is that when a clinical incident occurs in a hospital, particularly if it is a serious incident involving a child who, after birth, obviously has had some difficulties and is in a neonatal intensive care unit, for example, hospitals are generally good at advising such incidents to us.  We pick up on them.  As the Deputy says, they are a vital source of data in relation to lessons to be learned.  Our clinical risk team is always engaged in an analysis of these incidents as they are notified to us.</p></speech>

That happens.  We have a key performance indicator system with all of our hospitals whereby we look at the rates of reporting to us and write to them if we feel they are falling short of what we believe to be acceptable for an acute hospital or a maternity hospital, for example.</p></speech>

I know they are not all cerebral palsy cases or anything of that nature, and there is a much broader range of cases.  I understand Mr. Breen was only giving that as an example.  I speak to parents who have gone through litigation processes to secure funds for their children for the long term.  In other cases, where there has been a death, parents have gone through the process because they felt there was no other measure of accountability with the hospital, that the hospital was not responding to them, the board had not taken the matter seriously and they were not being responded to.  I do not want to name any but there have been cases in the media this year where things like that have happened.  If, for example, somebody has a risky situation like that and it has been notified to NIMS, is there any obligation on the hospital to tell the parents and family?</p></speech>

That would be a great innovation.</p></speech>

In the case of a brain-damaged infant, because they are such tragic cases, hospitals want us to deal with them as quickly as we possibly can.  That is what we wish to do as well.  We aim to get to the end of cases in the shortest possible period of time.</p></speech>

Incidents occur and no claims flow from them.  In all instances, what happens is that the delegated State authority or healthcare institution puts up on the national incident management system details of the occurrence of an incident.  As I said previously, this is a really rich source of data for us and for the individual bodies, which can look at what their risk profile is, how claims against them arise and what they should be doing on a lessons-learned basis to stop claims from happening.  The principal aim of that is to not cause harm to people.</p></speech>

What is the percentage rate comparable for loans given in this regard from commercial banks?</p></speech>

It can lend money, which it has done in terms of debt instruments, and it can also put equity into these companies if that is what is required.  It can do something in between - a convertible equity loan - whatever the company might need.  The real attraction of the ISIF as opposed to a credit lending institution is that it can go across the risk capital spectrum, which very often is required, particularly in difficult circumstances.  The second thing to say is that as mandated in legislation, the ISIF has a commercial bottom line and must produce a commercial return so we must act commercially.  We would not necessarily compete on price with other commercial entities.</p></speech>

The SBCI drew down &euro;25 million of the facility in 2016.  In 2017, another &euro;25 million loan was converted into shares in the SBCI.  These were issued to the Minister in accordance with the Act.  In October 2020, the Minister subscribed for an additional &euro;50 million shares at &euro;1 each in SBCI.  The subscription was paid for by an immediate conversion of the &euro;50 million loan advanced by the ISIF.  All shares issued by the SBCI are directly held by the Minister for Finance.  That is correct.  In December 2020, the balance of the available commitment under the ISIF-SBCI loan facility was &euro;165 million.  Why was a loan facility made available to the SBCI in October 2020?</p></speech>

The SBCI needs equity.  It is essentially acting as a bank.  As it increases its loan portfolio, which it has done significantly and thankfully over the past few years - lending more and more to SMEs and providing the credit guarantee scheme during the pandemic - it needs more equity capital to support those loans.  That equity capital comes from the ISIF as directed by the Minister for Finance.  Essentially, there would be a board decision where it seek more capital, the Minister would agree that this capital was required and the ISIF would then be directed to transfer that capital.</p></speech>

They referred to losses incurred by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund.  At the end of December 2020, the ISIF had net assets of &euro;12.7 billion, while in 2019, the figure was &euro;15 billion.  That amounts to a decrease of &euro;3 billion in the directed investment portfolio, from &euro;7 billion to &euro;4 billion.  Our guests stated that is due to a decline in the market value of AIB and Bank of Ireland shares.   In respect of the directed investment portfolio, how many AIB and Bank of Ireland shares are held by the State and what is their current value?</p></speech>

The ISIF made a fund of &euro;2 billion available on the Minister's instructions in May 2020.  As was stated earlier, the fund sought to support medium and large enterprises affected by the pandemic.  One of the criteria was that the enterprises would have more than 250 employees.  In regard to the fund of &euro;2 billion that was established for the pandemic, why was &euro;237 million paid to support only four businesses?  What were the businesses and what were the terms of the investment?</p></speech>

So far in 2021, we have committed an additional &euro;400 million to companies impacted by the pandemic.  The Minister called it a stabilisation and recovery fund for a reason.  Companies were going to need stabilisation and the economic cycle was going to be different for different sectors.  As the Deputy can imagine, we have been able to support some airlines, some businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector that have been hit and some regional and indigenous businesses to help them grow post pandemic.  I can give the committee a list of all the investments we have made that are in the public domain.  Some of them have not yet been completed.  We have committed that investment capital but, as the Deputy can understand, some of them are commercial and sensitive.  Of those we have completed, I am happy to make a full list available.  In total, we have invested &euro;800 million in commitments on behalf of that fund.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to predict the future in respect of investing when we are taking risks but a lot of these are fine companies that have been affected by the pandemic.  They were fine companies before the pandemic hit and they will be fine companies after the pandemic.  The role the Minister asked us to play was to ensure these big employers and big indigenous Irish companies were not knocked out by the pandemic and could recover, maintain those jobs and grow into the future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#H00300"><p>We cannot make public the commitments that have not yet been drawn down and finalised.  There is, therefore, a lag between those.  Let us take the &euro;800 million as commitments.  On the Deputy's question on why more has not been drawn down.  When the fund was set up, I said at the launch that I hoped none of the money would be drawn down.  This was not a target.  A fund worth &euro;2 billion was made available in the hope that it would not be needed, not that it would be needed.  This was designed for companies that ran into difficulty due to the pandemic.  The longer companies struggled and the more sectors that struggled, the more we would be needed.  As we see from all the available data, the economy is, thankfully, recovering quickly in the majority of sectors.  There are only a minority of sectors still affected by the pandemic, including the travel, tourism and hospitality sectors.  One can, therefore, imagine that they tend to be the focus but it is my hope that the funds will not be drawn down.</p> <p>  In addition, we are seen as an investor of last resort.  These companies are well managed and have their own shareholder base and financial providers.  If they need money, they can approach other providers of capital; it does not have to be the Government.  The Government is there as a safety net and the provider of investment capital of last resort.  Many companies are incredibly well managed and in good shape, and do not require the State's help thankfully.  My hope is that there will not be much more drawn down and we will get back to the original business of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is investing in key priority themes such as housing and regional development.</p></speech>

The four companies we have been made aware of in that regard are: Aer Lingus with a &euro;150 million loan; DAA, with a &euro;40 million loan; Staycity, with a &euro;30 million loan; and Finance Ireland, with a &euro;17 million loan.  How long does Mr. Kelly expect those arrangements to remain in place?  Will those companies seek to transfer those debts to a commercial arrangement with no State involvement?</p></speech>

That is the hope of the NTMA and the companies with which we are in dialogue.  One can imagine from both points of view, that such emergency funding is not wanted.  We do not necessarily want to be a long-term investor and they do not necessarily want us to be a long-term investor.  Many of the instruments we have put together are designed to allow us to get repaid quickly and it is hoped we can be taken out of the equation.  We can then reinvest that capital elsewhere, as needed by the economy.  That is what the fund is designed to do.  It is called an evergreen fund that continues to grow, produces returns and returns capital, and can then move into areas where there is less capital available and more State capital is required.  That is the long-term objective.</p></speech>

The agency's outstanding liability is now three and a half times what it was in 2012.  Why has the outstanding liability increased to such a degree?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#H00900"><p>As I said in response to a previous speaker, there are a number of reasons for that increase.  One reason is that the volume of claims has increased as we had new delegations.  One feature of the State Claims Agency that is probably not the case with a general insurer is mass actions.  We have a number of mass actions and, in fact, 30% of the entire non-clinical portfolio is based on mass actions.  Those mass actions increase the volume of claims and, as I said earlier, there is an inflationary effect of the decrease in the real rate of return - the personal injury discount rate - on the damages.  I agree it is challenging and this challenge will increase.  We know that from what our actuaries, who look at the schemes, are telling us.  We are doing everything we can to defray that and it is one of the great challenges facing us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#H01000"><p>Mr. Breen is correct in that mass actions are a significant portion of the portfolio, and it is interesting to note that figure of 30%.  I will now turn to two areas where such liabilities do, or might, exist.  During the pandemic, the governance arrangement was extended to private hospitals and the liabilities during Covid were also taken within the remit of State Claims Agency.  Does the NTMA have a picture of what claims are outstanding in those private hospitals during the first phase of the pandemic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#H01100"><p>We do not at this stage, and there is no surprise in that.  Normally, as the Deputy will know, the Statute of Limitations in regard to claims is, generally, two years other than for infants and some other special categories.  We tend not to see the effect of the coverage of something like that until late in that cycle.  While we have seen some claims, there has not been a significant number.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#H01200"><p>That is also related to the number of claims in 2019 compared to 2020.  One might have thought that when everything was shutting down, the number of claims would also have been affected and been reduced, however, it seems to be the same figure.  Does Mr. Breen expect a reduction in the number of claims in 2021 and 2022 as a result of less activity during the pandemic or does he believe there will be an increase?  I welcome any insight he might have into that at present</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#H01300"><p>The Deputy has made a good point.  Between 2016 and 2020, there was a 36% increase - which includes mass actions - in the number of clinical claims and there was a 21% increase in the number of general claims.  The Deputy might be interested to know that in 2019, we had 2,375 non-clinical claims.  That figure dropped off to 1,958 in 2020, which equates to a 17% decrease.  The Deputy is correct in that we expect that figure to pick up as the courts get into their stride again and we return to normality following the intense period of the pandemic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#H01400"><p>The other area the term "a mass claim" would be used is in the claims relating to the CervicalCheck screening programme.  I understand the State Claims Agency was notified of 234 claims against the HSE regarding the CervicalCheck programme in 2020, which was an increase from 134 in 2019.  Will Mr. Breen speak to us about the cost to the State for the 22 cases that have concluded to date in the CervicalCheck litigation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#H01500"><p>It might help the Deputy if I were to update his figures.  The current figure is 305 cases for CervicalCheck.  This is broken into 245 cases from claimants and an extra 60 cases from family members in regard to issues such as psychological injury.  Forty-one cases have concluded, 33 of which were in respect of claimants and eight in respect of family members.</p> <p>  On the matter of outstanding liability for the State against those claims, the Deputy must understand that our liability - the State's liability - is limited almost exclusively to the non-disclosure element that has been involved in that.  In the case of the late Ruth Morrissey against the HSE, the High Court decided that that figure was &euro;10,000.  The laboratories carry the principal liability and, therefore, the State's liability is pretty well capped at the amount that pays for non-disclosure.  As the Deputy may know, we also have a separate Government scheme whereby women can apply directly on a non-disclosure basis and get a payment without going to court.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Breen saying he cannot indicate to us the total cost to the State of those 22 cases at this point?</p></speech>

I can send that on to the Deputy and give the total cost to date of what we paid in both compensation and legal costs.  I can send that separately.</p></speech>

Mr. Breen tells us that there are 12,000 active claims.  Is a solicitor involved in every one of these cases to get them to the point that they arrive at the State Claims Agency?</p></speech>

Normally, a number of claims will go through that route and will be settled, or claimants will opt out of that scheme and the claims will be contested.  Clinical claims do not fall within the ambit of PIAB.  Those are the two routes.</p></speech>

I want to be efficient with the time so I would appreciate if we can keep the answers short.  The contingent liability is in the region of &euro;4 billion but that does not crystallise until the claim is actually paid.  Claims are paid as they arise.  Will Mr. Breen give a breakdown, for the last three years, of the number of claims that crystallised and were mediated as opposed to going through the courts?</p></speech>

That breaks down to &euro;3 billion for clinical and &euro;1 billion for general.  Of the &euro;3.2 billion that relates to clinical, &euro;2.3 billion, or 70%, relates to catastrophic injury claims.  Regarding mediation, in 2020, damages were paid in 25% of cases on the clinical side.  In 2021, that has jumped to 37%.</p></speech>

We saw such a case this week.  No amount of money can undo damage that is done at birth, in the case of cerebral palsy.

Most of our staff on the clinical side have been trained as mediators.  Therefore, they have been through a process of formal training in mediation.  We are big proponents of mediation as an alternative to the courts system.</p></speech>

We have had engagement at previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts about the value of mediated settlements.  It is more cost-efficient and it is also the least damaging way to deal with claims from the point of view of protracted litigation and so on, and also from the point of view of the kind of engagement that should happen with people where there is a legitimate claim.  The number of mediated settlements increased.  Mr. Breen says the State Claims Agency is going to build on that.  The absence of the court route seems to be the reason this ended up being the case.  When the courts open up, how will the State Claims Agency avoid going back to the practice that obtained before the escalation in mediated settlements?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that the pandemic forced good behaviours.  I do not mean good behaviour from us because we have always been a proponent of mediation, but for some plaintiffs' lawyers, it was an eye-opener, that this was a better system and one can get to a settlement much quicker.

The answer stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The HSE has not recognised any contingent liabilities in the last ten years.  This is mainly due to the fact that the nature of such liabilities for the HSE mainly arise as a result of current ongoing litigation. Due to this, it is difficult to determine a) if payment will be probable ... </blockquote> <p>It continues by referring to some test cases having gone through the courts.  Does Mr. Breen know what those test cases might be?  Have they concluded?  In that reply, the mindset of the HSE seems to be that contingent liability is exclusively related to current ongoing litigation.  Has Mr. Breen noticed a culture in this regard in the HSE, given that mediation is not even included and the process is predicated on ongoing litigation?  Am I reading that wrongly?</p></speech>

There are 245 cases of claims from women - not including their families - for psychological injury.  That is the total number.  They are all at different stages.

Mediation is dependent upon two parties which means we, the State or the laboratories as defendants in the context of CervicalCheck, and plaintiffs, that is, lawyers, must enter into that process.  There has been a good measure of success.  For example, if we look at the 41 cases concluded on CervicalCheck, mediation was offered in 28 cases and took place in 23 of them.  Quite clearly, it was a good process and much better than a court judgment or women having to give evidence in court.</p></speech>

I was asked previously whether the State could continue to extend its borrowing for matters such as housing.  I was trying to say that when one is investing for capital and infrastructure investment, the market and credit rating agencies look on that much more favourably than current expenditure.  It is important for us to get our current expenditure, our household budget if you like, back in balance and in surplus.  Investors give a little bit more room for capital expenditure, especially if it is productive and recognising there is a housing crisis.  There is some room there but our debt has become quite elevated.  When we come through the pandemic, we will have borrowings of between &euro;250 billion and &euro;260 billion.  The more elevated the debt, the more prone one is to future risks.  One has to bear in mind that one has less and less capacity, for obvious reasons.</p></speech>

If we were going to borrow more for capital investment, we would have to be sure we were offsetting that somewhere around our current expenditure profile.  I would be much more focused on getting the current spending down and making sure that gets back into balance.  If that was the case and I could be confident we would be back in balance in the budget, I would be prepared to give a little more room, but there are so many things.  One cannot keep borrowing for every project.  We have to get the books back in order at some point.</p><p>That is not really for the benefit of the bond gods or anything like that, as I have said before.  One of the reasons we could react so quickly to the pandemic and pull so hard on the fiscal lever was that we were in such good shape.  We had budget surpluses for the two years coming into the pandemic.  That is why we were able to respond as quickly as we did.  We will have to prepare the economy for these cycles long into the future.</p></speech>

The other figure I am looking for is the amount that has been paid out per annum on medical negligence claims over the past five years.

Most of our cases are settled at some point in the cycle.  The only time we would usually go to court is in cases where there is a very substantial issue in regard to liability or causation or where we simply could not settle for the sum claimed.</p></speech>

Of that number, on what percentage does Mr. Breen believe there will be payouts?</p></speech>

Between 2016 and 2020 in Canada, for example, there was a total of 3,806 resolved legal cases.  Of that number, 44% were judgments in favour of the plaintiff, 5.9% were in favour of the physician, 1,384 cases, or 36.4%, were settled with the plaintiff, and 2,156, or 55.6%, were dismissed.  In Sweden, &euro;61 million was paid out in claims in 2020.  Why is there such a disparity in the figures for Ireland in regard to claims?  Is it the case that there is a far higher level of mismanagement here?  Is there a problem with the way we manage patients in our hospital system?</p></speech>

The Deputy made some comparisons with countries that are not common-law jurisdictions.  If we look to the UK, which is a better comparator, we see that in its accounts for 2021, &euro;2.3 billion has been paid out under its clinical negligence scheme and the other non-clinical negligence schemes in operation there.  In a common-law jurisdiction such as ours, where there is a court process, there is a significant element of any claim that is compensation and then we have all the costs, of both plaintiff and defendant, on top of that.  That is a unique feature of common-law jurisdictions and, therefore, making comparisons with other European countries or Canada is not quite the same.</p></speech>

There is a calculation of life expectancy and how much he or she will require per year.  Does Mr. Breen agree we are facing a problem now in regard to compensation because any legal practice that has more than &euro;1 million in its current account will be charged a penalty of 0.5% by its bank?  A solicitor's client account would have quite a lot of money in it because funds are coming in for the purchase of houses, for instance, and the administration of estates that are awaiting tax clearance before the moneys can be distributed.  In a situation where money is paid out in, say, an infant case, how can that now be managed?  The funds obviously have to be invested wisely and there are restrictions on where they can be invested.  Will there now be an added cost in the form of the penalties being imposed by the banks?</p></speech>

The moneys we pay in compensation are paid directly into court and are managed by an investment committee in the wards of court system.  That committee will be looking for the best return it can get on the moneys.  Investment is subject to provisos, such as the one to which the Deputy referred.  I spoke about the real rate of return.  There is pressure in that regard.  As the Deputy may know, the real rate of return in respect of Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales is lower than it is in the Republic right now.  We are facing the prospect of litigation on that particular point in the months ahead.</p></speech>

Is this new challenge being looked at in terms of how it can be managed into the future?  Everyone wants to make sure that people who have suffered catastrophic injuries are adequately compensated and have sufficient revenue available to them to provide the level of support they require.  My experience of the Office of Wards of Court, and I am looking for clarification on this, is that it has delivered a negative return on investments.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that none of us wants to see a situation where the moneys for the future care of any child would run out over that period.</p><p>If we have the periodic payment or the statutory scheme in place, it is a much better scheme because we get the transfer of that investment risk to the State - us - which would be the provider of the periodic payment orders, PPOs.</p></speech>

Following that case, the Minister for Justice has established an interdepartmental group which is looking at that index with a view to revising it and making it a more suitable index for the making of PPOs.  There are six old PPOs that are in place in regard to the original index.  In the meantime, we are making interim payments wherever we can for families for three, five or ten years.</p></speech>

Given the way it is dealt with, some cases are dragging on for quite a period of time.  I asked another question.  What is the timescale from the time a solicitor&rsquo;s letter issues to the time of coming to a settlement?</p></speech>

Clearly, we are dependent on lots of things happening in that period, such as getting reports from experts, which can take time, and there is the legal process itself.  That is the kind of timescale we have narrowed it to.  If we had the pre-action protocol, that could be narrowed, we think, to the equivalent period in the UK, which is about 12 months or 11 months.</p></speech>

I will let Deputy Colm Burke back in later.  If members want to come in for a second round of questions, they should raise their hand signal or indicate in the room, given some people are in the room and some are online.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Mr. O'Kelly.  With regard to corporation tax, we are all aware of what is happening this week, in fact today, in regard to corporation tax.  He has expressed concern at the reliance of the State and Revenue on corporation tax and I think has suggested in the past that it was not a sustainable platform for the State.  If we are too reliant on corporation tax, how will the OECD floor of 15% impact us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#N00700"><p>First, I do not really have an opinion on that and I do not think I have expressed one in the past.  What we have tried to do is tell the committee and policymakers what we are hearing from investors.  What really matters is not what I think but what our investors, who are lending us the money, think the risks are to Ireland and how are they viewing those risks.  On corporation tax and certainty around Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental industrial model around attracting multinational corporations and having this dual engine economy, any threat to that or any change to that is understandably a concern and they are watching developments very closely.  It has been the position for the last year.  I do not know if Mr. O'Connor wants to comment as he has been on the road with investors &ndash; virtually, of course - for the last 12 months.  It is their No. 1 concern at the current time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#N00800"><p>Does Mr. O&rsquo;Kelly see it having major consequences in terms of our revenue intake?  Obviously, it will be a higher rate.  I am somebody who would argue for the 12.5% but for that to be collected, although that is another day&rsquo;s work in regard to some of the large multinationals having opt-out clauses or arrangements where the full 12.5% was not being collected.  If we are going to have a 15% floor under the OECD rules, I presume our European neighbours will want to see us collecting the 15%.  What consequences does Mr. O'Kelly see that change having for revenue intake?  I take on board that the NTMA are the people with the listening ear.  They are talking to the people who will be impacted by this and who have a special interest in it.  I think it will be accepted that the NTMA is in the know on this, more than many of us.  What are the consequences of that change in terms of fluctuations and it being a greater amount or a lesser amount?  Has the NTMA run figures on that and does it have a model on that?</p></speech>

It is a very complex business.  We have Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, and there is an awful lot we do not know yet about how this could turn out.  We know the Department has put in a provision to indicate that it thinks that &euro;2 billion per annum is the potential long-term impact.  I think that is a reasonably prudent forecast to take but it is way too early to say.  The devil is in the detail and there is so much negotiation and so much we do not know.</p> <p>  At the same time, Ireland is a great place to do business.  We know multinationals are here not just for tax reasons.  Take our recent interaction with Stripe, for example, which is making a huge commitment to Ireland in terms of jobs and its second headquarters, and tax has never come up in any of the conversations we would have with them about Ireland as a jurisdiction and as somewhere they want to do business and do more business.  I would not overstate the overall impact of this if it goes along the kind of tramlines we are talking about now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#N01000"><p>So 2.5% extra will not terrify them.  Is that what Mr. O'Kelly is saying?  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  I want to move to the issue of NAMA.  I know it is not particularly under the remit of the NTMA but, obviously, what has happened there is connected to a lot of its work.  I thank the NTMA for the information and the map it sent to us in preparation for this meeting.  While it has its own board, it is semi-detached, if we like, from the NTMA.  We could try to explain this for a week but the map sets out clearly the NTMA's relationship with these three bodies, and the functions are listed underneath.</p> <p>  The par value of the impaired loans taken over by NAMA was &euro;74 billion.  It paid in the region of &euro;32 billion for those loans, and that was the bailout with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We had NAMA here last week.  It hopes to achieve around &euro;36 billion of a return, so we will get the &euro;32 billion back plus somewhere between &euro;4 billion and &euro;5 billion.  If we take everything into account, including revenue, we are probably talking of a sum closer to &euro;5 billion, so, at best, we will get somewhere close to &euro;37 billion.  However, that leaves us with just over &euro;37 billion of a gap.  That is the bit that sticks in the taxpayers&rsquo; craw and in the public&rsquo;s craw in terms of the bailout.  While NAMA explained this to us at length last week and it will gain from those assets and loans what was given to NAMA - the &euro;32 billion - and that bit extra in terms of &euro;4.5 billion to &euro;5 billion, there is still a &euro;37 billion or &euro;38 billion shortfall.</p> <p>  My question is this.  I would be of the opinion, from listening to economists and various other commentators over the last period, that a lot of that was sold too quickly, first, but also that it was sold in very large lots, which reduced the number of bidders.  Obviously, the more bidders there are, the more competitive the process is.  Is it Mr. O'Kelly's opinion, looking back now with hindsight, that had we been able to hold some of those portfolios for just a couple of years longer and subdivided them into smaller lots, we would have got a better outcome and would have been able to close some of that bailout and relieve the taxpayers of some of that liability they have been stuck with?</p></speech>

NAMA is not my remit, as the Chairman knows, and I have no accountability for that area.  I know NAMA was in with the committee.</p></speech>

We provide corporate services.  In terms of the Chairman's wider question on the macro picture, I remember that, when we were speaking to investors six or seven years ago, the total loans that NAMA took on were considered a contingent liability of the State at that stage.</p><p>Many people were reluctant to lend us money while that liability was still unresolved.  Many thought that NAMA would not recover anything like the amount it recovered.  The context and the environment change.  I recall a time when that was a big hangover for Ireland with regard to its ability to borrow on the bond markets.  That is no longer the case, and that is a welcome development.</p></speech>

The NTMA has a direct role in these, wearing the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, hat.  It does the procurement and hands it over when it is ready to go to the relevant Department or State agency.  The NTMA has used it a lot and promoted it for different infrastructure.  Britain, as I understand it, has moved away from PPPs since 2017.  The Tory Government in England and Scotland has moved away from PPPs.  Does Mr. O'Kelly think that we may have been too reliant on PPPs?  I understand the logic that you get the motorway quickly, with the private sector putting in a certain amount of money.  When the cost over the full term is considered, does Mr. O'Kelly think that we have been too quick to move towards them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021100700002#O00500"><p>I do not.  I take the opposite view.  I do not think we do enough of them; not by a long shot.  There are a number of times when PPPs are a channel that is more attractive than others.  A major consideration is whether there is an interest in having things off-balance sheet due to worries about levels of debt?  Another major consideration is whether interest rates are low in absolute terms.  PPPs are essentially another way of locking in low interest rates for 25 years.  I would have argued for a long time that if those conditions pertain, then that is a period when the channel should be opened and more should be done.  When those circumstances are not in place, there is no worry about being off-balance sheet and you are happy with debt levels, or if interest rates go significantly higher in nominal terms, then I would pull back on PPPs.</p> <p>  Circumstances at the moment are so favourable that we want to do as much off-balance sheet as possible.  Interest rates are low and are effectively being locked in.  I find the current environment to be attractive for doing PPPs.  I do not think the State does enough of them.  I would like to see us doing more, especially for social housing.  The NDFA has produced its first 1,500 social houses at attractive costs.  On average, it was &euro;250,000 to build each of the houses.  It pays about 3% to investors to manage those PPPs and finance them for us over 25 years.  They are high-quality houses which have been effectively and efficiently built.  We should do much more of them.</p></speech>

For example, the total cost to the State of the Convention Centre Dublin was reported to be &euro;416 million.  It was discovered later that the State could have built it for about half that amount.  The company that the OPW partnered with, Spencer Dock Development Company, went into liquidation and had to be bailed out by NAMA.  This entity here, the Oireachtas, had to rent back, or pay a charge - some people dispute the use of the word "rent" - of &euro;25,000 a day for it afterwards.  The Limerick tunnel is underused.  Mr. O'Kelly knows that last year, especially during the strict six or seven-week lockdown due to Covid, traffic volumes went down dramatically.  There was a clause relating to when traffic volumes dropped below a certain level on those roads.  In the case of the Limerick tunnel, there could be a bill of hundreds of millions of euro.  Part of the N7 and N8 route goes through Laois.  It was constructed in the 2000s.  The taxpayer ponied up approximately 80% of the money for that and has to pay a maintenance fee of &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million a year.  I recall the figure clearly.  The motorist, who is the taxpayer, has to pay a toll.  After 25 years, when the road will need substantial repair, renovation and replacement of surfaces, repairs to foundations and so on, the taxpayer will then pay to get it back.  The cost over 25 years is a significant liability to the State and taxpayer.  Sometimes PPPs may be appropriate.  I do not argue that.  I am saying that a number which have not turned out to be good news for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

Those are handled by the National Transport Authority.  We just deal with accommodation PPPs.  I will give an example in that regard.  The Grangegorman campus of Technological University Dublin was the largest PPP taken on in the history of the State.  It was taken to the Supreme Court for two years and challenged by one of the underbidders.  It was hit by the pandemic.  This month, 10,000 students will arrive on campus to fine infrastructure that has been delivered almost exactly on budget since the financial close five years ago, despite all of the cycles and what has happened, with just some small adjustments for inflation.  Compared with infrastructure that the State procures directly, it stands up extremely well.  Building infrastructure is tough.  We have many plans to build infrastructure.

That is true.  I have one.  The ECB did whatever it took, including the introduction of interest rates, in this environment.  The actions that have been taken in the last years, including bond buying and the Commission's support to next generation EU loans and grants, and that commitment and environment, allow us to do what we are doing, including borrowing and lengthening the maturity.  Any change to that is probably the biggest risk that we have to look for.  Ultimately, we will have to reduce those bond-buying programmes.  The ECB will change its stance and tack.  Higher inflationary pressures would make it change faster than its current predicted path.  That is something to keep an eye on since it is probably the biggest risk or change.  Even if that happens, we are already locked in and protected until 2025 or 2026.  Even if the stance of the ECB changes, Ireland will not face a refinancing risk or see the consequences until the latter half of this decade.</p></speech>

During the break, I discussed this with some of my colleagues.  It is obviously an issue of exceptional public interest given the risk to the young citizens of our State.  With the financial risk to the State and the ongoing liabilities, it is one of the biggest issues that we face.  Going back to the nitty gritty of the relationship between the State Claims Agency and the hospitals, how the incidents are notified and the accountability of the hospitals to the State Claims Agency, I ask Mr. Breen to describe the dialogue with the hospitals.  For example, if a risky incident has occurred, is the hospital board ever required by the State Claims Agency to present on the risk incidents that have occurred and the steps it took subsequently?  I ask Mr. Breen to answer that question first and then we might go on.  </p></speech>

Obviously, there are incidents that result in outcomes other than cerebral palsy.  That is not the universe of experience in any sense.  Is that not very serious?  Those are 26 children and 26 families who are impacted with their lives entirely altered.  I am not suggesting this is a role of the State Claims Agency, but at what point does the State determine that 26 is just far too many?  In most cases these are caused by a failure to intervene in a timely way.  I am not suggesting that any number is an acceptable number of cases.  I am concerned that we have insufficient accountability from hospitals with the current scheme.  We have an inability to oversee it in a way that says we understand that there are situations where incidents will occur and there was nothing we could do about them but there are far too many incidents where we have had to admit liability and apologise where a timely intervention might have avoided it and its lifelong consequences.  Is it time now to review the clinical indemnity scheme?</p> <p>  I might come back to this in private session.  I think it is time the committee asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to review the clinical indemnity scheme.  I know he did a report on it in 2012.  It needs to look at the role of hospital accountability, risk incidents, reviews involving parents and the presentations to the State Claims Agency or others regarding risk incidents.  We need to mandate the opportunity for external reviews into hospitals to be done as a condition of continued participation in the clinical indemnity scheme.  We need to look at what protection we offer consultants, nurses and other people working in the hospitals who identify problems to parents and who are essentially quiet whistleblowers within the hospital system, rather than presenting any risk to them.</p> <p>  At the moment we have incident after incident.  Dr. Peter Boylan did a report on it and we are hearing it from the State Claims Agency today.  It impacts those families and those children for the rest of their lives.  It is too serious and the State is paying for it.  We see the level of exposure and the level of personal hurt.  I would like to discuss it in private session and I hope I will get the support of my colleagues in seeking a timely review by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

The cerebral palsy rate in Ireland, which is 1.5 to 2 per 1,000 live births, is very much in line with the standard across the First World in terms of obstetric care.  The perinatal mortality rate, which is 3.5 per 1,000 live births, again reaches the level of not being out of step internationally.  Our maternal mortality rate, which is 5.4, compares very favourably, for example, with that in the UK, which is 9.7.  I absolutely accept that every case is a tragedy.  We do not want any case to occur, of course.  That would be the ideal situation, but just to inform the debate about where the relativities are, I thought it might be useful to offer those statistics.  Finally, we do have open disclosure, as the Deputy knows, which is now on a statutory basis where hospitals are obliged to engage in open disclosure with families, following an adverse event.</p></speech>

The interest bill is really the burden that is being passed on.  Because of the low interest rate environment, notwithstanding the larger amount of debt, the average interest rate on our total stock of debt today is 1.5%, the lowest that it has ever been.  Our interest bill at &euro;3.5 billion is twice what it was in the 1980s even though Government revenue is ten times what it was in the 1980s.  I am just trying to talk about the burden.<br/><br/>The debt <i>per capita</i>is not my favourite statistic to look at because the most impressive countries in terms of debt <i>per capita</i>are Greece, Cyprus and Slovenia.  Their other debt metrics are not ones that I would want Ireland to replicate.  Debt <i>per capita</i>can be a bit of a false read.  The Deputy would want to be looking at interest bill as a percentage of Government revenue, debt as a percentage of Government revenue and ratios like that to get a fuller picture.  </p></speech>

Ms O'Halloran may wish to come in on it as well.  In the background, the arrangement was that we could provide a working capital facility to Irish Water in the amount of approximately &euro;350 million, depending on its needs, and that would then be repaid before year end and could ebb and flow as needed.  We have been directed by the Minister to do that.  The terms of the agreement are being signed at the moment.  Irish Water has indicated it will not need to draw on the facility this year but all the paperwork and administration are in the background.  A bit like Mr. O'Kelly's earlier comments in respect of ISIF, the terms will have to be commercial.  We did comparisons in respect of where utilities in Europe borrow and the spread over a reference rate such as EURIBOR.</p></speech>

I understand a proposal is to come before Cabinet today in respect of elective hospitals.  The proposal is that it would be day facilities only, which is a very short-term solution, not a long-term solution.  I can only speak about this issue in the context of County Cork.  In the context of PPPs, I have met developers who have said they would be prepared to design, build and lease back a hospital as required by the HSE.  Do the witnesses believe such proposals should be given consideration in light of the fact that it would resolve several issues relating to healthcare as it would involve upgrading and putting in place the standard of hospital that is now required whereas, for instance, in the case of one of the hospitals with which I am working the original building was constructed in 1751 and the cost to refurbish it would far exceed the cost of building a new elective hospital?  In the context of public private partnerships, should that issue be considered?</p></speech>

I do not know anything about that.  I would need to see the details of it to be happy to give a view on it.  In general, PPPs are attractive if they are of scale but not as attractive if they are very complex, so hospitals may not be suitable for PPPs.  More suitable are accommodations such as schools, universities, housing and other projects that are relatively straightforward.</p></speech>

I presume the State would become full owner of the facility in 25 years.  The State would pay back over 25 years.  For example, Cork City Council took this route in respect of a substantial extension to City Hall in Cork back in 2003 or 2004 when I was Lord Mayor of Cork.  There was a full tendering process and contractors were appointed.  They provided the finance, did the building and delivered and now we have something that will last for another 100 years.  Likewise with hospitals, we want to improve the infrastructure in the healthcare sector and this might be a fast way of dealing with it.</p></speech>

The fee for the post office savings bank fund, which has just over &euro;4 billion invested, was &euro;28.6 million last year.  That was in the post office savings bank accounts in our annual report.  If one goes to prize bonds and fixed rate products, which are in another section of our annual report - I will quote from memory and Mr. Black will correct me - there is approximately &euro;13 million in prize bond fees.  The other fees come to approximately &euro;21 million for fixed rate products.</p> <p>  To give the Deputy context, there is approximately &euro;24 billion across the entirety of State savings products, which includes just more than &euro;4 billion in the post office savings bank, just more than &euro;4 billion in prize bonds and approximately &euro;15 billion in the fixed rate products.</p></speech>

On the post office deposit account for savings, I note that in 2011 it was &euro;2.5 billion and it has risen to approximately &euro;3.4 billion or &euro;3.5 billion.  Given the past year and a half we have had, does Mr. O'Connor expect that to rise higher than normal?  What is his perception of the year ahead?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  It was &euro;2.5 billion in 2011 and &euro;3.9 billion at the end of 2020 for the account he mentioned.  As of the end of August or September, it is approximately &euro;4.3 billion, which is continued growth.  We have seen growth, just like the whole savings market right across the banking sector.  We have been no different.  We have not been an outlier and our share of the market has stayed pretty constant.  In fact, looking ahead, despite the reopening of the economy, and one would expect some of those savings to convert into spending, we still see a little flow continuing.  For our own assumptions next year, we will have some small growth but, naturally, while recognising the economy is reopening and one might have a flow back out.  Currently, it is &euro;4.3 billion and I would expect it to marginally rise next year.</p></speech>

If I could strip it back and explain it, approximately &euro;4 billion comes in from the post office savings bank fund.  It is a diversified source of funding for the State that has been there for many years.  That comes into our general liquidity pot.  However, approximately 10% to 12.5% of that, going back to the 1990s, is used in what we call the secondary trading market of Irish Government bonds, to add a little liquidity to investment for a return.  Adding liquidity to the market also gives us price discovery.  We are approximately 2% of the turnover and it is has been a very useful source.</p> <p>  If the Deputy remembers, in the past, one took that short-term money from the post office savings bank and invested part of it in longer-term bonds at the old interest rates of 4% and 5%, so it generated quite a high return.  However, in this rate environment, and the Deputy probably read this in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the income from that did not outstrip the fees for what we pay to customers and in post office fees. </p></speech>

I outlined the situation with the convention centre.  As I understand it, the total cost to the State for it was &euro;416 million.  That was just the State's contribution.  There was a partnership with the Spencer Dock Development Company.  The total cost to the State hit &euro;416 million, but the assessment afterwards was that it could have been built at a total cost of &euro;200 million.  I mentioned the Limerick tunnel, the bill for which could run into hundreds of millions of euro as it was underused during the Covid period.  It will be similar for other motorways.  Another PPP that has been of interest over the past couple of years is the schools bundle.  Mr. O'Kelly said that the NTMA does not have a direct role in transport, but I am highlighting PPPs in general.  While there is a case to be argued for them, I am trying to highlight they also have major risks.</p> <p>  The PPPs for schools ran to 13% more than if they were constructed using direct billing.  We also finished up in a situation where private companies are not supervised on site.  The committee dealt with this last year.  There was a more than &euro;40 million cost for retrofitting those buildings.  As I understand it, the taxpayer took those hits.  That is substantial.  The broadband plan, which is not a PPP in name, and I followed this closely in the previous D&aacute;il because I had a responsibility as Opposition spokesperson on it, was done under what is called a gap model, but it is PPP.  We are giving between &euro;2.7 billion and &euro;2.8 billion to a private company, an American entity, to do the broadband plan.  Everyone's understanding was that the private entity would come up with 50%, or 30% to 40%, of the cost.  It turns out the private entity is coming up with a figure, in comparison with the cost to the State and taxpayer, of approximately 10% to 11% of the cost, which is somewhere in the region of &euro;270 million to &euro;280 million.</p> <p>  The taxpayer is taking all the risk with all those projects.  Irish Water has taken over liability on design build operate, DBO, projects from local authorities that are in the region of &euro;1.4 billion and there is an annual cost of servicing.  That is just a snapshot of some of them.  The point I am making is that while a public private partnership may not always be 50%, when the final figure for the national broadband plan came out it was just jaw-dropping.  I followed that very closely, as did others on this committee, in the various roles we had in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  We will finish up in a situation at the end of that project, where we will have broadband in rural areas that were not being serviced, not to mention all the other unusual aspects of it, but the cost will be enormous.  Does Mr. O'Kelly agree that the taxpayers' liability is enormous? </p></speech>

We are involved in schools bundles so I will take that one for a moment.  Schools bundle 5 is a very interesting situation in that, as the Chairman will recall, Carillion in the UK went bust and a local contractor in Ireland, Sammon, went into liquidation.  One of the big issues with PPPs is, often, when something like that happens, whether the State will end up picking up the tab and the risk will transfer and stay with the private sector.  In schools bundle 5, which the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, had full oversight of, all those schools were built and completed at no extra cost to the taxpayer.  The contract was intact.  Other directly provisioned schools Sammon was involved in when it went into liquidation ended up costing the State very significant amounts of money.  It is a great comparison to look at schools bundle 5 following the collapse of Carillion and Sammon, what happened to those schools being built and who paid for them.  I think the Chairman will find that the PPP contract for schools bundle 5 stood up very strongly.</p> <p>  I know that sometimes, maybe, it does not.  It is all about that contract, what is in it and how robust it is.  We learn all the time and contracts get better and better, but the schools bundles is a very interesting example of where the PPP contract stood up and the taxpayer was not out of pocket.  </p></speech>

I would argue that it is a very bad one in light of the financial aspects and taxpayers' liability.  Would the NTMA agree that, in light of what the taxpayer has ponied up and what is being put forward by the private entity in terms of the overall cost, the risk to the taxpayer is enormous given that there are not even penalty clauses for not meeting targets built into the contract despite the assurances we were given by Ministers on the floor of the D&aacute;il that such clauses would be included?  Does the NTMA agree that the broadband scheme poses a great risk to the taxpayer?  It is not just a risk; the taxpayer is shouldering a massive burden as well.</p></speech>

The contribution from the private entity is to be between &euro;250 million and &euro;290 million, while the taxpayer is to put up &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;2.8 billion.  This is a PPP although it has a different name, the gap model.  I do not know where that name came from.  It is exposing the taxpayer and the State to an enormous risk.  Let us forget that we are talking about the broadband scheme and say we are talking about some other scheme, perhaps a scheme for housing.  That risk is very high.</p></speech>

The NTMA has outlined what has happened there very clearly, including in the documentation it has supplied.  The value of the account has dropped by approximately &euro;36 million.  From the public's point of view and from the point of view of members of the committee, as laypeople, that is a concern.  While, in the greater scheme of things, the sum of money involved is enormous, this is still a hit of &euro;36 million for the State.  The NTMA manages this.  Perhaps the witnesses will clarify this for me.  If this money was put on deposit in an account and not managed, there would be no loss and we would not have taken that &euro;36 million of a hit.</p></speech>

If we had the money in cash and deposited it with the Central Bank rather than managing it, as the Central Bank interest rate is -0.5%, we would be losing &euro;70 million a year rather than &euro;36 million.  The fact of the matter is that central banks around the world are operating in a negative interest rate environment in order to stimulate the economy.  We have seen that Ireland, as a highly indebted country, is a massive beneficiary of negative interest rates and the low interest rate environment but the other side of the same coin is that savers and investors have to pay the price.</p></speech>

We do not really have any choice but to live with that.  We could take more risks.  The only way to get higher returns in today's environment would be to take more risks with that money.  However, we would not recommend that because it is probably only going to be there for a very short period of time.  We would have to take a bit of a gamble on where stock markets will be at the time we need to liquidate.  There is very little appetite to take risks with those funds.</p></speech>

I expected that would be the explanation.  It is fair enough.  I just wanted to clarify it for the public.  The public will see this depreciation in the value of these funds.  To be absolutely clear, Mr. O'Kelly is saying that there is no avenue whereby that &euro;14.02 billion could have been protected so that it would not lose anything and would remain at a standstill.  To be totally clear, is that what Mr. O'Kelly is saying?</p></speech>

It is high.  I understand it stands at &euro;241 billion or &euro;242 billion at the moment.  In answer to an earlier question, if I picked this up correctly, it was said that the average interest rate on that debt is approximately 1.5%.</p></speech>

The NTMA has provided the figures.  That is welcome.  I know the NTMA has been refinancing a lot of that debt.  Is it possible to refinance further big chunks in order to further reduce the amount of interest accruing every year?  Is that possible in the coming years?</p></speech>

Over the next three or four years, we will still have debt maturing that was issued ten years or so ago.  There are still some high coupons on that debt with rates of 3%, 4% or even 5% in some cases.  When we get into the latter part of the decade, the bonds we have issued over the last six or seven years will be maturing.  These will, of course, have very low coupons.  We have been able to lower the bill over the last period by retiring high-coupon debt at 5% and issuing at close to 0%.  That will become harder and harder to do.  We will have coupons at rates of 1% maturing and the savings will obviously not be as great.</p></speech>

I am considering doing a further iteration of it.  My recollection is that the figure was about &euro;1 billion a year.  Again, that related to the prevailing average interest rates at the time.  Given the reduction in rates since then, it is likely that this figure has gone down.  I may report on that in 2022.</p></speech>

I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That clarifies the matter.  We have covered a lot of ground.  I believe we have reached the end of the questions.  As the NTMA has a broad remit, its representatives have had to do a lot of preparation for this meeting.  I thank the witnesses for joining us.  I also thank their staff who were involved in the work of preparing for today's meeting.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for assisting us in preparing for the meeting.  Is it agreed that we request the clerk to get any follow-up information and carry out any actions arising from today's meeting?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I am informed that Mr. O'Kelly has been in his position for seven years, predating our term here.  I acknowledge that and the work the NTMA does, because it is handling the big bucks.  That has enormous implications.  The interest members have shown today demonstrates that.  I recognise that.  I understand that Mr. O'Kelly is stepping down very soon.  I wish him well.</p> <p>  Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefings from today's meeting?  Agreed.

Do members wish to raise any matters?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The next matter is accounts and financial statements.  Forty seven sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 27 September and 1 October.  These include 45 appropriation accounts in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report, which was published on 30 September, as well as two sets of accounts from the education sector.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address those accounts and statements before I open it to the floor.</p></speech>

That accounts for 45 of the financial statements that are before the committee.  They all got clear audit opinions but I draw attention to certain matters.  Obviously, the matters that are dealt with in chapters are called out in the audit report.</p> <p>  I draw attention to non-compliance with national procurement rules in 15 of the appropriate accounts.  Non-compliant procurement exceeded &euro;500,000 in each case.  In four of the Votes, the non-compliant procurement was in excess of &euro;5 million each.  Those were Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Vote 21 - Prisons, Vote 37 - Social Protection and Vote 40 - Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  I also draw attention to a number of other matters.  Under Vote 13 - Office of Public Works, I draw attention to the continuing operation of a maintenance contract far in excess of the notified value of the contract when it was put in place.  For Vote 22 - Courts, I draw attention to overpayments to a supplier as a result of a control failure.  In the cases of Vote 24 - Justice and Vote 34 - Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I am drawing attention to EU fines in both cases and, in one case, the fine is continuing at a rate of &euro;15,000 a day.</p> <p>  I also draw attention to the valuation of the property at Thornton Hall and how that is dealt with in the statement of the financial position in Vote 21 - Prisons.</p> <p>  The other accounts that are now lodged in the Oireachtas Library relate to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  It gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.  The Educational Resource Centre also gets a clear audit opinion for 2020.</p></speech>

Procurement issues arise time and again with all sets of accounts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that some non-compliant procurement was in excess of &euro;500,000.  He also identified other issues relating to the prison and Garda Votes.  Can he go into any specifics or any more detail on that?  Are any of the organisations the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted on our work programme?

That is any situation where the non-compliant procurement is in excess of &euro;500,000.  I specifically named four Votes where the amount of the non-compliant procurement was in excess of &euro;5 million in each case.  That was to help the committee focus on the areas where the sums are particularly substantial.  I would expect representatives of the Department of Social Protection to be before the committee.  After that, it is a matter for the committee to decide if it wants to talk to the Accounting Officers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prison Service or the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  There are chapters that deal with social protection so I expect the committee will be examining those.  There are not chapters that relate to the other Votes I have mentioned.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General also highlighted the OPW contract that has been extended well past its sell-by date.  Perhaps we can reconcile that with our work programme and see if we cannot bring those organisations in.  That is not small change by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a lot of money and we need to examine the position.</p></speech>

I want to change the order because Deputy Sherlock has an urgent engagement and I want to try to facilitate him.  He has a piece of correspondence in.  I know it is not listed first, but I will deal with correspondence No. 811C from Deputy Sherlock, dated 29 September.  It requests that the committee makes inquiries into the use of public funds by An Taisce.  That organisation is not accountable to the committee, but various Departments and semi-state bodies that fund An Taisce have certain obligations related to that funding from their Votes, including what is expected to be achieved with that funding and how it is to be accounted for.  Deputy Sherlock has set out five questions for the Department and semi-state bodies that fund An Taisce.  I will open it to the floor.  Perhaps Deputy Sherlock will outline where he is coming from.  Deputy Carthy also flagged the matter for discussion and will come in on it.</p></speech>

I am very grateful.  I wanted to understand better the relationship between An Taisce and various Departments and statutory funding bodies.  We all understand, possibly on a superficial level, the work An Taisce does in respect of education.  It is inherently good work, particularly when it comes to blue flag and green schools initiatives.  It would be very useful for us to understand the financial relationship.  We can bear in mind that between 2018 and 2019, there was a restatement of figures.  I wish to understand that better and how the Department has dealt with that matter.</p> <p>  I also would like to get an overview of the relationship that exists, including whether there are service level agreements in place.  If there are, how do they operate?  Do the line Departments that are funders, particularly in the context of restricted funds, have an expectation about the governance of any organisation that they may fund, even if it is a charitable organisation?  I am seeking the support of the committee for us to write to the line Departments with a view to getting further information in order to better inform ourselves.</p></speech>

An Taisce is the national trust and fulfils an important role in our society.  Nevertheless, and like every other organisation in receipt of public funding, there must be full transparency and accountability.  To support Deputy Sherlock's point, there should be two specific questions to the Departments of Transport and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  An Taisce's annual report and financial statements, as provided to us, indicate funding coming from both of those Departments.  In response to parliamentary questions I submitted, both Departments indicated that they did not provide funding to An Taisce in those years.  There is clearly some confusion.  I suggest, if the Cathaoirleach is agreeable, that I forward the pertinent information to the secretariat and we can get those matters clarified in our correspondence with those two specific Departments.</p></speech>

Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers in following up to the Committee of Public Accounts.  No items of correspondence have been flagged under this category but I mention No. 804 from Dundalk Institute of Technology, dated 24 September, and No. 809 from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, dated 28 September 2021.  Both responses arise from consideration of the accounts and statements at the meeting of 22 June and provide explanations relating to matters in the accounts that the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to and for which we requested explanations.  In accordance with the proposed actions, we will note and publish those items of correspondence.  Does any member wish to comment on these?  No. 809, from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, relates to a building.  There is an explanation set out in the letter for the difficulties with that project.  Are members happy with that?  We will note and publish those items if so.</p> <p>  Next for consideration is category C, which is correspondence from private individuals and any other correspondence.  The first, No. 811, has been dealt with.  That is the only item in the category.</p> <p>  No. 4 on the agenda is the work programme for the coming period.  Next week we are scheduled to engage with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and examine the 2020 accounts, including up-to-date expenditure on the national broadband plan.  On 21 October we will engage with Tusla regarding its 2020 financial statements.  The D&aacute;il is not scheduled to sit the following week, between 25 October and 29 October/  That will bring us to 4 November, when we plan to engage with RT&Eacute; arising from its receipt of Exchequer funding, which is now the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  That is how matters stand.</p> <p>  Separately, it has been proposed that we also engage with: the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; the Department of Transport; the Department of Social Protection; the Department of Health; and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  We had some discussion about this previously but are people happy enough with the work programme?  Is it agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  That concludes our consideration of the work programme.

The purpose of today's meeting is to commence pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the circular economy Bill.  From the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, I welcome Mr. Leslie Carberry, principal officer; Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Donoghue, principal officer; Mr. Alex Hurley, assistant principal officer; and Ms. Catherine Higgins, assistant principal officer.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome all the witnesses to the meeting and thank them for coming before us to discuss the general scheme.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses who are attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contributions, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Carberry to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.401" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Leslie Carberry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#A00300"><p>Today&rsquo;s global economy is overwhelmingly based on a linear model of production and consumption &ndash; we take, make, then waste.  This linear economic model is environmentally and economically unsustainable.  However, the circular economy offers an alternative, whereby waste and resource use is minimised and the value of products and materials is maintained for as long as possible.  In this scenario, when a product reaches the end of its life, its parts can be reused again and again to create further useful products.  The circular economy, therefore, has the potential to significantly reduce dependency on primary resource extraction and complex global supply chains, thereby strengthening state and business resilience in the face of supply shocks.</p> <p>  Meeting our climate targets also requires a transformation in the way we produce and use goods.  Therefore, making less or using fewer resources will play a key role in climate action.  In line with the evolution of EU and UN environmental policy, A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy was published in September 2020.  This far-reaching plan reconfirms the link between the circular economy and climate action, and mandates a whole-of-government approach to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s successful transition to a circular economy.  The circular economy Bill 2021 is a key step in this transition and will provide a robust statutory framework for moving from a focus primarily on managing waste to a greater focus on adapting patterns of production and consumption.</p> <p>  The Bill will provide the necessary legislative basis for several key measures, including the circular economy strategy and the circular economy programme.  The adoption of a high-level whole-of-government circular economy strategy will provide an overarching policy framework for the public, private and voluntary sectors.  The first version of that strategy, which is due to be published shortly, will set out the first high-level steps we need to take to make the transition possible.  The circular economy programme, which will be implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will provide critical evidence-led support for achieving the objectives of the strategy.</p> <p>  Food waste is also a global problem with environmental, social and economic consequences.  Worldwide, more than one quarter of food produced is wasted.  Through the national food waste prevention roadmap, Ireland will provide a pathway to achieving the goal of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030.  Placing the strategy, programme and roadmap on a statutory footing will ensure that the circular economy transition remains a national policy priority.</p> <p>  The Bill will also give the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications the power to introduce new environmental levies on single-use items and, in due course, to prohibit the placing on the market of certain environmentally harmful products by replacing and building on existing powers currently set out in waste legislation.</p> <p>  Recognising the role of the environment fund and the need to align it more closely with the promotion of the circular economy, a new circular economy fund will replace the environment fund.</p> <p>  The Bill will also make important amendments to the Waste Management Acts to support the delivery of further actions in the waste action plan.  In the context of waste enforcement, the Bill will advance a number of priority provisions, including the general data protection regulation, GDPR, compliant use of technologies such as CCTV, for waste enforcement purposes.  This will support ongoing efforts by local authorities to tackle illegal dumping and littering.  Provision will also be made for the use of fixed penalty notices for additional waste streams, including under the extended producer responsibility model for dealing with waste tyres.  The changes proposed have the general aim of providing for more proportionate and more focused enforcement.  A combination of legislation, guidance and the use of mandatory codes of practice will ensure that the processing of personal data may be carried out by local authorities tasked with enforcing litter and waste law, thus providing an important deterrent to protect our environment from the scourge of littering and illegal dumping, while at the same time respecting the privacy rights of citizens.</p> <p>  Further provisions in Part 3 of the Bill will help drive better segregation of waste in the commercial sector, where EPA statistics indicate that 70% of the material placed in the general waste bin should be in recycling or organic bins.  This in turn will help us to attain our EU targets for recycling and landfill.  The Bill will also help streamline and improve the end of waste and by-product application processes.  These measures will help drive higher quality applications, and ultimately tailor the level of regulatory assessment of applications to their environmental risk.</p> <p>  Finally, Part 5 of the Bill will end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and mining of coal, lignite, and oil shale.  This will consolidate our policy of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.</p> <p>  A transition to the circular economy offers the possibility of a sustainable future and is a fundamental step towards achieving climate targets.  Through increased awareness, better informed consumption decisions and appropriate incentives, Ireland can become a leader in this field, delivering environmental, social, and economic benefits.  The circular economy Bill is a key step in that process.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to share the Department&rsquo;s vision for our transition to a circular economy.  We look forward to considering the report of the committee and taking part in the pre-legislative scrutiny process.</p></speech>

As this meeting is confined to a maximum of three hours, I propose that each member is given two minutes to ask their question in order to ensure all members get an opportunity.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will be able to be liberal with the two-minute timeframe considering we have three hours available.  There should, therefore, be no rush with questions or answers.  The first contributor is Deputy Richard Bruton.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#A00500"><p>I welcome the officials to the meeting.  This is important legislation and it is the context within which all materials that do environmental damage can be considered and removed, insofar as is possible, from the supply chain.  That includes fossil fuels.  It is the context within which the climate challenge should be considered.</p><p>It promotes designing out any negative while still enjoying the service, and that is really important.  It is broader than climate alone or waste alone, which has been the focus of traditional policy, and it embraces consumption as well as production.  This is crucial.</p><p> I have the following concerns.  For a strategy to work, it needs clear targets, defined responsibilities, adequate budget, authority to deliver, rigorous oversight and capacity to adapt.  Those are six crucial elements.  There have been suggestions there will not be firm targets in the strategy.  That is something we need to be concerned about.  There is no evidence that a budget commensurate to the challenge will be available.  I am concerned that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is charged with implementing it, does not have the authority to drive the cross-sectoral change that is necessary here.  In my belief, it needs to become a central spine of the climate strategy and have that oversight from the heart of Government with annual actions updated, timelines set and delivery.  That is one area of concern.</p><p> The other issue is the definition of the circular economy.  We should define it more broadly than has been defined here, which is, essentially, only looking at resource use and trying to keep it going as long as possible.  We should be looking at it in the broader sense to cut the environmental damage all along the supply chain.  That means taking out some materials that should not be there in the first place in the supply chain.  One of the concerns of the committee that has been expressed on a number of occasions is that challenges such as that of biodiversity do not get caught up in the climate and waste debate whereas if you look at that broader context, they do.  Some definition change is necessary.</p><p> My final point is that the legal framework for creating this strategy needs to be more ambitious.  We need to have in the legislation some sense of what the ambition is and a guidance of how the strategy should be evolved, particularly in the key sectors, such as construction, mobility, retail as well as in food, which is adequately there.  It should be setting out certain criteria and subject matters that need to be addressed in the strategy.  The framework needs to be stronger, albeit that a strategy will be published before the proposed Bill is passed.  For the next strategy, we need to have a significant step-up.  This is the opportunity to do that.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Bruton for those questions and remarks.  I thank the Deputy as well for the support for the importance of the circular economy.</p> <p>  There would be very little that the Department would disagree with in what the Deputy has said in terms of the idea of targets, responsibilities, adaptation, deliverables, etc.  Our view is that there is a step before that, given where we are in terms of the circular economy today, which is tackling awareness and understanding of the circular economy across all sectors.  We felt that what was first needed was a high-level strategic document which would demystify what the circular economy is, how it can apply, what its benefits can be to sectors and, essentially, put in place a single policy target which is about significantly improving our circularity rate versus our EU peers.</p> <p>  The current version of the strategy - we can make this clear but I hope this was the message that went through when it was launched for consultation - was always intended to be a short-term document with a lifespan of less than two years.  When we convene the interdepartmental groups which will implement the strategy and the circular economy advisory groups which will take in broader stakeholders, we will be looking at identifying specific targets, sectoral roadmaps and actions that can be taken to support those targets identifying responsibilities that will go into the second version of the strategy, which will then be a statutory document.  We felt that getting an overarching policy document was important.  That seems to have been the international experience.  The countries that are doing really well, such as The Netherlands, have that overarching single-point-of-reference document for their circular economy policy and then build in those targets and other measures where there is a common understanding.</p> <p>  In terms of budgets the environmental levies, which we can talk about and which I assume will be talked about at some stage, are not intended to be revenue-raising measures.  They are intended to modify people's behaviours to more sustainable choices but, in common with the plastic bag levy and the landfill levy, initially, in their lifespan, there will be revenue generated.  That revenue will be routed through the circular economy fund to support circular economy initiatives and support the strategy.</p> <p>  Finally, in terms of the connection to the climate plan, the Climate Action Plan 2020 treats the circular economy as a cross-cutting issue that will affect all sectors of the economy and there are actions related to the circular economy that will be in the climate action plan.  I would assume every year, when that plan is updated, you will see an increasing number of specific circular economy actions.</p></speech>

In framing this legislation, we need to go beyond the ambition of setting a broad-based statement and pulling together groups which might engage on it.  We have to look at the how and the wherefore of sectoral plans delivering results with a fair degree of urgency.  We need to have in our own mind what some of those high-level targets are.  Ending landfill could be one.  I, myself, have done a report for the committee that suggests what some of the high-level targets could be.  That helps one to get the buy-in for consumer, community and enterprise to move.  Design thinking is crucial here.  One must have some fairly stringent expectations of where we end up so that one drives the capacity to rethink the design of these supply chains.  One will not get it by getting everybody into a room and hoping they will spontaneously respond.  Certainly, I will be urging the committee in our response to look for some more exacting terms within the legal framework that the Department is asking us to consider.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#B00700"><p>Deputy Bruton has been clear on the need for much stronger accountability.  I also looked at the definition and felt that it was not strong enough.  Even when we went back to the three Rs - reduce, reuse and recycle - I felt that the reduction part of that is one of the parts that is not strong enough in the proposed Bill.  There is a strong focus on the recycle and the waste management.  There is a strong focus on those components.  There is some discussion around the reuse piece but that reduction piece - the initial piece around thinking about the inputs that are coming through - is a part that needs to be stronger.</p> <p>  Of course, the direction of travel is clearly signalled now in Europe where we are looking now at discussions on the right to repair, and a new "R" getting added at the other end in terms of the right to repair.  One might also add the "rethink" in that.  In all of those issues, it is, as Deputy Bruton stated, around design thinking.</p> <p>  I am concerned that if we end up with a Bill that is addressing issues at consumption points we will be going three steps back in that we are hoping that consumption patterns change.  We hope that consumption patterns changing has this knock-on effect in terms of industry and manufacturing in some sense when, in fact, with this legislation, we really should be going quite directly in manufacturing terms and being very clear there around things such as design.  In the report Deputy Bruton produced for us, something the Deputy looked at was how, for example, new, virgin or fresh plastic is treated versus recycled plastics.  How do we ensure that there is, in fact, a preferential treatment of recycled plastic in design?</p><p>How do we build the right to repair and protection against in-built obsolescence into a requirement?  Perhaps there need to be penalties for knowingly building in obsolescence.  The witnesses will be aware that many NGOs have challenged us to institute penalties where we see greenwashing or abuse, with materials being presented as meeting various standards when they in fact do not.  One scandalous form of recycling saw fresh palm oil being presented as used cooking oil.  That had consequences.</p><p> How does this Bill reach into industrial manufacturing?  Some of that manufacturing is not taking place in Ireland but across the EU.  In that context, the key element is procurement.  It should not just be about incentivising different choices by individual consumers, in that the State, as a major purchaser and consumer, should also be setting high standards.  We have a chance to set high standards through the law while demanding even higher standards through our procurement.  The witnesses will be aware that I have drafted legislation on meeting quality criteria in procurement.  A key issue in that regard is what kind of material is being purchased.  This has to do with the design and making reductions from the very beginning.  Procurement decisions should take into consideration the supply chain's past in terms of design and quality and its future in terms of life cycle survival, potential reuse and the right to repair.  Procurement is one of the tools that can be used.  I hope that these areas might be strengthened in the Bill.  The producers' responsibilities need to be more centre stage.</p></speech>

Regarding the definition, to the best of my knowledge, this is one of very few examples, if not the first example, of capturing the concept of the circular economy in legislation.  It is a broad economic, social and environmental concept, so it is not easily captured in the language of legislation, but we are open to making the definition as expansive and progressive as possible.</p> <p>  On the shift towards the producers, I should have noted in my opening statement that the Bill and the strategy do not represent the totality of everything that is going on in the circular economy space.  The Department is working on amendments to ensure that, under the extended producer responsibility scheme, self-certification will no longer be an option.  Producers will be required to become members of certified schemes and will then be subject to eco-modulation of fees whereby less recyclable goods will incur higher fees than more recyclable goods will.  There are incentives.  While it might be said that the commercial segregation of waste is at the end of the pipe, when one considers the purchasing power of the commercial sector and the sector's incentives to switch to more recyclable options, it will have an effect.</p> <p>  We strongly support the initiatives around right to repair, eco-design and eco-labelling, although they are better taken at EU level through the EU's circular economy action plan so as to ensure a level playing field.  This would recognise the fact that, were Ireland as a relatively small EU market to introduce some of these measures alone, it would be difficult to say that a comprehensive right to repair, for example, would shift the EU manufacturing market.  We believe that these measures should be introduced, and would be most effective, at EU level.  We will advocate for strong measures along those lines in our discussions with fellow EU member states.</p> <p>  Regarding waste policy, are there already measures in place that address enforcement and mislabelling?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.413" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#C00300"><p>Yes.  There is much going on in that space.  The important part is trying to decouple people's views of the circular economy as being related directly to waste.  Our ambition in this regard is set out in the waste action plan, but we view the circular economy as a much broader engagement.</p> <p>  To address the Senator's specific point on recycled plastics, there is a worldwide shortage of rPET at the moment.  It cannot be got, so companies are moving as quickly as they can, from a consumer perspective if nothing else, to try to utilise as much recycled material as possible.  There has already been a great deal of movement in that regard in Ireland.  There will be a bottle-to-bottle plant in Ireland soon.  That will help, as will the deposit return scheme, DRS.  The move away from materials that are difficult to recycle will be the greatest transition.  That is where eco-modulation is already playing a role, and it will do more.  In a very short period, we have seen changes to the colouring dyes that are used in black meat trays so that the trays can now be recycled and we have seen a change whereby soft plastics can now go into the recycling bin and be dealt with properly, which will have a significant impact in terms of the materials that are left at the end of the pipe for landfill or waste energy treatment.  All of these measures will force a shift on the producers' side so that the materials they are putting onto the market will be easily recyclable, meaning they can be captured better and moved out more quickly.</p> <p>  We should acknowledge that we are not lacking in ambition in many of these areas.  In 2008, 62% of material went to landfill.  We were down to 14% in 2018 and we are well on target to meeting the EU's expectation of 10% by 2035, although we hope to get there much sooner than that.  However, we must ensure that there is a level playing field for everyone.  As Mr. Carberry mentioned, a pan-European solution to some of these issues would be a faster implementation model for us than trying to do something at an Irish level that would penalise only Irish producers of these materials.</p></speech>

We focus a great deal on the consumer and the product - we all have images in our heads - but what about buildings?  Something that is happening at EU level has to do with building regulations and changes in building practices as well as the question of embodied energy in terms of wood and construction.  An issue we have seen in large-scale projects has been the question of how to ensure the use of recycled materials in buildings.  This has been a concern.  Related to that is the question of how to reconcile food safety with moving towards refillables.  Each of us might have a bottle that we refill here or there, but what about moving back to a situation where food sellers are able to use materials that can be recycled?</p> <p>  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  It is important that the need of people with disabilities for certain kinds of flexible plastic materials be factored into however we do this.  I think of that as being dual use rather than single use, in that it is used by a person for a purpose and in order to protect his or her disability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#C00500"><p>I welcome our guests.  It is important to say at the outset that, although we will be nitpicking because this is the pre-legislative scrutiny phase, they have done good work with this Bill.  It is in a similar vein to the climate action Bill, which the committee also scrutinised.  It puts in place a legislative framework to empower the Minister, which is the important element.  The Bill will not contain everything - that is where the plans will come in.  From our point of view, we need to consider what the problems are and whether this legislation allows the Minister to address all of them.</p> <p>  I run repair caf&eacute;s.  One of the main challenges is insurance.  In Ireland, it is difficult to run repair caf&eacute;s, so we ended up doing sewing rather than anything mechanical.</p><p>The other issue is having to pay full VAT.  There is no tax incentive to sell something that is repaired or made from reused materials.  Obviously it is much more difficult to do because it is more difficult to purchase the items that are necessary.  Will the Bill allow the Minister to make the changes that are necessary to make these things easier for people?</p><p> I understand the point that the witnesses are making about wanting to get people on board but my experience in recent years is that many people are already on board but find it quite difficult to do what they need to do in their daily lives.  For instance, in terms of zero waste, one could spend one's entire day thinking out how to arrange one's life in a way that is compatible with one's values and most people simply do not have that time.  I am thinking particularly of those in more disadvantaged areas who are living hand to mouth and whose children are far away from a market.  I do not believe the options are there for people.  As Senator Higgins has said, we must make sure it is the manufacturers and retailers who bear the brunt of this.  How does that fit into the overall plan and, more specifically, into the Bill?</p><p> There is quite a small list of products under head 6.  The list is far smaller than the one in the waste action plan.  I ask the witnesses to explain why that is the case.  Under head 3, similar to the climate action plan, the Minister shall "take into account" the following.  Is there a way to make that a firmer commitment in order to ensure that the Minister takes into account the programme for Government, the climate action plan and relevant EU directives?  Is there a way to strengthen the language in general?  Sometimes "may" is used rather than "shall" and there might be a good reason for that but we will have to look at it in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.417" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Leslie Carberry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#D00200"><p>I thank Senator O'Reilly for her questions.  Specifically on the repair issue, the Bill will ensure that when the national waste action plan is being prepared, it will include specific targets for reuse and repair.  Furthermore, it gives the Minister the power to effectively set regulations regarding those targets.  We do not expect that ever to be needed but if it was the case that, for example, the national waste management plan was not ambitious enough, the Minister could make regulations in that regard.  More broadly on the issue of repair, the repair sector is one we want to look at in terms of a sectoral roadmap under the strategy.  The Senator mentioned issues with insurance and that is something we have heard repeatedly from people in the reuse and repair sector.  There is also the question of skills, which probably needs to be looked at.  Design and the right to repair are also issues but actions in that regard would be most effective if taken on a Single Market-wide basis.  That is certainly an issue we will be considering.</p> <p>  In terms of the list of products that are mentioned, the heads may seem quite compact but what will happen is that the regulations will specify, within that category of products, potentially quite a long list.  For example, the head provides for levies on single-use disposable food packaging which can cover a significant range of products.  It can include everything from plastic clamshell containers to packaging for reheatable food.  The regulations can specify quite a long list, given the powers of the Minister.  The legislation just sets out the broad categories, principles and policies.</p> <p>  In terms of the heads dealing with what the Minister "shall" or "may" take account of, we are looking at the drafting at the moment in consultation with the drafters and the Attorney General and we can certainly try to make sure the language is as strong as possible.</p></speech>

One of the issues that comes up quite a lot, particularly for councillors, is the installation of CCTV.  As I understand it, this legislation would allow local authorities to install CCTV cameras.  Illegal dumping is a huge issue in many areas near me in Galway.  People drive to isolated locations, or to estates with long and winding roads into them, and dump huge amounts of waste.  I have heard from many local authorities that the installation of CCTV cameras raises issues related to GDPR.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the legalities around CCTV and GDPR.  How can we ensure through these regulations that the installation of same is legally robust?</p></speech>

We have been working with the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, and the Department of Justice on it.  Obviously, we have also been keeping our colleagues in the local authorities involved as well.  I will ask Mr. Hurley to run through it because he has been the point person dealing with this.</p></speech>

It is our view that we should be able to resolve the issues via a code of practice for the use of CCTV under the Waste Management Act and the Litter Pollution Act so that local authorities would be able to make a case for the installation of CCTV schemes.  We are also looking to expand slightly on that under the Waste Management Act to cover the use of drones and other mechanisms for more significant waste management enforcement actions.  We believe there is a relatively good understanding of the intent in our discussions with the DPC and that this will be resolved via the proposal.</p></speech>

I have a number of specific questions that I would like to tease out.  I worked on the single-use plastic directive when I was an MEP and one of the things that was exposed through freedom of information, FOI, was the negative role that Repak, particularly in Ireland, played in trying to delay the targets.  My first question is on the discretionary nature of those targets.  Should we not be setting statutory targets because industry has shown that it is unwilling to move unless it is forced to do so?  It also creates an unfair disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>those companies that are trying to do their best.  I echo what Deputy Bruton said with regard to the importance of having strict and ambitious targets to force industry to change the way it does business.</p><p>Under head 3, is there a possibility of including marine protected areas in the list of matters the Minister should take account of?  The Marine planning framework is included but not the marine protected areas which would cover wildlife at sea and the quality of the water.  </p><p>My next question is about head 4, which deals with recovery.  My understanding of recovery is incineration, either in the incinerator in Ringsend or in cement kilns, and that this would be included in the circular economy fund.  However, at EU level, incineration has been excluded from the new European Green Deal funding.  I am wondering why we would include this element of recovery.  Given that Covanta alone made &euro;21.9 million in 2021, I do not think it needs access to the circular economy fund, if that is what the definition of recovery is in head 4.</p><p>On head 6, Senator O'Reilly asked about the lists of items and Mr. O'Donoghue answered her by saying that we can expand on the lists, which are broad areas that can be teased out.  Is there a possibility of also including marking requirements?</p><p>One of the disappointments in regard to the single-use plastics directive is that the marking requirement on balloon packaging advising people that they should not release balloons into the air did not get through.  Perhaps we can show more ambition at a national level and have that marking requirement on balloon packaging.  </p><p> I have another concern in regard to, I think, head 15 around the civic amenity, CA, sites and waste collection.  The national review of civic amenity sites found that there is a lot of disparity among the different civic amenity sites and that where you live can determine how much you are charged and how often you can access the site, including at the weekend.  There are some parts of the country where there is no provision for waste collection services and people have to travel long distances to civic amenity sites.  Are we, therefore, increasing the potential for illegal dumping?  Will this be covered in the Bill?  Will there be a standardisation of tariffs, opening hours and what is accepted at civic amenity sites?  The review also noted that some civic amenity sites are doing co-operative work in establishing co-location of re-use and repair social enterprises such as Men's Sheds.  Will that be expanded?  It might address some of the insurance issues if they are covered by the civic amenity site as opposed to having to get their own insurance.  </p></speech>

On the specific questions around the single-use plastic directive and markings, we would need to engage on that with colleagues who are working directly on transposing the directive and revert to the Senator.  In terms of the marine protected areas being add to the list as something the Minister would have to take account of, we could look at that.  On head 4, the recovery levy is essentially a counterpart to the landfill levy.  That means when material is sent for recovery to incineration or exported for recovery it will incur a levy and that levy will fund the circular economy fund.  It is essentially tackling something we want to phase out in the medium term through the use of a levy to incentivise more sustainable behaviour and ring-fencing that revenue for environmental and circular economy nitiatives.  It is not the case that this would be providing money to those activities.  Rather, it will be levying those activities with a view to disincentivising their use <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>recycling.<br/><br/>On the civic amenity sites-----</p></speech>

My understanding is that it relates to activities the Minister can fund, including to assist the establishment, equipping and, where appropriate, the operation of waste re-use, recycling activities or recovery activities and that the levies come under later heads.  Am I reading it wrong?</p></speech>

I can be quite definitive in saying there is currently no policy intention that such recovery activities would be funded via the environment fund or the circular economy fund.  Going forward, we can look at the language used with a view to tightening it up.  My apologies in that I slightly misunderstood the Senator's question.</p></speech>

There is particular potential for the co-location referenced by the Senator and bringing in more social enterprises around re-use and repair.  It makes sense to look at maximising that network.</p> <p>  On standardisation, tariffs, rates, etc., I will ask Mr. O'Donoghue to respond.</p></speech>

We funded that report from the regional authorities in regard to CA sites with the specific intention of harmonising them.  The opening hours and materials accepted at CA sites should be harmonised across the State.  This will allow us to build on the social enterprise side as well and get to a point where we can use CA sites for re-use activities and to get people through them and begin to learn at a local level what the circular economy can be.  We would like to see the CA sites have a much higher profile in local communities and, so that people would not to be disadvantaged on the basis of where they live, each CA site would have the same facilities available.</p></speech>

We work in a building where biodegradable takeaway containers are in use, but they end up in a bin.  How do we ensure that biodegradable packaging does not require industrial composting so that we are not just creating waste and making ourselves feel better by saying it is biodegradable?  What is happening with regard to the materials such as polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS, used to line those containers to stop the grease and liquids leaking?  The use of PFAS is a live issue at the moment.  I am particularly interested in hearing how we propose to stop the greenwashing of biodegradable containers replacing single-use plastics when they are no better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.432" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Leslie Carberry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#E01000"><p>In terms of biodegradable packaging, there is a national standard for biodegradable compostables.  Products that meet the requirements can use that standard.  In terms of the policy approach, taking the example of single-use coffee cups, the intention, following the enactment of this legislation, is to make regulations introducing the levy on disposable coffee cups.  We are currently minded to put in a single levy that will cover all classes of disposable coffee cups because the important message that we want to drive home is that we are trying to move from single-use disposable of any type to reusable rather than trying to segregate different types of single-use products.  That is in line with requirements at EU level, where we have to take measures to disincentivise the use of single-use cups, including biodegradable ones.  At a policy level, as set out in the waste action plan and in the strategy, we will always state that reusables are better than single-use items, but with specific exemptions for specific circumstances.  That is the approach we will be taking.  Again, taking disposable coffee cup as an example, we would not see a mass change from one type of disposable cup to another.  We are trying to shift from disposable items to reusable items.  We are hoping the levy will help us to achieve that.</p></speech>

I have had only a quick read through of it but I think it makes some excellent points about living as lightly as we can.  It would be interesting if we could put our mammies or nannies in charge of this.  I am old enough to remember when children visited their cousins and they were invited up to their rooms to be given old clothes.  For me, the circular economy is about recycling Moses baskets, prams and clothes and Sunday's dinner being Monday's tea and chicken bones being used to make stock.  The waste of food in the world today is frightening.  There is a famine in Yemen and we have food banks in our universities and soup kitchens.  I know this is not about a return to the old days.</p><p>I have not gone into huge detail on the Bill, I just have not had time, but I will and look forward to working on it.  I worry that there is infinite production and consumption, expansion and growth now.  The economy when I was growing up is different to the one we are in now.  I do not see Governments and economies getting this.  The power and wealth is all based on a production and consumption model where, for example, it is cheaper to buy a new thing than get it fixed.  Obsolescence is built into products.  I worry that it is not so much the public that needs to buy into this but the leaders and Governments.  The people here are all working for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Do they see that the Government and leaders are actually ready to embrace the radical changes that are necessary?  </p></speech>

I fully agree that many of the practices around the circular economy are not new.  They are not innovative.  They were probably more frequent in times past.  All around the country there are community-based swap groups, people exchanging old clothes, children's toys and so on.  These are bottom-up initiatives that do not need any regulatory framework but are doing great work.  One thing I would like to do in the next year or so is find a way to help people capture those initiatives and reflect the work that community groups are doing at a national level.</p> <p>  All I will say on Government commitment is that we are very explicitly tasked in the waste action plan to produce a whole-of-government strategy for the circular economy which will look at all the policy levers available and bring policy coherence across not only the Government and the Departments but the wider public sector.  That probably addresses that.  </p></speech>

First on the circular economy and the Bill, to me this is a missing piece of the puzzle.  We are talking about reducing our emissions but we obviously must encourage and incentivise the public to do what they can and many people are doing what they can without any need for legislation.  This committee has spoken about packaging in particular and the need to do what we can to reduce packaging and recycle it appropriately etc.  Deputy Cronin was talking about social enterprise and how we can encourage that.  There was an upcycling website, its name escapes me, which had information on how to reuse and share discarded items.  I think it had problems with funding about a year and a half ago.  I hope that the levies that are to be collected will help towards funding these initiatives.  Mr. Carberry spoke about that earlier.</p> <p>  On the heads of the Bill, Mr. Carberry's opening statement mentioned the national food waste prevention roadmap.  We need to reduce our food waste by 50% by 2030.  How will the Bill incentivise the proper disposal of food waste, while also discouraging the discarding of food waste?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#F00700"><p>Food waste is a really challenging area that we have been looking at for some time along with the EPA.  The Bill gives us the authority to set out the food waste strategy or roadmap and the actions will come through that.  A draft has been done.  It has gone to colleagues in the EPA for their assessment and we will share it with others.  FoodCloud is going to see it tomorrow.  We will bring it to our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and get a flavour from them as to where it should be tackled.  It is a really complex area.  The problem with the halving of food waste target is there are no baseline data yet.  We have to set up a metric for that in order that we have a target to aim at.  In the interim we will change some of the waste things very quickly.  We will incentivise waste collection for commercial premises because they are not using a three-bin system currently so there is a huge amount of food loss happening there.  In many respects it is not waste, but loss, because it is simply going into non-target materials and would be better composted.  We need to start capturing the baseline data of farm, producer, retailer and consumer and establish where the losses are happening and where we can target them best.  It is a much broader piece of work.  The Bill is basically setting out a statutory requirement to deliver a roadmap and update it at a minimum of every three years.</p></speech>

Staying on food waste, I hear what Mr. O'Donoghue is saying about commercial waste and his point on the three-bin system is fair.  Within Dublin, waste management was trying to look at the by-laws about people disposing in the wrong bin in the domestic waste sphere.  There was talk of fines, levies and everything else.  No enough information campaigns are being conducted on the green, brown and grey or black, or sometimes purple, bins.  There needs to be education around both commercial and domestic waste disposal and people need the benefits of segregating waste explained.  Hopefully that will be done.  I will leave that with the officials.</p> <p>  Mr. Carberry mentioned the Minister having the power to introduce new environmental levies.  Head 6 makes a proposal around regulations, which Mr. Carberry said was quite a small list.  Section 3 goes on to say the amount of the levy will be specified in the regulation but should be no more than &euro;1 per item.  Will Mr. Carberry elaborate on section 4 and whether it refers to an individual producer having to pay the levy but if it is sold by a multiple, then it will be collected by them?</p><p>Section 3 of head 6 concerns the &euro;1 cap on the levy and was included to indicate the absolute theoretical maximum.  We expect the levies that will be set by the regulator will be much lower, and further detail will be set out on how and when the rate of the levies can be increased.</p><p> Head 4 concerns businesses selling or supplying leviable items and sets out that the person who carries out that business is responsible for the collection and payment of the levy.  There may be multiple businesses carried out in the same outlet, such as a department store that has a concession area within it.  An example of this would be a department store that has one till for its main business, with a concession area that has its own separate till and supplies.  The person running the concession area is equally responsible for the collection of the levy for his or her business.</p></speech>

On the issue of food waste prevention, should the case be made that the mandatory reduction targets be set statutorily because at present they are not?  I am concerned we will have waste management plans that will consistently miss their targets.  A number of people have raised the need to set targets and to have a regime of enforcement.  Is there a case to be made for the mandatory reporting by food businesses on the amount of food waste they generate and the actions taken to reduce such waste?  As we have to reduce food waste by 50% by 2030, some argue that a mandatory 7% food waste reduction target should be set each year.  That would require the setting of year-on-year food waste prevention targets and the establishment of an regime to enforce them.</p> <p>  A number of people have raised the issue of product obsolescence.  Perhaps this cannot be tackled at an Irish level, but is there anything that can be done to address that issue because it is a fundamental issue of importance in a circular economy?  There are many examples of unnecessary waste that relate specifically to product obsolescence.</p> <p>  On construction and demolition waste, does this legislation provides particular opportunities for us to improve our performance in this regard?  In my area of County Meath, each year we deal with illegal dumping on an industrial scale for which the State and the taxpayer pick up the tab.  This occurs on the one hand while on the other hand there is a regime that lacks the level of regulation that is required.  From speaking to people in local authorities, I know of the challenges they face keeping on top of requests for licences.</p> <p>  I have a related question which perhaps cannot be dealt with by the legislation.  It strikes me that this Bill could result in a significant demand for increased resources, be that from the Environmental Protection Agency or local authorities, in regard to enforcement.  Has that been factored into the Department's preparations to date?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Leslie Carberry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#G00800"><p>On the last point about resources, the Environmental Protection Agency's budget for 2022 is obviously part of the annual Estimates process and, as part of that, the agency has confirmed to the Department that the resources necessary to convert to the circular economy programme from the national waste prevention program has been factored in.</p> <p>  On the issue of obsolescence, I raised the point on the measures that are best put in place at EU level around right to repair, green design, etc.  There are measures we are taking at home and some we want to progress further.  There is direct funding, for example, for circular economy initiatives under the Environmental Protection Agency green enterprise programme and the Department's circular economy innovation scheme, which was launched this year.  Both of those are open to a range of different circular economy initiatives.  Green design is an approach we want to see more of and which we will support through these funding models.  The boosting of repairs is an area we will look at through the strategy.  Another aspect when considering obsolescence is the consumers' willingness to avail of repaired or refurbished goods.  There are commercial operators that refurbish ICT and phone equipment at present.  More research may need to be done on what are the barriers consumers think about before purchasing a refurbished phone.  For example, are consumers unsure of the quality of the product?  Are they concerned whether the producer they buy from will remain in business for the duration of the warranty?  This is relevant for data bearing devices.  Are they willing to sell their device to a refurbisher who will then resell it?  Can they be sure their data is secure?  There are many elements that need to be considered beyond just the design.  There is also the consumer behaviour analysis aspect at which we want to look.  There will be an increased focus on awareness under the strategy which we specifically need to work on further.  I will hand over to Mr. O'Donoghue who will speak about the food waste issues and some other points raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#G00900"><p>We are not against setting mandatory targets.  We need to get an understanding of where they should be set and we are waiting on baseline data to figure out exactly how we can achieve the 50% reduction by 2030.  We will examine any mandatory targets needed on that basis.</p> <p> I refer to the area of construction and demolition waste.  It is a significant area of work for us to ensure construction and demolition waste generated is managed properly.  The local authority system and the EPA deal with a significant volume of waste under article 27, by-products, and article 28, end of waste, of the European Communities (Waste Directive) Regulations, the two areas I imagine the Deputy was referring to for local authorities.  There are provisions in this Bill that will streamline those processes and should assist in ensuring the applications made for determination are of sufficient quality to make a determination.  Due to the changes we expect in that regard, we have been working with the Construction Industry Federation and all the relevant stakeholders, and the regulatory side, since 2017 through a construction waste resource group.  The areas that need immediate attention have been identified by the sector.</p><p>On that basis, we would expect the change to happen relatively quickly after the introduction of the provisions in this Bill.</p></speech>

The heads of the Bill the Department have brought forward present a huge opportunity to transform the consumer culture that has got us to where we are at the moment and the amount of waste that we see.  As Senator Boylan said, it is a huge opportunity to clean up our oceans and clean up our countryside, about which we are all very passionate.  It could also give value for money to the consumer in how we do things.  We must focus on the potential positives of what these heads of Bill provide and eventually in having a circular economy Bill enacted, which is great.  The next weeks and months will be about trying to ensure that it is robust.</p> <p>  Some of my questions might apply more to a circular economy strategy than the legislation itself.  If we could touch on it, however, it would be great.  On the types of projects that could be funded by the circular economy fund, I believe that anaerobic digestion does not get enough attention.  It does not get talked about enough and we do not debate it enough.  I often wonder why it is something we often seem to steer clear of.  If we are talking about reducing waste, about reusing by-products in a better way and about decarbonising a sector such as agriculture, then fundamentally anaerobic digestion surely has a part to play.</p> <p>  The members are probably bored of me telling my story of visiting an anaerobic digestion facility in west Cork.  What I saw and what was presented to me provides a lot of solutions around the disposal of agricultural waste in particular.  It was almost a co-operative style set up where the local piggeries, the poultry farm, and the local distillery brought waste to this anaerobic digester.  They were getting energy from this, which is almost a renewable energy, and an environmentally-friendly fertiliser to be sprayed on the land.  As part of that going forward, do we have a strategy for anaerobic digestion?  We have seen the success of this in Europe.  I understand the concern that we do not want to have a situation where crops and products are being grown specifically for anaerobic digestion.  Can we have a strategy for anaerobic digestion?  Can this be included in a circular economy fund?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Leslie Carberry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#H00400"><p>My understanding is that an anaerobic digestion would primarily be dealt with under the bioeconomy policy. The bioeconomy is recognised in the strategy as an important subset of the circular economy.  The national bioeconomy policy statement states that the Irish bioeconomy as it develops should be sustainable and circular.  There is already a recognition that there should be close co-operation between those two policy areas and further opportunities for co-operation identified.</p> <p>  On the question of funding anaerobic digestion from the circular economy fund, the fund funds specific proposals and everything would come down to the merits of those proposals.  I am not aware of any statutory blockage at the moment to such funding being provided to an anaerobic digestion scheme.</p></speech>

I believe that I was at the same plant described by the Vice Chairman.  From a departmental perspective, it is something we would look at more on the energy side than from a purely waste perspective.  We have conversations with the energy side in relation to it.  There are some fairly substantial anaerobic digestion projects which have come on stream over the last while, and are about to come on stream.  It will be interesting to see what kinds of feedstock they go for.  The standard mix at the moment is slurries and potentially some organic fines.  We keep an eye on it but the stronger element in Ireland tends to be for composting at the moment rather than anaerobic digestion.  As an emerging technology, however, we are certainly open to seeing its use expanded.</p></speech>

The food loss prevention roadmap is included in the heads of the Bill.  Again, this comes down to the idea of anaerobic digestion and the smaller scale digesters that are used in some hotels or in some more industrial sized kitchens, whereby peelings and food waste is used to create gas to cook.  Is this something that could be part of the food loss prevention roadmap?  We have seen it done on a smaller scale and there is some great emerging technology in how we can cut down the amount of food going into the brown bin, composting bin or waste bin, which happens in some cases, and reuse to produce gas for cooking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.462" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#H00900"><p>At the moment, the roadmap is focused on what is currently happening and trying to determine where the losses are happening across the supply chain.  Our focus is on the roll-out of the brown bin for households and the proper segregation in commercial waste.  We are not looking at the moment to move material away from the brown bin network.  The composting sites would be looking to increase that.  The idea of support for small-scale digesters is not part of what we are looking at currently.</p></speech>

This was to avoid waste and to help those people who were more vulnerable or on low incomes and may not have been able to afford a big shopping bill.  Would there be a requirement for some amendments to health guidelines or health strategies to encourage those types of initiatives, especially where we are seeing tonnes of perfectly good food being binned because of guideline sell-by dates on food?</p></speech>

It is an education piece around the terms "use by" and "best before" that was causing problems previously.  We worked with the retail action group, which was most of the major retailers in the State.  I am sure the members will have seen in supermarkets a push to have as much food as possible used, even by slashing prices and putting it into designated areas, so as to minimise the food waste in supermarkets.  Many of the bigger chains are partnered up with the likes of Food Cloud so there are charitable donations and donations to local communities through that.  Obviously, we would like to see that continue but the impact of what we are trying to do with the roadmap is to ensure that there is not enough food in the system causing the need for it to be dealt with at the back end like that.  Each stage of the process will be examined to see where the major losses are happening, and to see what can be done to ensure, from a policy perspective, that we are minimising the amount of waste being generated in the first place.  Then we will look to deal with the materials that are left, as holistically as possible.  If the food can be used, eaten or distributed, this is a far better use of it than putting it to composting or anaerobic digestion.</p></speech>

I just have two quick questions.  Deputy O'Rourke brought up an excellent question about resources.  He mentioned the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities in particular.</p><p>Many of us have sat on local authorities and we saw how under-resourced their litter-response teams were, including their litter wardens.  My area of west Cork is a huge geographical area and we essentially have one litter warden responding to all of it.  Will funding be freed up and made available for local authorities to monitor and enforce the circular economy?</p></speech>

We basically set aside &euro;5 million this year to start to combat some of the difficulties found by local authorities.  We have also changed the waste enforcement structures and have an enhanced waste enforcement regional lead authorities, WERLAs, for that in order that we are ensuring there is a minimum number of waste enforcement officers in each county.  We will be looking to do the same with litter.  We are trying, as best we can, to ensure local authorities have sufficient resources to deal with what they are being asked to do.</p> <p>  At the same time, a major part of our role is to ensure education and awareness for everybody in this State around the importance of leaving no trace and trying to take care of one's local area.  We worked with MyWaste on the staycation messaging and on leaving no litter, as the economy started to reopen.  It is important to reflect when we were in a lockdown scenario of 2 km to 5 km, the waste was still appearing.  We were getting more calls pointing out what was there, but there was no increase in the waste being generated.  It highlighted to all of us, to some surprise, at a time during when no one was travelling, that the waste and litter were not being generated by passing most motorists coming through one's county and throwing it out the window, but by each local authority area.  It is being generated in everybody's locality.</p> <p>  We decided to tackle that as best we could through a more harmonised approach throughout the State and we are working with the waste collectors to try to ensure we have better provision of facilities and the materials people need, such as litter pickers or bags.  We will work on whatever is necessary to support the Tidy Towns groups but much broader than that is a big education and awareness piece which needs to happen.  We need to ensure the enforcement of the laws and fines are carried through and to try to get people back to supporting their local communities and ensuring they are not the cause of the littering issues other people in their communities are being asked to resolve.</p></speech>

Two things were happening there.  People were walking the feet off themselves during those two lockdowns and probably walking in beauty spots to which they had never been and were noticing these things.  We also had those great summers during which people were flocking to the beaches.  That obviously caused an issue.  At least there was a response to that.  We have not spoken about international examples.  Are there one or two good international examples in which they have legislated for a circular economy and it has successfully led to a reduction in waste?</p></speech>

To use the metric of the circularity rate, which is the amount of resources that go into an economy and are then circulated back in, as opposed to being disposed of or exported, Ireland is the second worst.  We are below 2%.  The Netherlands is in the high 20s.  It shows what a coherent policy framework, not just around legislation, but a whole joined-up approach about awareness and a focus on both consumers and producers, as has been noted by the committee, can achieve.  If we were looking to best in class, we would say it is the Netherlands.  Some innovative work is also being done in Scotland around Zero Waste Scotland, such as what it has done around reuse and repair.</p></speech>

That results in us building substantial parking facilities under more compact living, which adds enormously to the cost of new homes.  If we could move to more shared use of vehicles, we could dramatically reduce our material use in cars purchased, but also reduce our building costs and make homes cheaper.  There is a massive virtuous circle here, if we get the design thinking right.  Is there a place in this Bill for design principles to be set out as something that sectors should refer to, audit and report and that they should commit to progress on a comply-or-explain basis in order to create momentum in the design space?  Is there a place for packaging, retail or public procurement principles to be set out in order that we could start to see real momentum built in sectors we want to see addressed?  It would not be a regulation beyond the European because these would be principles and encouragement, such as comply or explain.  They could be compatible.</p> <p>  One of the complaints I received, not just from the construction sector, was that many standards prevent the reuse of materials; standards that have grown up and their unintended consequence is one cannot reuse materials.  It could be in making toys from reused materials and they simply will not pass the standard tests.  Are the officials looking at that sort of obstacle in any detail to bring forward change?  I will go back to Deputy O'Rourke's point in that this is a big project.  Whether the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has the resources is one thing, but does it have the authority to do the sort of sectoral work required here?  It is one agency under one Department, when really we are talking about every Department in every sector buying into a process of deep change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Leslie Carberry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021100700002#J00600"><p>On Deputy Bruton's point about the example of cars and the level of time they are unattended and unused, I absolutely agree in that when we look at the circular economy, it is not even just the material design we have to look at, it is the business and use models.  A greater pooled use of existing products and materials, without changing design at all, would make a huge difference to our resource consumption. That is something we want to look at.</p> <p>  In terms of providing for design principles or reporting requirements, I echo what Mr. O'Donoghue said about food waste targets.  The Department would not have any objection to being given the power to introduce such principles and reporting requirements into the legislation.  It would be precipitous to specify, in legislation, what those principles, actions or targets should be, but if it was the will of the Oireachtas to designate, the Minister would have the power to set those under the legislation and that is certainly something we could look at.  There is no economy-wide material flow analysis for the Irish economy, that is, looking at the products and materials coming in, tracking how they are used and then tracking they are disposed of, recycled or re-entered.</p><p>That is a huge piece of work that would let us target our interventions and track our progress.  Getting that kind of work done, as well as doing the sectoral work of identifying actions and regulatory barriers, is necessary before we specify what would be potentially quite onerous targets through legislation.  </p><p> In terms of the regulatory barriers, as Mr. O'Donoghue alluded to, the end of waste and by-products processes are being streamlined.  This means that under certain circumstances, a product which is being treated as waste can be taken out and no longer treated as waste but reused.  Similarly, a by-product from a process can no longer be treated as waste and be used in a subsequent industrial or manufacturing process.  </p><p> In terms of other regulatory barriers, some may be set at an EU level.  Where we identify them, we must take an approach at EU level to see if we can ensure that barriers that exist around safety, for example, are as robust as they need to be but can also facilitate the circular economy.  Part of the work we want to do under the strategy is to identify any national regulatory barriers where we can take action.  I am engaging with stakeholders, particularly from the private sector, on this and am asking them for feedback on where such barriers are and if there is anything we can do at national level.  </p><p> The EPA will have a key role in implementation but, for the avoidance of doubt, the Department and the Minister will have overall responsibility for driving this agenda across government.  An interdepartmental working group, comprising a wide range of public bodies as well as Departments, will be tasked with implementing the first version of the strategy, preparing the second version and seeing through the various actions there.  It is not that the agency will be left by itself to do all this.  The EPA is a key player and partner for the Department but the Department its responsible for the wider whole-of-government process around the circular transition.</p></speech>

Will there be something in head 1 that excludes incineration from the recovery wording?  They are sometimes or often synonymous.</p> <p>  I am really interested in the whole idea of the sharing economy.  There is a place in Galway that I have used previously to get bunting and gazebos, which are shared.  If there is a big event coming up on a particular day, we do not necessarily want every community group purchasing a gazebo.  It works pretty well from a cost point of view and it obviously extends the life of all of those things.  I also know of sharing apps that are consumer driven and libraries are obviously the ultimate in a sharing economy.  Are there any plans to expand on the idea of a sharing economy?  I might have a shovel and then there is no need for anyone else in Highfield Park to have one because there are only so many hours in a day that anyone will be digging holes.  I have been interested in the sharing economy for many years but it needs real backing and it needs the numbers to make it work.  </p> <p>  I asked a question in the first round about VAT.  Deputy Bruton spoke about tax incentives and said that regulations often make it difficult to reuse or upcycle things, like standards for toys, for example.  I have spoken to people at An Mheitheal Rothar in Galway, who recently received more funding for bike repair in the context of social innovation but from an economic point of view, it is very difficult.  They have to purchase parts to enable them to upcycle an old bike into a new one and it is difficult to make the sums add up when they are paying VAT on those parts, not to mention the amount of hours involved.  How do we ensure that it is economically viable for people to upcycle?</p> <p>  My last point is around obsolescence.  I understand that it is being looked at in Europe and I understand why.  We are a small economy with limited purchasing power.  Is there engagement between the Department and Europe so that we can have our voices heard, over and above our MEPs?  One of the key issues around obsolescence is the length of a warranty.  Objects become obsolete at the end of the warranty so if warranties could be extended, that could really help.</p></speech>

For the purposes of the new environmental levies, including the waste recovery levy, recovery is being used in a very specific sense to address incineration, certain landfill operations or export for those purposes.  Waste recovery is being used to capture these specific activities which we want to disincentivise relative to recycling.  We may need to look at the other sections which draw largely on the pre-existing waste legislation and which might mention recovery.  We may need to differentiate so it is clear that when we are talking about waste recovery for the purposes of those levies, we are talking about incineration and we may not mean the same thing in other parts of the legislation.  I thank the Deputies and Senators for flagging it because when I look at it with fresh eyes, I can see why there might be some confusion there.</p> <p>  In terms of encouraging the sharing economy, the potential of the digital economy to support the circular economy is something we want to further progress.  This year, under the circular economy innovation grant scheme, we funded the development of an app through which consumers can buy pre-owned goods from charity and other second-hand stores.  That will help to expand the scope of those stores and help them to improve the overall retail experience.  The grant scheme will be an ongoing feature of the Department's strategy to encourage innovation and digital innovation would be part of that.</p> <p>  There are no current plans to look specifically at VAT but the strategy does talk about looking at all of the policy levers available to government to encourage the uptake of upcycled, refurbished or repaired goods.  In terms of engagement with Europe, through our permanent representation and our environment team, there is always ongoing engagement with other member states and the European Commission on a full range of environmental issues.</p></speech>

What is envisaged there?  Would the local authorities maintain those records, issue the notices and pursue them?</p> <p>  On head 10, Mr. Carberry spoke earlier about data protection issues, which I have been aware of since September of last year.  Hopefully this legislation will address those concerns.  Is it envisaged that the local authorities will be the data controllers?  If that is the case, I would go back to the issues of the lack of litter wardens and resources that local authorities do not have.  I am thinking about their ability to maintain and issue fixed penalty notices and monitor CCTV footage, as well as the number of litter wardens available in each local authority's administrative area.  Maybe the circular economy fund could assist in that regard.</p><p> My final question is on head 11.  Could Mr. Carberry outline what the rationale behind that particular section?  In terms of investigating, detecting and prosecuting the offences, I assume that the local authority will be responsible.  Mr. Carberry might elaborate, however.</p></speech>

There are two aspects to fixed-penalty notices.  Deputy Devlin is correct in that the penalty can be collected either by the agency or by the local authority, depending on the offence that is identified.  For example, the litter offence will be changed.  That would be local authority.  Illegal dumping would again primarily be local authority but there is the provision that it could also be collected by the agency for different offences, for example, for principles of responsible investment offences.</p> <p> Deputy Devlin also mentioned the data controller issue.  There are data experts within local authorities.  A local authorities would be working as the data controller in this instance as well.  We are confident that they have the resources to do this.</p></speech>

If we took a vox pop of the committee, we could all speak to our local authorities and say there are not enough litter wardens, particularly in rural local authorities which have vast areas.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly referred to the laneway that is regularly dumped in.  Nobody can see it but the local authority is charged with cleaning it up.  It is all well and good having legislation which states that it is the responsibility of the local authority to issue the penalty notice and to do all that, but if, under the legislation, we are not looking to fund it through collecting levies, that is missing a key part of this.  We have to be realistic.  There is no point in having the legislation if we cannot enforce it.  Enforcement is a requirement, unfortunately, in certain local authority areas because of the volume of waste that must be dealt with on a regular basis.</p></speech>

We see this as helping and providing a more proportionate solution in this instance.</p> <p>  In the case of the closed circuit television, CCTV, and the litter warden, it is not necessarily the case that the litter warden is the one who is also tasked with monitoring the data.</p></speech>

There is discretion for flexibility within that.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Donoghue mentioned earlier that we have attempted over the past couple of years to increase the funding that is available for enforcement through the anti-dumping initiative, the WERLAs, etc.  The Department has an ongoing commitment under the waste action plan to that funding line as well.</p></speech>

We certainly need to give serious thought to this.  I accept what Mr. Hurley says about the fixed-penalty notices.  That assumes that the individual can be identified.  One of the biggest issues, aside from whether it goes to court or not, is whether you can identify the culprit who is dumping a vast amount of stuff.  I would say that, between the fixed-penalty notices and the circular fund, we need to examine how we could fund many of these positions that the local authorities will need.</p> <p>  Finally, someone might elaborate on head 11.  They might confirm that we are sticking with the fixed-penalty notices and CCTV under this head.</p></speech>

It is a similar thing, not being duplicated under the Litter Pollution Act in this instance but to make sure that, for significant waste enforcement investigations, the local authority has access to this technology.

One of the issues I wanted to bring up in the first round was use of the phrase "from time to time."  It seems a vague use of language, and open-ended, for holding a Minister to account or even, in one case, the EPA, which may evaluate its programme from time to time but at least every six years.  I am wondering if there is scope to tighten that up.</p> <p>  We are saying we do not want to put too much work on the EPA.  They have enough to be doing.  This is a huge body of work that they will take on in implementing this but six years also seems like a very long period.  Given that we are in this phase where there will be pilot schemes and the initiatives we were talking about, such as the sharing economy, the repair and the co-location of civic amenities, I am wondering should we reduce that period or at least allow that the initial one may be a review after two years and then extend it to every six years.  It is more about the loose language in the context of the number of times the phrase "from time to time" is used, and whether that can be tightened up.</p> <p>  Under head 12, where the Minister has the authority to include targets on a statutory basis, will reuse or refill be defined.  Will there be a certain number of high temperature washes?  Will it be set?  Best practice is that we should be setting that in law as 20 times minimum that something should be refilled or reused.  Will we be defining that in the legislation?</p></speech>

In terms of the language, in using the phrase "from time to time" in the drafting exercise that we have been doing since the heads were published, we are specifying more specific timelines in many cases.  At present, I cannot state definitively that we have looked at the six-year timeframe, specifically, in relation to the EPA programme, but it is something we can look at.  When one sees the published Bill, one will see many more specific timelines around things like when the strategy, etc., should be reviewed and replaced.</p> <p>  The first part of head 12 provides for statutory inclusion of reused and repaired materials.  The second part will allow the Minister, if necessary, to make regulations specifically on those targets.  That would allow for the kind of specification that the Senator is talking about.</p></speech>

On a more general question, Senator Pauline O'Reilly referred to VAT.  She made good points about VAT for repair operations and making it economically viable for those organisations to be able to do that.</p><p>Is the Department in consultation with the EU in regard to the VAT schemes?  One of the issues we have around sustainable period products is that they are charged at 12.5% whereas disposable sanitary products are actually rated at 0% VAT.  If we want to encourage a reduction in waste, and this is a huge area of waste, we need to reform the VAT on a European Union level, or at least negotiate to get the period products that are sustainable put in with the rest of the period products in Ireland.  Is there a conversation with the Department on the need to reform the VAT rate at an EU level to address some of these issues?</p></speech>

Deputy Violent-Anne Wynne will substitute for Deputy O'Rourke.</p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is to engage with the chairperson designate of the Shannon Group to discuss his strategic priorities in the role and his views on the challenges currently facing the Shannon Group.  On behalf of the committee, I heartily welcome Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a statement is potentially inflammatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus.  They may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings that a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will, reluctantly, be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, you are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect yourself and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise the practice of good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between you and others attending.  One should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.</p><p> It is with pleasure that I now call on Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh to make his opening statement. </p></speech>

Is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom a bheith roghnaithe ag an Aire Iompair agus Comhshaoil, Aer&aacute;ide agus Cumars&aacute;ide, an Teachta Eamon Ryan, mar chathaoirleach ainmnithe de chuid Ghr&uacute;pa na Sionainne.  Is m&oacute;r an phribhl&eacute;id a bheith i l&aacute;thair inniu mar chuid den phr&oacute;iseas ainmni&uacute;ch&aacute;in seo mar gheall ar an r&oacute;l f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach at&aacute; i gceist.</p> <p>  Let me assure the committee that working with the CEO, Ms Mary Considine, and board on the recovery of Shannon Airport after the devastation caused by the pandemic will be my primary and main focus.  It is a huge but exciting challenge at what is probably the most difficult period the global aviation industry has ever faced.</p> <p>  I would like to start by outlining my professional qualifications and setting out my reasons for applying for the role of chair of the Shannon Group.  I am a seasoned entrepreneur and hold a strong track record at senior level in the private and public sectors.  Perhaps, and possible the most valuable asset that I can bring to the role, is my extensive first-hand experience in aviation and a deep insight into all aspects of the sector.</p> <p>  Following an early career in Galway that involved accountancy, teaching and law, I remortgaged my house and, with a partner, bought Aer Arann in 1994.  Over the following 26 years I held the roles of chief executive, chairman and accountable manager, which was probably the most important, of the airline.  The role of accountable manager is particularly important in the aviation industry because one is personally responsible and accountable for all of the safety and operation of that airline from the perspectives of staff and passengers.  There are two parts to the industry.  One is the commercial side and the other is the regulatory side.  It is fundamentally important to have a good knowledge of both sides because they interact and overlap.</p> <p>  I am a former winner of the Ernst &amp;amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award and I represented Ireland in the world final of the EY World Entrepreneur of the Year programme.  I have also been a judge for the EY World Entrepreneur of the Year programme and have chaired the EY entrepreneur of the year programme for a number of years.</p> <p>  I am an alumnus of Harvard University and of National University Ireland Galway, NUIG, where I was awarded business alumnus of the year.  I am currently adjunct professor of entrepreneurship and business in NUIG.  I also hold professional qualifications from the Law Society of Ireland.  One of my proudest and most privileged times was when I worked with many members and other colleagues as a Senator in Seanad &Eacute;ireann from 2016 to 2020.  My previous board experience has included directorships with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, RT&Eacute; and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</p> <p>  I would now like to share some Shannon Group details and observations with the committee.   Shannon Group&rsquo;s mandate from the Government on its establishment in 2014 is "to promote and facilitate air transport and aviation services in and around Shannon Airport and to optimise the return on its land and property&rdquo;.  At the core of the group is Shannon Airport, which provides essential air connectivity that supports businesses and the livelihoods of thousands of people in the west of Ireland.  Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, 1.7 million passengers passed through Shannon Airport.  It is important to remember that in early 2020, Shannon Airport was set for a year of growth, with new routes and having secured locally-based aircraft.  The revitalisation of Shannon Airport is important not only for the staff who work there and who are very committed to the airport but also for the people of the region who rely on Shannon&rsquo;s air connectivity.  It is a vital economic engine for the Shannon region and the wider west of Ireland economy.  I believe that the Shannon Group is well positioned to play a key role in the region&rsquo;s recovery.  I am committed to working with the CEO and the board to ensure that happens.  I will bring drive, passion and energy to the role.</p> <p>  Over the years the Shannon Group has contributed significantly to economic activity and growth in the mid-west region.  Prior to the pandemic, the overall economic impact of these activities was estimated at &euro;3.6 billion gross value added, supporting over 46,500 jobs across the region it serves and contributing &euro;1.15 billion in tax revenue.</p> <p>  The group&rsquo;s property activity comprises a portfolio of 3.1 million sq. ft of property, in addition to significant land banks.  With over 300 companies and growing, the Shannon campus that incorporates the airport and the Shannon free zone is one of Ireland&rsquo;s most prominent multi-sectoral business parks.  Since establishment, the group has invested over &euro;135 million across its campus, successfully delivering innovative and competitive property solutions to indigenous and foreign clients of all sizes in the mid-west.  The campus hosts the largest cluster of aviation companies in Ireland.  Supported by the Shannon Group, it has grown to over 80 companies today.  Shannon is also home to Ireland&rsquo;s first test bed for future mobility, with a focus on innovation and development in driverless and autonomous transport technology.</p> <p>  Moving to heritage activities, I endorse the discussions taking place regarding the transfer of Shannon heritage sites to local authorities.  These arrangements will facilitate the Shannon Group to focus on the recovery of its airport business, building back international passengers as soon as possible, while continuing to develop its associated property activities and the aviation cluster as the country emerges from the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>  The recovery of the aviation sector to pre-pandemic levels is likely to take many years.  It is certain that airports such as Shannon will face much increased competition for new routes during this time. Some European aviation committees and structures believe it will between 2026 and 2027 before we get back to pre-pandemic levels.  However, I have set an ambitious target to recover Shannon's air traffic to 2019 levels by 2024 or in other words, within three years.  As the European aviation committees and structures believe it will take until 2026 or 2027 before we get  back to pre-pandemic levels, it is a pretty ambitious target but we will give it our best shot.  In meetings that I have with the CEO, Ms Mary Considine, we are 100% committed to aiming for this objective.</p> <p>  I am confident that this focus on recovery and growth, accompanied by the provision of appropriate supports for the Irish aviation, business and tourism sectors, will help ensure the organisation&rsquo;s emergence, and that of the mid-west region, from the effects of Covid-19.  The certainty of such an intervention, for example through the permanent inclusion of Shannon in the State's regional airports programme, will help drive future development and growth thus bringing certainty and predictability in uncertain times.</p> <p>  To conclude, I am confident that the actions now being taken by management will further enhance Shannon Group's performance and its contribution to all key stakeholders in the mid-west region and beyond.  As chairperson, it will be my privilege, and that of the board, to support the Shannon Group's management in delivering future growth and development for the group, and the mid-west region, during the coming years.  I am confident that with the right supports and hard work Shannon will recover and build back stronger.</p> <p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le baill an choiste as an deis a bheith os a gcomhair inniu.

He is very familiar with these surroundings.  Indeed, he would have chaired many meetings in this room.  I view his appointment as a very positive move for County Clare, the mid-west and the western seaboard.  As he said, Shannon Airport is an economic driver.  It is an engine for growth and 46,500 jobs hang on the back of Shannon and its well-being.  I have met with a huge number of people from the business community and the tourism industry over the past week and they have responded positively to Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's appointment.  He is a shot in the arm for both the mid-west and the western seaboard.  I look forward to working with him and rebuilding the potential that is in Shannon.</p> <p>  Even prior to Covid-19, Shannon Airport was struggling to gain market share.  The key issue is addressing the imbalance between Dublin Airport and the rest.  One of Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's targets should be to amend national aviation policy and have positive discrimination towards Shannon Airport because it is much more than an airport.  It is an economic driver and businesses that are in Shannon or the mid-west region are there principally because of the presence of Shannon and the connectivity it provides.  Coupled with that, Shannon is the lifeblood of tourism along the west coast.  We have many top-class hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments along the west coast, and they really rely on Shannon.  This week I met with the Irish Hotels Federation at the Inn At Dromoland about their asks for the coming budget.  I asked one particular individual, Michael Vaughan, if he had many tourists at the moment.  He said they had 30 Americans that night and that every one of those had entered the country through Dublin.  They had to sit on a bus or in a car and come down to Lahinch to overnight, play golf and so on.  Why are these people not coming through Shannon Airport?  Part of Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's objective should also be to restore transatlantic routes, build on that traffic, re-establish the three daily direct return routes to Heathrow and get a bigger slice of the aviation cake nationally for Shannon.</p> <p>  I also see Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's role as something more than just a person who comes in every month and chairs a board meeting.  I know him and I know that is not his way.  He is going to roll up his sleeves and give this his best shot.  This committee should support him and make representations to the Government, to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, to establish his position as an executive chairperson in order that he is remunerated and recognised for the vital position he now holds.</p> <p>  I am also, for my sins, chairperson of the Shannon Airport Oireachtas group and I have had a lot of contact from committee members who are very anxious to meet with Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  That is another pivotal role he will play because over the last number of years a gulf has arisen between the airport and the region.  I think Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will be able to provide that bridge between all the stakeholders, whether they are political stakeholders, businesses or the ordinary person who has a deep interest in the airport.  I ask that Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh play that role as well and I ask that he meet with the Oireachtas members from the region at the earliest opportunity.  I wish him all the best in his new role and I look forward to working with him.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate Deputy Carey's support.  His and his colleagues' commitment to Shannon Airport is one of the biggest reasons I went for this role.  It runs pretty deep with a lot of people, including those up here in Leinster House.  One of the Deputy's colleagues told me that as a child of five, six, seven or eight years of age, they used to go to Shannon Airport on Sundays to see the planes land and have a bit of lunch there.  It is deep-rooted in the community and in the area.  It is a huge privilege for me to be offered this opportunity and the Deputy is right that I am going to give it my best shot.</p> <p>  I refer to two matters.  The first is stakeholders.  The point the Deputy raised is critically important because no one person can bring Shannon Airport back to where it deserves to be, needs to be and should be.  We are all in this together and I am 100% committed to having open, frequent and honest engagement with all the stakeholders.  The committee members, as public representatives, have a hugely important role to play as stakeholders in relation to the future of Shannon Airport and if they are not actively involved in working with, supporting and challenging me, the board and the management team, the progress we make will be very small and slow.  For the next three years during which I will be chairman, it is going to be an active engagement scenario with all the stakeholders, the management team, the staff and the business communities.  As the Deputy said, those business communities are very supportive of me and I am privileged and humbled by that.  I am keen to engage with them and get their input and views because I am not able to do this on my own.  However, together we can put Shannon Airport on the map and I am confident of that.</p> <p>  From a board perspective and as already indicated, the big objective is to get us back to 2019 levels.  That includes three Heathrow flights a day and transatlantic routes.  We are going to do everything in our power to achieve that but the support of the committee and of key stakeholders is important.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about Dublin Airport that is very important.  I am delighted that Dublin Airport has done as well as it has and I wish it every success in the future.  I received a message from the CEO of the Dublin Airport Authority, Dalton Philips, offering his congratulations and support, and offering to co-operate and work with me and with us in any way he possibly can, which I welcome.  This is not an either-or situation.  This is about working together for Ireland Inc.  We have a slightly different roles and objectives.  Shannon Airport has an objective for that region and Dublin Airport has a slightly different objective in the same industry.  There is no reason, in the context of a small island with a population of approximately 5 million. for us not to work together and create a win-win situation.  One of the first things I will be looking at is how we can work with Dublin Airport to create a win-win situation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021100700002#D01100"><p>As with previous speakers, I offer a warm welcome to P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as the incoming chairperson of Shannon Airport.  We should be particularly thankful that Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has chosen to put himself forward for this role.  With his immense experience, undoubted ability and clear understanding of the needs of the region, he is the ideal candidate for the very difficult task ahead.</p> <p>  We owe Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh a debt of gratitude.  He is an exceptionally busy businessman with many other interests.  That he will give time to a role like this for the region and the State should not go unnoticed and unrecognised.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  I will raise a couple of issues relating to Shannon.  My colleague has already outlined many of the challenges and Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will be well aware of them.  The focus is on driving traffic through the airport and I note Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's stated objective is to get back to 2019 levels.  That will be challenging but I hope that in rebuilding to achieve 2019 levels of traffic at Shannon Airport, Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh makes some fundamental changes to the foundations that are in place.  In 2019, Shannon was losing competitive advantage to Dublin and Cork airports.  To get back to the 2019 numbers would be good from this vantage point but Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will face a challenge creating different streams to ensure the airport can grow and rebuild from those levels.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has the capacity to do that.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh spoke about the property portfolio, which is an important feature of the airport.  I would like to hear any thoughts or ideas he may have on that at this stage.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh referred to the heritage tourism part of the business that is transferring to Clare County Council.  It might be useful, notwithstanding that transfer of business, for Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh to engage with some of the representatives of the heritage part of the business as part of his consultation process.</p> <p>  It is vital that Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh engage at the earliest opportunity with the chambers of commerce and all the various stakeholders in the region, including the workers.  I recommend that he consider holding a town-hall style meeting when conditions permit.  From my experience, the airport workers are the most hardworking, decent and honourable people who have some fantastic ideas based on their lifetime experience working in the airport.  That would be useful.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has a very committed CEO and management team, with whom he has engaged.  That is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  The big short-term challenges will be to get Aer Lingus back on the Heathrow route with frequency and timings that meet the needs of the region.  We want to see the single flight each day continue when Cork Airport reopens.  My discussions with Aer Lingus suggest that is possible.  However, while the flight to Heathrow is a welcome development, it is not adequate and does not meet the needs of the region.  We need an early morning flight out of Shannon, as Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh well knows, and a late evening return flight.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh indicated the airport will try to get back to three flights a day and use those slots, which will be a further challenge.  As Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will be aware, Aer Lingus's commitment to the slot access to Heathrow has a life span and is up for review.  It will be important to challenge to retain that slot access to Heathrow.</p> <p>  Transatlantic flights out of the United States are expected to restart in March 2022.  While I welcome that, it would be helpful if Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh could use his contacts and skills to broaden the reach in the United States from the east coast, as we have been used to.</p> <p>  The big challenge Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will find is that Shannon Airport does not have access to another European hub other than Heathrow.  There are big efforts by the chambers of commerce and business interests in the region to try to get access to Frankfurt Airport or Schiphol Airport.  Any assistance or guidance Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh can give in relation to that would be helpful.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will note from his discussions with people in Galway, Clare, Limerick and throughout the west and mid-west, there is a desire to see a greater level of flight activity.  In my view, the focus of Shannon Airport for the past seven or eight years has been on developing the Shannon Group's property assets.  When the group reports its success at the end of the year, it is reported in terms of profit and loss, and it has been significantly profitable.  Much of that profit is based on the success of the property assets in the Shannon Group's property portfolio.  That often masks the failure to reach the kind of growth in passenger numbers that Dublin and Cork airports have recorded.  Knowing Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as long as I do, he is a straight talker and straight shooter.  I do not expect his board, when it announces results in the future, will talk only about pounds, shillings and pence.  It will talk about passenger numbers through the airport and how its targets will be achieved.  No one will give out if the board does not meet its targets.  It is about the strategy for achieving them and I implore Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh to work on the passenger numbers side of the business because that is what drives the region.  Having property assets generating profits is lovely around the airport but the real win is when passengers come through, stay in hotels and guesthouses and eat in restaurants.  I do not mind if they travel to counties other than County Clare but they will spend money along the western seaboard.  They will visit the Cliffs of Moher.  They only way that can happen is if we increase flight activity.</p> <p>  The way in which Shannon Airport developed was that it was expected to be sustained and to grow.  When there was not enough capacity for business, the State intervened through Shannon Development and built factories.  Is it now time for Shannon Airport to look at owning its own airline - setting up an airline to serve routes that are not already served?  That is not to suggest that every route can be served.  Is there an opportunity for Shannon Airport to set up an airline, a small one initially, with some State capital?  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will know better than I that the big leasing companies have a lot of aeroplanes on their balance sheet, many of which are not being leased.  This could be a good time to try something like this.  It certainly could be done in conjunction with the leasing companies.  They would give favourable rates in the short term.  With Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's experience with running an airline, I would like to hear his views on that.  We would then be fully in control of operations rather than being at the whim of the airlines, all of which, with the exception of Ryanair, are international and are significantly stretched because of recent losses.  It might be time for a small, new, fit-for-purpose airline getting access to relatively cheap aircraft on the international leasing markets.</p></speech>

He is marrying Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's former ownership of an airline with his appointment as chair of our precious Shannon international airport.</p></speech>

It is thinking outside the box.  It also sets a challenge that is outside the box and is well worth investigating.  I know all about setting up and building an airline.  It is a huge challenge.  It is a different business model from an airport model.  Having said that, we would not be the first airport to consider doing something like that.  It is worth looking at and doing a feasibility study into the proposal.  Perhaps we might take it away and get back to the committee on it at some stage.  Establishing an airline is a huge task and I am certainly open to looking at the opportunity.  I thank Senator Dooley for raising it because it is the kind of thinking we need.  It is outside-the-box stuff we need for Shannon.  Sin &eacute;, a Chathaoirligh.</p></speech>

What are his plans to get early morning and late morning flights to Heathrow?  That would mean three daily Heathrow flights.  When should they be?</p><p>Has Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh engaged with Aer Lingus on the return of transatlantic flights, particularly on the Boston and New York routes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021100700002#E00200"><p>No, I have not.  I am still not chairman of the board and I do not have any authority or footing to formally or properly approach Aer Lingus on the routes the Chairman mentioned.  Having said that, when I am officially chairman, one of the first strategies I will have is to see exactly where we are at with Aer Lingus and work out with it what the company requires to get the three Heathrow slots the Chairman and Senator Dooley mentioned.  It is not just three Heathrow slots but also their timing that is fundamentally important.  There is no point in having a slot that is just a filler for an airline that might decide, for example, to put a spare aeroplane on the Shannon-Heathrow route.  They have to be slots that suit members of the business community who are travelling to and from Shannon.  There are four waves of aircraft into and out of airports, four particular slots.  We must ensure the slot we have coming into and going out of Heathrow from Shannon hits one of those waves of international traffic coming in.  That is fundamental and very much at the top of the agenda.</p> <p>  The potential of setting up an airline is longer term.  It is important to look at it but it is not absolutely urgent here and now.  The urgent issue is the Heathrow route and, as members said, getting at least the fundamentals of the transatlantic routes - Boston and New York - on flow.  If we can nail that down, we can look at stage two of a strategy and a longer term strategy.</p> <p>  To respond to Senator Dooley, the total number of passengers who travelled from Shannon Airport to London Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick in 2019 was around 600,000.  That is a serious number and I cannot see why any airline would not have an interest in working with us in Shannon on getting back to those passenger numbers again.  We have the trend there.  Also in 2019, 134,000 passengers were carried on the JFK to Shannon route and back again.  That is a sizeable number of transatlantic passengers.  I sometimes speak in English and think in Irish but t&aacute; an stair againn.  We have the history of doing that.  It is just a matter of convincing the airlines that we can go there again and also to work hand in hand with us on that.</p></speech>

They would be lower but my guess is that the figure is probably in the region of 80,000, although it may be more.  I give that figure subject to checking but it gives a sense of where Shannon was at and where it can get to.  That is low-hanging fruit.</p> <p>  I thank Senator Dooley for his support.  It is very much appreciated.  He also mentioned heritage.  I understand that the process is very much in progress.  It is a long way down the road.

The transfer is supposed to take place on 1 January.  We are entering a period in which there is major concern among employees of the Shannon Heritage sites.

Obviously he has to get a feel for the new position first but it would be good to have a listening exercise with workers.   There has been a gap over the years between workers and the board.  I know Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is not directly responsible for staff but there would be no harm in addressing them and setting out his vision, as he has with us today.  That would be welcome and get him off to a good start.</p></speech>

I will give a couple of reasons.  As Deputy Carey mentioned, this is a non-executive role.  In my view, for two years, maybe three, it will be more than a full-time job if we are to get the airport back to where it was.  I will give it my best shot.  It is a non-executive role.  Much of what the Senator is talking about is a management function.  I need to make sure I do not cross over and start managing the airport because we have a very good CEO and management team at the airport.</p></speech>

Having said that, staff are a key stakeholder in all of this.  It is much more than a job for them.  I was in Shannon last Friday to have a brief meeting with the CEO.  When I walked in the door with my mask on a gentleman in a high-visibility vest came up to me and said, "You're your man, aren't you?  You're what's his name, P&aacute;draig."  When I said I was, he said, "You're very welcome; we are delighted to have you."  He is just one of the staff.  It meant so much to me.</p></speech>

There is collective collaboration, cross-party support and business people and community workers are very positively disposed to Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's appointment to this role.  We want to harness that.  Shannon as a region is much stronger collectively, with all its components.  Senator Dooley suggestion is one that, as chairman of the board, Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh would very much take on board in the overall context of the Shannon Group in terms of the huge role the employees play and the benefit that would come from there engagement and interaction with the company.</p></speech>

I met him earlier in Buswells Hotel.  It is great to see him in Dublin and the Houses of the Oireachtas, a place where he is very much at home.  It is great to welcome him to his role as chairperson of the Shannon Group.  He told the story of being approached by a worker who did not know his surname but knew Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh was the new guy on the scene.  The feeling of relief and hope he described permeates the mid-west.  It is felt politically and among those who work in the airport and beyond.  The airport is a catalyst for so much economic activity in the region.  Our heart and soul is invested in Shannon.  We support our local hurling and football clubs and the province in rugby.  There is real support for the airport.  My wife is from Cork and like many families, we browse the air fares that are available.  I am always loyal to Shannon and would rather pay the extra buck to fly out of the airport.  That is not felt everywhere in the country but it is certainly felt in the mid-west.  We need to tap into that and Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is the man to lead from the helm.</p> <p>  A week ago, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was before the committee and we discussed what Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's imminent appointment to this position would entail.  I made the point that he will work with a very good chief executive, Mary Considine, and I believed they would work well together.  I asked the Minister about the rest of the board and when their terms expire.  He envisaged it would be a rotation, where some members would leave the board and new members would be appointed.  I know Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh does not have a say but I hope that, as the board is changed up a little, those who come to surround him on the board come from an aviation background.  Business and economics are important but running agribusinesses or businesses in other important sectors of the economy are different from running and airport, seeing aeroplanes in our sky and stimulating a region.  I hope Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and Ms Considine will be surrounded by the right people and they get us back on an upward trajectory.</p><p>About three weeks ago I had a meeting here in Dublin with the Saudi Arabian ambassador.  The Saudis are very keen to establish direct air connectivity between Riyadh Airport and Ireland.  I have set up a meeting for Ms Considine and the ambassador, in the hope of deepening links there.  There are many aviation hubs in the Middle East but Riyadh airport offers excellent connectivity options for us eastwards into Asia and Australia.  We offer westward connectivity options to them as a stepping stone to the US.  That is an open door we are pushing.  Of course, there is a huge amount of work to be done but there is an appetite on both sides here to do something and I hope Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will champion that in his tenure.</p><p> Moving to the matter of Shannon Heritage, it has felt quite rudderless at times.  For many years it has been managed by the mothership Shannon Group.  Shannon Heritage has good localised management but some of the big decisions that impacted on it have been taken outside that in the airport.  Some of them have been communicated well, others not so well.  Given that deficiency in the communications, many of the workers have come to us politicians and we go seeking answers for them.  I made the point that while I will gladly do that time and time again it is not really the correct chain of command.  I hope that communications line is something Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will try to rectify as helmsman of the Shannon Group.  The transfer of responsibilities is legally intended to conclude on 31 December but now the belief is that could run out to March, for unavoidable reasons like due diligence and all the rigmarole involved there.  This is one of the first things I hope Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh can sit down with Ms Considine and have a proper look at.  It has been said to Shannon Heritage workers at both the County Claire and County Limerick sites that for the interim period from 1 January until the middle of March, the sites will again close.  That is utterly unthinkable.  It is unstrategic.  It is a head in the sand approach really at a time when all places are reopening.  We are just days away from 22 October when society overall opens up.  We must back those heritage sites, see them as being strategic tourism sites in the region and say that though this may have been a bumpy road, we are going to keep all the sites open.  There is a photo doing the rounds on social media of a tour bus pulling into Bunratty Folk Park the other day and the park was not able to take them.  Commercial bookings have been turned away.  We are going to lose a lot of space here unless we do something right.  Even though Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is going to be relinquishing responsibility for the Shannon Heritage portfolio he has a role for the next few months, probably up to March, and I ask that he take it on and pass the baton on to the local authorities with the heritage side in a very healthy state.  I ask also that he would please engage with the workers.</p><p> A dialogue has come out in the last few weeks which has been very helpful to Shannon.  It is being called "Shannon-shaming".  It is very important that is knocked on the head by everyone who cares about Shannon Airport and the region.  The genesis for US military flights landing in Shannon is UN Security Council Resolution 1441 which was passed unanimously.  Just yesterday evening, a local Afghan family from County Clare arrived home, having been stuck in Kabul and facing all that they faced at the hands of the Taliban for the last number of weeks.  At times, we must look at what is really happening with some of the people who are going out from Shannon on those military flights.  It is not all waging war.  Sometimes people are being brought back to safety and there are positives.  We need to stop and knock on the head the Shannon-shaming.  We have enough problems without adding to them.</p><p> Shannon is categorised as a category 9 airport.  That has implications for which large-body aircraft, with respect to both width and length, can land on the runway.  At times over the past year, Shannon has fallen below category 9 status and that has been down to reductions in those working in the fire service.  It is important from here on, as we are getting beyond Covid, that Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, Ms Considine and all on the management side of the airport ensure it is always category 9 and can always receive aircraft coming in over the Atlantic.</p><p> I will conclude with a few other small points.  The national development plan launched on Monday had some really good positives for Shannon.  The suggestion there will be a rail spur out to the airport at long last and that it is being strategically advanced in a national plan is very important, with rail stops at the airport and out along the line through County Clare and into County Limerick.  I would like Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's opinion on that.  Is it an enabler for getting things back?</p><p> We want to see restoration of full connectivity to hubs, existing ones and beyond, and also to the US.  I have described the relationship between Shannon and the Dublin Airport Authority since separation as a predatorial one.  It certainly felt like that in the time before Covid.  I think it is largely accepted now in the region, and indeed nationally, that it is impossible for the two to fully compete.  There is a bit of the David and Goliath about it.  That is just owning up to the realities of this.  When Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh stewarded Aer Arann he was leading a David versus Goliath operation as well, and very successfully.  Shannon and Dublin must work off each other and play off each other and look at how, in other countries like Finland and the Netherlands, the capital airport of the country was able to benefit and strengthen them and we must look at that.</p><p> I have a very short question on the duration of Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's tenure.  Last week the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told us there is no length to tenures and he is going to switch the board in and out but we certainly want some continuity as we try to make a recovery.  Does Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh know how long he is going to be chairperson for?  Has the come into discussions just yet?</p></speech>

We can sometimes be in a particular position for too long.  It does not mean we are doing a bad job or whatever but life evolves, quite frankly.  Three years is a key, critical timeframe for Shannon.  At that stage we will need to pause and ask where to from here and what has been achieved in those last three years.  Whether I am the right person for the role going forward or not, that needs to be decided at that stage because this role is not about me.  It is about what we can do together.  I have one role in it.  It is an important role but it is only one role.  This is about all of us together.  As I said earlier in response to what Deputy Carey asked at the very beginning about stakeholders, it is so critical.  Let us decide after three years whether I am the right person to go forward or not.  That is my response to that, if it is okay.</p></speech>

The first main point he made was on Shannon Heritage.  The note I have here is "transition".  I am not read in and am not really familiar with the situation in the heritage part of Shannon Group yet.  I do not have access to documents, information or anything like that because I am not chair.  I am not even on the board.  It is something we will look at.  It is something which, in my view, management would be driving from a transitional process and I hope that would be done.  I am confident it will be, and will take all stakeholders, especially staff, into account.  As I said at the beginning, I have set up a whole host of different businesses.  I have been judge, and so on, of a number of business competitions.  I have never seen a company grow in my life.  Companies do not grow; people grow.  Having said that, the people also have to come on board.  There are times where there is pain and suffering for all of us but we need to look at the bigger picture.  It is people who will make Shannon Airport grow.  I am just one of them.</p> <p>  On the point about "Shannon-shaming", I cannot comment on it, to be honest.  As to what is out there, rather than the double "s" in shaming, I prefer the other "s" in support.  It is about working together and making it happen.  Shannon does many good things for an awful lot of people, which all members know about.</p> <p>  On the category 9 status, it is really important that be maintained.  Shannon Airport has invested in the region of, I think, &euro;15 million in the past couple of years in upgrading the airport itself.</p> <p>  The national development plan is hugely welcome.</p><p>There should be a rail spur to Galway.  Shannon is in County Clare and is between the third and fourth largest cities in Ireland - Limerick and Galway.  Galway is critically important to developing Shannon and I will do whatever I can to get Galway people on board.  If it costs more to fly out of Shannon, which in many instances I think it will not, I will work on that.  I want Galway people to think as the Deputy does in regard to that.  I would love if there were to be a rail spur.  Public transport to an airport is critically important.  Ireland is the only country in Europe without a rail link to any of its main airports - Dublin, Cork or Shannon.  That is an indictment of our transport system.</p></speech>

We always focus, particularly in Shannon, on travelling west to New York and Boston because, traditionally, that is where our families emigrated to.  However, the connection on the other side is very interesting.  I am delighted with the Deputy's initiative to put this suggestion to the Saudi Arabian ambassador, in regard to Riyadh, and for connecting with the CEO in Shannon about it.  I am sure the CEO will explore that further.  It would be very exciting if we could land a route like that.</p></speech>

Like the other members, I extend my congratulations to Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on his new appointment.  I look forward to the Shannon Group's board being fully functional.  As we are all aware, this position was left vacant for a long time - more than 12 months.  It may help to put the Shannon Group into a good place to face the journey of recovery that, invariably, lies ahead.  I am glad to hear him speak specifically of the passion, energy and drive he will bring to this role.  Those qualities are important going forward.  I am grateful to have been afforded the opportunity to attend the committee today to converse with Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh in substitution for Deputy Darren O'Rourke.  The Deputy kindly gave me his slot so that I could address Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh given how integral Shannon Airport is to my constituency of Clare.  I am aware the remit of the Shannon Group goes beyond the airport and, as Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh stated, the Shannon campus comprises more than 300 companies and is a hive of activity in and of itself.  However, most of my questions will mainly focus on the airport.</p> <p>   Since the pandemic struck last March, many people expressed their deepest concerns to me over the decay of Shannon Airport and some went as far as to say that this was evident in pre-pandemic times.  Obviously, the aviation industry throughout the island and, indeed, the world, has been one of the industries worst affected because of the significant restrictions on travel, and we are all aware of that fact.  Even before the pandemic, Aer Lingus workers expressed industrial relation concerns and many of my constituents reached out to me, including cabin crew workers, air-traffic controllers, maintenance workers etc. to express their concerns on the management of Shannon Airport.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh informed us of his aim to recover Shannon's air traffic to 2019 levels by 2024.  My first question is on the core tenets of the strategy that will make this aim impossible to achieve.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh said that it is an ambitious target.  What are the necessary factors to help or hinder him meeting that target?  We had, for example, presentations from members of the Shannon Chamber on the traffic recovery support scheme, TRSS, and the idea around that.  What are Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's views on that?</p> <p>  Will Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh confirm his position on the question of the reintegration of Shannon Airport?  We know that previously Shannon Airport was incorporated under the DAA, however, my question is not on this topic.  We have received many statements on aviation in recent months and I and other elected representatives, particularly those in Sinn F&eacute;in, have called for the establishment of a national airport authority whereby Shannon Airport could be reintegrated.  Does Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh endorse a national umbrella for the orchestration of the three main airports in Dublin, Cork and Shannon and what are his views on that?  Does he believe Shannon Airport is best placed to run independently?  Sinn F&eacute;in believes there needs to be equity between these three airports in order to guarantee equitable allocation of resources and funding and to ensure balanced regional development across the whole island.  This is an issue about which I have had many conversations with constituents.  They are picking up on the language used by the Government around, for example, the importance of regional development, however, that importance is not always the case in reality.  This was evident in the number of flights afforded to Shannon Airport during Covid.  </p> <p>  What are Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's views on the proposed rail line in the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area as outlined in the national development plan published on Monday?  I have heard some of his comments on that, however, I am interested in the reaction from Shannon Chamber which is calling the plan quite ambitious and has concerns about how expensive the project will be.  What is Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's vision in this regard?  He stated that he is not in the position of the chair at present and, therefore, does not have access to documents.  He might come back to me with further clarification on that point as to when that will take place.  Pre-emptive to that, what are his views on the rail line and its implementation in the near future?  A new hangar has been permitted under the national development plan.  Will Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh give us more information on that if possible?</p> <p>  I refer to the transfer of the heritage sites which, all going to plan, will take place by the end of the business year according to responses I have received to parliamentary questions.  Until what point will it remain the responsibility of the Shannon Group to manage and maintain the heritage sites?  I have also been informed that, in order to mitigate the significant losses incurred by the group over the Covid period, the sites will operate seasonally for the foreseeable future.  Will Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh confirm if this means the sites will be closed until the transfer takes place?  Will he confirm, based on his negotiations with stakeholders and Clare County Council, that the leaseholder agreements will remain unaffected after the transfer?  I welcome any information he may have about the transfer, such as what stage it is at and what it will involve over the coming months.</p></speech>

I will try to address all of her questions but if I miss any, I ask her to let me know.  Some of the questions I have already answered to the best of my ability, to be honest, particularly with regard to the heritage sites.  There is nothing I can add in that regard.  <br/><br/>  In terms of my negotiations with stakeholders, I have not had any because I am not chairman yet.  Indeed, I am not even a member of the board yet so I do not have any authority.  I hope to do that pretty soon but I cannot comment on it now.<br/><br/>On the question of adding a hangar, I do not know the answer at this stage because I am not involved.  I know that since 2014 Shannon Airport has invested &euro;135 million in various developments across the campus, which is very significant.  The campus has been successful from a financial point of view, as was mentioned by Senator Dooley earlier.  That leads me to the very important question that Deputy Wynne asked about the reintegration of Shannon Airport into the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  I cannot speak negatively or positively about that at this stage.  All I can say is that back in 2010 to 2014, some of the Deputy's colleagues in these Houses were very keen that Shannon Airport be stand-alone.  They felt that Shannon was not getting a fair crack of the whip because it was being treated as the junior partner <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the airports in Ireland.  That was the very strong feeling on the ground at the time, as I understand it.  Deputy Wynne would probably know more about it than me.  I understand many stakeholders were involved in negotiations and discussions at that time.<br/><br/>I would think it is better at this stage to view this as a transition process.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, Covid 19 has absolutely devastated the aviation industry and even more so in places like Shannon Airport as opposed to Dublin Airport.  The latter will come back much faster, naturally.  I would prefer to hold our thinking on the question of the airport authority for the moment.  We must give Shannon Airport the opportunity to breathe again and to have life put back into it, which I am convinced will happen.  I sense that there is a very good management team in place and very committed staff there, with whom I am very privileged to work.  My sense is that there is a good board there too.  I do not know the people on the board but I sense it is more than just a job for them.  I would prefer to put that on ice for the moment and see how we get on with the Shannon Group as it is.  Sometimes one is better off being smaller and fighting for one's place.  We have slightly different objectives to places like Dublin Airport.<br/><br/>The Deputy and others mentioned regionality.  Shannon Airport is absolutely core to the region.  If one has that really good focus, it gives one a better opportunity to achieve one's objectives rather than being part of a much bigger picture.  Having said that, I would not rule it out.  <br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned rail lines and ambition-----</p></speech>

I would suggest that there should be a rail link between Limerick and Shannon Airport but also between Galway's Ceannt Station and Shannon Airport because I see a lot of growth coming from the Galway region.  That would bring seamless access.  Oranmore is on the outskirts of Galway city.  At the moment, people are driving to Oranmore, getting on a spur and within six minutes they are in Galway station.  They do not have to try find parking and it is a lot better, environmentally with a lot less congestion and traffic coming into Galway city.  Public transport infrastructure coming into Shannon is critically important and would add huge value.</p> <p>  Deputy Wynne suggested that a rail link is ambitious.  Yes, it is ambitious but if the Deputy knows me, she will know that is my middle name.  I am an ambitious guy and I cannot help it.  I do not always succeed but I will give it my best shot.  The key stakeholders are the chambers of commerce in Shannon, Limerick and Galway and I am really keen to meet them as soon as possible to get their input into the whole process.  They are a vital cog in all of this and I am glad the Deputy raised that.</p></speech>

I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom f&iacute;orfh&aacute;ilte a chur roimh Ph&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis agus t&aacute; mo thaca&iacute;ocht ioml&aacute;n go m&oacute;r aige mar chathaoirleach nua den bhord Shannon Airport.  If an advertisement for the power of experience and the benefit of conducting hearings with potential chairmen is needed, then this morning's meeting is an example that should be shown across the Oireachtas.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh comes to the position with a vast tome of experience.  I am a bit biased on one level because I have fond regard for Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  He is a person of huge experience and ability and will guide the board of Shannon Airport well.  I say that as a partisan Cork person who always advocates for Cork Airport.  I am very much taken by his remarks earlier about working together and not having a race to the bottom.  I really hope we do not do that.</p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to ask a couple of questions.  It is important for this committee to affirm and support Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh in his new role.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh made reference earlier to Shannon Airport being a junior partner.  We have had an issue with the separation of various airports from the DAA.  There was a debate about Cork in the past.  Shannon split from the DAA in 2013.  Does Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh think that was a good idea?  Has it worked for Shannon?  I ask that in the context of the questions posed by Deputies Dooley and Carey regarding passenger numbers which plummeted long before Covid was an issue.  The airport has not met its passenger number targets at all since the separation in 2013.  Has that separation been a success for Shannon Airport?</p></speech>

It has also been a big financial success for the State and the Government in terms of the extra jobs that have been created and the focus that is around the 300 companies on the campus.  Approximately 80 of those companies are focused on aviation, going to the next stage in terms of autonomous driving and so on, which is really cutting edge <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>transport.  From that perspective, it has been successful.<br/><br/>On passenger numbers, there is work to be done but the business model of an airport is different to that of an airline.  As an airport, we need to understand the kind of business model that triggers an airline to base an incredibly expensive piece of equipment, an aeroplane, at an airport.  I believe Shannon Airport will be successful off its own bat.  The transition in 2013 and 2014 was huge and took up an awful lot of staff and management time.  The focus was on the transition and then it was on how the airport could become standalone.</p><p>As has been mentioned, the best way of becoming stand-alone was deemed to be getting income from renting out the property.  A great deal of investment was put into the property in order to make it rentable and to bring in businesses.  A lot of great work has been done.  As the Chairman and others mentioned, the primary work had to do with driving passenger and flight numbers.  That will be the core.</p></speech>

To be fair, he has been clear this morning.  There is a clear demarcation between the chief executive and Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, as board chairman.  How will the strategy that Shannon will operate post Covid bring in passengers, given the comments from Deputy Cathal Crowe and others about various airlines?</p></speech>

However, it is what it is.</p> <p>  There is a big difference between the executive and non-executive roles.  My role is to understand where Shannon stands right now under the bonnet.  I have a sense of it, but I have a lot of learning to do very quickly.  The question will then be where it is we want to go.  I am keen to return to pre-pandemic levels within three years.  I am putting my name to that.  It is a clear and specific aim.  We know the number - 1.7 million passengers - and the routes.  We may or may not succeed, but this is about setting the vision and working with the management team in creating that vision.  The management team has good relationships with various airlines, for example, but perhaps I have another relationship with a particular airline, CEO, board chairman or whatever.  If I do, then let us use it as a resource in support of Shannon.  That is how I view my role.  I will provide an example of something that arose just yesterday, so this is my first time mentioning it.  I have to go to the US in mid-November, hoping that the US authorities will open up their borders for non-Americans.  I have a board meeting relating to something else in Houston, Texas, but I am going to Chicago.  I am trying to meet the CEO of United Airlines, whose headquarters are in Chicago.  His name is Scott Kirby and I have a funny feeling that he might have a connection with Cork.</p></speech>

Regardless of whether we like it, we are in a Covid era.  I hope that we can function normally, but Covid is always lurking in the background.  I will not use the word "interfere", but how will that influence or act as a variable in an airport like Shannon getting back to 2019's figures in 2024?  How does one factor in Covid?  How does it change the dynamic when dealing with airlines and so forth?  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh mentioned the US.  We have pre-clearance, which is a major comparative advantage for us.</p></speech>

What are the implications of the current environment for how an airport like Shannon returns to interacting with airlines like Aer Lingus, Ryanair and others?</p></speech>

They were here before, but we did not fully recognise them for what they were.  We have restructured the way we do business and we look after our staff and passengers.  That will continue happening in Shannon.</p> <p>  An aeroplane has similar air filters to the ones found in operating theatres.  The filtration of viruses and other particles is as pure as one will find in an operating theatre.  That has been the case for years at airlines with newer aircraft, and Ryanair in particular.  Ryanair is a world leader in terms of the environment and air filtration.</p> <p>  Shannon has another interesting aspect.  There were 1.7 million passengers pre pandemic, but Shannon can cater for more than 4 million.  It is a big airport.  As such, it is much easier to have physical distancing in a place like Shannon than it is in a place where there is a large number of passengers but a congested area.  I hope that, from a marketing point of view, this is one of the points we could make about Shannon.  People can park their cars at Shannon Airport and be through security in ten or 15 minutes.  There are very few international airports in the world that can provide that.</p></speech>

That is a great point and makes mine even stronger again.  The Covid situation is here to stay.  There are Government regulations that all of the committee's members are a part of creating and that we will follow strictly.  That said, from a staff point of view and a passenger perspective, we have the physical space to allow us to do what I have set out.  The single most important aspect for any airport or airline, even more than money, is the safety of its passengers and staff.  If we do not have that, we can forget about everything else.</p></speech>

I was in EY a million years ago while training to be an accountant, so I know the company better than many people.  To have won those awards and be brought back as a judge says a great deal about Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's talents and abilities that perhaps many of us do not totally appreciate.</p> <p>  I am speaking as someone who had three west of Ireland grandparents who are unfortunately no longer with us.  Equally, though, I am based in Dublin.  I am not someone who will say that I do not want Shannon to thrive.  Quite the opposite.</p><p>If up to 4 million passengers, which is at capacity, wanted to fly out of Shannon Airport rather than Dublin Airport, then it would help the latter as much as the former because many people, particularly in the midlands, automatically think of Dublin Airport.  If one lives in Portlaoise or anywhere in the midlands, one is equal distance from Dublin and Shannon Airports.  There are car parking charges in Dublin Airport and one must get a bus to get to and from the carparks.  One can literally drive straight to Shannon Airport, park one's car and get through security and pre-clearance faster than one will ever get through Dublin Airport.  That is always going to be the case as long as Shannon Airport is as small as it is relative to Dublin Airport being as big as it is.  Sometimes people forget how convenient Shannon Airport is.  I have never flown through Shannon Airport but why would I as I live in Dublin?  I have visited Shannon Airport, so I can say I have seen the airport and been inside it.  As a committee, or individually, we should visit Shannon Airport but, of course, that would be at the invitation of the chairman-designate.</p></speech>

The group is primarily made up of the airport and everything around it but it is also has a big property portfolio and Shannon Free Zone, which used to be known as the Shannon Development Zone.  The group is much bigger than the airport.  I do not have enough knowledge about the airport, and I am sure other members of the committee may have more knowledge about it, but not necessarily as much as they could or should have.</p> <p>  Dublin's growth is unhealthy when compared with the rest of the country in terms of airports and many other things.  Dublin, as much as anywhere else, needs better balance and there must be a better regional balance between all of the regions.  I say that because there are challenges when an area is too busy in terms of house prices being too high, not having enough school places and everything being stressed in a different way.  In fact, many people fly out of Dublin Airport because they do not see an alternative, so perhaps Shannon Airport could become an alternative.  It is a vicious circle the other way.  Nobody flies out of Shannon Airport so, therefore, there are no routes but it is because there are no routes that nobody flies out of Shannon Airport.  Let us consider the reverse where people start flying out of Shannon Airport, more routes become available and people realise the airport is fantastic and they can avail of the services very simply.</p> <p>  I do not think anyone has touched on the enormous history of Shannon Airport.  I refer to the fact Irish coffee was invented at the airport and that duty free was established there as a concept.  It is a fact that Shannon Airport was part of the route through which millions of post-war passengers travelled through.  At that time almost everybody who flew out of Paris, London or Amsterdam had to stop-off at Shannon Airport, then Newfoundland and so on.  Shannon Airport had a very ingenious relationship with Aeroflot in the 1980s.  A Soviet fuel farm was built, the tankers came in, Aeroflot paid for its landing charges in fuel, and fuel was sold to Aer Rianta which sold it on again.</p> <p>  Shannon Airport has been incredibly innovative.  Guinness Peat Aviation, GPA, was not the ultimate success but it was based at Shannon.  Tony Ryan was very insistent on that and he went on to become Mr. Ryanair.  Shannon Airport has an enormous amount of aviation history.</p> <p>  I appreciate that the role of the chair of the Shannon Group is non-executive, which is hands-off as much as it is hands-on, and that the chair is not a chief executive.  From the perspective of a transport committee, and really from an Ireland Inc. perspective, it is not Dublin versus Shannon, which Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh referenced earlier.  I know that because I listened to all of the contributions in my office.  It is Ireland versus other European hubs in the competition for business from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Qatar or from the west coast of America and so on.  I want to put it on record that I do not believe there will be a kickback from Dublin, the Dublin region or Dublin representatives.  Many Dublin representatives come from the country or their parents or grandparents did, so these representatives want more balanced regional development.  A visit to Shannon Airport would benefit this committee.  I wish Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh very well.  I did not have questions because my questions were already asked.</p></speech>

Can Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh tell us why Dublin Airport has grown exponentially relative to the likes of Shannon and Cork Airports?  We have talked about the fact Dublin Airport is congested.  Shannon Airport has the biggest runway in Europe and huge capacity, so why has Dublin Airport continued to not only increase its passenger numbers but its share has increased exponentially?  That is something Senator Horkan has mentioned on many occasions but I have framed the question.  I think Senator Horkan posed this question and I ask Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, who has practical expertise in aviation, why has that happened?</p></speech>

The single biggest reason is numbers.  About 2 million people live within an hour's drive of Dublin Airport or almost half of the population of Ireland.  There is another factor to be considered.  I do not have the exact figure - I am near enough in percentage terms - but more than 70% of all of the passengers who move in and out of Dublin Airport are delivered by two airlines, that is, Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  The headquarters of Ryanair and Aer Lingus are in Dublin.  When headquarters are based in a place, then it is more than likely the number of flights will increase.  I have listed the two biggest reasons and it is very much a numbers game.</p></speech>

While it does not have the same catchment in terms of population, one could drive a good bit further and still get through Shannon Airport more quickly than if one had to drive to Dublin and catch a flight from Dublin Airport.  Shannon Airport needs to remind people that the region has a smaller local population in terms of Limerick, Shannon and Galway.  However, one could drive a good bit further to get to Shannon Airport.  There could even be rail links, if we got them up and running.  The experience of moving through a small airport, and we have all been through small airports that have 2 million or 3 million passengers a year as opposed to 30 million passengers a year, is a different and much faster experience.  If I lived in a place like Portlaoise, if there were flights from Shannon Airport, I would avail of them, even it meant paying an extra &euro;10.  The point has been made that flights do not have to be any dearer and surely the cost of running Shannon Airport cannot be more expensive once management gets the economy of scale up and running, per passenger charge.  The facilities are all there, and there is under-utilised capacity so let us all try to make it work.  I am certainly available to help and support Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as best I can.</p></speech>

If we wear the same jersey, then we will all reach the top but if we do not, then there will be a race to the bottom.

That is appreciated.  It is an open door.  As of now, I have not met the CEO or anybody in that space because I do not have the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>for that, but I hope to do that.  I also will work very closely with the CEO of the Shannon Group in regard to the process we go through.  I am keen that the board and I will work closely and seamlessly with the management team in Shannon Airport.  I do not want to be going over what it is doing.  We have to work as a team.  I see that as one of the top priorities.  <br/><br/>Another top priority, although the Deputy did not ask about it but I mentioned it earlier, is public transport access in and out of Shannon Airport.  It is not, in my view, where it should be at.  We need to improve that area.  An issue not yet mentioned, which is pretty high up on my agenda, is that Shannon Airport become one of the most environmentally friendly airports in the world.  There is no reason we cannot achieve that.  I am raising that for the first time at this meeting.  We can do that.  </p></speech>

In other words, it is about how we operate internally?  As part of our conversations with airlines we can look at their environmental strategies.  It is an issue we can raise with them but in respect of which we cannot influence them.  We can emphasise that that is an important part of our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>in regard to who we are.<br/><br/>I am also keen to learn what other airports do in this particular space and what type of models they use.  I do not have that information yet.  It is very early stages. This is only at concept stage in my mind.  I have done some reading on it and I have had a couple of Zoom calls with some people in this space, in particular a professor in the US who is in this space, but it is too early for me to give any detailed comment at this stage.</p></speech>

Airports and climate change do not necessarily have a great relationship, particularly in the media.  That is a vital piece of work.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh mentioned that in terms of communication he will engage in joint planning with the DAA and so on.  It goes without saying that that is vital.  I would like some more detail on how he sees Shannon Airport progressing into the future and on what proposals he has to ensure the long-term viability of the airport.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has great experience in this area and he knows that it has to work as a business.</p></speech>

It is a State organisation.  All of the funding invested in Shannon Airport will, hopefully, bring returns for the State.  That is important.  The more successful we are in Shannon, the more successful and richer will be the State coffers to support all of the investments that are done by the State in different ways.  I am cognisant of that.  It is a significant responsibility.  It is a significant contribution when you can make that happen.  We have to try to do that to the best of our ability because our owners are the State.</p> <p>  To achieve the objectives and to get back to 2019 levels in the next three years during my term as non-executive chairperson of Shannon Group, it will be down to stakeholders.  There is only a very small amount that I personally can do.  I will give it whatever energy I can, but we need the committee to be actively involved and supporting Shannon Airport and regional development strategies.  The influence of this committee with the Government and the Department is fundamentally critically important to us.  If we get that, it is a big add-on for us.  There are other stakeholders, which I mentioned earlier, that are really important to us as well.  There is no need for me to mention them again now.  The committee has a central role in all of this.  As non-executive chairperson, I need to make sure that the committee is engaged and inside the tent working with us and that it supports us yet challenges us in different ways to help us to do our job better than we would if operating in a vacuum.  I will be pushing the boat out with the committee to work actively with us.  I know I will get its support, on the basis of what I have seen around the table and the people who have contacted me over the last couple of weeks.  I am looking forward to working with the committee.  That is the best answer I can give Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; at this stage.</p></speech>

We, as a committee, very much look forward to the invite to visit Shannon Airport.</p><p> I am delighted Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has taken up the challenge.  He is the person for the job and we will work with him, which goes without saying.  Shannon Airport is fundamentally an airport.  The T&aacute;naiste is on record, and I brought this up in the D&aacute;il, as saying Government is willing to put money into the reactivation of strategic routes and the continuation of strategic routes.  I namechecked the Heathrow, Boston and New York routes as three critical routes out of Shannon Airport.  Heathrow is up and running with one flight but we want three.  We have Boston and New York.  All flights are with Aer Lingus, but I am not taking away in any way from other airlines.  Ryanair is hugely important.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh mentioned the statistic that 70% of flights out of Dublin are Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  Willie Walsh, former CEO of IAG and now with IATA, said that 60% of all flights out of Ireland were with Aer Lingus and Ryanair, so they are critical.</p><p> Will Government support be required when the runway in Cork reopens to ensure the Heathrow slots are retained by Aer Lingus, that we get early morning and late night flights, that we get the three flights per day and that we get the Boston and New York flights back with Aer Lingus in March or as early as possible?  What form should that Government support take?  That is the bread and butter.</p><p> I can go out my front door and go to the Hurlers pub in Castletroy where I can get a bus to Dublin Airport.  Why can I not go to D'Olier Street in Dublin and get a bus to Shannon Airport?  There is a requirement for marketing.</p><p> Can Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh deal with the first question on three flights per day to Heathrow and on the Boston and New York flights?  The Government is saying it will put money into a hierarchy of routes and the T&aacute;naiste said the three routes I mentioned, Heathrow, Boston and New York, were not wide off the mark.  What does Shannon Airport need in Government supports to increase the number of flights to Heathrow from the one to three flights per day with better times, morning and evening, and to get the Boston and New York flights back with Aer Lingus?  It is a hard question but it is fundamental.</p></speech>

About two weeks ago Spain approved &euro;2.3 billion in airport infrastructural investments between 2022 and 2026 and Aena, the company that manages a number of airports in Spain, is freezing airport tariffs.  I am not asking the Irish Government to put in anything like that but two things need to be done.  I mentioned one in the opening statement.  The inclusion of Shannon Airport in the State's regional airports programme is hugely important as it will help drive future development and growth bringing certainty and predictability in uncertain times, in particular in Covid-19 times.  If the Government brought Shannon Airport under that State regional airports programme, that would be quite significant.  That is a long-term, permanent request.</p> <p>  The second requirement is more short term.  If we can get airlines into Shannon Airport - I mention London Heathrow, New York and Boston - and if we can say to Aer Lingus, Ryanair and other airlines that for a period of three years, while they are building their market, they will not have to pay any landing or airport charges and that we will get that money from the Government for a period of three years following which it will be tapered off, that would incentivise them to come in.  There are other airports around Europe which are looking for Aer Lingus and Ryanair airplanes and which are offering that type of deal.  If we are not-----</p></speech>

We are coming out of Covid-19, with passenger numbers at fewer than 3 million. Under European Commission rules, there is scope there for the Government to provide support.  That would be Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's fundamental request on the flights at the moment.</p></speech>

Initially airlines are not going to make money on services as it takes time to build them up.  I want to reduce their financial risk and when the passenger numbers are up to a sustainable level and they are getting a return on their investment, the Government funding should taper off.</p></speech>

It is because of the choices and the options people have in Dublin.</p></speech>

In regard to the primary market, when we were in school we had a compass with a pin and a pencil at each end.  If we put the pin of the compass on Shannon Airport and drew a circle around it, it would cover Clare, north Cork, a good bit of Kerry, the midlands, as was mentioned earlier, Galway, parts of Roscommon and the western seaboard.  There are approximately 1.2 million people living in that broad area.  That is the core of the compass.<br/><br/>In regard to the secondary part, it goes back to an important question asked earlier about the relationship between Shannon Airport and the various airports.  There are routes that Shannon should be providing that may not be provided out of Dublin Airport or Cork Airport, and <i>vice versa</i>, so we could work together as a team wearing the one green jersey.  Therefore, if you want to get secondary markets for people who want to go to those destinations, rather than duplicating things where everyone wants to go here or there, we should work together on the basis that there are some routes which are more suitable to Shannon.  If somebody from Dublin wants to go to a particular destination, it should be worth his or her while driving or, preferably, getting a train or a bus and travelling to two hours to Shannon Airport in order to go directly to that destination.  That is part of what I would like to explore with Cork and Dublin Airports.</p></speech>

It might happen.  It would be a huge risk.  You could crash.  The effect of it happening with it versus without it is hugely significant.  I am not saying we will not achieve it but the risk of not achieving it is so much higher.  Actually, the more important point is the Exchequer will make that money back in jig time because of the passengers going through and the extra revenue.  As I said at the beginning, the members, myself and all Irish taxpayers own Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

As mentioned earlier, I was a member of the aviation task force set up in May or June of last year.  We got very busy people involved, who understand aviation inside out.  The delay in executing some of the key aspects there is disappointing, quite frankly.  The fact we did not follow what was happening in European aviation was disappointing, to be honest, and left the industry in an extremely precarious situation.  This is particularly the case for an island economy like ours.  We do not have a bridge to Europe.  Aviation is our bridge.</p></speech>

It is going to take us longer.

I like Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's presentation of this, namely, that there is no point in us competing with Dublin or Cork and we must work with them.  We must have, as he said, our primary and then our secondary targets.  That is all very well but what does he want to see in an aviation plan that will assist Shannon in the first instance, but also all three airports, to recover?  What are the three key elements?  He has already spoken this morning about the three-year deal on airport charges, landing fees and so on.  Outside that though, what do we need to do in this aviation plan to drive Shannon and indeed drive all three airports?</p></speech>

I am aware the Department is very actively involved in that particular space.  From my engagement with the Department, it is very much on board and keen to have an effective aviation strategy for Ireland.  I will say a couple of things.  What is the vision?  What do we want to achieve here?  Given where we are coming from, that is, we are an island nation physically surrounded by water, what is the purpose of the aviation strategy?  The first and primary purpose is connectivity, and connectivity with the world.  How do we create that connectivity?  What strategies do we need to have in place to make that connectivity as seamless as possible?  On that connectivity, where are the key areas we want that connectivity?  I am talking about, as the Chairman, Senator Dooley and others have said, London Heathrow with three flights a day at the proper times and the transatlantic routes.  A very interesting point was raised by Deputy Cathal Crowe in relation to Riyadh.  Where we want to get to is fundamental in this.  Then there is the matter of what do we need from an infrastructure to help us get there.  To me, effective public transport links to the airports are really important.  Who are some of the key stakeholders to help us there?  One such stakeholder is Tourism Ireland due to its marketing of the island of Ireland internationally.  I would also welcome an opportunity to meet with and discuss the strategy the organisation may have for Belfast International Airport, George Best Belfast City Airport, and City of Derry Airport because that should be part of the overall sense of people coming to the island.  That is not a political statement or anything.  It is a purely economic practical statement, to be honest.</p></speech>

The other side of it is that Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is going to be chair of the Shannon company and there is huge potential for an aviation school perhaps, and pilot training facilities.  There is a lot of land in Shannon and a lot of capabilities.  Consider what has happened with aircraft leasing and all that over the years.  Much of that started in Shannon, going back to Guinness Peat Aviation, GPA.  Thus we must look at the side industries that can develop around an airport as well.  They could create thousands of jobs.  There is no reason that cannot happen in Shannon and the mid west.</p></speech>

There is a very fine training school in Cork.  There was one, about four to six years ago in Waterford that did not work and had to close down, unfortunately.  Members may be aware many people actually remortgaged their homes to do pilot training which is very expensive.  An aviation school is very interesting.  The possibility of working with the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology or the National University of Ireland Galway might be a really interesting concept to explore from that perspective.  I might add that pilots must do ongoing training every six months.  It is mandatory.  I am sorry, the training is at least once a year.  It is a health check they must do every six months.  There is the possibility to develop simulator training, what is called sim training.  There is one in Dublin at the moment and that caters for a fair amount but there may be the possibility of more, or that company may be interested in setting up simulator training programmes in Shannon, for example.  Senator Conway's point is well made and I have made a note of it.  I thank him.</p></speech>

In terms of the Aer Lingus London to Shannon service which will operate for ten weeks while Cork Airport is closed, Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh said he was willing to work with Aer Lingus to expand on that.  I would like the airport to be developed as a European hub.  When I was a member of a committee in the past I had to travel to Brussels a good deal.  There is no connectivity between Shannon Airport and Brussels.  The representatives of many companies travel to European cities on business trips and Brussels and Amsterdam would be key cities.  I would like connectivity to be developed between Shannon Airport and one of those key cities.  Many business people have to travel to Dublin Airport to get flights to those cities.  If such connectivity was available on their doorstep in Shannon Airport, they would use it.</p><p> Regarding transatlantic routes, I welcome the announcements made by United Airlines and American Airlines.  Has Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh any plans to expand those routes or to consider flights to other areas?  </p><p> To follow up on Senator Conway's thinking on the setting up of an aviation school, there are many aviation leasing companies in the region.  Many companies with a link to the airport have based themselves in Shannon.  Has Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh any plans to examine other options in terms of companies locating on the grounds of Shannon Airport?  </p><p> While the number of passengers travelling through the airport have dropped, I was there recently when the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, visited the airport and it was good to see many cars in the car park compared to a few months previously when there were only about 20 in it.  Things are coming back.  Shannon Airport has one of the longest tarmac runways in the country.  It is the only airport in the country that is open 24-7, 365 days a year.  Shannon is very proud of that.  Has Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh any options to expand connectivity to other destinations to create a regional balance with Dublin?  Dublin Airport is very busy.  While the number of people travelling is reduced, can expanded connectivity to other destinations such as Asian countries be explored?  To travel to those destinations or to Australia, one has to travel from Dublin Airport?  Is Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh considering other options? </p></speech>

The first transatlantic flight happened in 1945.  Shannon Airport was the world's first duty free airport in 1947.  Senator Horkan mentioned some of this history, which got me thinking about this.  Shannon Airport had Europe&rsquo;s first US border pre-clearance in 1986.  The runway Senator Byrne mentioned is 3,199 m, which is the longest in Ireland.  It is designated at the alternative landing site for the space shuttle.  There is much to be proud of in Shannon Airport.  It is important not to forget what its contribution has been.  That is also part of our future.  It does not mean we always look back but we must recognise where we are coming from.  I can understand where the board of the group was coming from in 2013.  It wanted to have a proper solid cash flow and a good base underpinning it.  I can understand its focus on the property and income from it.  That has been achieved and, as the Chairman said, going forward it is about air services and passengers.  That is my primary focus in my involvement on the board for my three years in this position.  </p> <p>  Senator Byrne mentioned the establishment of an aviation business hub.  Currently, more than 300 companies are located on the Shannon Airport campus and more than 80 of those are purely aviation related.  It is by far the largest such grouping in Ireland.  Obviously, we must place an emphasis on that.  Shannon could be the Silicon Valley in that space with respect to aviation hubs.  A number of aircraft leasing companies and so on are based there.  All those companies are going through a tough time.  Industries directly and indirectly connected with aviation are going through a very tough time.  This is a transition period.  It is important the message that goes from this meeting is not to have too high expectations but to have realistic expectations.  We will not change the world here overnight.  The first transatlantic flight landed in Shannon in 1945.  That is a good few years ago.  I do not think any of us was born at that stage.  </p></speech>

Let us take it step by step and it will be small steps.  Let us make sure we are going in the right direction.  That will be my role as the non-executive chairman of the group.  It will also be to listen to the members of the committee and other stakeholders.  There have already been a number of valuable contributions from a business and strategic point of view, on which I have made notes and which we will definitely consider and follow up.  Also, at this meeting in my view it has emerged that the committee, and the Chairman is supportive of this, will have one of its meetings in Shannon.  It will request a letter be sent to the Taoiseach asking for a Cabinet meeting to held in Shannon to show support for it.  There is also a strategy on zero landing fees and airport fees for airlines to get services up and running on a tapering basis for three years.  Shannon is part of the regional airport policy and strategy.  If we can get those across the line, we will be going in a very good direction.</p></speech>

I know what a champion of the west he has always been.</p> <p>   I want to raise an issue with him that has been referenced by a few colleagues.  When he said we have to wear the same jersey, he was right.  I agree with him.  When he said we must avoid a race to the bottom, he is spot on.  The difficulty is that under the current structure Shannon is not wearing the same jersey.  It is a wearing a different jersey from the jerseys of Dublin and Cork.  Is it realistic on an island this small to pit Shannon in direct competition with Dublin and Cork?  I will cite the most stark example of that.  Following the separation of Shannon Airport, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA. moved its shared services centre, which was based in Shannon, because it did not want to give revenue to a competitor.  That is how stark it is.  I am pleased Dalton Philips has wished Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh well and I do not doubt his sincerity in that regard.  However, the current structure pits Shannon against Dublin as a competitor.  I know from talking to the workers in Shannon Airport and having linked in particularly with the trade union representatives,  who are passionate about Shannon, that they are very clear about the fact that the separation has failed.  It is an issue that will have to be tackled.  With all the good intentions we have, and the fact there was a united call from the Oireachtas transport committee for a new national airport authority, this is the key issue that must be tackled because unfortunately the current structure puts Shannon in competition with Dublin.</p><p>Does Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh see that as a problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021100700002#P00200"><p>In the past Shannon would have been seen as being in competition with Dublin and various people would have said so.  I accept that was the situation.  It is going to be a big challenge for me.  Indeed, it is one of the key challenges I face but as Senator Gavan knows, if there is not a big challenge, I am not interested.  I cannot help it.  It is the Connemara in me, it is my DNA.  I cannot help it.  We should see what we can do for the moment.</p> <p>  I am very cognisant of what happened back in 2012 to 2014, when the people of Shannon and their public representatives were involved in a huge movement to make Shannon Airport independent.  They argued that Shannon was being lost in the bigger picture by virtue of being part of the DAA.  I want to be respectful of that but that does not mean the airport and the authority should not be connected as they were, prior to 2012.  I do not know the answer to that yet but I am more than happy to come back again and have that conversation with Senator Gavan on a one-to-one basis.  I would be delighted to meet him at some stage to get his views, input and support on it.  I would also be happy to come back to the committee but at this stage, I would prefer to focus on the direction we heading in the short term at least and we will see what success we can achieve from that perspective.  That said, it is not something that I would throw out at this stage.  It is an important part of the analysis of the long-term future of Shannon Airport and an important part of the debate.  </p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will be aware that this committee completed a report on aviation last year and suggested that this is an area that needs to be reviewed.  We are all trying to get to the same place.  The core issue at the moment is getting planes into the air but Senator Gavan makes a very valid point.</p></speech>

Back in 2011 Booz consultants reported that if Shannon Airport was to become independent, it would require a separate income stream to support it financially.  It may be difficult for our guest to answer this question before he takes up his new role, but where does Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh see that income stream coming from?  Shannon Airport has never actually had a steady income stream which, in fairness to the current management, makes it very difficult to plan ahead.  Decisions by Government are made on a year-to-year basis as opposed to any long-term financial commitment.  This is resulting in increased borrowings for the airport which is a key issue.</p></speech>

The Senator has put his finger on a very important point.  The key issue is where the Government, as the key stakeholder and owner of Shannon Airport, sees it going in the long term.  Reference was made to the aviation and transport strategy document which is being prepared at the moment and input into that by this committee and others would be very valuable.</p> <p>  If the 2011 report to which Senator Gavan refers is the same as the one as I read, it also suggested that there would be between 2.5 million and 2.7 million passengers in Shannon, which never happened.  The figures were very high and I believe that report was way too optimistic.  I would have questions in relation to-----</p></speech>

I had a really good meeting with representatives of Limerick Chamber of Commerce and Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is going to have a great relationship with that body in the years to come.  Like us, the chamber is really passionate to see the early morning London flight return.  A lot of key industries in Limerick and Shannon depend on that early morning flight.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has said some very positive things but does he think we can get that early morning Aer Lingus flight back and secured?  The fact that people can travel in and out of London in a single day is the value of that flight for businesses across the mid-west.  Is Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh optimistic that we will get that back in the near future?</p></speech>

Ultimately it is an Aer Lingus decision because it owns the Heathrow slots but it will certainly not be for the want of trying on our part.  Senator Gavan mentioned Limerick Chamber of Commerce, which is a key stakeholder in all of this.  I am really looking forward to engaging with the chamber.  I am delighted to hear that Senator Gavan met chamber representatives and had a conversation around these issues.  Every political person in the region should have a good, strong relationship with their local chamber of commerce and I am sure they do.  I hope the Government supports the recommendation supported by the Chairman and this committee that there would be zero landing charges and airport charges for airlines for three years.  Airlines will be losing money for the next couple of years until they build up the market again.  Zero landing charges would attract them in and would give people like me, the CEO of Shannon Airport and others, leverage with the airlines.

I have six questions and I hope Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will answer them all, if possible.  He mentioned promoting Shannon's environmentally-friendly credentials.  He will be aware that Shannon Airport has the longest runway in Ireland which enables planes to take off with a higher load than they can from shorter runways, thereby delivering greater fuel efficiency per passenger than is possible from any other Irish airport or, indeed, many other airports across Europe.  This brings me to a question about fifth freedom flights, that is, flights which start outside of the EU and whose destination is also outside of the EU, with Ireland as a transit point where passengers can board or disembark.  Shannon Airport was very much the fifth freedom hub in Ireland for a long time but was undercut by Dublin.  Shannon Airport went after Ethiopian business and was on the verge of signing a deal with Ethiopia when it was undercut, possibly with the help of an Irish Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid at the time.  What now for fifth freedom flights?  The fifth freedom flights arriving into Dublin provide relatively little added value to the Dublin region but would be very beneficial to Shannon in driving economies of scale.  Is that something that can be pursued?</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has repeatedly said that he is a non-executive chairman.</p><p>Will he explain the difference between an executive chair and a non-executive chair?  I have a related question.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh said that his role is to determine the strategic direction of the airport,.  Whose role is it to drive matters and achieve that strategic direction if he remains a non-executive chair?</p><p> Antigen testing was very topical at this committee for a while.  As a State, and unlike almost all other EU member states, we do not seem to have moved very much on this.  How important is antigen testing as an alternative to PCR testing in attracting people, and especially Europeans, to come back to Shannon Airport and to Ireland more generally?</p><p> Reference was made to Dublin Airport buses.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will be aware that the buses that serve Dublin Airport and the city of Dublin are blue.  They stopped throughout the pandemic and were not running.  There was no bus from Ballsbridge or from Leopardstown, take your pick, to Dublin Airport yet there was a bus from Shannon Airport to Dublin Airport throughout.  Can we get to the bottom of that?  Who is funding that?  It is clear that someone is doing so.  If it was not commercially viable to run a bus from Ballsbridge or Clontarf to Dublin Airport and it was viable to run a bus from the door of Shannon Airport to Dublin Airport, it begs some serious questions about fairness and a level playing field.  Will Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh be raising this with the Government to get to the bottom of it?  I suggest that it is indicative of something bigger.</p><p> There has been a great deal of talk about Heathrow slots.  At the moment, however, the only slots that are being utilised are those relating to Cork.  How real is the risk of losing the Heathrow slots when the guarantee runs out next year?</p><p> My final question is more of a statement, although I try not to make statements.</p></speech>

There were six key points raised by Deputy McNamara.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-07a.726" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021100700002#Q00900"><p>If I miss out on one of the Deputy's questions, I ask that he please come back to me.  Reference was made to the environment, fifth freedom flights and transit.  I really do not know a lot about that yet, but it is something I am keen to learn about.  I have made a note of it.  I cannot offer a comment until I have enough information on that, which I hope to get over the coming weeks as I read myself properly and fully into my new role as non-executive chairman.</p> <p>  This brings me to the Deputy's second question about the difference between the non-executive and executive chairman role.  As I see it, a non-executive chair is very much a part-time role, the primary function of which is to chair anything between eight to ten board meetings a year, each lasting up to two to three hours and sometimes longer.  The executive chair is a full-time role.  That is the primary difference.  The Deputy also asked about the difference between the chair, the chief executive officer and the management team, and the strategic direction.  In my view, it is the board and not the chair.  The chair facilitates the board.  The board creates the vision and works on the strategy with the management team.  Fundamentally, strategy is very simple.  The Deputy spoke of strategic direction.  With strategic direction, we start off knowing where we are at now.  It is totally honest, with no sort of bias.  It is just a case of asking where we are at now.  Then we ask where it is we want to get to.  Strategy is the bridge we build between where we are now and where we want to get to.  It is the board's role, in my view, to work with the management team in creating a realistic and effective strategy in creating it.  It is the management team's function to execute on the strategy.  Management are primarily in execution mode.  The board is not necessarily in execution mode.  All of the board, including me, are non-executive.  There are many other things going on in their lives, as is the situation with most, if not all, other State boards.  That is the difference in the role of the board versus the role of the executive.</p> <p>  With regard to the third question on antigen testing and the alternative to PCR testing, for the life of me I absolutely cannot understand why Ireland has been dragging its heels in respect of testing that is taking place in the EU and elsewhere.  I have watched parts of other committee meetings when people have been brought in here.  I am subject to correction on this but it may have been Professor Ryan who said that they do not have a real issue with airlines.  I remember raising this point also during a radio interview.  The air filtration in an aeroplane is similar air filtration to an operating theatre.  It is of that incredibly high standard.</p></speech>

The risks are not as high.  I cannot understand why we are not using a simple and effective PCR test, and especially now with the numbers of people who have been vaccinated.  The logic escapes me.  Maybe I am missing something.</p> <p>  Question number four was about no buses to Dublin Airport.  I was thinking to myself that I would not know this because I have not been in Dublin Airport in a long time.  I have been cocooned in Connemara, which is a great place to be cocooned by the way.  The Deputy asked about the bus between Shannon and Dublin and who funds it.  I have not a clue but I will make an inquiry.</p></speech>

I have not a clue about that.  In the first instance perhaps I will raise it with the CEO of Shannon Airport to see if she is aware of it.  We will probably take it from there.</p> <p>  The fifth question concerned the Heathrow slots and the risk of losing them.  Yes, I definitely would be concerned about that.  Maybe it is wishful thinking on my part, but I do not believe it is going to happen.  I mentioned earlier the numbers of passengers in and out of the UK from Shannon Airport was in the region of 600,000.  The number of passengers in and out of Heathrow from Shannon Airport was 268,000 in 2019.  That is a fair number of passengers.  Any airline should be able to make a return on that if it has a reasonably decent cost structure.  I am very hopeful that we would get Shannon Airport back in there.  There is, however, a risk of losing it.  The Deputy is right.</p></speech>

I do not see any reason those routes would not come back.  If we could incentivise them, as was mentioned earlier, it would help to make the decision easier, get them back faster and grow faster, and support Shannon Airport faster.

It is a no-brainer to be honest.</p> <p>  I have answered five.  The sixth question----- </p></speech>

I have quick follow-up on that.  Are there State boards where there are executive chairs as opposed to non-executive chairs and executive directors as opposed to non-executive directors?  Does Mr &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh believe that this needs to be considered given the scale of the challenge faced by Shannon Airport at the moment?</p></speech>

I genuinely do not know.  It may be worth sending a letter to see if that is the situation.  I believe that we are in a very particular situation regarding the aviation sector.  Regardless of who the person is, I really believe that an executive chair is critical for Shannon Airport in the short to medium term, not long-term, because of the position in which we find ourselves.</p><p>Some 1.7 million passengers passed through Shannon in 2019.  Last year, there were approximately 360,000.  That is 20% of the previous figure.  If we are to do our best to get back to that point, which is what I am putting my name on the table for, we have to multiply the passenger numbers fourfold, or 400%.  That is a serious challenge and will not be easy.  We will need the committee's help to get there.</p></speech>

I commend Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on his interaction with this committee and I look forward to working with him into the future.  One of the key issues that has emerged is the need for an executive chairperson position at the helm of the Shannon Group.

This role needs to be hands-on and Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has the time available, as well as the energy and passion.</p></speech>

For me, the kind of secretarial support that would be great to get would be a young girl, boy or man who has come out of college and is eager to learn about the aviation industry.  They could download whatever is inside this grey head of mine and those of others as regards what it is all about.  They could then develop themselves and create positive influences on aviation in Shannon Airport and in the aviation industry in Ireland.  There are enough third level institutions between Limerick and Galway so there are plenty of people who would love that level of experience.  As the committee members will know, I am adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at the National University of Ireland Galway and I am passionate about education.  I have already had a brief conversation on the phone with the CEO of Shannon Airport about this but it is important that we have a very strong, positive open relationship with third level institutions and this would be one part of where that would develop.</p></speech>

Sometimes it might be based on the departure of management, which is not the case in this instance.  We have a fantastic CEO but the scale of the challenge in terms of the recovery from Covid necessitates some positive discrimination towards Shannon Airport.  The challenge Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh faces is enormous.  He has outlined the difficulties, and he needs all hands on deck.  Normally, the role of chairman is somewhat hands-off in nature.  There is a board meeting once a month for a company that is progressing in a normal environment involved in corporate governance and all the standard things.  This is a roll-up-the-sleeves, hands-on-deck scenario for everybody.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has indicated a willingness and a capacity to work outside of Shannon, to travel and meet with airlines, chief executives and players in the industry.  That requires a significant time commitment.  In that context, I would be more than happy to second the proposal put forward by Deputy Carey.  Maybe we could write to the Minister about it.  I do not think it in any way takes from what was advertised because that was then and this is now.  That process was opened up a long time ago, long before the State realised the consequences for the aviation sector as a result of Covid.  The previous chairman's role ended a long time ago so there has been a process in place for a long time but there is justification for doing this, looking at all the concerns.</p> <p>  The one key issue that remains is the notion of separation.  I was probably a lone voice against separation at the time because I felt that Shannon Airport would never be able to compete effectively.  Separation was sold on the basis that a leaner, fitter Shannon could challenge Dublin.  Truthfully, that did not materialise and, based on what Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has said, it is never really going to happen.  It is about working with Dublin.  Overall aviation policy and bringing back a national airport authority would be my favoured long-term ambition.  That worked well, as it does with CI&Eacute;, where there are three companies all under the CI&Eacute; umbrella but working independently with some level of competitive tension.  In the current climate, we must work with Dublin and Cork airports.  It will take somebody like Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, who understands that relationship and sees the potential there, to do that.  It goes back to what Deputy McNamara raised about the fifth freedom flights and potentially cargo flights.  I welcome Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's approach to reaching out to Dublin Airport and having a collaborative environment rather than a competitive tension.  That is the way to go.</p></speech>

Shannon Airport is at a critical moment.  Based on our deliberations and on what we are hearing, we collectively feel that there is a need for an executive chair role in Shannon Airport for a period.  We will be writing to the Minister to say that we have met Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and are supportive of his appointment.</p><p>We will include that as something that should be considered, for a period of time, in view of the unique circumstances now impacting Shannon Airport.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh would be working with an excellent management team under Mary Considine, the CEO at Shannon Airport.  We must get aeroplanes back in the air and work collaboratively to do that.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will bring significant experience of the aviation sector to the non-executive role and add to the lift-off of Shannon Airport.  That is key.  </p><p> I call Deputy Cathal Crowe.  </p></speech>

I asked him about Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh taking on an executive role.  The suggestion was first made to me by some of the hoteliers in Clare.  They see the appointment of Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as an enabler for the region.  They asked me to put this question to the Minister for Transport.  The transcript of the meeting is not live yet.  The committee transcripts take about two weeks sometimes to come on stream.  However, the Minister's response was negative.  We have heard a doubling down on this proposal today and I again support it.  We should go back to the Minister again with it.</p> <p>  I made this proposal last week.  The Chair heard the Minister's response then.  He came up with several reasons why this proposal should not be accepted.  He stated that Ms Considine runs the airport from day to day as the chief executive and that Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh would have a chairing role.  That is fine.  A bedding-in period is required, however, where Ms Considine and Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh need to work in tandem to get us on a recovery trajectory.  I double down on this proposal in that context.  Others have also made the same proposal today, so let us go with that.  </p> <p>  There are opportunities here.  We have an infatuation with Ryanair, Aer Lingus and North American carriers and rightly so.  Those are the carriers that bring large volumes of people into Ireland.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh could push other opportunities in addition, however, during his tenure.  I refer to companies such as GainJet and other small private jet companies that fly into Shannon, some of which are based there as well.  We must explore the opportunities presented by those flights.  Some of those departures from Shannon originate in the Middle East and they go on to land in Washington D.C by night and important traffic is included in those flights.  Enabling works are being undertaken by the Department to expand on those activities as well.  </p> <p>  Recent months have seen much talk of the Air Corps.  I do not want to go near the separate debate about search and rescue, SAR.  What has been mentioned is the Air Corps moving away from the Pilatus propeller-driven aircraft it uses for pilot training and finally catching up with the rest of the world in using fixed-wing trainer jets.  There are capacity limitations in Baldonnel, and if those trainer jets are adopted, we should pitch in for them.  Lest anyone say that we are trying to unravel search and rescue, this is about the training of Air Corps pilots, which is a separate and distinct area.  We should be pitching Shannon Airport as the location for such fixed-wing trainer jet capacity.  </p> <p>  Locating a cargo hub at the airport has not been mentioned widely yet.  I have mentioned it several times at this committee.  Cargolux is a fantastic model where there is buy-in from the state.  It is a cargo carrier with a majority of shares owned by the state.  It goes all over the world.  Luxembourg is tiny, just slightly larger than County Clare, and yet it has a dominant global position in international air capacity.  Shannon Airport is well positioned in that regard.  We have heard many things mentioned in the last week, including motorways to Cork, talks in the Government about a rail cargo facility at Limerick Junction, rail spurs to Shannon, motorways to Foynes and estuary capacity.  All that lends itself to Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and the Shannon Group pitching the airport to the Government for something big to happen there.  There was much talk between the Government and Amazon about having a facility in Shannon and the mid-west.  With its long runway, Shannon can strongly position itself as a potential location for an air cargo facility. </p> <p>  We have talked about American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and other carriers.  JetBlue has now begun transatlantic flights.  The airline is flying in the UK twice a day.  I would love Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh to pitch to that airline.  It is flying into Gatwick Airport and conscious of its budget regarding landing.  Let us pitch to the company to touch down in Shannon, take on so many passengers and then go back.  In time, then, perhaps we could lock the airline into a full Shannon service.  For the moment, a quick touchdown in Shannon would enhance the airport's connectivity into America.  Anyone who has been in an American airport will have seen that United Airlines and American Airlines dominate, but JetBlue also operates an immense network.  I would love to see that pitch made.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh to wrap up on some of those points.  </p></speech>

More generally, this meeting was powerful, supportive and had many good ideas and positive contributions.  I thank members for that and I want this relationship to continue.  This is not all about what is wrong.  We can all talk about that aspect.  The committee is considering how to make things better.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe mentioned private jets.  There are many private jets in Dublin and that is the main space for this type of business.  In the UK, Luton Airport derives significant income from private jet flights.  I do not know how strong that business could be in Shannon.  I do not know what it is like now.  It is something I will need to find out.  Regarding the Air Corps, the single-engine Pilatus is a Swiss aircraft and is a good aeroplane.  Pluses and minuses are associated with such single-engine aeroplanes.  If that single engine fails in such an aircraft, you would need to be a good swimmer.  I will put it like that.  The Pilatus aircraft, however, has a very good safety record.  </p> <p>  Senator Conway mentioned training earlier as well.  What the members are saying, as I see it, is that it could be possible to support and add another angle for a market concerning training for the Air Corps.  That is interesting.  I made a note of it.  Turning to JetBlue transatlantic flights, funnily enough my son, another Cathal, was in Chicago and he phoned me to tell me that I should get in touch with JetBlue.  It would be an interesting group to get into Shannon.  It is on the radar from my personal perspective.  All the airline can do is say, "No".  </p></speech>

He developed software called Navitaire.  In my days in Aer Arann we used that software, although we could barely afford it.  It was the same software that Ryanair used back in the day for online booking.  I met Mr. Neeleman a few times, but not for a good few years. now.  We can rekindle those meetings.</p></speech>

It was seriously considered.  It seemed to be a good idea, but I do not know where that stands now.  I will need to check that out, and I apologise for not being able to give a fuller answer.</p> <p>  I was there on Friday and I bumped into Mr. Jim Gavin, assistant director of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, a Clare man, if he does not mind me calling him that, and the manager of the Dublin football team.  He is proud of his family coming from Clare.  One area that the IAA is focused on, and which is becoming a bigger focus in Shannon, is that of drones and the exploration of what they can do.  There is huge potential.  I refer to Shannon Airport and the IAA, the regulator, working hand in glove and becoming a European leader in the area of drone technology and drone safety.  I have been talking to representatives of the IAA about that for a couple of years and it is interested in that space.  I am keen to promote that further in Shannon and to work closely with the regulator to develop that technology.  It is a big part of the future of transport, aviation and movement.  </p></speech>

We all forget how valuable pre-clearance is as an asset.  I presume that even those private jets can use it if they are coming in at all hours.  They cannot do that in Luton or in loads of other places.  It is important to know that one has pre-clearance when one lands in America.  A flight could be delayed and it happened to me one time; we were supposed to be going to Chicago and the runway there was covered in snow so we were in Milwaukee for four hours.  I got back to Chicago and made my flight connection by about ten minutes but I had a four-hour gap.  If I did not have pre-clearance I never would have made that flight because one is walking into the airport as a domestic passenger.  Maybe we do not sell that enough from the point of view of Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport but we are talking about Shannon Airport today.</p> <p>  The fact that Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh knows so much about Dublin Airport is a good benefit.  Having had his airline based there and having worked there means he knows that side of it.  We have talked a lot about inbound tourism, in respect of people coming into the country and Shannon Airport creating tourist business.  Equally there is the home-grown market of 30 million to 31 million passengers who have historically flown out of Dublin Airport.  We are talking about figures of 400,000 passengers per year.  That was four days of Dublin Airport traffic at the height of the boom; it was doing 100,000 passengers per day.  Dublin Airport does not need to fear Shannon Airport.  If Shannon Airport went to full capacity in the morning, it would still only be 4 million passengers or so.  It will not suck 31 million passengers away from Dublin Airport; it is a tiny redistribution.  I will be and I am pro-Dublin Airport but that should not be at Shannon Airport's expense and it does not have to be.</p> <p>  This is not a reflection on any individual but in the past ten years, since 2011, every single Minister with responsibility for transport at Cabinet level has been based in Dublin.  The last non-Dublin based Minister responsible for transport at Cabinet was Noel Dempsey.  We had Deputies Varadkar and Donohoe, Shane Ross and Deputy Eamon Ryan.  That is not a bad thing but it shows that we all focus on our areas more than on other areas.  We all know we have to mind our bases and maybe Shannon Airport has suffered a little bit from that.</p> <p>  I am around long enough to remember when S&eacute;amus Brennan was the Minister talking about and implementing the break-up of the airport.  At the time Shannon Airport was probably crying out for that because it felt that Dublin Airport kept saying "No" to anything it wanted to do and that if it was independent, it could then do things.  That has not worked out the way people might have thought but at the time - and I remember the discussions about it - it was said that Shannon Airport was being squashed by Dublin Airport, that it would not let Shannon Airport do what it wanted and that Dublin Airport wanted everything for itself.  Shannon Airport was given the wings to do its own thing and lots of things have happened in the meantime, including Covid.</p> <p>  It is important that Shannon Airport and Cork Airport work.  That is for everybody's benefit, not just for those regions.  It is also beneficial to people in the Dublin region.  I wish Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh the best and I look forward to going to see Shannon Airport and the wider Shannon zone whenever that is possible.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh can be assured of my support and he will have the support of all the committee.  As for the question of an executive chairman versus a non-executive chairman, whatever needs to be done in order to make Shannon Airport the best should be done.  I do not want to undermine the chief executive and nobody wants to do that but equally, Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh brings a lot of skills to the position and the argument that he would be more hands-on than a normal chairperson for a period has a lot of merit to it and could be examined further.</p></speech>

Limerick Chamber did a report in conjunction with Copenhagen Economics and my colleagues would be familiar with it.  One of the things it put forward was getting a link to Frankfurt Airport and this was pre-Covid.  How important would that link be?  As there is a link to Heathrow Airport, what would a link to the likes of Frankfurt Airport bring to an airport like Shannon Airport and the region?</p></speech>

It would give options for onward flights, some of which we have in Heathrow Airport and some of which we do not have.  It is a direct link into Germany, which is a hugely important economy and there are lots of German companies in Ireland, including in the wider Shannon area so such a link would support and strengthen those companies.  In addition to point-to-point connection, there also is connectivity out of Frankfurt Airport which is regarded as the premier international airport in Germany.  Heathrow Airport provides some of that connectivity, as it goes west and east, but Frankfurt is a huge hub.  When I was a Senator a couple of years ago I went to Frankfurt on my own bat because I am passionate about SMEs.  Frankfurt has the largest incubation hub in Germany; it has something like 350 start-up businesses and companies.  I had a meeting with its CEO and the hub was interested at that stage in working with innovation hubs in Ireland and we could have created a win-win situation out of that.  We could do a lot of collaborative learning from that as well so a connection to Frankfurt would not just be purely airport-related.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh can see that there is cross-party, cross-community and stakeholder support for his appointment.  Shannon Airport is at a critical juncture.</p> <p>  In normal cases chairpersons of boards are non-executive.  That is the standard model and it is a good model but from what we have heard today, Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh can bring something with an executive role.  I take on board Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's point that regardless of whether it is an executive or a non-executive role, he will do his best and we welcome that.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh can bring a synergy to the Shannon management and board as an executive chair for a period of time because of his background and contacts in aviation.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has been chair designate for little over a week and we wanted him to come before the committee quickly so that he could hit the ground running as fast as possible.  We will write to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, today on foot of this meeting to say we have met Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, that we had an engaging meeting and that we are supportive of his appointment.  We will also say that in the circumstances that pertain with Shannon Airport, the Government needs to give serious consideration to making Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's role an executive chair role for one year to 18 months because of the synergies the airport needs to bring its passenger numbers back fourfold from 360,000 to 1.7 million in 2024.  The target would be between 2.5 million and 3 million passengers by 2027, which goes without saying.</p> <p>  We look forward to our Oireachtas group in the mid-west, chaired by Deputy Carey, meeting up with Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as soon as possible and Deputy Carey will issue that invite.  Furthermore, we will write to the Taoiseach and the Government to seek a meeting at the airport.  This shows intent and when we write to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, we will be stating that as a group.  I am sure the committee will agree with Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's request and the request we have made that there should be zero landing or airport charges for a period of three years until 2024 and until Shannon Airport gets back to some sort of level footing.  The Government is committed to putting money in and that should be expedited as quickly as possible.</p><p>There must be further discussions with the Shannon Group and with both Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as chair and Ms Mary Considine as CEO as well as the others on the management team.  That is the immediate thing.  We must see planes in the air.  We have a window of time now before Cork Airport opens.  We must ensure Heathrow routes continue at Shannon but more particularly that we get three daily flights, at morning, daytime and evening and that we get Aer Lingus to get the transatlantic flights running as quickly as possible.  I refer to Aer Lingus's routes to JFK Airport and Boston and as well as those of other airlines as well.  That is something we feel very strongly about.<br/><br/>Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's point on the task force and the new aviation strategy is something we will very much be taking up with the Government and the Minister.  We will have Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh back in before us on that matter again.<br/><br/>I wish Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh well.  This is a key appointment for Shannon, for the entire western seaboard and for Ireland Inc. overall.  Collectively as a committee we look forward to working with Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and his further engagement with us.  I have no doubt we will see him back here shortly.  <i>Bon voyage</i>.</p></speech>

Shannon must be front and centre in aviation policy.  Having the Cabinet coming down will set that marker.  The Shannon Group will issue the invite as well.  There is an urgency to the Government concluding discussions with Aer Lingus in particular, but also other airlines.  The three strategic routes we are looking at are Aer Lingus routes.  Ryanair should not be forgotten here.  It does phenomenal flights in and out of Shannon and they are huge.</p></speech>

On Heathrow, that must involve providing three daily flights in the morning, daytime and evening.  That is key, as is the restoration by Aer Lingus of the transatlantic flights to Boston, New York and so on.</p> <p>  Thank you very much &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  We wish you well.</p></speech>
