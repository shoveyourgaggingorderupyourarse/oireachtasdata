He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Cullinane and Deering.  On behalf of the committee, the staff and myself as Chairman, I offer our sincere condolences to Deputy Cullinane on the passing of his mother in recent days.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p> <p>  The minutes of 13 December is the next item on the agenda.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.  We just have to make one typographical correction.  The next item then is matters arising from the minutes.  There is nothing specific that we will not come to in the course of our meeting.  The next item is correspondence received since the last meeting.  There is quite a bit because it has been a month since the last meeting.  We will give this an hour or so and try to complete as much of it as we can.  I do not want to hold too much over indefinitely.  We go into our public session dealing with the Irish Prison Service some time after 10.30 a.m.  </p> <p>  The first item of correspondence in category A, briefing documents and opening statements, is Nos. 1835 A and 1845 A from the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 10 January 2019 and 16 January, and the briefing papers and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish those.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next category of correspondence is from category B, Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, as well as follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication.  The first item of correspondence is No. 1761 B from Ms Mary Lawlor, Communications and Public Affairs Manager, NAMA, dated 29 November 2018, providing further information requested by the committee in relation to Project Nantes and the question of the sale of assets.  We raised the issue in respect of section 172 disclosures.  I suggest we note and publish this letter from NAMA on the breakdown of the &euro;24 billion in asset sales categorised by the jurisdiction of purchaser.  In respect of the section 172 declaration, we are getting legal advice on that.  We might take that in private session early next week.  We will publish that documentation but we will have to come back and get legal advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, as NAMA has sought its advice as to where we are with this issue.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1792 B from Mr. Phelim Quinn, CEO, Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, dated 11 December 2018, enclosing a copy of HIQA's workforce plan for 2018 as requested by the committee.  It is good and positive to note that the Department has sanctioned 47 additional posts for the authority.  We will note and publish that, including the workforce plan.  It may already be in the public arena but we will publish it in any event.  The next item is No. 1794 B from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, dated 11 December 2018, providing notes requested by the committee in relation to Galway as the European Capital of Culture in 2020, including the role played by the Department's representative on the board as well as a note on monitoring reports and meetings.  We will note and publish that.  There are dates of meetings and reports.  </p></speech>

The next item is No. 1795 B from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 11 December 2018, providing a briefing note on the national broadband plan and metropolitan area networks, MANS.  We are going to have some of the private providers in that sector here at a special meeting.  This document has quite a bit of information provided on the national broadband plan, the reasons given by companies which exited the tendering process and a briefing note on the metropolitan area networks.  That includes specific reference to the maintenance of MANs contracts with Enet and the roll-over of that contract.  I know Deputy Catherine Murphy will want to speak on this.  I want to let people know to which document we are referring.  There is also an update on the national broadband plan as to where we are with that at the moment.  There are also some appendices attached showing the lists of various areas where the MANs network exists.  Finally, appendix 2 gives statistics on the increased use of Eircode.  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

There are some specific pieces of information that we sought.</p><p>One was the percentage of the investment by the Irish Infrastructure Fund that came from public funds.  Is that separate?</p></speech>

Some areas in the country covered by metropolitan area networks, MANs, contain blackspots.  We also looked for that.  It is more to do with mobile phone coverage than it is to do necessarily with the MAN.  However, it is one of the documents that was requested.  We should specifically go back after that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019011700002#C00800"><p>Okay, we will ask specifically for that where there might be parts of the metropolitan area not covered by the metropolitan area plan where there are obvious gaps in it.</p><p>For people who will read this document when we publish it, I want to highlight the reason Eir gave for withdrawing.  That is in this document.  The rationale for the State purchase of a &euro;200 million stake in Enet is there.  It continues to deal with the broadband plan.  We will come back to that because it keeps referring to high-speed broadband.  We have asked it to define what it means by that.  It refers to download speeds of 30 Mbps and upload speeds of 6 Mbps.  That is not high-speed broadband.  High-speed broadband is the biggest misnomer of all time.  That is not high-speed broadband by anybody's definition in this century.  If those figures are mentioned in any of the contract details, we are not getting what it says on the tin.  Before we finish with that we need specific data.  It has to be future-proofed.  If those types of references are in the contract, it is a waste of space before we start.  There should be no investment in broadband that is delivering 6 Mbps of upload speed.  That is a waste of money in this day and age.  If that is what the plan entails, we will need to discuss that in more detail.  We will be talking to a number of private operators here as set out in our work programme.  We have quite a bit to come back to on that.  For the moment, the letter contains interesting information and we are noting and publishing that.</p><p>No. 1797 from the HSE provides information as requested by the committee on the national ambulance service.  Deputy Lahart had requested information on this.  I propose we publish this and forward a copy of this to the Deputy.</p><p>Next is further correspondence from the HSE providing information on the development of national screening guidelines for hepatitis C; the reviews that have been undertaken in Portiuncula Hospital and the Portlaoise maternity hospital; issues relating to miscarriage diagnosis; and an update on the changes being made in clinical assessment.  We asked for this in the context of medical negligence issues.  We also asked for a note on the project team established to examine local reviews.  We asked for a note on the plan to enhance learning from incidents.</p><p>I wish to make a few comments on aspects of concern.  On page 4, the HSE confirms: &quot;Doctors may require retraining as part of the outcome of a disciplinary hearing, investigation of an incident or following a legal settlement with or without admission of liability.&quot;  The idea that they may require training is not good enough if there is a major incident.  It should be almost mandatory.  We will come back to that.</p><p>On the current practice of local reviews of an issue that arises in a particular hospital, at the bottom of page 5, it is stated: &quot;At a local level, once a review has been completed, learning is expected to be shared across the service...&quot;.  That is harmless.  If that is the policy, we expect something might happen.  The final page refers to the plan to enhance learning from incidents.  That is what we want.  We want the HSE to learn to reduce future incidents.  The letter states:</p><blockquote>Though the current practice outlined above remains valid, the HSE has identified that there are also a number of other ways in which learning can be captured&hellip;<br /><br />The second project is focused on putting in place a system whereby &lsquo;lessons learned&rsquo; from incident reviews can be provided to a single point within the organisation.</blockquote> <p>We are hearing that the HSE does not have a single point where lessons from medical incidents can be learned and it is now developing a project to centralise the lessons to be learned.  It is decades behind what is acceptable.  That will be the recommendation when we come to issue a recommendation on that; it is so obvious.  It is dreadful that it is saying that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019011700002#C00900"><p>This applies in other parts of the public service.  For example, a local authority has a legal requirement to give a decision for planning permission within a specified time.  It becomes almost the number one requirement because there is a legal requirement.  While it is a different scenario, the lack of a legal requirement to do this puts it down the pecking order.  When we issue a recommendation, we should consider requesting a statutory obligation rather than anything that would fall within the voluntary category because this is of such importance in changing the culture.  It changes the mindset if they can be sanctioned for not doing it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019011700002#C01000"><p>I welcome what is set out in this letter.  Is it adequate?  It certainly is not.  We should not just leave it to our report.  We need to look into this further to identify how to save money.  I could tackle this in many ways.  I could tackle it on an emotional level from my personal experience with family, which is most people's contact with the health service when something happens and they are left in that place.  Alternatively, I could tackle it in the way I should as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  What is proper governance?  When reviews are set up local independent outside the country, what do they cost?  What do they learn from them?  What can we avoid in the future?  That is the purpose.  Like the Chairman, I am in no way reassured that that is happening here.</p> <p>  I will give a specific personal example without going into any details whatsoever of an independent review of a family member that was carried out.  It was anything but independent.  It was absolutely forced from the system.  It was not proactive in what was an open-and-shut case involving admission.  Notwithstanding all that, it placed unacceptable pressure on a family to try to get some accountability.  I am only giving one tiny example.  This is repeated.  If we go back to Savita Halappanavar in 2012, there was no openness and accountability in that case.  It was dragged from the system and eventually an independent review was set up.</p> <p>  As the Chairman has pointed out, something must happen about learning.  That is an extraordinary statement.  Those of us on the committee are endeavouring to get value for money.  The health service is under pressure and I am the first to acknowledge that.  I have great admiration for most of the staff.  However, mistakes are being made.  Some are part of life and others are because of the extraordinary stress they are under, lack of training and lack of learning.</p> <p>  It ties in with the State Claims Agency, which ultimately picks up on behalf of the public the claims that inevitably come which people do not want to bring at all.  They want accountability and want someone to apologise.  They want someone to explain how something went wrong.  Most important, using my family as an example, they want assurance that this will not happen again and that the next patient will not suffer as experienced by a family member.  I do not see that happening.  I seek the Chair's assistance as to how we deal with this in terms of the HSE and the State Claims Agency because I am tired of this type of language.</p><p>More important, it is not bringing accountability to the system.  It is not saving money and it is not giving value for money.  I will finish on an issue, which I have raised previously.  I tabled a parliamentary question which asked what independent reviews had taken place in the hospital in Galway over the past ten years and I received the extraordinary answer that there was no system for recording reviews or their cost.  That is just about the review and the cost, without mentioning the learning from the reviews.  As a Deputy in Galway West, I do not know how many independent reviews were carried out over the past ten years, what they cost or, most importantly, what was learned and what changes were made.  I am referring to independent reviews but we also have the language of "local reviews".  We cannot leave this.  I would like to come back to it.  I will take direction on how to deal with it, but it is certainly a big issue.</p></speech>

What she is saying echoes my own view.  We are going to come to it in the work programme.  I will specifically recommend a special report on medical negligence.  We have flagged that well.  The cost to the Exchequer is &euro;2 billion.  That liability is sitting there and climbing every year.  The State Claims Agency and the HSE are involved.  I will just jump to the work programme for a moment.  Aside from our periodic report, I will propose that we do two special reports in the coming months on work we have commenced.  I propose one on medical negligence dealing with exactly what both Deputies have mentioned and a second on the issue of housing.  The chief executives of local authorities will come before the committee.  I expect two special reports.  I propose to pull these two separate reports together and that the committee publishes two separate reports.  We have commenced work on both of them.  That is a definite.  That will be a key part of our work programme in the near future.</p> <p>  No. 1799B is from the Department of Health providing information notes in respect of the profile on infection between primary claimants and others; the Health Research Board drug prevalence study; a breakdown of the administrative costs of the hepatitis C tribunal; and the individual original primary claimants.  We will note and publish all of that, arising from our previous meeting.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1800B from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, providing information regarding the breakdown of direct and indirect costs breakdown in respect of the Munster technological university amalgamation process.  We will note and publish that.  It is there for everybody to-----</p></speech>

The Deputy can raise it again at a subsequent meeting.</p> <p>  No. 1801B is from Mr. Paul Dunne, CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, responding to a request from the committee for a copy of the value for money report in respect of Irish Public Bodies produced in 2015.  It includes a letter dated 13 November 2018 from Irish Public Bodies that sets out its position, which is not to release the full report due to commercial sensitivity.  It also includes a summary report prepared by PwC in 2016 and the report of the Irish Public Bodies value for money steering group prepared in 2016.  To summarise, the Information Commissioner has recommended that this be published.  The matter is before the courts because Irish Public Bodies has objected to this being released under freedom of information legislation.  That matter is proceeding.  It has given us a summary document, which members will want to read and study, even though there is not much commercial information in it.  It has given us the summary report prepared by PwC in respect of the value for money review, which will be useful for members who have an interest in this area to review this document.  Finally, it includes a report from the Irish Public Bodies value for money steering group, which deals with the County and City Managers' Association, education and training boards, ETBs and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  We will publish that.  There is, however, one request in the letter, which is that some appendices not be published.  That is a separate item.  Irish Public Bodies is saying that, in its view, the publication of the summary does not unduly prejudice its interests.  It has happy for that summary to be published.  We will do that here today.  We note and publish that.</p></speech>

We are not seeing the totality of the claims throughout the public service.  Is that stated anywhere in the accounts?  Is there mention of the liabilities that do not go up the food chain to Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance, IPBMI?  I refer to claims that would normally fall under the category of insurance but which, because they are below a certain threshold, are not stated.  A large number of small claims can represent quite a sizeable amount.  Where is that captured?  Is it captured across the-----</p></speech>

In respect of Departments, claims that were settled in year are set out in a note in the appropriation accounts.  There is a figure and there is generally a separate figure for compensation and associated legal cost payments in the appropriation accounts.  Many State agencies will carry commercial insurance but insurance costs are not isolated as a separate item.  There is an element of initial or minimal payments that would be made.  It might be difficult to extract them directly from the financial statements, however.  There is not a single place to which one can go to find that information.</p></speech>

Interestingly, it said that it had just recently taken on dealing with section 38 bodies and major hospitals which are voluntary organisations.  The agency is now handling all of their claims.  We asked why the agency did not take on the insurance for local authorities.  I still feel that there is unnecessary duplication when the agency is handling all of the insurance claims for most Departments but there is a separate parallel insurance scheme for the ETBs and the city and council councils in respect of claims by members of the public, their own staffs, or whatever.  We are running two separate schemes to deal with the one issue.  I was trying to get at whether it made sense to have one State agency dealing with it all.  On the face of it, it would appear that it would.  That is why we are trying to get information.  It would be useful to be able to compare the experience of Irish Public Bodies with that of the State Claims Agency which deals with the HSE and every other Government body.  We have not been able to get there yet.  I do not know how far we will get on it.  We are the first to start pursuing this.  That is all I will say at this stage.</p></speech>

We will come back to that because this insurance issue is definitely on our list.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is No. 1802B, from Mr. John O'Connor, the CEO of the Housing Agency, providing information requested by the committee in respect of the breakdown by local authority of the 2,424 properties that have been offered to local authorities but which were considered unsuitable.  Detail has been produced on a county-by-county basis.</p><p>Within each county, every single offer is listed for every individual town, village or townland where the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, felt it had a property that might be suitable.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Some of this information is possibly already in the public arena.  It should be available through the local authorities.  I suggest members will want to study it in their own right and use it at local level to find detailed explanations for why various local authorities did not take up various offers of housing. </p><p> No. 1805 is correspondence received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, providing information requested by the committee on correspondence received on allegations of unauthorised state aid to Horse Sport Ireland.  The Department refutes the allegations which are being investigated by the European Commission and provides details of the Department's position.  We will note and publish the correspondence and forward it to the person who wrote to us directly about the matter. </p><p> No. 1806 is correspondence received from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, providing information requested by the committee.  There is a lot of very interesting information.  First, the Department was asked for the gender breakdown and age profile in respect of sick leave taken within it.  The details given include age and the number and length of absences.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Copies of the reports on the back to education allowance and JobPath are also available.  The Department also deals with false self-employment cases.  There is a detailed chart showing the savings achieved in that area as a result of employer inspections.  </p><p> There is a note on various other items, specifically historical debt in cases where there were overpayments.  I would like to highlight some of them.  The Department states in the report that 156,000 debts are due to the Department from individuals, totalling &euro;475 million.  We asked for a breakdown of debts amounting to more than &euro;30,000.  There are 3,208 cases where the debts are in excess of &euro;30,000, totalling &euro;178 million.  We asked how many of the debtors were in receipt of a payment from the Department, meaning that some of the debt can be recouped by way of a reduced payment on a weekly basis.  Where the person concerned was no longer in receipt of a payment, we asked what mechanism the Department had in place.  </p><p> We asked for details where debts amounted to more than &euro;10,000.  There are 11,580 cases where the outstanding balances exceed &euro;10,000 and they add up to &euro;319 million.  Some 48% of these are making repayments, which is good.  The Department says that 25% of cases are suspended.  No recoveries are taking place because the cases are under appeal, there are bankruptcies, the cases concern deceased persons and the Department is dealing with their estates or the Criminal Assets Bureau or other agencies are examining them.  The Department states there is a residue of 25% of cases in which it has no specific arrangements in place.  This is money that is due to the State and there are very large cases.  In more than 11,000 the amount exceeds &euro;10,000 and in half no serious effort is being made to actually collect the money owed.  We are asking the Department for a systematic effort to be made.  This will have to form part of our periodic report.  These are cases where the Department is satisfied that the amount listed is due, but it has not got around to devoting the resources needed to follow up on them.  It is as simple as that.  We will come back to the issue.  As I said, we will note and publish the correspondence. </p><p> The next item of correspondence is from the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  A short note was requested by the committee on the procurement competition for the delivery of Government banking services which led to the award of the contract to Danske Bank.  In order that members are aware, I note that last summer as a result of an EU competition Danske Bank won the contract to handle and process all social welfare payments and public sector salaries.  I propose that we write back to the Department to request an indication of the volume of payments being handled by Danske Bank across each Departments.  We would like to get an indication of the scale of payments being handled by Danske Bank.  I do not think the Department will have the answer, but I propose that the committee send a brief note to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  It should be very simple to prepare a report outlining how many of the 28 EU member states use banks from outside their jurisdiction to handle all social welfare payments.  I would like to know if it is normal across the European Union.  Is Danske Bank doing this in several countries or is Ireland the only country that has chosen to have a system where a bank from outside its jurisdiction is handling all social welfare, pension and salary payments?  I was surprised to see it.  Perhaps the matter might be put in context and it is a regular feature.  I do not know, but I would like to know.  I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with it as it did go through a procurement process.  As I said, I would like to know what happens in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

The perception - I will put it no stronger than that - was that it was really intended to improve the health of the banking system by having additional activity, but there was a consequence for post offices.  It undermined something that could be an organic third force in banking, or at least part of one.   There are other issues.  As well as the winning of a contract, there is the potential undermining of another State entity by the policy followed by the likes of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in pretty much directing that people be paid by direct debit or standing order, rather than collecting their payments at a post office.  That is the other side, of which we should not lose sight.</p></speech>

My concern is the number of jobs we have exported from Ireland as a result of the giving of the contract to a bank located outside it.  Perhaps all of the Danske Bank staff processing the payments are based in this town; I do not know, but we have seen the library in D&uacute;n Laoghaire outsource library provision to a company in England.  Is this another example of Ireland's procurement law giving firms outside the State business with which other countries may deal with differently?  We will receive information on the levels of payments made.  We might ask the Department of Finance if it knows where the jobs involved in processing payments are based.  Are they based in the State?</p></speech>

We would be complaining if procurement law was not being followed properly.  There is a conundrum in that when we compare Ireland to other European countries, we see that the leakage here is much higher.  That might be because of our size, but we do not have an answer to that question.  This does not concern jobs in this area only but in other areas also.  The Chairman is right; the library service is a very obvious example.</p></speech>

During the crisis the Minister made a decision to provide for free screening, a decision that had profound consequences.  I will not criticise him for making it because one could take the argument either way, but the introduction of free screening has had serious consequences for the screening programme.  The delay is now 20 weeks, which is having a detrimental affect on women's health.  Furthermore, following questioning by me, it has been determined that there is no prioritisation mechanism or way to deal with priorities.  The system cannot distinguish between a woman who has to go back for screening quickly or a woman attending for routine screening.  The 20-week delay affects equally the woman who needs screening as a priority and the woman who is going back for routine three-year screening.  The decision has had other impacts down the line that could have a detrimental effect on women's health because of the delays caused.  As a consequence, it has had other impacts outside what was intended and the Minister and the Department did not have the capacity or chose not to provide adequate resources to deal with the excessive demand created by the decision.  On top of that, we have a breakdown of the figure of &euro;4.7 million required to provide women with a free GP consultation, with &euro;2.36 million being the estimated cost of the consultations.</p> <p>  There are further costs related to how the laboratories undertaking the work were paid.  For commercial reasons, the Department has refused to tell us the cost.  I am not sure that this is fair or appropriate.  I fail to see a reason it would not tell us.  It states the total is &euro;10 million.  Therefore, if we deduct the other two amounts, the total is approximately &euro;3 million.  Why it cannot state the cost is beyond me because we can add and subtract.  I am not happy that it is not telling us what the cost is.  There has certainly been secrecy surrounding the dealings with the laboratories from day one.  The Royal College of Obstetricians review will probably not be completed this year.  It has already been saidit will probably be completed six months from now.  There is a secrecy surrounding the relationship with the laboratories.  Following the money trail to determine the cost of cervical screening and the work done by the laboratories is shrouded in secrecy and this is another example.  I fail to see why the Department cannot give us the figures.  I, therefore, ask the Chairman to write back and ask for them.</p></speech>

The final paragraph in the appendix to which the Deputy has referred states women who availed of an early repeat smear test with CervicalCheck will be called for their next routine appointment according to their individual screening recommendation.  This means that most of the women who have been screened will be recalled for screening in either three or five years and that the future cost of providing smear tests will be offset to a degree by this out-of-cycle smear testing.  I think that at the time people thought in good faith that there would be extra screening, but it is now being said that if a woman avails of extra screening, the next test will be three or five years later.  Essentially, therefore, they are only bringing forward the tests women were due to have.  No extra screening is being offered.  Essentially, upcoming planned tests are being brought forward such that they are being done now, rather than when the women concerned were due to have them, for example, next year.  I was not fully aware of that until I read that paragraph.</p></speech>

All they are saying is that if a woman had a test and is concerned, they will bring forward the next test, rather than doing it at the regular time, but she must then wait three or five years for a further test.  Therefore, there is no extra screening.</p></speech>

The second is that, effectively, free screening was not offered.  What was done was a woman's next test was brought forward.  Essentially what is being said is that the women concerned will now go to the back of queue.</p></speech>

When I was a Minister some years ago, I provided the first funding for one of these schemes.  At that stage, the Department of the Environment and Local Government rather than the Department of Justice and Equality had responsibility for the matter.  The funding was provided to pilot a CCTV scheme in the Chairman's county.  It is up and running and has been successful, which shows this can be done.  We are facing into Brexit with all the potential complications arising from that, whatever the outcome.  It is a farce if we cannot sort out data protection and CCTV schemes.  This has been going on for years.  We all know the issues relating to crime, which I will not go into, but this is a cost-effective way of helping areas to deal with crime.  The Chairman and I both deal with the issue of criminals in high-powered vehicles using the motorways to travel up and down to Laois and Tipperary, left, right and centre.  A number of areas in my constituency affected by this because they are close to motorways have been granted funding.  The issue that arises is who will control the data and where it will be held.  The matter has gone back and forward between the Department with responsibility for local government to the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is farcical that this cannot be dealt with.  A fund is available to be drawn down but there are insufficient applications because the local authorities will not bother to do so on the basis that this issue has not been sorted out.</p></speech>

The research I read suggested the jury was out on the value of CCTV schemes in certain areas, although there is definitely a place for them.  Sometimes CCTV comes under the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and then there are community schemes, but in my experience they often do not work.  Vast amounts are spent installing cameras but they have never worked.  In addition, there are privacy issues and the question of a private company being employed.  There are serious issues, in our case primarily related to value for money, with money being spent on cameras that are not used.  I understand is the position with a number of cameras in Galway and throughout the country.</p></speech>

There is an expectation that if one puts a camera up out in the countryside, it will solve all sorts of problems but the practical experience is that it does not.  There are locations where they work and others where they do not work.  Too much is expected of CCTV schemes.  The other issue is that communities must find a sizeable amount of matching funds.  If we are to criticise the scheme, we should do so in the round and understand that it is not merely a problem regarding data collection but also with what is expected of the scheme and the requirement for matching funding.</p></speech>

Frustration is shared by members of the Opposition, the Minister, who has spoken frankly about this matter, and the Department.  The scheme is motivated by genuine concern to help communities but its format has not worked, which is borne out by the level of take-up.</p><p>On the broader issue, CCTV does work and I have given examples of previous schemes going back three Administrations.  Deputy Kelly referred to his time as Minister for the Environment and Local Government and he is correct that responsibility has moved from Department to Department.  Previously, the Department of Justice and Equality ran a scheme in a different format which worked well.  My county benefitted from it and the chamber of commerce was the applicant which drew down the funds.  It has been successful because the Garda use it as a pre-emptive tool and to help with traffic management around the towns.  It has an impact.</p><p>We must ask why CCTV is wanted and if cameras are located in the right areas.  The crucial question is who are the applicants.  In many cases, community-minded volunteers do not have the wherewithal or fundraising capacity to make the application in the first instance.  Given that the joint policing committees are effectively a collaboration between the Garda and local authorities, the local authorities need to apply for the scheme.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government must work with the Department of Justice and Equality if this scheme is to be successful across the country.  Otherwise, it will only operate on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, where it works in a small number of communities but will be largely unsuccessful in the rest of the country.</p></speech>

The current scheme - I do not know its exact name - sees &euro;1 million provided annually, but only &euro;430,000 has been drawn down.  I was looking at the figures yesterday.  Not to disagree with my colleague, but the reason is that there are problems with drawdown.  There is a policing committee which theoretically includes everybody in the community, all of whom have a seat at the table.  However, the data controller has to be the local authority and most local authorities, with the exception of Fingal County Council which has &euro;100 million on deposit, do not have a red cent.  Sligo County Council, in particular, can barely pay its librarians, which has been an issue in recent years.  For this reason, local authorities are not queuing up to assume additional overhead costs and further responsibilities with GDPR and everything else to be the data controller.  We could usefully suggest to the Department that it needs to review who can apply for the scheme and who can be the data controller.  Perhaps the scope can be broadened.  There is a network of community councils - chambers of commerce, for example, to which Deputy Cassells referred - and others, who, if provided with adequate training, may be better placed to be the data controller given the financial constraints on most local authorities.</p></speech>

In our case, the Garda is the data operator.  It is the garda&iacute; who do all the work.  We want that role to be performed by the professionals, in other words, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda does all of the work.</p></speech>

People refer to the previous CCTV scheme for urban areas, which involved the chamber of commerce in the various towns and the Garda taking a direct monitoring role.  That system worked.  For some reason, the community CCTV scheme was linked to the local authorities, although I acknowledge it is based in the community.</p><p>I saw the document produced last night by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The format laid down by them is that the local authority has to be the data controller.  There then has to be a data processor and people can then have access and can look at it.  In fact, it can only be garda&iacute; who have access to that to get copies of what is in the system for evidential purposes.</p><p> The system approved by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na referred to somebody having access in order to view what is on CCTV - this is exactly what the Department has written down.  There must be a written request from an officer not below the rank of superintendent to the data controller, which is the local authority, and there must be confirmation in writing that this can happen before the officer can see it.  What happens at weekends?  The local authority has to have a staff member at the end of a phone 24-7, 365 days a year if it is to meet the data protection rules under the responsibility given to it.  It cannot allow anyone else to access it without that specific request to the data controller.  The involvement of the local authorities has put an awful ream of responsibility on them, although I know it was brought in through the policing committee.</p><p> The Garda can operate this very effectively in urban areas because the local authority is not involved.  In rural areas, under the informal arrangements that applied before the data controllers came in, garda&iacute; would come out and look at the issue straight away, for example, they would see two strange cars in the area and they would be moving on it in a few minutes.  Now, we are bringing in the local authorities, and they are expressing concern that their staff will be subpoenaed to give evidence every time a case arises in court.  I listened to the chief executive in my area and I understand the position.  In addition, there is no funding from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Department of Rural and Community Development for the ongoing costs of operating this system.  Everything we are talking about comes under a capital grant to get it up and running and then, after maybe three years, the volunteers get tired maintaining the system and technology changes, and what they have is not as good.</p><p> It is a very complicated system.  We put the Department of Justice and Equality on notice that we are going to raise it.  We want to simplify the system given there are too many layers of people getting involved.  Unless the local authority signs a consent to act as the data controller, the application cannot be accepted by the Department of Justice and Equality for funding.  It is not that there is not drawdown; it is that, in certain areas, there is a block on the applications going in.  We will raise that with the Department of Justice and Equality when it comes in, although not today as it is dealing with the prisons issue.  I believe it is scheduled for a visit in the near future.  This is of relevance to many people in certain areas of the country.</p><p> The next item is No. 1814 and 1834 concerning the Higher Education Authority providing information in regard to employee assistance helplines in higher education institutions.  The January item received is a more complete version of the item received before Christmas.  We will note and publish that.</p></speech>

Employee assistance helplines, as we know from dealing with protected disclosures and all of that, should be mandatory and that is why I asked for a list of when they were put in place.  We can see that it was done in some institutions in accordance with the timeframe, in some others it was done beforehand, and in others it was done quite late.  It is alarming that some institutions were doing it and others were not.  That is one issue.  The fact it took months for the Department to get this information through the HEA is concerning.</p> <p>  There is another issue.  As I understand it, employee assistance helplines are also meant to be the first port of call for people who have issues which could potentially end up being protected disclosures.  Having looked at the names of some of the firms involved - this is no commentary on them and they may all have a role in regard to well-being, employee assistance and so on - but I am not sure these organisations can deal with those sorts of issues.  I want an inquiry in this regard.  We have all the issues in regard to third level institutions and they are in again next week.  I want clarity on this issue.  If somebody has issues that concern them and which are not necessarily about their well-being but concern what is happening in their workplace corporately, for want of a better phrase, are these the right organisations to be going to?  I genuinely do not know.  I have a suspicion these are not the organisations that many individuals feel would be able to deal with their concerns.</p></speech>

We will note and publish that, and we will write to the HEA on that basis for further information in regard to the service provided.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1815 concerning the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland providing information requested by the committee in regard to SBCI, how much it has provided through the banks and how much is provided through non-bank on-lenders.  The correspondent states that the information provided in the appendix is commercially sensitive as it concerns amounts provided to different banks.  I propose that we publish the letter on our website but that we do not publish the appendix because it contains this commercially sensitive information.  The person has requested that.  He said the attached appendix 1 sets out details of SBCI's current lending relationship and the facilities provided to those on-lenders, and some of the details are commercially sensitive.  Obviously, there is competition between all of these financial institutions.  SBCI has asked that it be deemed confidential and not be published or circulated to a wider audience.  We can circulate the letter, which will not give the specifics that the committee had sought.  At least the members of the committee have the answer.</p></speech>

Essentially we were told that an extension was given to a contract years in advance of when it was required, that may well have ended up costing a State entity - not necessarily the one that was dealing with it - more.  The committee wanted to know if public money was used, and whether public money was used in any of the amount that came from the infrastructure fund. The funding can be raised in different ways but we want to know if any of that was public money.  That was the net point.</p></speech>

There are three documents touching on the same organisation, namely, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  On the rationale for extending maintenance of metropolitan area network contract with Enet, the earlier document stated:</p><blockquote>Enet was awarded the first Concession Agreement for an initial 15 year term in July 2004.  In July 2009, following a further procurement process, Enet was awarded an initial 15 year contract to manage the 60 Phase II MANs.</blockquote> <p>They say that in that original contract there was provision for a roll-over for another ten years.  On page 4 and 5 they also state &quot;Norcontel Consultants were engaged in April 2016 and provided advice and modelling on the financial and commercial aspects of both options&quot;, as in &quot;an extension of the Term or [a] return to the market for the purposes of securing a new Concession Agreement&quot;.  They are saying that the consultants came back and recommended an extension of the contract was the most beneficial from a financial perspective.</p></speech>

One would almost think it was a State organisation with that name they put on it, which is confusing.  I see in public documentation that the Irish Infrastructure Fund has regularly stated that it is a State-backed investment.  I took this to mean that the State had a shareholding.  I thought that our correspondence from the committee was to know what percentage of the shares are held by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund in the Irish Infrastructure Fund.  They have come back to say that the Irish Infrastructure Fund has a number of investors, one of which is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  When I read "State-backed" and "investor" I took it to be a percentage of ownership.  Now it appears that the investor in this case really only has a financial interest in the outcome of the investments.  Using the words "State-backed" and "investor" I was under the impression that the State had a shareholding in it.  This committee wanted to establish the amount of that shareholding.  Now it is said that it is just a joint venture to the extent that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund has put in &euro;250 million, the others have put in &euro;250 million and they hope to benefit.  It is, therefore, more of a joint venture than an investment or a shareholding.</p></speech>

We were provided with a very useful table about procurement.  There was procurement for this event but can we ask the OPW for greater detail about one or two of these suppliers?  The same suppliers seem to emerge from the process because there may not be the kind of competition available to enable a genuine procurement process.  Can we drill down into that a little bit and perhaps pick one or two items?  There is no point in looking at the multiple suppliers.  The first one is an obvious candidate for further scrutiny.  We should ask the OPW to provide us with further detail about the procurement process, certainly as it concerns Actavo and the provision of platforms, media risers, trackways, fencing and that kind of thing.  What was the procurement process?</p></speech>

Many items have been combined to reach &euro;2 million.  We will ask that the OPW provides us with a breakdown of any individual company that received over &euro;50,000.  That should not be too difficult; there cannot be too many of them.  We will ask the OPW for the information requested by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 1819 B from Mr. Martin Shanahan concerning the annual employment survey.  We will note and publish this, and if anyone wishes to comment on this at a later stage please feel free to do so.</p> <p>  No. 1820 B is from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, providing information regarding the legal costs for the prosecution of cases of tobacco-related offences.  There are no legal costs because people can effectively do what they like in that area.  There are no prosecutions to any meaningful extent, as we established on the last occasion.  We note and publish that.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 1821 B, a bimonthly update from the Tax Appeals Commission, providing information on high-value appeals, which we had asked for.  We have seen one of the lists before, and we also have an updated list.  We have asked for an update every two months about how it is progressing, because we are very concerned that there are cases worth &euro;1.6 billion sitting on its desk.  We want to keep the pressure on it, and for it to keep the pressure on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for additional staff to ensure that it is more efficient in dealing with those issues.  We are following up with that for a good reason.  </p> <p>  The next item is 1822 B, from Ms Jackie Maguire, chairperson of the County and City Management Association, clarifying that local authority chief executives will make themselves available to assist the Accounting Officer from the Department at a future meeting, for which we have a provisional date.  It is good that there is agreement on this issue; there was some confusion about the letter we received on the last occasion.  We will note and publish that.  </p> <p>  The next item is 1793 C, requesting that the committee makes inquiries from the Residential Tenancies Board about a landlord who has not been registered since 2012.  This is not within the remit of the committee, and the individual should seek clarification directly from the board itself.  We will write to the person on that basis.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item 1796 C is from an individual requesting that the committee makes inquiries into the procurement arrangements for section 38 and 39 organisations, and senior HSE managers taking up positions in those organisations.  We will ask for an information note from the HSE to that end.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  The next item is 1803 C, from an individual to a number of newspapers.  It is a copy of a letter concerning Galway GAA, which is not within our remit.  We will simply note the item.</p></speech>

The last line of the letter asks that this committee investigates this matter.  The Chairman has pointed out that it is a letter to the newspapers to which we have been cc'd.  I do not want to overstate the matter, but I want to comment because it has been published.  It states that we should remember that the taxpayer has funded the GAA over many years, with many millions of euro received from the Exchequer.  Any cent of money received by an Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael from the Exchequer is accounted for.  The issues pertaining to Galway GAA are issues pertaining to internal GAA issues concerning ticketing and credit cards and are, as the Galway GAA chairman has stated, damning.  The issue of public moneys paid to the GAA are accounted to at the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport in terms of revenue or capital, and every cent received from the Exchequer is utilised to the maximum for the benefit of local communities throughout this country.  The GAA provides a focal point for many communities, not just in a sporting sense but also in a community sense.  Any negative inference that could be drawn from that letter, or any attempt to conflate issues, is wrong in the extreme.</p></speech>

Despite the assurances from Deputy Cassells, who is passionate about the GAA, we are not here to be passionate about the GAA or to defend it.  We are here to discuss public money and accountability for its spending.  That is the issue here.  I am aware that we have not been written to directly, which is a difficulty.  However, the issue being raised is accountability for public money.  It arises everywhere, including, for example, in the charity sector, and I am reminded of the issues faced by Console in the past.  There are always people who come forward who say that charities do tremendous work.  It is irrelevant; it is important to remember their work but that is not our role.  We have to look at whether public money is being spent on an organisation and how it is accounted for.  I do not know about the extent of the issues raised in the letter.  I was made aware of it via the media before Christmas and it certainly made me wonder about the public moneys provided to the GAA and how they are accounted for.  The same question will arise when we talk about the prison services, and Government moneys being provided to, for example, the Red Cross for a particular programme.  I will be asking questions about how that money is accounted for.  It is a legitimate question.  I require guidance on whether-----</p></speech>

It is a large organisation.  I can be very dispassionate when dealing with Exchequer funds and I hope Deputy Connolly knows that.  When I attended my own GAA club's annual general meeting last week, I saw that the public moneys it received were fully recorded and accounted for.  The GAA is a large organisation, operating at central council level, provincial county level, county board level and club AGM level, which all have separate accounts.</p><p>Public moneys paid to the GAA must be fully accounted for and are subject to scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  My point is that public moneys were not the issue here.  Instead, it was ticketing issues and a personal credit card.  Public moneys must be properly discharged and accounted for not just by the GAA but also the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, or any other sports organisation in receipt of such moneys, and rightly so.  There was an inference in that letter that tried to conflate two things which are completely separate.  That was my point.</p></speech>

I do not want assurance from a member because I am not here for that.  I am here to ensure that public money is accounted for regardless of the organisation involved.  I do not know enough about this, just what was on the radio and in the newspapers, which is that there was, at least, serious mismanagement of funds.  I do not have the details but what was published was extremely worrying.  It is legitimate to ask about public moneys going to the GAA if this is the such moneys are being handled.  I seek guidance on that.  Clearly, the GAA does not come under our remit, but public money and value for money do.</p></speech>

It is not a question of us examining GAA funds but the public money going to it.  I agree that there is an attempt to convey the perception that public money is being mismanaged.  If that is not the case, let somebody in the GAA tell us that and show us how the organisation is managing the money.  It is a genuine question.  Guidance is needed.</p></speech>

I presume we could consider writing to seek confirmation from the Department regarding payments to the sporting organisation concerned, the GAA, and that it is satisfied that the moneys it has allocated from public funds have been properly accounted for.  We cannot get involved with the other funds the GAA has beyond what the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport gives it.</p></speech>

That is our purpose.  Reassurances are not good enough and they never have been.  I am not talking about the GAA but, rather, about why we are here as members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am seeking clarification.  I agree with the Chairman's proposal that we write to the bodies about public moneys and what goes to the GAA, particularly in the context of what has emerged in Galway.  What investigations have been made?  Are the bodies satisfied in that regard?</p></speech>

Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1812C is correspondence from an individual refuting information that was provided to the correspondent on foot of a committee request to the HSE regarding the refunding costs for the provision of services in the Brothers of Charity in Roscommon.  We have put this matter on our work programme.  We will note that for now and return to it.  I had agreed to meet that person in the new year and I will arrange to do so.</p></speech>

I gave a commitment that I, as Chairman, would arrange to meet him in the new year.  We are not proposing that the person meet the full committee.  We will put that arrangement in place.</p> <p>  No. 1823C is from Professor Mey in the University of Limerick providing information regarding an in-house psychiatrist at the University of Limerick.  We will note that.  It is not for publication.</p> <p>  No. 1824C is from Mr. Mark Rea, secretary, Northern Ireland Standardbred Association, requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding the monitoring of State funding to the Irish Harness Racing Association.  I propose to forward the correspondence to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for a response.</p> <p>  No. 1825C is from an individual who has undertaken research relating to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  I propose we write to the individual to thank her for her offer to meet us.  We may make further contact at some point.</p> <p>  No. 1826C, dated 27 November 2018, is from an individual who has provided some observations regarding the University of Limerick, UL.  We will note this item and it may inform our engagement with UL on 24 January 2019.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1827C is from an individual who has copied the committee on a letter to the HEA regarding the UL.  There is no specific request to the committee so we will note this.</p> <p>  No. 1831C is from Deputy Catherine Murphy.  We will consider this as part of our work programme regarding the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We note it.</p> <p>  The final item, No. 1832C, is from Deputy David Cullinane proposing a number of questions for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We agree to requesting the Department to provide this information.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will hold over the next item, which is the 15 accounts and statements for review, for the next day as we wish to move on.</p> <p>  We will agree not to have a long discussion on the work programme.  We might have a longer discussion on it on the next day.  The work programme is up on the screen so we can get things moving in the meantime and so members are clear on it.  Today we are meeting officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Irish Prison Service.  At 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday next we will have a private meeting with specific staff members or former staff members who have made protected disclosures or raised particular matters relating to UL.  It is not our main meeting of the week.  It will not be a long meeting and it will take place over at lunchtime.  Next Thursday, 21 January, we have report No. 103 from the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the UL and the Institute of Technology Sligo regarding the remuneration of certain senior staff.  We will have an update on the Thorn report and a special report, No. 104, from the Comptroller and Auditor General on Waterford Institute of Technology regarding disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  We will have witnesses from Waterford Institute of Technology, the Institute of Technology Sligo, University of Limerick, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  With regard to 31 January, before the summer recess last year, Deputy Catherine Murphy had written us a letter and I suggested that we might invite members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to discuss the overrun and the fact that they do not appear to know how to prepare a tender.  They have obviously entered into many commitments and I suggest that we examine the board's most recent financial statements to see how it is running the organisation.  Members of the board appeared before the health committee yesterday but I was not aware of that when I suggested putting this on the agenda.  We will try not to duplicate what happened in the health committee so we might have to look at what it did.  With a &euro;1.7 billion investment, it would do no harm to have a second pair of eyes look at it without specifically duplicating or repeating what happened in the health committee.</p><p>It would be in the context of the 2017 financial statements.  The Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il that the Committee of Public Accounts should examine this issue.  He has clarified that he intended to refer to the Joint Committee on Health.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is well aware of the project because the go-ahead for it was given while he was the Minister for Health.  It would be of use for the committee to investigate the checks and balances that are in place for other projects as well as this one from which we can learn a great deal.  There are often significant overruns in capital State projects.  Other countries are far better at managing the cost of such projects.  There is a process issue in regard to the management of these projects which we need to investigate.  There is a section of a Department which deals with procurement but that relates to buying things rather than dealing with matters such as the roll-out of infrastructure.  Local authorities have been responsible for a significant number of positive projects through the years because they built up an expertise in how to tender.  The expertise is not in place for once-off or occasional procurement such as a national children's hospital, which, obviously, is a hundred year project.  There is a very significant process or oversight gap in that regard and this is an example of it.</p></speech>

I spent four hours at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health yesterday going through this issue.  It was useful in terms of what the Committee of Public Accounts will be doing for separate reasons.  Prior to the meeting, I was not fully aware of certain facts.  The board that was set up is a publicly constituted board which reports to another board which reports to another board which then reports the Minister.  The reporting line is that the chairperson of the board reports to another chair, namely, Mr. Dean Sullivan, who then reports to Mr. Jim Breslin who reports to the Minister.  There are four layers and it is important that the people in charge of each layer appear on 31 January because that is the decision-making process.</p> <p>  A significant amount of documentation was requested at the health committee.  I ask the clerk to contact the clerk to the health committee to obtain that documentation in advance of our meeting on 31 January.  It deals with issues of great importance which this committee would examine such as the scoping of the project, financial decisions, tendering and so on.  I ask that all of those relevant documents be provided to the committee.  The meeting yesterday was quite an enlightening experience.  Although there is a role in the matter for the health committee, there is certainly a role for this committee.  This is the first time this form of build has been undertaken in this country.  The chair of the board yesterday made repeated reference to best practice and stated that he would not change any of the decisions that were made.  He stated that he was disappointed and that there were issues in respect of tendering for electronics, electrical work and so on but that he would not change any of the other decisions that were made.  It is critically important that all of that documentation be provided in advance of the meeting.  For information, the relevant figure is &euro;1.733 billion.</p></speech>

As a former member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I can testify that the refurbishment is many decades overdue.  I am sure all members support it and look forward to its completion.  Regardless of the cost involved, the work is vitally important, given that Leinster House was built in 1745.  The work continues on from the construction of Leinster House 2000 in the 2000s and the refurbishment of Government Buildings, which is home to the Department of the Taoiseach, in the 1990s and late 1980s.  That said, &euro;8 million was provided for the work on Leinster House but according to media reports the funding has been exhausted.  Although I am certain the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is considering the matter, against the backdrop of the overruns regarding the national children's hospital and in the light of the media coverage of the matter, the committee could usefully inquire as to the outlook in terms of total expenditure and completion dates in order to ensure that adequate oversight is in place.  This is a horse of a completely different colour to the issue of the national children's hospital.  Regardless of the cost involved, all members agree that the work is many decades overdue.  Some &euro;8 million or &euro;10 million is a modest sum compared to the billions being discussed in regard to the hospital.  I suggest that the committee write to the Office of Public Works and the Ceann Comhairle to ask what is the situation, how works are progressing, what is the budget outlook and so on.  As I stated, I am sure the Oireachtas Commission is giving close consideration to the matter.  It has a finite budget that is allocated on a multi-annual basis over three years and I am sure it is not happy about cost overruns.  The committee should write to the head of the commission, the OPW and perhaps the Ceann Comhairle to ask for an update on the budget, the status of the project, how much more will it cost and the likely completion dates.</p></speech>

I do not know whether this project was brought to the National Development Finance Agency.  We can inquire as to whether it had an involvement in it.  This is a specialist board.  It is different to a situation whereby a Department is undertaking a capital project on a one-off or programmatic basis.  This is a specialist organisation which only exists for the period during which the hospital is being developed.  There is a separate structure for the new hospital to run with the management and integrate the services from the hospitals that are being amalgamated.  Generally, instructions and arrangements for the adequacy of appraisal and control of projects are covered by the public spending code which is within the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>They do have some capacity to look at individual projects and examine and report on them.  I might suggest looking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform around what are the arrangements in place to ensure there is adequate control and appraisal of capital projects.</p></speech>

I do not think we will get six witnesses here.  We will write to the Department and the National Development Finance Agency and say we want an early answer.  Depending on the answer we get, we may need to bring them in.  As of now, we are asking the others to come in on that.</p> <p>  On 7 February we want to deal with all the different Votes that go before the Oireachtas and the group of Votes for the Department of An Taoiseach.  There are six of them there and there are Accounting Officers in most of those separate areas.  I propose that we break it into two groups on that day, one dealing with the legal side of it, namely the Votes for the Office of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor; and the other engaging with the Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach, which will cover the Department of the Taoiseach, the President's establishment, and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which I think has a separate Accounting Officer.  We will not have all six in together but will break the meeting into two halves.</p> <p>  On 14 February we have agreement in respect of meeting with broadband providers.  Eir has accepted the invitation to come in.  Imagine has accepted.  Siro has declined because it pulled out of the bidding process and did not want to get further involved.  Enet has accepted and we are waiting to hear from BT.  They are only assisting us as a committee with no knowledge of this technical area.  They are just coming forward voluntarily as witnesses to assist us in our understanding of the broader issues so that we will be more informed on the issues when we are talking to the Department.  They are not required to be here.  They are here to offer us knowledge on the whole broadband area to be of assistance to us in our work dealing with the national broadband plan.</p></speech>

Smaller providers would actually be of more interest to me.  However, we both know that is not going to be where we go during the course of a discussion with them.  It is not my job to police the committee but I cannot help but feel that the primary purpose of that week's meeting would fall into the policy sphere, which we do not cover.  That would be a matter for the line committee.  Of course Siro has to decline; it is the only tender bidder left.  I cannot help but feel that this is about the fourth or even fifth bite of that cherry in respect of the national broadband plan, which is exactly where the debate will go.  I wanted to flag that at this stage.</p></speech>

The scale of the investment in the national broadband plan is at least double what is being proposed in the National Children's Hospital.  If the Committee of Public Accounts were to say it is only &euro;4 billion and we are not going to look at it, we would not be doing our job.  We need to be as informed as possible when we are dealing with the national broadband plan.  We already had a letter this morning from the Department which is shocking, saying that they specified 30 MB of download and 6 MB of upload, which is pathetic.  They should not proceed if that is what they are talking about.  We do not want the State to be spending over &euro;3 billion on something that is out of date years before it is even switched on.  They have not defined what.</p></speech>

Mea culpa.  How should one conduct oneself?  Do not be guided by the Miriam Lord view of how we conduct ourselves at this meeting and just shut up and listen when people are talking.  That is what I would suggest.  There was a Secretary General here before Christmas.  We asked him whether the Department looked at 5G and he said it did.  When we got in under the bonnet, we discovered it had not.  That is about spending &euro;2 billion for this as opposed to X amount less for that.

I am moving on.  The policy issue in respect of the need for a national broadband plan is beyond dispute.  Nobody in their right mind will debate that policy.  We are talking about the implementation and the cost of carrying out that policy, not the policy itself.  It is sacrosanct that we need the broadband plan.  In respect of the processes, controls, implementation, value, cost and tendering process, we need to examine it.</p> <p>  On 21 February we have the financial statement of Kildare-Wicklow Education and Training Board, ETB, for 2015, which is the big bogey that really started us down the road of the ETBs.

During the last discussion we had on this, there was such a myriad of financing and spending details, examining it proved difficult.  It is good the CCMA representatives will be here that day.  Will the secretariat make it aware that we will be discussing this issue?  I would like the CCMA representatives to address the distribution and utilisation of local authority funding to ensure there is a structured discussion around it.</p></speech>

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.

While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the service is headed operationally by the director general and is administered centrally from headquarters located in Longford town.  The Department has policy and legislative responsibility for the service.  The 2017 Appropriation Account for Vote 21 records gross expenditure of just under &euro;327 million in the year.  As indicated in the figure on screen, more than two thirds of the expenditure related to pay.  The remainder relates to maintenance and improvements to the prison estate and equipment purchases, services for prisoners including education provision, and other operating costs.  Cash receipts for the year amounted to &euro;13.1 million and comprised mainly retained pension related deductions from staff salaries.  There was an underspend of &euro;3.8 million relative to the net Estimate provision.  An amount of &euro;2.2 million was carried forward to 2018 under capital carryover provisions, leaving just under &euro;1.6 million for surrender to the Exchequer.  I draw attention in the audit report to a material level of procurement in 2017 that was not compliant with procurement rules as disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.273" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019011700002#P00700"><p>I welcome the opportunity to meet the committee to discuss the 2017 appropriation account for prisons Vote.  I propose to keep my opening remarks brief and hand over to the newly appointed director general of the Prison Service, Ms Caron McCaffrey, who will also make a brief opening statement.  The Prison Service is a key component of the criminal justice system and its voted expenditure is directed towards one strategic programme - the provision of safe, secure, humane and rehabilitative custody for people sent to prison.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, the gross expenditure for the Vote in 2017 was &euro;326.9 million, of which 71% related to payroll costs, 22% related to non-pay current expenditure and 7% or &euro;22.8 million was capital.</p> <p>  The Prison Service currently operates 12 prisons.  There were 9,287 committals to prisons with a daily average of 3,680 prisoners in custody during 2017.  In total there were 3,186 staff in the Prison Service at the end of 2017.</p> <p>  The Prison Service operates as an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality within a statutory framework and policy parameters established by the Minister.  The practical effect is that while the Secretary General of the day is the Accounting Officer for the Vote, the director general of the Prison Service and her team carry out the day-to-day operation of the prison system.  Each year, the director general of the Prison Service and the assistant secretary in charge of prisons and probation policy agree and sign an oversight and performance agreement.  This commits to a minimum of two formal governance meetings per year.  Further, this is subject to a yearly review by the agency governance oversight subgroup of the Department of Justice and Equality, which conducts an annual governance overview of the bodies under the aegis of the Department and reports to the management board on any key issues arising or matters of concern.</p> <p>  The committee may wish to note that a number of reports over the years have recommended greater autonomy for the Prison Service from the Department.  Recent reports in this regard include a report from the Inspector of Prisons of November 2015.  The effectiveness and renewal group, ERG, recommended in 2018 that the Government examine converting the operational elements of the Irish Prison Service into a separate agency and the ERG may return to this issue in its next report which is due shortly.  In part, what is generally envisaged is that the director general would become the appropriate authority for issues relating to staff management including disciplinary matters and possibly the Accounting Officer for expenditure on the prisons Vote.  These matters are being pursued with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in order to give them effect they will involve legislative change.  This approach is consistent with the review of the governance relationship with our agencies which is taking place alongside the very significant transformation programme in the Department which I am currently leading.  I am pleased to inform the committee that this project is under way with the major restructuring of the Department to be completed over the next nine months.</p> <p>  Penal policy is constantly evolving and the Department and its agencies continue to work towards implementing the recommendations of the penal policy review group.  The recommendations of this body emphasised, among other things, the importance of interagency co-operation in the development and implementation of penal policy.</p> <p>  I will briefly address certain matters which have been receiving attention recently in relation to the Prison Service.  A court affidavit by a serving prison officer makes allegations about activities in the Prison Service, including unauthorised surveillance.  Notwithstanding that it was the subject of a newspaper article, that affidavit has not yet been opened in court and so its details cannot be publicly discussed.  The committee will be aware that because the Minister was of the view that the publication of these allegations created a public concern, he asked the Inspector of Prisons to carry out an urgent preliminary investigation to determine the facts as far as possible and report to him.  The investigation is now under way and we await its outcome.</p> <p>  I am also aware also that the committee recently met a prison officer in private session on certain matters, which I assume included reference to a protected disclosure made by the officer in question.  As there are ongoing issues relating to this case, including matters before the courts, we cannot comment on the specifics of the case during today&rsquo;s proceedings.  However, with regard to protected disclosures generally, the Department put in place a protected disclosure policy in 2015 in accordance with the requirements of the Act.  The procedures were updated in 2018 to provide for external independent assessment and investigation of disclosures made by Department staff.</p><p>Over the past three years, the Department has also engaged Transparency International Ireland, TII, to provide advice and support to disclosers and also participates in TII&rsquo;s integrity at work initiative which facilitates the Department and its agencies to learn about best practice at multi-stakeholder forums and annual conferences as well as testing and developing existing policies and procedures on whistleblowing. </p><p> I will hand over at this point to the director general, Caron McCaffrey. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caron McCaffrey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019011700002#Q00200"><p>A review of the protected disclosures policy for the Irish Prison Service has taken place and a revised policy was introduced in July 2018.  The review was carried out to ensure that procedures regarding protected disclosures are up to date and in line with best practice and to take into account any lessons learned from protected disclosures received to date.  An assessment undertaken with TII informed the review.  Arising from the review, a number of new measures have been put in place in the protected disclosure process.  They include independent professional advice for staff on the process and enhanced independent external assessment of disclosures including all notifications of penalisation.  Employees making disclosures are now also provided with periodic and confidential feedback regarding assessment, investigation or review.</p> <p>  The committee has in the past expressed concern about the level of sick leave in the Prison Service.  There are limited international comparators available to us as very few countries publish sick leave statistics for their prison services.  However, from the figures available to us, the 2017 sick leave figure of 15.7 days per employee per year places the Irish Prison Service at the lower end of the scale when compared with other prison services.  Comparable figures for 2017 show Northern Ireland reported a figure of 19.7 days, Denmark 21.9 days, Latvia 18.88 days and Slovenia 15.3 days per member of staff.  </p> <p>  Prison staff work in an extremely challenging environment in which, on a daily basis, they face unique circumstances unlike most others in the public sector.  Notwithstanding this, the Irish Prison Service is tackling the unacceptable level of sick leave we are currently experiencing in two ways - first, by providing staff with the best possible supports to target the work-related causes of sick leave and, second, through focused, structured management of all absences to identify and reduce absenteeism.  The Irish Prison Service is committed to strengthening the support we provide for our staff.  In addition to the employee assistance programme which has two national officers and over 40 locally appointed staff support officers, the supports in place for staff include an independent counselling service which we introduced in 2016.  The service is available to all staff free of charge and provides staff with access to up to six counselling sessions for support covering a wide range of issues.</p> <p>  In 2019 the service will complete the introduction of the critical incident stress management model of support interventions for staff, which has been endorsed by the State Claims Agency.  The model aims to minimise the emotional impact of critical incidents on staff, increase the resistance and resilience of staff to harmful stress and prevent the harmful effects on staff of such incidents by working with and supporting employees at the time of critical incidents. </p> <p>  I pay tribute to the employees of the Prison Service, many of whom work in a difficult and challenging environment to maintain a safe, secure and humane prison system which contributes to safer communities.  Both the Secretary General and I will be happy to take any questions the committee has. </p></speech>

Deputy Farrell has 20 minutes and Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has 15 minutes.  The following speakers have ten minutes each: Deputy MacSharry, Deputy Kelly, Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Connolly.  At least six members want to get in before the divisions in the D&aacute;il.  Even if a member is mid-sentence at the end of their ten or 15 minutes, I will stop them because otherwise other members will not have time to contribute.  Everyone can get back in a second time.  The first six speakers have indicated they want to get in before the divisions in the D&aacute;il.  I will start with Deputy Farrell.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending.  If they want to contribute at any point during my questions, they should feel free to do so.  That includes the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the remarks on current matters before the WRC, among other things, and the whistleblower who appeared before the committee, the only observation I will make on the point is timeliness.  I refer to the timeliness of responding to the issue, dealing with the issue and, in one particular instance, the timeliness of the provision of crucial information to the whistleblower which, on my observation, was very poor.  I will not get into the detail of it.  I do not expect the witnesses will want to either but I just wanted to put it on the record.  </p> <p>  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his work on the accounts.  Two major issues jump out at me.  The first is non-compliance with procurement rules and the second is the issue of the additional Vote, which as a percentage of the overall budget is quite significant.  I will start with the non-compliance with national procurement rules.  I would like some details.  The numbers have increased quite significantly as provided for in the report.  There were five urgent purchases for &euro;0.5 million.  What is deemed urgent in the Prison Service?  What would urgently require &euro;0.5 million of expenditure that could not be foreseen?  </p></speech>

To focus specifically on the area the Deputy identified, within that category are urgent requirements and issues of security consideration.  Of the five cases, which total &euro;498,000, three related to security equipment we were not in a position to go to the market to tender on.  That comprised handcuffs, an explosive detection system and the installation of security netting at a prison to combat a particular issue we have with drugs being thrown over the walls.</p></speech>

They include some of our locking and access systems and our fire safety systems.  As they are provided by a particular supplier, their servicing and maintenance can only be undertaken by that service provider.  There were six such cases in 2017 which totalled &euro;1.42 million.  They will continue to be included until the systems are replaced.  Similarly there are some ICT legacy systems within our organisation and the updating and maintenance of those systems can only be undertaken by one company.  However, we are looking at opportunities to move away from that and develop our own in-house models.  In one of the three cases in 2017, which totalled &euro;0.396 million, we have moved towards putting in place our own system so we will not be wholly dependent on one supplier in the future.</p></speech>

The only other matter in the non-compliance with national procurement rules is on the &euro;5.2 million figure.</p><p>Of the 18 procurement scenarios, some are still under review.  My understanding is that this is a common feature in the Prison Service where matters are being reviewed.  Could Ms McCaffrey give us some of the details of this amount?</p></speech>

In 2018, that equated to &euro;5.2 million, which included contracts for the provision of ICT, plumbing and heating supplies, bedding, dental supplies, and GP and pharmacy services.  Of the 18 cases, the OGP now has contracts in place for eight.

First, we are working with the OGP so that we are clear on its lead-in times for the awarding of contracts on our behalf.

Second, we are working internally with our director of finance to enhance the procurement skills available to us so as to ensure that our team, where appropriate, can put those contracts in place in a timely manner.  This is an overall area that will be given attention and considered-----</p></speech>

She touched upon the financial control issue in terms of procurement.  There was a report on other operations of the service in, I believe, 2015.  I am sorry, as I had the information in front of me a moment ago.  The report was commissioned internally regarding the operation of various funds and programmes within the Irish Prison Service and a review was conducted.  I will see if I can find the name of it in my documents, but it related to financial controls over the prison shop, the assisted programme fund and prisoner cash accounts.  I would like to get some general information on that last item.  I am intrigued as to how it can work efficiently or effectively from a cost perspective.  Ms McCaffrey might be able to inform me.  A review of how the service controls its financial affairs is ongoing.  Ms McCaffrey might enlighten me on it, please.</p></speech>

Some issues were identified through a combination of situations by our internal audit unit, the audit committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of potential risks at prison level.  In response, we have put in place a business process review.  It is aimed specifically at areas of administrative, operational and accounting practices at prison level with a view to strengthening the processes that are in place.  In particular, the review has examined matters such as sentence calculation, HR processes and cost management and led to us introducing more than 40 new standard operating procedures, SOPs, for staff at prison level so that we can ensure that the best procedures are in place and there is good compliance with same.</p></speech>

As the director general stated, the review has examined HR processes, financial processes and so on and led to 40 new SOPs.  In general, it reflects a desire to do things better and has been a proactive exercise by the Prison Service.  I would just like to record the fact that we find that very good.

People at administrative level undertake a range of functions, with this one of those functions.  I agree with the Deputy that it is an onerous requirement, but it is necessary for prisoners.  They have an entitlement to buy whatever they want from the prison shop, and family members contribute to their bank accounts.  Managing that for every single individual prisoner is an onerous obligation on our resources.  A transfer is subsequently made.</p></speech>

I recognise that it is an essential function that must be provided.  I imagine it would be almost impossible to do it in any other manner.</p> <p>  Despite the insignificance of the sum, the figure for the management of petty cash jumped out at me.  It was minuscule at approximately &euro;1,000 or something along those lines.  Is it recognised that there are improvements to be made in how prison officers or staff in general manage and maintain these accounts?  Is there a standard operation across the board?</p></speech>

Perfect.  This question is rather appropriate in the context of prisoners' injury and compensation claims.  How does our figure of approximately 5% benchmark against other prison services, to the best of Ms McCaffrey's knowledge?  In her opening statement, she gave us figures on absenteeism which appear to benchmark relatively well against other countries.  While I welcome that, it would be useful if broader figures could be provided from the UK, in particular, because it is very close in terms of culture of employment and things like that.  How does our 5% figure for claims compare internationally?</p></speech>

The ratio of the cost of legal services to the level of compensation payments - it is roughly 2:1 - is a very common theme across a lot of Government Departments.  Is there a manner in which that figure can be reduced?  Is the Prison Service talking about the volume of individual claimants who are dealt with individually?  I ask Ms McCaffrey to comment on that.</p></speech>

We have a very good working relationship with the State Claims Agency.  A number of structures that are in place are aimed at reducing compensation, which will then reduce the equivalent legal costs that relate to those claims.  We have a risk management liaison group in place with the State Claims Agency.  Our own internal compliance executive is chaired by me.  Along with every governor within our system and all of our directorate staff from headquarters, we are looking at reducing the incidence of exposure to claims.  We need to learn lessons from the incidents that happen in our prisons to ensure we can get the numbers down.</p></speech>

I assume training in things like avoidance techniques, tactics and self-defence is provided.  Is it provided by external service providers or in-house?  Perhaps both forms of training are provided.  I appreciate that Ms McCaffrey only took up her position on 13 December last.  Does she believe it represents value for money for the Prison Service to go outside the service for training?

It is located on our campus in the midlands, so it is adjacent to both the Midlands Prison and Portlaoise Prison.  We provide training to recruit prison officers.  Last year, we recruited 182 new recruit officers to our service.  This year, we plan to recruit approximately 200 recruit officers.  The training is done between our college and Waterford Institute of Technology.  Our staff get a formal qualification - the higher certificate in custodial care - from a third level institute.</p></speech>

We recently introduced continuous professional development for our staff.  We see this as a really positive move.  All of our staff now receive training in areas like control and restraint, which was referred to by the Deputy, on an annual basis.  They also receive training in areas like mental health awareness and resilience to ensure they are looking after themselves in this very difficult and challenging climate.  That training is delivered in-house by our own prison staff who have worked in the organisation and understand it.</p></speech>

My final question relates to mental health support services for prison officers and for Prison Service staff in general.  Human nature determines that stresses in the workplace go beyond the workplace and extend to people who do not work within the Prison Service.

I will ask a series of questions, some of which will be straightforward quickfire questions.  I will start off with compensation and legal costs.  Is there a reason that legal costs for claims by prisoners are far higher than the level of compensation awarded?  It is the only category in which we are paying more in legal costs than we are in compensation itself.  Is there a reason for that?</p></speech>

This includes the legal costs that are incurred.  The Department, or the Prison Service in this case, finds itself paying the relative amounts.  This is common across Departments.  Obviously, some cases are more complex than others.  Legal fees mount up in those cases.  I think there were compensation cases in relation to slopping out.  They are historic at this stage.  The expenses in those cases would have been incurred by the State Claims Agency.  I would like to make a general point in this context.  I come across this in other jobs.  As Ms McCaffrey has said, an agency or Department can try to reduce the number of claims by managing the process better, but it has very little control over the legal costs that are incurred because decisions on such matters are made by the State Claims Agency in many cases.  I think that might be borne in mind here.</p></speech>

Any payment on the slopping out cases that have been mentioned by the Secretary General is included in that figure.  The State Claims Agency is managing slopping out claims on our behalf.  To date, it has received 1,658 claims and High Court proceedings have been served in 983 of those claims.  The payment that was made in those cases in 2017 may be inflating the figure.</p></speech>

Ms McCaffrey has mentioned that there are more than 1,600 cases.  When representatives of the State Claims Agency were in here recently, they had a list of mass actions.  I do not think they are called "class actions" in Ireland.  Given that payments are already being made to people, has the principle been conceded in most of these cases?</p></speech>

The caseload of the national forensic mental health service within the prison system is approximately 250.

We agree that prison is not the best place to provide them with care because it is not a therapeutic environment.

It is in all of our prisons bar three.  So we do have a difficulty in terms of forensic mental health inreach services in Cork Prison, Limerick Prison and Castlerea.  In 2016, the HSE did sanction the recruitment of forensic psychiatrists for those prisons but they have not been in a position to fill those posts so we do have a significant issue in those prisons.  Where we do have an inreach service from the national forensic mental health service there is a team of doctors and nurses who come from the CMH who provide the appropriate care and oversight.  I would like to mention our own staff, who do an amazing job in terms of assisting people who are suffering from mental illness in prison, the compassion and the humanity that is displayed by our discipline staff and our own internal nursing staff, in addition to the national forensic mental health service.</p></speech>

It is an area that we identify as an issue or a skill that our staff require.  All of our staff have gotten specific mental health awareness training.  Obviously the nursing staff and our doctors would have quite a lot of background and training, and that is augmented by the specialist service that we get.</p></speech>

Is the opiate substitution programme available in all prisons?</p></speech>

We do not have methadone maintenance in either Loughan House or Shelton Abbey.  It available across the estate.</p> <p>  The reduction is actually related to a reduction within the community of those availing of that form of treatment.  So, on any given day, we have approximately 530 prisoners on methadone stabilisation treatment within the Prison Service.  We provided that service to almost 1,700 prisoners in 2017, which is 17% of the population who avail of methadone substitution treatment in Ireland.  So a very significant contribution is made by the Irish Prison Service in providing drug treatment within the country. </p></speech>

An increasing number of people have a serious addiction to prescription drugs when they enter prison.  What provisions are put in place for those individuals?  Obviously they would not avail of an opiate programme.  If one has a serious prescription addiction the come-down or going cold turkey in a prison or any other setting can be quite dangerous for that individual.  What procedures are put in place for individuals who have an addiction?  How do we assess on intake what a person's addiction is?  I ask Ms McCaffrey to give us some information on this matter.  I will leave it at that, Chairman, and will move on.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the addiction counselling service that we have got in place.  That is run by Merchant's Quay Ireland.</p><p>The service is very successful and there is a significant uptake in respect of it.  In addition, we have a nine-week drug treatment programme which operates in Mountjoy Prison.  The programme forms part of a broader unit within the prison that has 50 beds available to assist people with drug treatment.</p></speech>

They say that a new broom sweeps clean even though I know that both of them have been involved in the service before and at the outset I pay tribute to the hardworking prison staff that we have in the service all over the country, be they administrative staff, officers or otherwise.  I apologise in advance because people - particularly journalists - can be of the view that I am a bit abrupt in questioning.  None of it is intentional; I only do so to get to the answers as quickly as we can in order to move forward.  I may interrupt our guests as we are moving forward.</p> <p>  Our guests indicated that there are prison officers who had made a statement of claim and sworn an affidavit and that the matter is before the court.  That is fine but, for the record, there is no protected disclosure before the court so are we safe enough in talking about a protected disclosure.</p></speech>

In the context of a protected disclosure made before, an external review was carried out by a retired judge, William Earley.  In it, he made distinctions between bullying and victimisation that I want to put on the record.  In part 7.5 he states:</p><blockquote>It is not essential to identify a specific, individual bully where there is a finding that the IPS is responsible for repeated acts of carelessness or inefficiency which have, or are reasonably likely to have, an adverse effect upon the morale, health and welfare of a worker.  Such acts can amount to unfair treatment, bullying or harassment, and/or penalisation.</blockquote> <p>He also states:</p><blockquote>There is no definition of &quot;bullying&quot; in the Act.  Section 3 (1) does interpret &quot;penalisation&quot; to mean any act or omission that affects a worker to the worker's detriment, and in particular includes<br /><br />(a) suspension, lay-off or dismissal,<br /><br />(b) demotion or loss of opportunity for promotion,<br /><br />(c) transfer of duties, change of location of place of work, reduction in wages or change in working hours,<br /><br />(d) the imposition or administering of any discipline, reprimand or other penalty (including a financial penalty),<br /><br />(e) unfair treatment,<br /><br />(f) coercion, intimidation or harassment,<br /><br />(g) discrimination, disadvantage or unfair treatment,<br /><br />(h) injury, damage or loss, and<br /><br />(i) threat of reprisal.</blockquote> <p>I ask the Department and the Irish Prison Service to briefly outline whether they accepted that report.</p></speech>

The issues arising from that case have now moved on into other fora but the Deputy is right that Judge Earley's report was issued, he made a finding that the officer was treated unfairly in some respects as a result of his actions and I am aware that following that, the previous direct general apologised to the officer.  The case has now widened significantly because the officer has raised other issues.  There are a large number of issues in this case which I presume the committee is aware of and they are now in front of the WRC, the Labour Court and the Circuit Court.  In the WRC and the Labour Court, matters have been suspended pending the outcome of the Circuit Court proceedings.  That is as much as I can say.</p></speech>

Why was it not introduced in the Prison Service until October 2015?  Why did it need to be updated recently?  The opening statements by Ms McCaffrey and Mr. O'Driscoll noted that a policy has been introduced to ensure employees who submit a protected disclosure are given periodic feedback and liaised with, which I welcome.  Why was that policy introduced and how does it work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.554" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019011700002#W01400"><p>I will take part of the response before asking Ms McCaffrey to add to what I say.  My notes indicate that the policy started in July 2015, but either way there was a slight delay after the 2014 policy was introduced.  That reflects the fact that all public sector organisations took a while to catch up with the protected disclosure provisions.</p> <p>  The protected disclosure process in the Prison Service has changed, and I will ask Ms McCaffrey to elaborate on that.  It has also changed within the Department.  With the benefit of experience, and recognising, in particular, the need to be as independent as possible and to be seen to be so, and partly because of the unpredictable workload from protected disclosures - which has not been such a great deal but it has been unpredictable - we have decided to outsource all assessment and investigation, as I said earlier.  The OGP has put in place a panel from which we can draw in that regard, which we are now using for all the cases.  </p> <p>  Until July 2018, the director of the internal audit at the Department was the recipient for protected disclosures, not only in the Department but also in the Prison Service.  Since then, the Prison Service has put in place its own recipient and, therefore, its own process.  Some protected disclosures, even in the Prison Service, continue to be sent to the Department because some people address protected disclosures to Ministers and we must deal with that.  When that happens, we generally refer them to the Prison Service unless there is some sort of conflict, for example, with senior officers.</p></speech>

I am interested in the change of internal auditor which was made.  I accept that the issue of protected disclosures is changing and evolving.  We, including those of us in the committee, are learning collectively.</p> <p>  I will not beat around the bush.  We all know which body we are talking about, and Deputy MacSharry made reference to it.  The panel or company that is purported to be investigating the disclosure is an outside firm, which I will not name.  I presume that its terms of reference were written by the person who was then the head of internal audit, but he was one of the recipients of the disclosure when it was made.  I do not suggest anything against that person, but this needs to be examined because, as has been seen in other cases, terms of reference being partly or in any way written by somebody or some section that was party to the trail is not good practice.  Will the Department consider that and reflect on the panel, the terms of reference and whether the matter needs to be re-examined?  It would be good to examine because of the trail.  I will leave the matter without seeking commentary from the witnesses but I ask them to reflect on it.</p> <p>   I also ask them to reflect on the issue of mediation, specifically in this case because it has been requested a number of times.  There will be different opinions on it but, again, it might be that somebody needs to make contact.  If that happens, perhaps there will be changes in some of the way in which the subject traverses the media and so on.  </p> <p>  I understand that all the external firms that the Prison Service and the Department use are selected from a panel established by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I asked about costs over the past five years.</p></speech>

Several committee members met this individual.  What I have said in this regard should be taken on board in a generous way.</p> <p>  An apology was given by Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll&rsquo;s predecessor.  I have read the judge&rsquo;s findings on the matter several times.  However, it went to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, where it was fought tooth and nail.  That is behaviour from a different time.  Most of us believe that should never have happened.  The reason and the way in which it was fought, particularly considering the judge&rsquo;s opinion, was from a different time.  There was an award made in this case which was never paid.  I urge the Department and the new Secretary General to reflect on this.  This case should never have occurred.  It now has the opportunity to deal with this.  It was unacceptable that after the findings of the judge and the apology from the service, it was then fought all over again at the WRC.  I accept Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll&rsquo;s point but I find it unusual for such behaviour to happen.</p> <p>  How many protected disclosures have there been?

However, I agree completely with the usefulness of mediation in many cases.  Sometimes, it happens that mediation is offered but there is a discussion about the precise scope of the mediation.  That can happen in certain cases.  I want to make it clear that we have a preference for mediation.  The dignity at work policy in the Civil Service specifically highlights the desirability of mediation or of informal processes rather than formal investigations.  I agree with the Deputy on mediation but I am not going to talk about the individual case in question.</p> <p>  On the terms of reference issue, I do not know where they arise.  The external firm is asked to assess-----</p></speech>

The Deputy will agree mediation is the way forward in many of these cases.</p> <p>  Between 2015 and 2018, when the Department&rsquo;s internal audit unit was handling Prison Service cases, there were 25 cases.  Of these, 19 were dealt with under our old system and six under the new system.  I can give the Deputy some detail on that if he wants.</p></speech>

We have access to its national incident management system which allows us to generate reports at an organisational level, but also on a prison-by-prison level.  We have a system in place with a compliance executive.

For example, something that jumps out to me addresses why claims occurred.  The numbers I have were from 2016 and 2017.  One of the categories was self-injurious behaviour where somebody has inflicted an injury on themselves.  Why would that be a compensatable category if somebody was injuring themselves?</p> <p>  Bacteria is another of the categories.  Did that relate to something like TB?  There is then a category, from 2016, of wrongful arrest or unlawful detention in the amount of &euro;28,000.  The Prison Service does not arrest people.</p></speech>

A significant number of claims are taken by prisoners about their detention and, at any one time, 160-odd claims may be under way by prisoners against the State for unlawful detention.  The Deputy is correct to say it would not fall into the category of arrest.  It is unlawful detention.</p> <p>  Regrettably, I do not have breakdown of individual cases but perhaps I can talk in a general sense.  I mentioned we have a compliance executive team and one of the areas around which we are very focused is the environment and particularly risks that arise within the environment.  The Deputy mentioned TB and there is also legionella and other bacterial infections.  We have a huge amount of work and focus in place in ensuring that, from a health and safety management perspective, we have systems in place to ensure we mitigate against those issues arising in the prison.</p></speech>

We take a proactive approach in dealing with cases through mediation.  We established our own internal mediation network to coincide with the introduction of the 2015 policy and we are trying to encourage staff, at the earliest stage, to engage to address any workplace issues because the earlier the engagement, the better the outcome for everybody.

I have worked in other areas of the public service and, generally speaking, injury warrants are not common.

In the normal course of events, we can accommodate people but the accommodations policy is one which is designed to allow people to regain full health.  It is a temporary accommodations policy.  If someone is permanently or long term in a position where he or she is unable to undertake the full range of duties that attach to the role of prison officer, then he or she would remain on sick leave.</p></speech>

Mr. Culliton said previously that the CMO might retire an officer on health grounds.  How long must an officer be on long-term sick leave before he or she is retired from the service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.627" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Don Culliton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019011700002#KK01300"><p>There is no hard and fast rule on that.  It depends on the particular circumstances of the individual case.  We start looking at this in a very detailed way once an officer is out on sick leave for in excess of 12 months.  That said, we have had people on sick leave for longer than a year who have not retired then on the grounds of ill health but who have retired on those grounds subsequently after three or four years.  It depends but it is assessed on a case by case basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.628" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019011700002#KK01400"><p>Let us say the ill health is a direct result of injuries suffered on the job.  I am not referring to an officer retiring on the basis of general ill health but on the basis of injuries suffered by that officer in the course of his or her work which renders the officer incapable of performing the full duties of the role.  Can the CMO retire such an officer on ill health grounds or is there a different mechanism when the ill health is the result of injuries sustained on the job?  If a prison officer is assaulted on the job and he or she can never work again, it is not right that he or she should be retired on the grounds of ill health by the CMO.  The Prison Service must make it clear that such an officer is retiring because he or she is not capable of doing the job having been injured on duty.  The CMO will probably not take that second step so that the person who is injured while on duty is just being retired on the grounds of ill health but that ill health is a direct result of the performance of his or her daily duties within the Prison Service.  Some people feel that they are being trapped in that space.</p></speech>

The first is retirement on the grounds of ill health under the superannuation arrangements.  The Chairman is correct that the same superannuation rules apply regardless of whether the retirement is a result of injuries sustained on duty or a general medical condition.  However, persons who are injured in the course of their duties have access to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, CICT, and can pursue a case through the tribunal if they feel that they are at a loss because of an injury sustained on duty.  There is a second avenue available to them.</p></speech>

The Prison Service grants the officer superannuation benefits because he or she is retiring on the grounds of ill health but does not acknowledge that the reason the officer is in that position is that he or she was assaulted on the job.  The Prison Service is essentially telling the officer to take a case to the CICT and take his or her chances there.  That is not a good way to treat employees.</p></speech>

It is a serious physical assault scheme and relates to people who are seriously injured on duty.  Ordinarily if staff are injured on duty, they are entitled to six months' sick leave on full pay and six months on half pay but under this scheme, they are entitled to 12 months' sick leave on full pay.  This is now forming part of a review of occupational injury and disease and their treatment within the Civil Service.  That review is being undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are playing a very full and active part in that review because we recognise the specific issues facing some of our staff.</p></speech>

It is fine that an additional six months of sick leave on full pay is available to prison officers but I am talking about people who are long past that point.  The extra concessionary months under the rules of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are fine but I am talking about people who are facing the prospect of leaving the service.  How does a person prove that his or her injuries were sustained on the job?  The CMO might say to a prison officer that there is no way of knowing whether he or she had a back problem anyway.  Do the witnesses understand the point I am making?  It is all well and good to say that this is being looked at by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to ask how long is a piece of string and to ask if it will ever happen, who will be covered going forward and so on.  I am talking about current serving officers who have been injured at work and cannot continue to work.  They do not want to be retired on the grounds of ill health without some recognition that their ill health is a direct result of injuries sustained at work.  The Prison Service is their employer and it has a duty to deal with them rather than telling them to take their chances with the CICT.</p></speech>

I understand the point the Chairman is making but we can only apply the superannuation arrangements that are in place at this point in time.  They provide that someone who is injured in the course of his or her duties can have access to enhanced pension arrangements, unlike someone who retires because of other medical conditions.  They are the arrangements with which we must comply and we have no authority or derogation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to introduce any extended arrangements, apart from the examination that was conducted some years ago about which the director general spoke, following which we received authority from the Department to introduce an enhanced sick leave arrangement.</p></speech>

I will move on to something else and ask about the prison shops and restaurants.  What prompted the Prison Service to remind the voluntary mess committees of the governance responsibilities?

There were two elements to the question.  There is the prison shop and then there are our staff canteen arrangements.  Procurement for the prison shop is done by the Irish Prison Service and the funds are managed by it.  We reinvest the profits from the tuck shop into a prisoner assist programme fund which we then use to make hardship payments to prisoners.  We also use some of that profit to fund the community return scheme which allows prisoners to go out early onto community service.</p> <p>  The mess committees are separate and they manage their moneys themselves.  They are aware of the principles of good governance, notwithstanding the fact that they are not part of our voted expenditure.  As part of our business process review, when we were looking at cash management and handling within the Prison Service, we thought it was an opportunity for us to engage with those committees to ensure that they did have the appropriate financial arrangements in place, but those arrangements are a matter for the mess committees themselves as opposed to the Prison Service.</p></speech>

As the director general referred to there, we have been engaging with them in terms of reminding them of their own governance obligations.  Off the top of my head, I cannot honestly say whether they have a tax number.  It is very much up to the individual mess committee.  Each kitchen is staffed by prisoners.  It is part of the work training initiatives within the prison that they are engaged in the operation of the kitchens.  We have also been in correspondence with Revenue to get an opinion on the exact situation concerning Revenue obligations in that regard.  For instance, there is no Revenue obligation to register for the Department of Defence mess committees.  We have been trying to engage to get a formal decision in relation to that.  We are awaiting outstanding correspondence from Revenue at the moment.</p></speech>

Approximately 20% of incidents recorded on the SCA's database related to slips, trips and falls between 2013 and 2016.  That was 188 per annum.  Using the data we got from the agency, we were able to target individual prisons and ensure appropriate action was taken at prison level.  We have now reduced that figure from an average of 188 claims per year to 129 per annum between 2017 and 2018.  That is a 31% reduction in that area of claims because of engagement, co-operation and the lessons we are learning from the agency.</p></speech>

It reduced even further between 2017 and 2018.  The big area is probably violence, harassment and aggression under the exposure to behavioural hazards.  Were there recommendations in that area?</p></speech>

Over 30 of those recommendations have been implemented to date and we have seen a reduction in the number of assaults on staff.  One assault on a member of staff is too many so there is no level of complacency within the organisation regarding assaults.  In 2017, there were 104 assaults on staff.  It is an area we target for continuous improvement.  Some of the security equipment we bought earlier, particularly the handcuffs, was one of the recommendations made in the SCA report, which was that we would standardise our equipment across the service and ensure that everybody was properly trained.  Again, we are actively working with the SCA with a view to minimising the amount of claims and the number of incidents in our prisons.</p></speech>

One of the areas was management of bail money at prison level.  People can come and pay their bail money in at a prison level.  We are talking about a significant amount and ensuring robust procedures for cash handling are in place was one of the reasons of the review.</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier that we have a significant number of unlawful detention claims.  As such, it is important that we do not keep someone past his or her sentence expiration date.  One of the former governors to whom I referred brings a great deal of technical skill and knowledge to bear around sentence calculation, which is complicated and technical in nature.  Between the middle and end of 2018, we conducted a review of 1,500 prisoners and checked individually that their warrant and sentence calculations were correct to ensure they did not give rise to future claims.  That is a particular area.</p></speech>

One of those claim areas is around unlawful detention.  If we have systems of insurance and checks and balances in place at prison level, it mitigates any compensation we might be exposed to at a future date.</p></speech>

Ms McCaffrey does not need to justify the canteen facilities.  However, she needs to deal with accountability in these matters.  It does not only involve prisoners; there is a mix.

Politicians assure everyone that they are above board and accountable but there must always be an external system to ensure that is the case.  What has emerged from various reports, that of Mr. Justice Charleton being the latest, is that institutions are simply incapable of holding a mirror up to themselves.  We know that from issues involving Tusla, the Garda and politicians.  An effective oversight system must be in place.</p> <p>  It is difficult to sit on this committee and listen to what whistleblowers go through.  The word "punitive" is often used.  It is upsetting that somebody would feel they have been punished and, further, that there would seem to be evidence that they were punished.  That is a matter for another day but we have seen evidence of that in every forum, including third level institutions, some of which will appear before the committee next week.  We are utterly reliant on whistleblowers because governance issues do not work.  I wish Ms McCaffrey the best of luck with the new approach she is bringing in and I hope we can work together to make it a success.</p></speech>

That is not an overstatement.  One element of that is putting in place new governance functions on the criminal justice and civil justice and equality sides of the Department.  That will provide an organisational platform for a new relationship between the Department and the agencies we oversee.  Some 24 agencies, including the Irish Prison Service, report to the Department.   The agencies vary in size, function and degree of independence.  We will put in place a new governance function which will, at least, provide the organisational basis for a new relationship.</p> <p>  I mentioned in my opening statement that we are discussing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the issue of making the director general Accounting Officer and-or the appropriate authority for disciplinary purposes. </p></speech>

In regard to the cases about which questions have been asked, how many relate to sexual harassment, if any?  How many reviews are under way by the Prison Service or the Department in regard to cases of sexual harassment or other matters or issues that have been raised by whistleblowers?   How many investigations are under way?</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in the area of mental health.  I do not have much time for my remaining questions.  An interesting doctorate carried out by a young man in Trinity College Dublin quoted the prediction of the World Health Organization that the prison system will become the asylums of the 21st century.  It seems to me that that is happening.  I ask Ms McCaffrey to comment on that.  How many prisoners have mental health issues?  How many have drug issues?</p> <p>  The Red Cross is involved in a particularly interesting project in regard to non-violence.  It is in place in three cities.  I ask Ms McCaffrey to provide further information on it and to explain where the funding comes from.  Does it come from the Department through the Prison Service?  What accountability is in place in that regard?  I ask that question of all organisations in receipt of public moneys.</p></speech>

The Red Cross programme to which the Deputy referred is a community-based health and first aid programme.  It is an excellent example of innovation within the public service.  It is run jointly by the Red Cross Ireland, the Prison Service and ETBs.  The Probation Service has recently become involved.  It is about empowering prisoners to take care of themselves and their health both in prison and in the wider community.  We have received dormant accounts funding for the past four years for the project.  There was a payment of &euro;200,000 in 2017 and 2018.</p></speech>

I realise the Chairman is under time pressure, so I will be brief.  There was one anonymous protected disclosure on sexual harassment.  Again, a private law firm was engaged to examine the case.  That report was received in November and was shared with the Prison Service.  As a result, certain undertakings have been given to the Department about procedures in the Prison Service, especially under the new dignity at work policy that I mentioned earlier.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's other question about prisons becoming the new asylums and the relationship between mental health and crime, the Deputy has touched on what is one of the single most important issues we are facing in criminal justice.  This is not just in Ireland, but affects every country.  The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland by Kathleen O'Toole is very much focused on this issue.  It points out, for example, that the average policeman or policewoman in a developed country - it is not exclusive to Ireland - spends 75% of his or her time dealing with vulnerable people and 25% of the time on dealing with actual crime.  It is also true that a large number of people who arrive into prison have drug or mental health problems.  I do not have precise figures, but in a recent visit to one prison, the governor estimated it at 75%.</p> <p>  This relationship that the Deputy has touched on between mental health, drug abuse and crime is crucial.  The solution to this lies partly in the way we run the prisons but it primarily arises before an individual ever reaches the door of a prison.  It is also about how we do policing in particular.  One of the key points about the Kathleen O'Toole report is that it does not just look at the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It looks at policing under a much broader frame and it binds together a view of the enforcement agencies, those being the Garda, the Irish Prison Service, and the Probation Service, the health services, the social services and so on.  The report proposes a joined-up approach to that.  The high-level implementation committee for that plan includes the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Health, Housing, Planning and Local Government and so on.  The high-level committee is at Secretary General level and includes my colleagues in those Departments and me as the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  This is a fundamentally new way of looking at criminal justice in the State and it is very promising.</p> <p>  Other programmes that we have rolled out, including those that relate to community release, have been very successful in this space.  A very successful programme that has won an innovation award in the Civil Service is called the joint agency response to crime, JARC, project.  It has run a number of different pilot projects now and is highly successful.  Again, it wraps all the various services together into dealing with people who have a high propensity to offend.  These are people who are repeat offenders but have been identified as possibly likely to benefit from a more caring approach rather than a discipline approach.  The Deputy has touched on what I would regard as perhaps the most exciting development in criminal justice in Ireland at the moment.</p></speech>

I ask the committee to bear with me because I was not here to witness the debate.  I had other commitments in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  I wish to follow on from Deputy Connolly's point about capacity in our prisons.  We have 12 prisons, which I believe are full, at a cost of &euro;327 million, and with a staff of some 3,300.  Is the capacity there for the prisons that are coming on stream or the prisons we foresee being built next year?  We all hear about the revolving door system.  I am aware of a case some years ago in Kilkenny where an individual was brought up with two garda escorts.  There were costs with bringing that person up, and the garda had to get cover for the day and food and so on.  The man they brought up was out and in his home before they came back that evening.  I ask this in the context of capacity in the years ahead.  Have we enough prisons and prison spaces currently?  Reference was made to Thornton Hall.  I went to see that site with a committee a long time ago.  It was going to be a state-of-the-art prison.  It is still in the pipeline, once funds become available, to have that state-of-the-art prison at Thornton Hall.  There have already been costs incurred there.</p></speech>

As of today we are at 94% of the capacity that is available to us across the prison estate.

Our numbers are subject to peaks and troughs, depending on the activity happening within the courts.  As I said, we are seeing increases in certain categories of prisoners.  We are certainly seeing an increase in the numbers of female prisoners being committed to custody.  It has gone from 122 females in custody in January 2017 to 168 in custody in January 2019.  This is across two prisons, namely, the D&oacute;chas Centre and a small female prison in Limerick Prison.  We are also seeing an increase in the number of prisoners on remand where 579 persons were in custody on average in January 2017, and this increased 21% to 701 people in January 2019.  There are some measures under way that will give us additional capacity.  We are introducing a step-down unit for female offenders.  This is a recommendation of the penal policy review group.  Very happily, the Department has-----</p></speech>

It will not be run by the Prison Service.  It will be run by a service provider in the community.  Between the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service we will have access to ten beds.  It is for women who have very complex needs so we can release them into the community with those wraparound services they require in order not to reoffend and come back into our custody.</p> <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that we will sign a contract imminently for the replacement of the A and B wings in Limerick Prison.  That is our next major piece of capital expenditure.  That project will take place over the next 18 to 24 months.  It will give us an additional 125 spaces.  As well as the male wing that is being replaced, we are building a stand-alone prison for female offenders on the Limerick site, which will provide 50 female spaces.  That will be very welcome capacity in the context of the increase we are seeing in female offenders.</p></speech>

We are conducting an audit of all our accommodation to see what additional capacity might be available to us within the estate.  We also have some accommodation that is not in use currently.  The training unit is a prison located on the Mountjoy Prison campus site.  It has been out of operation for the past 18 months.</p><p>We will bring it back into operation and it will give us 100 spaces.  The progression unit, formerly St. Patrick's Institution, also on the Mountjoy Prison campus will give us 50 additional spaces.  I am confident, therefore, that for the foreseeable future there will be additional capacity in the system which will allow us to manage our numbers.</p><p> On temporary release, we have moved from what the Deputy described as a revolving door to where anyone on temporary release is part of a structured programme.  The Secretary General mentioned two programmes that we run in co-operation with the probation service.  The community return scheme is for prisoners who are serving sentences between one and eight years, swap some of their prison time for time spent doing community service.  They are contributing greatly to their communities in the projects they undertake.  The community support scheme is for prisoners who are serving between three and 12 months who can be released with supports in place.  They could be supports to deal with addiction or mental health issues in order that they will not fall into a pattern of reoffending.  </p><p> The numbers on temporary release have reduced significantly.  As of today, only 160 are on temporary release, which is in sharp contrast to-----</p></speech>

That is a phenomenally high figure which is down to the very careful selection of the prisoners to participate in the scheme.  We are very careful in choosing the prisoners whom we deem to be suitable for temporary release.  The compliance rate is lower for the community support scheme.  However, that might be expected because of the complexity of the needs of some of the prisoners who are serving longer sentences, but even then there is a compliance rate of 75%.  The other 25% are returned to custody where they breach the conditions in being allowed out early.  They then serve every last day of their sentence.</p></speech>

The cost per staff member is &euro;68,535 per annum.  It works out at &euro;188 per day to keep an offender in custody.  I do not have a breakdown of the cost per prison, but if the Deputy is interested, I can make it available.</p></speech>

For example, under the Fines Act, there has been a huge decrease in the number of committals to prison.  This was part of the revolving door aspect to which the Deputy referred, as many of the people in question would have been in and out of prison on the same day.  We have tried to get rid of this to the greatest extent possible.  There has been a huge fall in the number committed for the non-payment of fines.  What we are trying to do at a policy level is develop alternatives to prison.  This also has a bearing on the Deputy's earlier question about the number of prison spaces needed.  If we can develop the use of community service orders or attachment of fines or recovery orders, for instance, which do not involve the use of custodial arrangements, it will be a win-win all round because the Exchequer would not have to pay &euro;68,000 to house somebody in a prison and somebody would not be put in a prison who was not suitable for it, given the nature of his or her transgression which should not lead them into a prison.</p> <p>  There has been a debate recently on the neighbouring island - when they are not debating other things - about short sentences - sentences of less than six months or one year - whether people in that category should really be in prison - by definition, the transgressions must be relatively minor if the sentence is of that length - and whether it might be better if they did community service.  That is the direction of policy.</p></speech>

How it now looks at Thornton Hall is as a strategic land bank available to the State.  It was purchased and investments have been made, particularly in providing access roads and so on.

For example, in order to build houses elsewhere, other facilities must be moved.  Would they want to move a facility of some kind to the Thornton Hall site, which would be one possibility?  The agency is to deal with the housing issue, but that does not necessarily mean that houses will be built.

Would that man have had to come before us to have the committee listen to his complaints if a correct governance system had been in place?

I am saying I cannot comment on an individual case, that the protected disclosure process is in place to allow anyone to raise a genuine concern they may have.  Someone can make a protected disclosure which can be investigated.  Sometimes they are found not to have merit, but that is not to imply that the person in question did not genuinely have concerns when they were raised.  The protected disclosure process is very important to provide an avenue for people to raise concerns in a way they can consider to be safe.  Some issues are best dealt with through formal investigation and that is the direction we have taken to protected disclosures.  One thing which I hope gave comfort to the committee was how we had moved towards the most independent form of investigation, that is, investigation by external independent investigators from panels picked by the Office of Government Procurement.  They are very independent-minded.  They genuinely look at the complaint and the issues raised, assess them and reach their conclusions independently which we accept.</p><p>However, that is not the only mechanism available.  Under the dignity at work programme, which is a very important programme in the Civil Service now, we also look at less formal forms of engagement including mediation.

We do live in a democracy.  There are all these processes in place, I guarantee the Deputy that.  It is a fact.  However, that does not mean an individual will not seek to go in front of his public representatives.  This is important too.  In any individual case, we try to adapt our response to the nature of the case.  If mediation is possible, we look at that.  If it requires full-scale independent investigation by external independent people from reputable companies, we do that.  We do try to operate these programmes in a reasonable and open way, encouraging people to come forward with complaints if they have them, preferably within our existing systems but if necessary through protected disclosure.  The systems are there and they are robust and independent.</p></speech>

It happened in Dublin, a stabbing incident of which I suppose Ms McCaffrey is well aware.  A prison warder was stabbed and the unions representing prison staff were not very happy with the response they got.  It was all hush hush.  I do not want to say too much about it because there is probably a court case or something like that going on.  What is in place?  I am talking about that individual case because it is the only one I know of and I received complaints from prison warders whom I know personally.  It could happen again.

We all hear about the epidemic of drugs in prison.  Have the witnesses got on top of drugs?  Are some prisons worse than others?  Is the Prison Service getting control of the problem?  We hear about people going into prison without a drug problem and coming out with one.  What is Ms McCaffrey's reply to that?</p></speech>

Our prisons are very much a reflection of what happens within our communities.  Clearly, addiction is a societal problem and it is a major contributory factor in respect of criminality.  A significant proportion of people who are committed to custody have addiction problems.  Mr. O'Driscoll made reference to a figure earlier.  It is quite old research but it suggests that between 70% and almost 80% of prisoners have a problem with addiction.</p></speech>

We have a huge range and take a two-pronged approach to dealing with drugs in prison.  One is dealing with the demand and that is around our drug treatment programmes, which are in place to assist people.  Prison and the interventions we have there are a great opportunity for people who have not dealt with their addiction issues in the community to engage with the services to deal with their addiction problems.  We also have a huge focus on reducing the supply of drugs.  We have invested very significantly in front-of-house security in terms of the level of screening people go through.  We have drug detection dogs.  We have netting on our yards.  A lot of our prisons are in a city centre location, which means they are highly susceptible to drugs and contraband being thrown over the walls.  In some instances we have netting or double netting on our yards to ensure, insofar as we can, that contraband is not getting into the prison.  It is a significant challenge.  A lot of contraband brought into the prison is concealed internally by prisoners.  It is a significant challenge to the Prison Service but one on which we are determined to continue our efforts.  We have a drugs policy which is being reviewed this year and we are going to look at what additional measures we might take in respect of this area.</p></speech>

I was going to ask more but my time is up.  Awards came to &euro;492,000 in 2017 but the legal costs were &euro;1 million.  That does not add up.  The legal costs were double what the awards were.  Why would that be?  How can the witnesses stand over it?  It sounds incredible and sounds like an extremely large sum of money.  I am sure some procedures could be put in place.  For example, with whiplash, a court will only give so much for a whiplash.</p></speech>

They are managed by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the State, as are our slopping-out cases.  The increase in respect of the legal costs to which the Deputy referred actually concerns the slopping-out cases at the moment.  More than 1,600 proceedings have been lodged in court by former prisoners in respect of the fact that they did not have in-cell sanitation during their period of detention.  In 2017, &euro;351,000 of the &euro;1 million related to legal costs incurred by the State Claims Agency in defending those cases.</p></speech>

None of the cases has been paid out yet.  They are still before the court.  However, some of the legal costs already have been paid at this point.

I have a few questions because some Deputies will want to come back in a second time.</p> <p>  I will deal with a few issues which I touched on early with regard to officers injured in the course of their duties.  I ask the witnesses to take me through the steps.  The service states that an injury warrant goes to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and others have to take cases to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Some other cases go to court.  I ask the Prison Service to take me through the chart.  We will deal with them, one by one.  In the case of this injury warrant and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, what is the process?  They apply to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, not to the Prison Service.  Will the Prison Service briefly give me the steps?</p></speech>

To my mind - previous to my life in the Prison Service, I worked in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - I do not recall an injury warrant application being made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in recent years.

There are prison officers injured in the course of their work, they have exhausted their sick leave, they probably feel they want to do some light duties, and the Prison Service is saying there is not a great facility for it as the person is not fit for work.  In the meantime, the prison officer has not been pensioned off - or whatever is the phrase one likes to use - but has no money.  Such staff are off payroll receiving nothing.  Is there much of this?  This sounds very unfair for somebody who was injured doing his or her job on behalf of the State.  I am trying to highlight the unfairness here.</p></speech>

That is a scheme that is sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are looking to have that particular regime reviewed and we want to actively engage in that with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, as it stands at this point in time, and I cannot give any better answer than this, we are limited in what we can do.</p></speech>

The Chairman was concerned that certain individual officers may find themselves in a no-pay situation.  Because of the new sick leave arrangements implemented by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2014, nobody goes into a no-pay situation.  At worst case, they go onto a regime called temporary rehabilitative remuneration.  There are payments to such officers, albeit that the payments might be quite low.  As I understand it, they do not fall below the threshold that is set by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the context of disability payments and so on.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the situation from reading the reply to one of the parliamentary questions I asked last year on temporary rehabilitation and remuneration.  The Minister stated that while the Irish Prison Service endeavours to provide reasonable accommodation, which Mr. Culliton has mentioned, within the constraints provided in the prison environment, it should be noted there is no onus on the service to provide such accommodation, and this is reflected in the employment equality legislation in section 37 of the 1988 Act.  I am again hearing about all these lovely schemes, but when push comes to shove, there is no onus to facilitate an officer injured in the course of his or her work.</p></speech>

Some people find themselves trapped.  Does Mr. Culliton have influence to tell the chief medical officer to sign the form because a person is impaired?  The chief medical officer will not do so and sign out the person because he or she is capable of doing light work.  In the meantime the injured officer is out there, and Deputy Aylward highlighted a case a moment ago.

This is why we went to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2015 to seek the extension of a scheme that did not apply to any other civil servant.  It is why we have petitioned the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a review of the occupational injury and disease provisions for civil servants that recognises our staff are in a unique environment.  I completely accept the concerns expressed by the Chairman.  It is why we are engaging in the review process with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am as concerned as the Chairman about the circumstances in which some of our staff may find themselves.  Certainly from our perspective we are committed to looking for solutions in the context of the review.  We have no discretion to operate outside the parameters of the schemes in place for all civil servants.</p></speech>

The Irish Prison Service is trying to recruit people, but people being recruited into a uniformed service, whether the Garda or whatever, and we are speaking about the Irish Prison Service today, know that if they get stabbed in the course of their job, the chief medical officer in the Department of Health will not sign them out because they are capable of desk duties.  They will run out of sick pay but the Prison Service states it can do nothing for them and cannot retire them on health grounds unless the chief medical officer states they are not fit for work.  In the meantime they go off pay.  The public service collectively is not looking after staff who have been seriously injured in the course of their work on behalf of the citizens.  The witnesses get the point I am making.  These people are being caught.  Do the witnesses share my concern?</p></speech>

I am raising it to clarify it in case some people watching take the other meaning.  What is the position involving the Garda and the Irish Prison Service regarding security when transferring prisoners?  There are 41,000 transfers per annum.  Obviously, the Irish Prison Service has to have a serious protocol.  Is the Garda always available at the drop of a hat when needed?  There is a security issue I do not want to go into but the public wants to be satisfied.  If there are 41,000 movements of prisoners in and out of jails every year, mainly to and from courts but also to and from hospitals and so on, are those movements secure from everybody's point of view?  Is there a protocol?  The media reports at the time to which I am referring suggested certain people were not available or whatever.  Has the bigger picture been addressed?</p></speech>

We mentioned assaults on prison officers a minute ago.  What is the process in place and the protocol involving the Irish Prison Service and Garda regarding the taking of witness statements?  If it happens in a public place, that is fine.  Let us say it happens within the four walls of a prison.  Does everything have to go through the governor?  What is the protocol?  Do the garda&iacute; come in and physically question every witness?</p></speech>

There is a specific Garda liaison contact for each prison.  Where there is an assault on a member of our staff, it is notified by the governor to the Garda liaison officer.  It would obviously be notified by the person concerned to the Garda.  There are arrangements in place between the prison and the local Garda station for the notification of assaults.</p></speech>

We were told before that if there is a case involving a prison officer, the governor is notified and that it is then up to him or her to inform the staff member of the issue.  We have heard that if there is an issue involving a prison officer, the Garda does not deal directly with individual prison officers.  It works through the governor or the liaison officer as the case may be.</p></speech>

It was said the information was channelled by the governor to the Garda or liaison officer but it was not given down to the prison officer, which led to difficulty.  I am not asking Ms McCaffrey to comment on the case.  There is a command structure in regard to the flow of information that does not apply to other citizens in that garda&iacute; feel freer to make contact in the way I have described.  The Irish Prison Service has a protocol and that protocol does not apply to other citizens.  Are the prison officers in some way hamstrung?  I have heard of an assault case, on which I am not asking Ms McCaffrey to comment, in respect of which the governor did not facilitate every witness in making a statement to the Garda.  The injured prison officer's case did not succeed due to a lack of evidence.  It seems to be the case that a governor can in some way be involved in the process or restrict a process.</p></speech>

Has the family links programme been rolled out in all prisons?  If the witnesses do not have the answer to hand, they can provide it to the committee subsequently.  Last year, the programme was rolled out in a number of prisons, with the aim of having it rolled out across all prisons this year.  If the witnesses find the information before the end of the session, they can revert to us then instead.</p> <p>  There was an acting clinical director last year.  Has that role been filled on a full-time basis?</p></speech>

According to the service's 2017 annual report, the capacity was put at approximately 70%, which means a good bit of capacity remains available within the prison system.  The participation rates are only 24% or 25%.  What steps are being taken to encourage greater participation, given that we have the capacity and it would be of benefit to the prison population?</p> <p>  The second matter is education.  I do not know what the capacity is in this regard, as it is not stated in the report, or whether education is available to every prisoner or is based on capacity within prisons.  It is done in partnership with education and training boards, ETBs.  Participation rates in this regard are usually slightly higher, at 35% to 40%, but what steps are being taken to increase them?</p> <p>  I also wish to ask about the incentivised regimes, of which there are three - basic, standard and enhanced.  Can Ms McCaffrey briefly provide details on what each entails?</p></speech>

Our commitment is to maximise the rehabilitative facilities available within our prisons.  The figures are being impacted by staff shortfalls.  We are not at full staffing levels.</p></speech>

Our security posts are the ones that we must man first.  Regrettably, some ancillary services can be hit with closures.  On top of the vacancies, we have mentioned the number of escorts that the Prison Service is required to conduct annually.  We sought the value for money review, which has recently been completed, because we were significantly concerned about the draw of prison officers from our prisons to assist in escorting.  We have a Prison Service escorts corps, PSEC, but it is not staffed sufficiently to deal with what has been an exponential increase in the requirements placed on it.</p></speech>

I mentioned our vacancies as well as the draw to PSEC.  The issue of sick leave also has an impact on prisons on a day-to-day basis.  Where there are high levels of sick leave, they create vacancies within the prison, which regrettably leads to ancillary services being reduced.</p> <p>  We are coming towards the end of our current strategy, and maximising the use of existing services will be an area of particular focus in our upcoming strategy so as to ensure that, where we have work, training and educational facilities, we can assist, facilitate and encourage prisoners to utilise them fully.</p></speech>

We have a school operating in each of our prisons.  Those schools are vibrant centres of education.  We have 220 whole-time equivalent teachers operating across our 12 prisons providing educational services.

For example, if a prisoner is at an enhanced level, he or she can avail of an additional gratuity, tuck shop orders or telephone calls.  At the end of December, almost 50% of the prison population, or 1,921 prisoners, were on the enhanced regime, 40%, or 1,570, were on the standard regime and almost 10%, or 378, were on the basis regime.</p></speech>

Is it because the pilot project is still under way or is it still being evaluated?

Mr. O'Driscoll told me that we cannot really talk about these things and Ms McCaffrey is saying that we have a rule in place since 2015 which does not permit this, except there was a camera in one instance in Wheatfield Prison which no longer exists, so I am taking that as a "No".</p></speech>

Again, it is anecdotal evidence, but the word around the campfire is that there is outside catering at a number of events.  I know that in the normal course there might be a soccer match between one prison and another, leagues and so on, as there are in the Garda and the Army, and that there might be outside catering at some event in tennis club A or rugby club B.  Is there any accounting of the term in terms of auditing to say, for example, that it cost &euro;300 or &euro;500, that it was the contribution of the Irish Prison Service in the soccer game that took place between the PSNI and the Irish Prison Service?</p></speech>

The Irish Prison Service invests significant resources in training its staff, including for the kitchen area, driving and so forth because those activities are part and parcel of our core business.  As we have to feed prisoners and cannot go to the local takeaway, we need people to staff the kitchen.  On a day to day basis I cannot say whether we might have somebody who does not have full qualifications working in the kitchen, but, if we do, it is out of necessity because of staff shortages.  We certainly invest a lot of resources in training personnel.</p></speech>

In consultation with the Prison Officers Association - this was a very big industrial relations issue at the time - we came up with a proposal that would allow us to provide work-training activities to prisoners, utilising the mess facilities that were already there in our prisons, but that the management and oversight of those mess committees would be the responsibility of individual mess committees; that there would no longer be any subvention of the provision of food to prison officers; and that they would need to be self-sustaining.</p></speech>

So we will take 60 off our 1,000 giving 940.  I am told the mess committees provide good meals to the staff who are on duty on a particular day.  The average cost of breakfast is &euro;2.50.  The average cost of lunch is &euro;3.  The average cost of dinner is &euro;5.50 subsidised.  My research suggests that the mess committees typically buy meat and vegetables.  Ms McCaffrey said earlier that they pay for all their own food.  My research indicates that a very substantial amount of the resourcing is subsidised from central prison stock.  That routinely includes bread, milk, cheese, chips, cooking oil, gravy powder, curry powder, salt, tinfoil, pepper and so on.</p></speech>

There is a bigger point here.  With an average spend per day of &euro;10 and we take the 60 off the staff number, it comes to &euro;9,400 per day multiplied by 365 giving &euro;3,431,000 in turnover.  This is a very crude calculation.  If we took the cost of that food at &euro;5, because it is about &euro;11.50 there, and we will divide that by two, that gives a profit of &euro;1,715,500 for the year.  We need to bear in mind that my information is that all these other things are routinely drawn from central prison stores.  We know they do not pay anything for heat or light.  We know the chefs and prisoners who help are not paid from their funds; the Irish Prison Service pays them from the central funds.  There is no rent and there are no staffing costs.</p> <p>  Ms McCaffrey can correct me if I am wrong in this.  My research indicates the mess committees have no memoranda of articles of association.  They have no rules.  They are not registered charities.  They are not limited companies.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, the top accountant in the State is present.  He can tell me if I am off the wall in my very crude calculation.  They may have at their disposal in the region of &euro;1,715,500 in profit, subsidised by taxpayers' payment of resources for the Irish Prison Service's stores, staff costs, heat and light.  Nobody audits that money.  Nobody knows where it goes and nobody knows what it is used for.</p></speech>

Ms McCaffrey said that each mess has an account and that there are small amounts of money in these accounts because they are run on a not-for-profit basis.  I am using estimates and that is the reason we need figures, audits and so on.  I suggested spending in the messes might be &euro;10 per person per day.  That came from my own research in asking around.  Based on a figure of 940 staff, that would amount to &euro;9,400 per day.  That is how I came up with the figures.  The figure for the year would be &euro;3.6 million or thereabouts.</p></speech>

The numbers were given.  We picked a speculative 1,000.  We then took a third of the three prisons off that and suggested a figure of 940.  Let us go really low and say there are 940 people at a &euro;3 spend per day, below the lowest amount, and multiply that by 365, that is approximately &euro;1.2 million.  If we then remove 556 per day, there are still hundreds of thousands in profit, especially when it is known that staff, heat, light and equipment are, anecdotally, subsidised from the service's own resources.  Even if we assume that it is not, there are still major profits, with no audit, no oversight, no accounting, that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not get to look at it and that the Department of Justice and Equality does not look at it.  All we know is that Mr. O'Driscoll is so frustrated with my effrontery in raising such a matter that it just does not suit him and he wants to send me a note on it.</p> <p>  These things need to be in the public domain because it is not good.  Prison officers are entitled to their full entitlements.  The director general said that after a long industrial relations negotiation, this was agreed.  That is fine if it is an entitlement but we do not know how much it is.  To an unqualified person who can simply add, as opposed to being a chartered accountant, it seems to me that there is a lot of money flying around beyond the actual costs, especially when the overhead is free.  That puts Templemore in the ha'penny place.  If it was part of a negotiation that it was to be this obscure and not for profit, then where is the profit going, because it is clearly profitable?  What does the Chairman think?</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts has a duty to deal with real figures.  We can all run the figures of how many hours a person works in a year.  An average of five officers are required to give 24-hour coverage for 365 days of the year.  If one works 40 hours a week for 45 weeks a year, that is 1,800 hours out of 8,760 hours in the year, so five staff are required.  For every prisoner, only one fifth of the staff are on duty at any one time.  The staff member is only there for a third of the day, while the prisoners are there for 24 hours per day.  The Committee of Public Accounts wants real figures and we ask the witnesses to do their best.  I am not passing the buck to them.  There was an issue in Templemore.  I do not know if there were issues in the Army; I think it has a slightly different system.  It is all integrated and maybe this needs to be integrated.  I do not know.  I will only look at it with regard to real figures.  I am not disputing the witnesses' figures but I do not know.  I want to get real figures.</p></speech>

I went as low as &euro;3 and as high as &euro;10.  The fact is that mess committees are not regulated by anybody with no oversight, accountancy or audit.  There is a suggestion of them cross-subsidising stock from taxpayers' cash for prisoners' food and so on and there is no oversight.  I am sorry to have to say this and I appreciate that people are new to particular roles but the blank faces and lack of answers are perhaps the most worrying fact.  It was somehow okay over there and on a not-for-profit basis.  If any meals are being sold, there is serious profit with no overhead.  If it is going out to tender tomorrow, the witnesses can stick my name on the list to try to put a catering company together.</p></speech>

I understand that mess committees are registered charities and limited companies.  Have they memoranda and articles of association?  Are there procedures?  Where does all the money go?  Are they all cash payments?  Do those cash payments tally with a tally roll from a till?  Are all transactions put through the till?  Is all the money that comes in lodged to this account?  If there are such modest amounts left, taking into account the cost per day to feed people, it would seem to me that money is missing.  This needs to come under the Comptroller and Auditor General for auditing.  I appreciate that the witnesses might be annoyed with me for throwing this at them today.  They might not have been ready for it but it is clearly the first time it has come up in this way and it clearly needed to.  Let us get to the bottom of it.  I appreciate that the witnesses think I am looking for headlines but I am not box office and my name is not Healy-Rae, so it probably will not.</p></speech>

There are some issues relating to relying on a locum service.  We are considering potentially re-employing our own doctors but the number of directly employed doctors is far exceeded by the number of locum doctors we have working.  To reiterate, we have GP sessional services in all of our prisons.</p></speech>

I understand that but I see no reason the same principle applied in respect of nursing staff should not apply for doctors.

The Prison Service has made a good move in respect of the nurses.  Is there a senior-----</p></speech>

The prisoners would be lucky to see the same doctor twice if they were in for a year if locums are coming and going and there is only one doctor.  I am just looking at the health of the prisoners and that is where I am coming from.  I do not know the answer, I am not a doctor, but on the face of it, it seems very light.  Health and mental health are big issues.  A number of prisoners are on prescription.  I would be afraid that the volume of work for those four permanent doctors and locums is so large.  One would hope prisoners have good access to a doctor, if required, although I know nurses probably handle many of the issues.  I am expressing concern and the witnesses know where I am coming from.</p></speech>

Our governors see the value of the education service that is provided to us and it would be an exception that the school officer post would be cut.  It may happen on occasion and I can certainly give figures for when a school might have closed.  The governor would try to protect the opening of the school on a daily basis to ensure that the significant number of offenders who engage in education can be facilitated, given that the teachers are on site and, as the Chairman mentioned, in a position to teach.</p></speech>

Do prisoners of basic, standard or enhanced status all have equal access to education or does it depend on where they are?  How equal is access to education throughout the Prison Service and for the three categories of prisoners?  Does a prisoner with enhanced status get greater access?</p></speech>

Prisoners on an enhanced regime have access to things over and above other prisoners, such as access to an additional phone call.  The fact that a prisoner was of basic or standard status would not restrict access to education.</p></speech>

Can that be sent on in writing because the witnesses might not have it in front of them there?  Here is an awkward question.  Ms McCaffrey mentioned people who are wrongfully detained.  How many prisoners are released straight into homelessness the minute they walk out?  Ms McCaffrey's predecessor mentioned at this committee that some prisoners have passed their release date but the Prison Service knows they have nowhere to go and the service tries to hold them for an extra period, maybe a matter of days, until something gets sorted.  I need to know what arrangements are in place to ensure the Prison Service knows where prisoners who have been released from prisons end up within 24 hours.  If the director general has a system that she believes covers that, her system is not working as well as is documented.  That is all I am telling her.</p></speech>

Of course, the provision of accommodation and services to prisoners once they leave the custody of the prison is no longer a matter for the Prison Service.  However, as I have mentioned, we have significantly invested to ensure the best supports are in place for prisoners when they are released.  We have taken action around a number of areas and have made arrangements with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure that any prisoner who is eligible for a medical card and is in a position to have applied for and received that medical card before he or she leaves prison has a means of payment and to ensure that anybody who is entitled to social welfare benefit and has made that application in prison is in a position to have a means of payment when he or she is released from custody.</p> <p>  We have also made arrangements with local authorities around housing.  There is a person in each local authority with whom we liaise about housing.  As the Deputy has pointed out, there are significant issues of homelessness for prisoners who are coming out of our system and particularly around the provision of accommodation to male offenders.  Often the local authority is only in a position to put in place hostel accommodation on a nightly basis.</p></speech>

There is also a high rate of homelessness in people going into prison.  I have seen figures on that, although offhand I cannot quite remember them.  The figure is something like 14% or 15% of people going into prison go from homelessness.</p><p>There is a commitment under the national Housing First policy for a Housing First project in which prisoners will be considered and funding has been provided for this for 2019.  Some &euro;500,000 has been provided under the Probation Service Vote for that initiative.  The target is for 25 tenancies per annum for three years, amounting to a total of 75.

It is part of the broader Housing First initiative nationally.  In this case, it is dealing with people with a high level of need.  Each tenant will be supported by a multidisciplinary team.  It applies to people with chronic homelessness problems or who are facing a multitude of problems.  Homelessness is usually not an issue in and of itself but is linked to a whole set of other issues.  This is a broader issue for our society, as the committee is well aware.  The Housing First initiative is one strategy that is being adopted nationally and within it, a strand for prisoners is being established.  I accept that it is just a start.</p></speech>

In a few moments, I will invite our guests to make their presentations.  When they have concluded, I will afford members an opportunity to ask questions.  Those making the presentations have been informed of the time limits.  Members asking questions have five minutes on the first round and, if time allows, we can take additional questions.  I ask members and our guests to adhere to the time limits.</p><p>Before asking them to make their presentations, I need to draw our guests attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  If members or witnesses have mobile phones, they should turn them off or place them in flight mode because they interfere with the broadcasting and recording of proceedings.</p><p>I will start with Mr. Rudd or Mr. Fagan, or they can share the time between them, however they wish to do it.  I remind our guests that their opening statements have been circulated to members.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Damien Fagan.  We would like to thank the committee for the invitation to make a presentation and for the public call for us to speak.  We have conducted an investigation into JobPath over the past several years.  The vast majority of citizens who have sought that help have come from all levels of job skills and have worked for years if not decades.  Many examples of this will be found in the victim statement reports supplied.  As outlined in our two separate submissions, due to the EU and International Monetary Fund, IMF, agreement any response to unemployment and long-term unemployment on the part of the State is restricted due to contractual terms which will not be lifted until the full recovery of the funds and interest provided via Ireland's bailout programme.  The figure in that regard currently amounts to &euro;42,000 from each man, woman and child in the country.</p> <p>  The Government and Departments claim that the purpose of JobPath is an approach to unemployment activation which caters mainly for the people who are long-term unemployed - that is, for 12 months - to assist them in securing and sustaining full-time employment or self-employment.  There are, however, other agendas which the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will not explain.  Those are to honour the EU and IMF agreement to reduce long-term unemployed support costs for the Department and to reduce the cost of staff needed to support those who are long-term unemployed and in receipt of payment from the Department.  One should question which takes highest priority.</p> <p>  The full set up of the JobPath programme is outlined in our written submissions.  I refer to the example of Tuesday, 11 February 2014, when Turas Nua, a joint venture between FRS Recruitment and Working Links, was set up.  On Tuesday, 28 October 2014, Seetec Employment and Skills Ireland Designated Activity Company was established.</p><p>As this was happening, both Seetec Business Technology Company Limited and one part of Turas Nua called Working Links were under investigation by the Public Accounts Committee of the British House of Commons over claims the companies were committing fraud and the heavy use of sanctions, as revealed by three whisteblowers.</p><p> Under Irish Water legislation, people's personal data became legally classified as an asset.  In 2017, the judge in the JobPath High Court case determined that the JobPath companies were not by legislation operating a public service.  These two points are very important.  A business that does not operate an official public function is not equally legally covered under the amended Social Welfare Acts of 2005 and 2006 or accountable to the Ombudsman.  Therefore, the companies have no legal right to demand people's private details.  When members of the public try to regain their legal right over their personal data, their legal asset, they are accused of not engaging.  They are trying to hold on to something they own - their personal data - however, others are demanding these data, often with menaces.  </p><p> People are told they have been randomly selected for JobPath.  This is possibly wrong.  The 2013 JobPath tender exposes that citizens are silently targeted through a probability of exit, PEX, State assessment process.  The State has put this on record, as members will see in the 150-page report on JobPath from United People.  It is at this stage of the JobPath programme that the person's data are transferred to companies without the consent of the person to whom the data refer.  Under the GDPR, the State has further become a data processor under JobPath, not just a data storage entity.  The importance of this is also not explained to newly enrolled citizens.  The adviser, who is a private company employee, begins asking questions about the person.  The answers are to be saved to a server.  Again, this is legally important.  This data help make up a personal progress plan, PPP.  Clients are not informed that they are now giving away a legal asset they own.  This a form of legal possession consent given away by a citizen who has deliberately been kept in the dark.  </p><p> The personal progress plan is defined on page 137 of the 2013 JobPath tender document.  It states that the plan is developed by the personal adviser with the client and the aim is to provide a clear route for the client to re-enter employment.  Information that is required to develop a PPP can be found on page 23 in the section on JobPath services.  The progression plan given by the private companies is a general power of attorney contract.  Clients are not informed of this legal aspect.  A general power of attorney contract is defined by the Department's publication on self-guiding one's money - general power of attorney - which has been provided.  The contractual terms for this general power of attorney are the following: failure to comply with the company's job search conditions and targets may lead to sanctions; full access to all appointment records from past and future employers of that person; and failure to provide personal information regarding that person and close family members, including financial circumstances, may lead to prosecution.  These contractual terms are not defined and are not even a requirement of the creation of the PPP in the 2013 JobPath tender document.  </p><p> The greatest frustration with the privatisation of public services for companies seeking profit is that when such privatisation occurs, the needs of the people are overlooked in favour of the wishes of the companies operating such services.  A number of victims' statements today will bear this out.  The two private companies - Seetec and Turas Nua - are contracted to deliver JobPath based on their skills, abilities, experience and contacts.  Since the beginning, both Seetec and Turas Nua have further subcontracted the JobPath programme out to additional companies.  Seetec subcontracted to People First and Turas Nua subcontracted to Working Links.  All of these companies are operating today.  </p><p> Private companies operate a business practice which regards the use of sanctions on the public using public services to be the most effective method of saving.  This practice was adopted from a previous UK model, the Irish Water model and the incoming waste management legislation.  The document outlines the JobPath protocols placed not only on members of the public but also on the staff who are to enforce these protocols.  In an additional request for tenders, instructions are provided on how to get the application of sanctions applied to a person.  Translated, this means the word of the companies is taken over the word of citizens who are referred for sanctions.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service report from 2015 highlights this problem.</p><p> The Department has stated that in designing the JobPath programme, safeguards were put in place to prevent malpractice.  What safeguards exist?  There are no safeguards to prevent the companies from enforcing unmeetable targets or meetings on the person to justify referral for sanctions.  The worst aspect of the absence of safeguards is that when the referral for sanction is made, the Department does not carry out any investigation into the grounds for that referral.  When a meeting is called, it is conducted in the manner of a disciplinary procedure instead of a grievance.  In the document and visual presentation, we expand on this issue.  The appeals office does not provide any safeguards against further sanctions.  Another safeguard that was meant to be in place has failed as the committee will discover in the submission from Damien Fagan.</p><p> One of the fundamental flaws is a creative loophole that allows the Department to override the natural flow of justice, as defined in the Constitution.  This is outlined in detail in the documents provided by Mr. Fagan and me.  This loophole in the Social Welfare Act allows the Department and companies to operate a system based on the principle of guilty until proven innocent.  The operation of such a system is unlawful and unconstitutional and breaks international law and human rights treaties signed by Ireland.  It is the belief of Irish citizens that a person is entitled to a fair hearing.  The Social Welfare Act, in official interpretation and subsequent action, contradicts this.  </p><p> By signing a PPP, the private companies profit by &euro;557 per signature.  A total of &euro;60 million has been paid for signatures alone, with no service provided to clients.  According to Chapter 12 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2017 report, between July 2015 and the end of December 2017, the JobPath programme cost &euro;83.8 million.  This breaks down to &euro;15 million for PPP signatures and &euro;32 million in job sustaining fees.  The figure of &euro;50 million for registration fees is made up of just one type of payment, which is received through the signing of a PPP with no services provided.  This payment is only meant to account for between 10% and 15% of the overall JobPath cost.  The &euro;32 million in JobPath sustaining fees is made up of four payments for supports given to people in employment for 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks, respectively.  Translated, this means that the Department has spent more money on companies doing nothing in a single payment than on four separate payments combined for actual services they are meant to be providing for people.  Therefore, the argument has to be made on behalf of the Irish taxpayer that if it is costing &euro;32.9 million to support the person into sustained employment, why are we spending more than &euro;15 million on signatures alone?  </p><p> The operation of JobPath indicates that substantial fraudulent behaviour is occurring on a regular basis with the full knowledge and encouragement of the Department.  The programme is meant to be for 30 hours of employment per week.  The companies are only required to assist for 30 hours over four weeks.  This allows the company to retain the citizen and receive taxpayer payments for him or her and the citizen can be referred back to the programme.  The document provided features a variety of victims' statements regarding this practice.  The use of sanctions is a method of saving.  It is being used to repay Ireland's bailout programme.  With regard to sanctions, the money is transferred back into central funding where the Minister for Finance has already used central funding to lower Ireland's bank bailout costs.  It is fair to ask whether the contractual terms of the bailout programme are not just terms to agree and honour but are another method of having taxpayers repay the debt.  </p><p> The JobPath companies contracted by the Department have been hiring referred clients for JobPath staff.  For this, the companies receive all JobPath payments as each company is required to shoulder the cost of its staffing for the JobPath programme.  Doing so permits additional bonus payments to be made.  This is a breach of the JobPath tender contract.  Translated, it means the companies are gaining two separate taxpayer payments for each staff position.  This permits them to control the number of payments they receive for each staff job.  This issue is referred to in the United People JobPath 2019 report.</p><p> Another issue is that unemployed people are sent a letter stating they are invited to attend JobPath while the real message at the bottom of the letter is effectively that they must turn up or else suffer financially.  Translated, this means that people are allegedly being press ganged as a result of financial threats from the State.  Many of the victims' statements bear out this view.  At the initial meeting, people are instructed to sign the PPP.  They are not told at any point that they have the legal right to decline a request to sign a PPP.  There are two main criminal offences committed by JobPath companies that occur in respect of a person's legal right not to enter into a private contract.</p><p>Where a person is forced into a private contract under any form of threat or sanction it is a criminal offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.   Where a person is coerced and sanctioned it is a criminal offence under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  This has been proved to the court's satisfaction in Damien Fagan's High Court case.  We speak for many who do not have a voice and who have allegedly been the targets of bullying, coercion, intimidation, financial starvation and more by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the rash say of companies.  A case in point is Gerry Tobin and we have included the details in the report we have supplied.</p><p> Additionally, people are told to apply for any job and, in many cases, it does not matter whether they are suited for the job or not.  They are ordered to apply and if they do not do so, more threats are issued via the private companies.  State services are supposed to work with citizens on their day-to-day requirements, including family schedules and health conditions.  In reality, the opposite occurs in JobPath.  Too many times, people have been sanctioned or cut off for having the cheek to go to hospital or drop their children to school first.  Subsequently, they have been unable to make very poorly assigned appointment times.</p><p> As JobPath has continued, hundreds of people, and possibly thousands, have allegedly found themselves abused and shouted out, had their children shouted at and made to feel inadequate and treated as if they were second-class citizens to kick about.  They have been treated harmfully, allegedly with assaults and sexual harassment, their personal data abused and illegally deprived of money that has left them hungry and perhaps homeless and at the mercy of others and more.  Committee members will find examples of all of this in the documentation I have supplied.  In some cases, people have tried to kill themselves on JobPath property.  They have cracked from the physical and mental abuse they have allegedly suffered so the two companies and their additional funds can make massive private profits.  This is a simple scratching of the JobPath surface.  If the committee delves deeper, it will find far more shocking issues.  This is nothing worse of ongoing mass State-sanctioned abuse.</p><p> With regard to why speaking up about JobPath is important and why an investigation should take place, the State is knowingly and unknowingly, openly and covertly, allegedly abusing human rights, law breaking at a national and international level while further undermining the present and future rights of all those employed and unemployed carers, parents and individuals.  JobPath exposes inherent flaws in the departmental systems that allow this to happen.  In reality, private businesses are further profiting while a nation of citizens loses quality of life rights to self-determination.  We have spoken to victims of JobPath from all walks of life.  We have heard their pain and seen their distress and financial hardships due to JobPath.  Many have had mental breakdowns.  Some have ended up spiralling into depression, which has resulted in legal and illegal drug taking.  We have supplied victim statements on this.  As they have explained their current situation they have cried and, to be brutally honest, I have cried with them.  JobPath encroaches on the rights of every citizen in Ireland.  We say without a shadow of a doubt that in the vast majority of cases, JobPath is not of benefit to citizens.  However, it is a future inquiry in the making and a drain on taxpayers' money.</p><p> For the past few years, as our investigation has continued, our families have had the patience of saints but they all completely understand why we persist in helping the many citizens who have been wronged.  It is the duty of every citizen in Ireland not only to hold those who have been elected accountable but also to hold accountable the Departments and programmes they oversee.  How can we do anything less?  I thank the committee for allowing us to come before it today.  We look forward to any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I am the chair of the Adult Education Guidance Association of Ireland, AEGAI.  I work in the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board as a co-ordinator of guidance.  I deliver guidance in the Bray area and I co-ordinate the service throughout Wicklow.  Today, I am representing the 37 services that work in the 16 education and training boards.  I am here to promote and advocate on our behalf because prior to JobPath coming along, we saw ourselves as the organisation that should have been doing the job that JobPath is now doing.</p> <p>  The adult education guidance services, AEGS, were established in 2000 in response to a White Paper from the Department of Education and Skills entitled Learning for Life.  Adult guidance was recognised in the White Paper as the linchpin in the lifelong learning model, enabling adults to make educational, work and life transitions in a fast-moving technology based, globalised society.  Guidance counsellors in the adult education guidance services are professionally qualified to postgraduate level in guidance, as set out in the Department of Education and Skills course recognition framework document of 2016.  The services provide a full-time, year round, objective, professional, quality-assured guidance and information service.  They provide guidance at pre-entry, entry, ongoing, pre-exit and follow&ndash;up stages for those engaged in adult education and training.  The service is underpinned by a number of principles.  These are being learner and client centred, confidentiality, impartiality, equal opportunities, accessibility, transparency and empowerment.  These come directly from Learning for Life, from which we were instigated and received our legal framework.</p> <p>  The AEGS model is informed by national and EU guidelines for guidance provision.  EU policy in the Lisbon Agenda identifies lifelong guidance as central to a successful dynamic knowledge-based economy, viewing it as an effective conduit between education and sustainable employment while promoting social inclusion.  This is also written into the national skills strategy to 2025.</p> <p>  We were very excited when the SOLAS further education and training strategy was launched in 2014.  Under section 10 of the strategy, the adult education guidance services were recognised by SOLAS and the Department of Education and Skills as the model for delivery of educational and career guidance to adults in Ireland.  The roll-out of the SOLAS further education and training strategy underlines the need for guidance and the centrality of guidance in the Government's job strategy.  The further education and training strategy recognises that the planning process must consider and identify how the needs of the learner, employer and community are met and how effective guidance services can ensure a return on taxpayers' investment.  I am aware the committee is also examining the issue of quality of service.</p> <p>  As stated in the SOLAS further education and training strategy, the adult education guidance services enable individuals and, therefore, communities to achieve their developmental, personal, social, career and employment aspirations.  Guidance facilitates the acquisition of career management skills and benefits employees throughout their working life.  The adult education guidance services provide a professional, impartial and confidential service to all those who are over 16 and out of school up to post-retirement age.  We work closely with second level colleagues.  I will not take a second level student who has a guidance counsellor but if someone of that age has dropped out of school, and unfortunately some do, we recommend them to YouthReach and sometimes we place them in part-time programmes for adults.  This is not always suitable but we work with them to ensure we can get them back into education.</p> <p>  Through our referral protocol with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has been in place since 2012, and our links with local State and voluntary agencies, including local community mental health agencies, enterprise partnerships, enterprise boards, regional skills fora, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, citizens information centres and all social inclusion programmes, we meet more than 52,000 clients on an annual basis, supporting them in education, training and employment.  We can evidence this work through our national client database, which shows the outcomes, including the acquisition of new skills, increased certification and progression in career development, all of which enhance the likelihood of long-term unemployed individuals eventually performing more highly-skilled jobs in the workplace.  Every year, our statistics are detailed in the National Centre for Guidance Education's adult guidance report.  Before the moratorium and austerity measures, we met more than 68,000 people because we had full staffing.  We were deeply affected during the moratorium.  The problem was that JobPath was ruled out.  If we had received investment at that time, the employment statistics would be much better.</p> <p>  According to A Strategic Review of Further Education and Training and the Unemployed by Professor John Sweeney, which was published in 2013, effective guidance services help ensure a return to the taxpayer from the use of public funds.  Professor Sweeney analysed our service with regard to it being the one that should have been linked to the further education and training strategy.</p> <p>  The Adult Education Guidance Association of Ireland supports the development of an integrated further education and training guidance service, as envisaged in the SOLAS further education and training strategy, building on the practice in operation in our service.</p><p>Currently, because of the lack of a coherent, joined-up approach to guidance there is a fragmentation in the way guidance services are being delivered which is wasteful of taxpayers' money.  In our recent submission to the career guidance review carried out by the Department of Education and Skills and Indecon, we recommended an interdepartmental framework for adult guidance.  An overarching body should be established representing all stakeholders in guidance, that is, the Departments of Education and Skills, Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Employment and Social Protection, Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, SOLAS, the National Centre for Guidance in Education, NCGE, and other organisations.  I refer also to IBEC, which is a fantastic organisation.  We have met with its officials.  We accepted much of what was in the report it published in September as part of its Smarter World, Smarter Work campaign.  I understand the Indecon report, which has not been published, agrees with this.  If committee members have any influence at all, I call on them to please get that report published for us.  It was carried out in June and was to be out in September.  I know that with the schools issue, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, had a lot on his plate when he took up the role.  However, we want to see that review because we think it can change the way things are being done with regard to this model. </p><p> I wish to compare our service with the JobPath model.  That model was based on the model being used by the G4S recruitment company in the UK, which was criticised by the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, Ofsted.  It was poor practice to transfer this model and some of its workforce from the UK to Ireland without making any changes or adaptions for working with the Irish public.  We have no difficulty with recruitment agencies as a model of accessing employment, but to use these services, people must be highly skilled and workplace-ready.  I hate this phrase, but I am going to use it because it is used by the Department; people with a level 1 rating of probability of exit from the live register, PEX 1, can use a recruitment agency.  The committee members or I, if we were made redundant tomorrow and got going immediately - before we knew we had been made redundant, actually - would probably be able to use a recruitment agency and get into a job.  However, I have met top bankers with top qualifications seeking work.  Before JobPath was rolled out, we met every unemployed man and woman in my community and throughout the country between 2011 and 2015.  After three months of trying to get a job, even if an applicant has held a highly paid job in Accenture or any of the large businesses or public agencies I could mention, he or she becomes very low.  A person who keeps getting rejections in his or her inbox or postbox goes flat.  I have seen it so many times. The recruitment-style model is not a guidance model.  It can work for a well-educated person who is ready for work.  We use this model for those people.  My own son is one of those emigrants to Australia; he is working successfully in recruitment.  I have nothing against it.  Members have better access than I do to the statistics on the effectiveness of the JobPath programme.</p><p> According to personal client testimony, to be referred to Turas Nua is to be placed in a vulnerable position and denied access to further education and training.  I use the example of Turas Nua because I work with that company, but the same applies to Seetec.  There appears to have been a lack of recognition by Turas Nua and Seetec of the trauma undergone by people at a major crossroads in their lives.  This is in addition to a lack of understanding of people's need to manage challenging barriers regarding childcare, transport, disability, illness, bereavement, addiction and mental health issues post-redundancy and financial stress.  The forced march pattern of this recruitment model has been unsuccessful, with only 9% of participants securing longer-term employment.  Those are the results for just one year.  Many of my clients have dropped out at the end of a year. </p><p> I will direct the committee to the example I gave.  One example of inappropriate Turas Nua work was when a case officer from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection made a referral to my service of a 62-year-old man who had left school at ten years of age and had been out of work for 20 years.  He was receiving jobseeker's allowance after exiting another service.  He suffered from anxiety and his only outing was to walk to his mother's grave in darkness.  His basic skills led me to recommend a part-time literacy, communications, computers and woodworking workshop in our local adult education centre.  He agreed to engage with the programme and I put counselling skills and other supports to deal with his anxiety issues in place.  Following six weeks of the programme he was called by Turas Nua and removed from this education programme.  Two weeks later, he came to me in an agitated state.  I can recall it so clearly.  He asked me to make a CV, as he had been ordered to return to Turas Nua by the end of the week with evidence of having submitted 15 job applications.  In this three-week period, while he was engaging with Turas Nua, three different agency advisers contacted me looking for a copy of his CV.  One of them had spelled the person's name wrongly.  Some of the people who were hired by this organisation did not have the skills to deal with the type of person they were dealing with, which is difficult.</p><p> Our client did a full year with Turas Nua without getting any work.  We recently learned that he has been returned to the agency and he will be with them until September 2019.  Currently, he is not engaged in any education, training or employment but is required to attend on a monthly basis, when he has a chat with a very nice gentleman.  I now have a better relationship with the people in Turas Nua because they are putting clients onto our programmes.  However, we have to do double the work.  I have to get in touch with Turas Nua, I have to get in touch with the Department and I have to get the file sent.  It then takes six to eight weeks.  The clients have lost as much as three months with Turas Nua.  It is a duplication and a waste of time and bureaucracy.  </p><p> Our own case study is in the NCGE database.  I will not go through it, but members can see that the model we are working by was very successful.  Following on from the Turas Nua case study, it is clear that the one-size-fits-all approach taken by the agency does not deal with the individual circumstances and displays no long-term strategy towards career development, confidence-building and educational qualifications, without which there is limited access to sustainable employment.  Over a period of time our professional approach leads to better outcomes.  In our experience, particularly for those with very basic skills, the minimum term required to gain new skills is one to two years attending further education or training ranked on levels 3 to 5 by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, or accessing a traineeship or apprenticeship.  The new traineeships are great.  A longer time would be required if a client wants to gain a degree or a higher level of education.  Once in employment people can continue their education through part-time options like Springboard+, evening training courses and on-the-job training, where provided.</p><p> One wonders how the JobPath approach and outcomes can be validated.  It is difficult to understand how the approach, with its narrow objectives focused only on employment, fits into the national skills strategy.  It does not align with the broader need for upskilling and social inclusion and the goals of the Ireland&rsquo;s National Skills Strategy 2025 for people across Ireland.  As stated on page 17 of the strategy, the Government's objectives in support of its vision include the following: "Education and training providers will place a stronger focus on providing skills development opportunities that are relevant to the needs of learners, society and the economy ... The quality of teaching and learning at all stages of education will be continually enhanced and evaluated ... There will be a specific focus on active inclusion to support participation in education and training and the labour market."</p><p> Our model includes an integrated information officer, a guidance counsellor, that is, myself, and our CV and interview skills service which is second to none.  In the example I gave, the service met a woman who was made redundant, had lost confidence and was out of work back into a job.  She is working happily in administration.  </p><p> We are working closely with employers now.  Recently an employer was looking to take on somebody with good administration and communication skills.  I called four of our previous clients in the past three months.  Based on our CV and interview skills work, three of them had secured positions.  This was because I was looking at people who were ready for work.  One was in Accenture, a  good company, another in an Irish university and a third in a good local company in my community in Bray.  We can evidence this in our database. </p><p> Since its establishment in 2000, the Adult Education Guidance Association, AEGS, has been the service charged to work with those who were unemployed and marginalised so that they can avail of education and access opportunities to obtain sustainable employment and facilitate social cohesion.  This objective was further developed in 2012 by the protocol for referral from Intreo case officers to our service.  We have a fantastic relationship with case officers at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  They cannot say this, but they would do anything to avoid the person they are serving having to go back to Turas Nua or Seetec.  They want those people to get an opportunity for education, and we work well with them when they come to us in the initial phase.</p><p>We work extremely well with them when they come to us in the initial phase.</p><p> Furthermore, we note the recent debate about the service delivery model of JobPath, which has been awarded a budget of &euro;140 million since 2015.  Just 9% of participants have progressed into full-time employment.  According to the document from which I am reading, some 11,000 participants who previously used Turas Nua are, like my client, returning for a second year of participation.  However, I believe that figure may be wrong.  Deputy Brady will correct me if it is.  In the same four-year period between 2015 and 2018, our services met with and progressed more than 208,000 beneficiaries on an annual budget of just &euro;6.5 million, with a cost to the State of &euro;125 per beneficiary.  I assure the committee that our services are not looking for more money for ourselves or anything like that.  We want the committee to support an increase in our service.  We want our service to be rolled out as the service that replaces the JobPath model.  We were chosen to be the replacement in the Government's SOLAS further education and training strategy.  It is crucial to mention that we provide a service to all unemployed individuals, including those not entitled to social welfare payments, the low-skilled employed, those on zero-hour contracts, the underemployed, those facing redundancy, early school leavers and those who have left college without securing employment.  Unfortunately, many high-skilled people are now underemployed.</p><p> The AEGS would also like to raise the demand for progression for clients accessing education and training by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This can be counterproductive when jobs are changing so rapidly and qualifications are outdated.  Any of us in this room could leave work tomorrow or be made redundant.  I know that my IT skills would have to be significantly updated.  I would be afraid to go for a job, even if I had many other qualifications for it, because of this weakness.  I am sure there are people in this room who will need opportunities when they leave this room today.  If one needed a level 6 qualification in supervisory management, the Department would not allow one to pursue such a qualification because it requires progress to be made.</p></speech>

I will move on.  One of the key things I want to say is that the JobPath project involves the displacement of public services.  It also involves duplication.  For that reason, I would like to come back to the value for money exercise.  We hope and believe our service can deliver that.  A key component of our work involves helping the long-term unemployed.  Professor Tony Watts of Cambridge University has highlighted that the career guidance counselling process focuses not only on finding jobs for people, but also on supporting people to become resilient and to construct their own career journeys.  We are hopeful that the guidance review will be published soon and will ensure a national lifelong career guidance strategy will be rolled out to ensure coherent career guidance provision is provided for all individuals at all life stages.

I am joined by Dr. Aisling Tuite, an Irish Research Council post-doctoral researcher who is working on the Waterford unemployment research collaborative project at WIT  Since 2012, we have interviewed 121 unemployed individuals as part of our aspiration to capture the experience of unemployment.  Our work over seven years has captured the considerable transformation of welfare services under the Pathways to Work policy initiative.  Since 2014, in our data we can clearly see a significant shift towards a less supportive, more conditional, less empathetic and more pressurising welfare system in which the threat of sanctions is ever-present.  The individuals who are subject to this system are forced to perform as directed by Intreo case officers or JobPath providers, often against their better judgment and usually without any positive outcome for themselves.<br/><br/>Since 2016, many jobseekers have distinguished between their experience in Intreo offices and their experience after being referred to JobPath.  They feel that the pressure on them intensified distinctly after this referral.  They moved from a bureaucratic system which could be unsympathetic and was often given to autocratic direction and demands to a system that actively and capriciously patronises, cajoles, threatens, manipulates and, at times, bullies them.  Many of them believe this service represents a deliberate attempt by the State to lower their expectations of work in terms of their reservation wage and an interference in their family and caring responsibilities.  They believe that long-term concerns for career development and life balance are notably absent among JobPath providers.  They consider that while welfare services may be intended to support re-entry into work, many aspects of various schemes compound the negative experience of unemployment.<br/><br/>In our research, we encountered 25 individuals who reported direct personal experiences with JobPath, largely through Turas Nua.  We did not seek positive or negative experiences.  Instead, we looked for authentic accounts of the contemporary experience of unemployment.  We encountered reflections on the service that are very different from those in the evaluations of the Department and of JobPath providers.  All 25 interviewees recalled being forced to undertake futile bureaucratic routines, such as mandated and monitored job search activity.  For example, they were watched over while they sat at a computer for a number of hours to ensure they did Internet searches for jobs.  When they had their CVs rewritten for them, they considered that their CVs were massaged to orient them towards existing job interviews without reference to long-term career development, personal circumstances or responsibilities.  All of the people to whom we spoke reported that they were forced to undertake coaching, personal effectiveness and confidence training that was delivered largely by unqualified and inexperienced trainers and served to undermine their confidence and sense of self-worth.  They were asked over and over again to provide proof of job searches, under suspicion of duplicity.  They felt intimidated over technical or minor infractions of the Byzantine rules of these schemes.  They were often required to accept employment that they considered incompatible with their career ambitions or family responsibilities.<br/><br/>I would like to provide some specific examples.  More detailed cases are set out in our submission.  We encountered a woman who was sanctioned and ended up relying on a food bank and on high-interest debt.  We encountered a Traveller who, despite a decade of full-time schooling, left the education system with low levels of literacy.  He was enrolled in mandated training that required high levels of literacy.  He had his name amended on his CV against his wishes to conceal his ethnicity when searching for a job.  We encountered an aspiring architect with carefully husbanded career ambitions who found that her job search was micromanaged in a way that undermined her carefully laid plan to develop a reputation with local employers.  She was directed to reduce her expectations and accept other types of work.  We also encountered a pregnant woman was directed, under threat of sanction, to accept work at a call centre in a location some distance away which she had absolutely no means of getting to.  There was no public transport.  She was advised to make friends with people so that she could car-share, car-pool or something.<br/><br/>We should emphasise that all respondents gave details of the continual threat of sanctions, which had the effect of making it appear that it was compulsory to engage and comply with the various tasks they were encouraged to undertake.  Our data demonstrate that beyond the application of sanctions, the process of activation under threat of sanction is in and of itself a negative experience.  The process is a punishment.  Our qualitative data is commensurate with international experiences.  If we compare the percentage of individuals sanctioned against international benchmarks, we will find that JobPath is not a harsh sanctioning regime.  However, we know that the ever-present threat of sanctions has negative long-term consequences for the well-being and future earnings of individuals.  Officially, sanctioning decisions are made only by the Intreo office but the experience of jobseekers is that in practice, a recommendation of sanction by a JobPath provider appears to be a <i>fait accompli</i>.  When we spoke to counter staff and case officers in welfare offices as part of prior research, JobPath providers were described as making decisions on sanctions, with Intreo simply implementing them.  In our interview data, we did not encounter any positive experience that we could report to the committee today.</p><p>My colleague, Dr. Boland, will detail our policy evaluation of JobPath.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.1611" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Boland" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019011700002#J00200"><p>Our interviewees experience of JobPath is that it is a scheme that actively undermines their personal reservation wage and labour market expectations so that they will accept any job however unsustainable, unsuitable and precarious.  It is inspired by behavioural economics and the idea of subtle nudges.  JobPath assumes that the problem of unemployment is idleness and that a work-first approach will ultimately lead to sustainable, high-quality employment.  In practice, these measures constituted a stressful and unwelcome intervention in people's lives and was even described as traumatic in some cases.</p> <p>  All of these interventions are made under the threat of sanction for non-compliance.  This pressurises jobseekers to find any work.  That may explain why 25% of people commence work but only 9% are still employed after 52 weeks, which is the same percentage as if participants had not gone through the process.  International research has begun to re-evaluate the maxims that any job is better than none, and that work is always the quickest route out of poverty, which is not the case.</p> <p>  Many of the JobPath interventions were already emerging under Intreo and were part of the traditional local employment service that supports the unemployed.  What is distinctive here is that they have intensified and become aggressive, and more punitive, under JobPath.  This is due to the pay-by-results model or the recruitment of staff on short-term contracts without necessarily having professional careers in the welfare system, as per guidance supplied by Education and Training Boards Ireland.</p> <p>  Given what JobPath aspires to do, the contract has an unfeasibly short horizon that does not facilitate the building of durable institutional resources on the awardees part.  If Ireland has a perpetual need for the complex and highly-contextual pastoral skills of nurturing disaffected jobseekers back into the labour market, it takes time to build such a capacity and, if done correctly, can be valuable.  However, a four-year contract is an unsuitable instrument for this activity.</p> <p>  I shall talk about the so-called "creaming and dumping".  Our interviewees mostly reported being acutely aware from their experience of JobPath of the so-called payments by results model that drives the initiative, and so they all had a realistic understanding of their own personal labour markets.  They actively encouraged and supported their JobPath caseworker in "creaming and dumping" but tended to grow frustrated when asked to do things that they perceived to be harmful to their career prospects or responsibilities.  In effect, they tried to negotiate the "creaming and dumping" that they knew to be going on.</p> <p>  It is worth noting that there is a very significant inconsistency in the geographical distribution of sanctions.  The distribution does not correspond to the level of population of the unemployed and ranges from an 8% sanction rate in Louth or Limerick to almost 0% in Mayo.  This inexplicable variation is consistent with our long-held view derived from research that there is a significant variation in how rules and eligibility are applied and interpreted office by office, day by day and welfare officer by welfare officer.  The thicket of schemes and their constant reform, adjustment and modification make the rights of a service user unclear and contingent on both user and front-line staff.</p> <p>  In conclusion, activation in the form of human capital building and supported job search can have long-term positive effects on the supply side of the labour market.  We suggest that investing in training and the back-to-education scheme are the best tools for doing so. </p> <p>  Policies that emphasise welfare conditionality and sanctions are short sighted.  They require  compliance under threat of being put below the minimum level of income and this mainly has negative consequences.  There is significant international research on the consequences of sanctioning from short-term poverty to long-term health, and negative future effects on earnings and employment.  The knock-on effects on the economy are to foster precarious, low-wage or no-wage cycles and alienate those who are already most disadvantaged, and to unfairly pressurise those who are temporarily out of work.  Rather than using the stick and carrot approach we suggest removing the threat of sanctions as a core administrative tool because the benefits of an education opportunity or a job should be sufficient motivation in themselves.  Sanctions may have some part to play in the benefits system but their current role is out of all proportion and against the principles of natural justice.  Clearly, sanctions should be subject to stronger regulation and oversight, and we have recommended stronger and more specific measures elsewhere in our previous research and submissions.</p> <p>  In terms of JobPath, the payment-by-results and short-term orientation of the JobPath contract are unsuitable policy instruments.  The power that providers wield over the unemployed is neither appropriate nor commensurate with the vulnerability of this population.  The "work first" approach involves market coaxing, which involves reducing the choices and expectations of jobseekers, reduces public faith in the social safety net and undermines the entire labour market.</p> <p>  The impact of JobPath on individual lives is decidedly negative even when sanctions were not imposed.  We envisage a long-term impact on overall social cohesion for these policies as a result of the experience and throughput of so many citizens through these initiatives.  We suggest that the committee should advise strongly against renewing JobPath and that we need to learn lessons from this expensive, costly at the point of use and broadly ineffective misadventure because we must seek to build a high-quality labour market welfare policy.</p></speech>

I shall ask them general questions about their research before handing over to committee members.</p> <p>  I am not wearing my glasses so I cannot read the figures but I think they said that their research, since 2012, involved interviews with 121 unemployed people of whom 25 subsequently had experience or contact with JobPath.  How valid is it to compare their findings with a national programme that involved thousands of people?  Is a sample pool of 25 people appropriate for making broader findings?  Is the sample pool representative in terms of age, gender and geographic location?  I am not criticising the research and ask my questions in order that this committee can understand the profile.  The research referred to 25 people, and their experiences were recorded in great detailed.  In terms of their age, profile, gender, education and geographic location, how can one apply that information and make comments and recommendations on a national programme?  The information would help the committee.</p></speech>

Each unemployed person is radically different and has his or her own life course.  There is no coherent system for administering unemployment in social welfare offices.  For example, the sanctioning rate in Wexford is 8% but in Waterford it is close to 1%.  Even in very narrow geographic spaces one finds a huge experience.  It incorporates people who have very vulnerable lives, people who have had very difficult lives and people who are transitioning from one job to another.  The way we administer unemployment is called unemployment but the experience of it is another matter.</p> <p>  To clarify, we have conducted 121 interviews since 2012.  We specifically do a tranche of people every second year.  The 25 people that we encountered are the ones who naturally and specifically referenced JobPath as we interviewed them and they relayed their experience.  It is a random sample.  What is very interesting is that each one has consistently reported a negative experience.  In the data set from 2012 to 2015 there was a much wider account of the experience of unemployment.  Since then the situation has become more consistent.  Instead of looking to themselves as not getting a job for personal reasons, people now rate their experience of unemployment as being a negative experience that is being administered to them by the State.</p></speech>

They reflected many of the issues not just in respect of JobPath but also those raised in the wider report prepared by this committee on unemployment.  One of the key issues is the appropriateness of placing in terms of quality and the importance of linking to a work-first approach versus an education, training or route-forward approach.  I ask our guests to elaborate on that because we found, even from those who had produced initial reports that talked about work first or the different outcomes, that education had not led to immediate employment options but did lead to better prospects down the line.  Where training is seen as not giving the right options, it is sometimes because it is not appropriate training.  I ask our guests to elaborate further on the work-first issue.  It was interesting to hear that in some cases this has damaged people's employment prospects and their career.  As was described in one of the examples, if people are in a small town where there is a limited number of employers and are forced to look for inappropriate jobs, they are marking themselves down the line.  The issue of reskilling is also important here.</p> <p>  The threat of sanctions is another issue.  We are often told that sanctions are not really being applied at a high level, although the figures show that their application is increasing significantly.  The threat of sanctions, however, can damage proper supported engagement.  The issue of decision and implementation was also interesting.  There seems be a lack of questioning of recommendations for potential sanction that come from Turas Nua or Seetec.  That was elaborated upon by Mr. Rudd and Mr. Fagan.  I ask them to talk a little bit more about that.  What is the pattern or the process?  We have been told that Turas Nua and Seetec have no role in sanctioning but it seems that they direct it.</p> <p>  Our guests referred to the damage to overall social cohesion.  Mr. Boland, Mr. Griffin and Ms Greene spoke in a positive way and stated that when individuals are getting appropriate supports, it benefits not just them but the entire community.  That is the flip side of the vision.  I thank those to whom I refer for their presentation because I had not been aware of the extent of the work involved.  It showed where we could be in terms of supporting individuals.  It also highlights the ancillary benefits of recognising people as humans because in doing that, we are supporting their families too.  I would imagine that the stress of being forced into inappropriate work under threat of sanction means that rather than employment being a positive experience in the wider family context, it creates a ripple effect.</p> <p>  I have a technical question for Ms. Greene.  She mentioned that she works with all unemployed persons.  I am interested in qualified adults, those who are not on the live register and those who may only be available on a part-time basis.  Intreo has not really been able to accommodate such people as much as it should.  Perhaps JobPath is more appropriate and I ask our guests to speak to that issue.  There were several references to care responsibilities.  In some cases, that might result in part-time availability but, in others, it might mean that people are not available to do shift work, for example, or that they would need a very predictable schedule.  I ask our guests to talk more about the issue of family responsibilities.  It may be the case that people are available for 40 hours per week but that they need predictability.</p> <p>  I am very interested in what Mr. Rudd and Mr. Fagan had to say about power of attorney in the context of personal progression plans, a matter I will investigate further.  I have previously submitted amendments, unsuccessfully, to social welfare legislation in the context of such plans.  I have concerns about them but our guests have raised a different and new concern that I will look into.</p></speech>

It is always interesting to get an outside view through a different lens.  I have looked at this matter comprehensively in recent years and have heard all of the stories which have, unfortunately, been dismissed by two Ministers.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Social Protection, dismissed them and the current Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has also dismissed them.</p> <p>  Today's presentations, based on interviews with participants, shows that many identified JobPath as the State deliberately attempting to lower people's expectations of work.  When the then Minister for Social Protection, now the Taoiseach, came before this committee previously, he let the mask slip when questioned on JobPath.  He said that people need to give up their idea of a dream job.  We are talking here about people with qualifications, including teachers who are engaged in part time employment because of the nature of contracts or doing substitute work and so on.  That is the ideology that is driving this and that is coming through from people participating in JobPath and also from Ministers.</p> <p>  Ms Greene made some interesting observations about the people with whom she engaged, including a 62 year old man who had left school at the age of ten and who had been unemployed for 20 years.  He engaged with the services, not in the context of the narrow employment-only focus or objective but in terms of a skill set that was identified to suit him.  It was interesting that JobPath was able to take that person who was engaging, in terms of doing woodwork, ICT courses and learning other skills that were needed to get him back into the workforce, out of that setting.  He is one of the 15,000 people who have been called back up to engage with the programme a second time.  Is that a common occurrence?  How does that come about?  It is absolutely appalling.</p> <p>  Our guests referred to people being referred to JobPath and then being referred from JobPath back to the adult guidance service and how that comes about.  It was interesting to hear their analysis in terms of duplication and so forth.  I ask them to elaborate further on that.  We have heard evidence from other groups on these issues.  I have engaged with the local employment service, which does phenomenal work across the State.  Its representatives have told me that if that service had been given additional resources, it would have been able to expand and take on the work now being done by the private companies, Turas Nua and Seetec.  Since the introduction of JobPath, the number of people being referred to the local employment service has gone down, year on year, because more people are going into the privatised setting.  Do our guests have any figures in that regard?  Could Ms Greene supply figures in respect of the people who were referred to her service between 2016 and 2018?  Has there been a decrease in the numbers being referred to her since JobPath began?</p><p> The Chairman will allow questions first and then allow the delegates to respond.  How does the adult guidance service differ?  What occurs when someone engages with Ms Greene?  We know what individuals have to do when they go to JobPath.  As we know from the evidence given by Mr. Rudd and others, at the best of times they have to go at times that do not suit them.  When an individual engages with the service, are there regular meetings?  Is there a weekly meeting?  We are aware no sanctions are imposed on individuals.</p></speech>

We know the contract for JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec is due to expire this year.  I have been calling for it to be cut right now.  That needs to happen.  What would the witnesses like to see happen in the here and now, if the Minister is not prepared to curtail the contract?  Would the adult guidance service be in a position to meet the demand at that point?</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for some of the other witnesses.  I ask for the Chairman's indulgence because this is an important area.  I was taken by the evidence given by both witnesses.  Mr. Rudd gave a figure on signing the PPPs, amounting to &euro;557.70.  At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts prior to Christmas, we heard for the first time evidence indicating the actual costs and expenditure.  A figure of &euro;311 was given for every signature.  Reference was made to the different sustainment payments for 13 weeks, 26 weeks, 39 weeks and 52 weeks, namely, &euro;613, &euro;737, &euro;892 and &euro;1,165, respectively.  Where did the figure of &euro;557.70 come for in respect of the signing of the PPPs?  That contradicts the evidence we have been given, which refers to &euro;311.</p> <p>  I have just a couple of concluding questions.  Very powerful information was contained in the witnesses' statement.  I engaged in a comprehensive analysis whereby people could come to me and give me their evidence.  As with the witnesses' engagement with the 25 witnesses, I got no positive feedback on JobPath.  The one thing that struck me was the individual who had his identity curtailed.  There was an attempt to hide it.  I am talking about the Traveller man who was forced against his will to have his name changed to get a job.  He would not agree to it.  The change was made on his CV.  That is absolutely appalling, particularly when this House passed a momentous Bill last year that gave recognition to Travellers and their ethnicity.  </p></speech>

It was called <i>The Murder Machine</i>and was about the education system.  It contended everyone was moulded to be the same, coming down a conveyor belt.With regard to labour activation, everyone is expected to conform to the same product and have his or her identity done away with solely to get into low-pay, precarious employment.  That is the essence of all this.  The witnesses have done comprehensive work.  It would be very worthwhile if they were prepared to give it to this committee for further analysis.  It is powerful work.  Have the findings or the report been given to the Minister?  The Minister is in complete denial.  She still stands over the fallacy that JobPath is the most successful labour activation scheme in the history of the State.  She fails to take into consideration that thousands of people have been bullied, intimidated and cajoled and have had their identities robbed, stolen and suppressed to get into low-paid, precarious employment.  </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  They are doing great work.  I thank them on behalf of everybody who is a victim of this vicious system.  I do not know whether any of them watched "I, Daniel Blake".  It was on television again over Christmas and it was my second or third time to see it.  What keeps coming back into one's head are the outcomes of the vicious ways of trying to force people into employment, including unsuitable employment.  Mostly it is vicious because, now in 2019, there is almost full employment and employers are crying out for workers.  Why are the penalties increasing?</p> <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question on this issue in October.  The number of sanctions increased from 359 in 2011, when the system was introduced, to 11,169 in 2018, with 55,828 in total over the whole period.  There is no explanation for that other than that it is punitive.  It cuts back on the appearance that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is doing its job.  In fact, it is paying out all the money to private companies.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for Mr. Rudd on that issue.  As mentioned by Deputy Brady, a figure of &euro;557.70 per signature was quoted, which I accept.  How in the name of God is such a figure calculated?  It is &euro;557.70, not &euro;558, &euro;600 or &euro;550.  Who is it calculated so exactly to the level of cents?  What the hell is going on there?  What is going on when the two companies are subcontracting or outsourcing their own work?  Could the delegates explain what they believe is happening?  Is it that the companies cannot cope with the volume of penalties they are introducing or the volume of individuals coming to them through Intreo or random selection?</p> <p>  Have any of the delegates done work on the number of individuals who have been blocked from going back to education or into a community employment scheme?  They are called into JobPath and are told by a different Department, almost simultaneously, sometimes within days or even hours, that they have the back-to-education allowance or that there is a community employment scheme on which they may participate.  They are immediately blocked by JobPath from going into the back-to-education scheme or community employment, which is a huge contradiction in terms of what the Government says it is trying to achieve.</p> <p>  It is also very clear that much of the work individuals are being forced into is precarious.  Before Christmas, we passed a Bill, the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill , to try to organise around and stop the spread of precarious work.  Look at what we are doing; we are forcing people further into precarious work. </p> <p>  I, too, want to comment on the name change forced on the Traveller man to hide his ethnicity.  I came from a meeting with the Oireachtas Traveller group the other day at which the Minister explained to us all the various initiatives the Government is taking to bring about the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  It is another contradiction in Government policy that an effort was made to force Travellers to change their ethnicity while another Department was spending a fortune on creating committees to help Travellers gain ethnicity rights.</p> <p>  Those are my main questions.  They concern the blocking of individuals, the calculation of the cost, outsourcing and the precarious nature of employment.</p><p>My last question might require a long answer but if that is the case, Mr. Rudd might be able to expand on it in writing.  In his submission, Mr. Rudd said that one of the agendas of the Department is to honour the IMF and the EU agreement.  Will he expand on that?  What does the agreement actually state that the Government has agreed with the IMF and the EU?  What does it state about forcing people into this kind of a contract through the State machine?</p></speech>

Before I go to the witnesses, I want to put everything in context.  I thank them for their presentations and for attending.  They are part of a process.  This is an issue the committee has been investigating for a while and we are coming towards the end of our hearings.  The committee will then produce a report with findings and recommendations.  As Deputy Brady indicated, JobPath as we know it is coming to an end so the report is timely.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to avoid repetition in their comments and to refer as specifically as possible to the points that were raised.  I especially ask them to be mindful that there are two elements to the report.  There will be findings on the JobPath programme.  The other aspect stems from Mr. Boland's comment on a recommendation to discontinue the policy immediately.  Ms Greene talked about what could have been.  As a committee, we are equally concerned with the witnesses' vision of what they would see following the current phase of JobPath.  They can give details of that before the committee today or, because time is limited, they can follow up in writing. </p> <p>  We, as a committee, will make recommendations for the future.  That is an important point to make.  The witnesses have highlighted many issues.  I am not being dismissive of them, as they will be part of the findings, but the committee is also interested in recommendations, suggestions and proposals from the witnesses.  There is limited time for them to contribute today, so if they want to submit those in writing afterwards to the committee, we will consider them.  I call Mr. Rudd first and ask him to be specific, avoid repetition and mind the time.  There have been a number of questions on the &euro;550 rate so I ask him to start with the money.</p></speech>

As this committee has discovered for itself, the total price is &euro;3,718 and 15% of that gives the figure of &euro;550 exactly.  It is simple mathematics if we check the 2013 tender document where 15% is quoted as the bonus for the signatures.  It boils down to that.</p></speech>

In one of the submissions provided, in the victim statements and in the United People report, I mention the case of Mr. Gerry Tobin.  I have his full permission to refer to him.  He was sanctioned from March last year until 22 December 2018.  There were non-stop rolling sanctions.  Under the Social Welfare Acts 2005 and 2010, after nine weeks a client or anybody who has been sanctioned, even outside of JobPath, is supposed to go back on the normal social welfare rates for at least one week before another nine-week round of sanctions is supposed to kick in.  That did not happen in Mr. Tobin's case but his is only one example.  It has happened in many cases.</p> <p>  He was sanctioned from March until 22 December and he still has not got his money back.  There was a promise that he might get some of it back.  We have documentation stating that he was sanctioned because he did not sign a personal progression plan, PPP.  It is on record that on 8 March Mr. John Conlon, assistant secretary of the Department of Employment Action and Social Protection, stated to the Committee of Public Accounts that people do not have to sign the PPP.  It is a legal right to retain the right to not sign a private contract.  </p> <p>  Yet Mr. Tobin was punished for trying to retain his legal right to not sign a private contract.  We have many examples of that.  I have submitted one document today which has 101 victim statements and there are more victim statements in another document.  This is an ongoing situation.  Rolling sanctions are going on and that is illegal because it is not covered in the Social Welfare Acts.  It was admitted that this was so in the High Court in Dublin in the case of Mr. Damien Fagan.  The Department admitted that the legislation was not in place to apply these sanctions when somebody declined to sign a PPP but he or she is still willing to engage in the JobPath programme.  </p> <p>  In the case of Mr. Gerry Tobin, he was fully willing to engage.  He was informed by letter that because he did not sign the PPP, he would be punished.  He later discovered, however, that had been done that incorrectly and illegally.  The Department then changed the excuse for his sanctioning to non-attendance.  Mr. Tobin has proof that he attended every meeting.  He has proof in the form of video evidence, the visitor's sign-in book and statements from people who attended along with him.  He can prove that he attended every meeting but yet there was an attempt to try to switch the excuse just to keep the rolling sanctions going.  To put it bluntly, we went through hell just to try to clear his name.  The Department is still only willing to return part of the money to him.  That is only one issue.</p> <p>  The subject of a dream job was brought up.  Under the Constitution, citizens are guaranteed a right to a great deal of self-determination.  This completely conflicts with the Taoiseach's view of a person's entitlement to aim for his or her dream job.  Everybody's ambition to even go for it is completely shut down.  There is a conflict there that needs to be addressed.  I am glad that Deputy Brady brought that up.  According to the people that we have talked to, and, as I said in my opening statement, the people that we have cried along with, this is a big thing.  From day one, JobPath strips people of any ambition.  They are just told to do this or that or else they are sanctioned.</p> <p>  My third point concerns other agencies mentioned by other witnesses.  It has been indicated that these agencies, and others that are similar, should have been adopted more and from the very start.  The services that they have should have been utilised more.  The State could have saved between 60% and 70% of the money that has been put into the JobPath programme by upgrading or using such services as have been mentioned.  This is on record.  On 8 May, representatives from such services stated this themselves before the Committee of Public Accounts.  They have been starved of numbers going into their programmes.  One of the victims statements I submitted is from an LES worker and because the numbers dropped - I will explain why they have in a minute - he found himself out of work.  He was then sucked into JobPath and told to take a minor job.  </p> <p>  This is a Civil Service worker.  The numbers have dropped but the sanctions are increasing.  The numbers of unemployed are dropping.  We can argue about percentages but they are dropping.  That means that the group of people available to be sucked into JobPath is getting smaller.  The companies are getting more desperate, as are the tactics.  There is a high staff turnover at a basic level in the JobPath system because they are pressurised to get people's signatures by any means possible.  There is serious pressure on the lower level staff and on the people to sign.  It is an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The tender document is only half of the contract.  The other half of the contract is what the two companies have charged the State.  We do not know what they have agreed to; we only know what the State has offered them.  This argument has been addressed in the Committee of Public Accounts.  When the committee has tried to review the contract to see what exactly is meant to be spent on this programme, a wall of private confidentiality or sensitivity is hit.</p> <p>  Within the make-up of the programme, companies are allowed to charge and subcontract out but they do not have to notify the Committee of Public Accounts or anyone else that they are subcontracting.  The companies decide themselves if they want to subcontract.  One of the major issues I find about subcontracting is that the companies subcontract to themselves.  If we take the example of Turas Nua, it is a joint venture of Working Links and FRS Recruitment, yet it subcontracts back to itself in the form of Working Links.   It is part of the main group that was originally awarded the contract.  </p> <p>  I cannot be 100% sure why the companies continue to subcontract out but it seems that they have bid at certain price knowing that they can pass it on to someone else at a reduced price.  At the end of the day, however, the taxpayer is paying the bill.  We pay the highest price that was offered and the companies then pass it on to a lower price.</p><p>The only logical explanation is they are charging more than what it costs to run the programme.  </p></speech>

Deputy Brady referred to the name change.  This is an ongoing issue.  It does not just involve the name change.  Highly skilled people such as part-time nurses, firefighters and tradesmen want to go further but have been asked to consistently dumb down, including their curriculum vitae.  In other words, they must lower their expectations, which, to a certain extent, is right.  Let us be honest.  We should all be working.  However, telling a person with a mountain of qualifications that he or she must dumb down their curriculum vitae and take a basic wage job not only affects the person on a financial level, it also affects him or her on an emotional level.  It also affects his or her family.  It is a case of asking why Daddy with all his qualifications is stacking shelves in a supermarket and what he did to deserve that or, to put it bluntly, asking why Mammy is cleaning toilets when she has qualifications in marketing or design.  How does someone explain that to his or her children?  How does he or she explain that the Government is fair when this is happening?  That is what it boils down to in real life.</p> <p>  Education was brought up.  We have found, and this is borne out by the victims' statements, that JobPath companies allow people out to a certain extent to acquire education.  However, because of the hype or madness about people speaking out about the current system and JobPath blocking education, the Government announced that it will now allow people to go into education while they are in the JobPath programme.  It did not give the full version, which is that people will be allowed to go into limited education but on top of that, they must get the permission of the JobPath companies.  I mentioned the case of a part-time nurse.  She wanted to upskill with a year-long course but she was not allowed to do so.  The JobPath company told her that the most she would be allowed to do would be four to nine weeks of any sort of training.  The companies want to hold on to people because each one is trapped within a 12-month contract.  If people want to upskill on a serious level - third level - for 12 months on a part-time or full-time basis, that contract runs out and they can escape from JobPath.  If they escape from JobPath and get a job after the contract, the companies are unable to claim their additional payments,  Consequently, they want to keep the people down to a minimum of time in terms of education.  This is a common problem.  Up until two days ago, I was still getting phone calls about this.  Many people have come to us and told us that they want to engage within the JobPath programme but that they were not being allowed to upskill in the ways they wanted to.  They told me that such upskilling will not only benefit them but their families.  </p></speech>

A question was asked about the IMF agreement.  I submitted it to the committee in writing.  The IMF agreement was signed on 28 November and 8 December 2010 with the EU and the IMF.  That agreement contained provisions regarding the introduction of instruments to better identify jobseekers' needs, or "profiling", and increased engagement; a more effective monitoring of jobseekers' activities with regular evidence-based reports; the application of sanction mechanisms for beneficiaries not complying with job search conditionality and recommendations for participation in labour market programmes set in such a way as to imply an effective loss of income without being perceived as excessively penalising so that it could credibly be used whenever lack of compliance is ascertained.  That is part of the IMF agreement relating to the bank bailout under the heading of structural reform.  I have provided the information.  It was on page 21.  How is this-----</p></speech>

That was the Secretary General's own admission.  The last time he was before the committee on 8 March, he stated that the JobPath programme is in line with the document from 2011 entitled Supports and Services for Unemployed Jobseekers: Challenges and Opportunities in a Time of Recession.  It states that anything discussed regarding the creation of a system to deal with long-term unemployment in a time of recession must always meet the terms of the IMF agreement.  Regardless of what is discussed, it must still abide by these three conditions.  These conditions are to profile, monitor and sanction when someone does not comply with the regulations.  How is the IMF involved?  It is involved because the paperwork links it all together.</p> <p>  I was asked what I would like to see happen with regard to JobPath.  Unfortunately, even if the programme was shut down today, there is nothing one can do.  As long as these contract terms are in place, a new programme will be set up to run the same way.  I would love to a see a proper activation programme that is designed to help people back into employment or education that is designed specifically for the user but we cannot design it because the IMF says we must have these rules.  A company then uses these rules as a business practice from which to benefit.  Regardless of whether we shut down the programme today, tomorrow or in two years' time, this will happen with every programme we create until that money is repaid to the IMF and EU.  This is just one term and condition that is being applied to the people in the system.  There are other areas of the IMF agreement that apply today but this relates specifically to social welfare.  There is nothing we can do.  I would love to be able to walk down to my local employment office, say that I would like to find a job and ask what the office could do for me but I cannot.  It is all for the benefit of the company.  </p> <p>  Regarding the deferral of sanctions, specifically on the ground, it is true that the Department applies the sanctions.  It is the organisation that physically puts the stamp on the seal and tells the person he or she has been sanctioned.  It actually comes directly from the two companies.  Under the section on sanctions in the tender document, it is outlined in detail and involves the email that is sent, what is written, what level of sanction exists and how long it will be applied for.  Once the Department gets that email, the sanction is automatic - no "ifs", "ands" or "buts".  It has been proven in my case when it was before the High Court.  I have probably dealt with 60 or 70 cases, all of which involve the same issue.  One of the worst things about it is that a person will never see what that email says.  It is hidden from the person at all times.  When the person goes to the appeals office, the companies do not have to attend.  They are the ones making the claim against the person but the person does not have any evidence of the claim - just the Department saying that the person has failed to engage because it has received reports that the person has failed to engage.  Once the company says it, that is it and the person is sanctioned.  The Department takes it at face value.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service report from 2015 warned about this in the same month in which the programme went live.  It stated that the belief in the companies would outweigh belief in the people.  This was warned well in advance of the programme's creation yet nobody paid attention to it.  There is no oversight or governance and there are no proper records because of arguments about privacy and confidentiality.  </p> <p>  Regarding the contract, the PPP is defined in the tender contract as a plan to help people back into employment, which is fine.  I have my own PPP, which was submitted in court, with me.  Most of it is fine.  It is meant to outline my skills.  The problem really arises with the last pages of the PPP.  They turn the PPP from a plan to get somebody back into employment into a contract.  It states three to four specific terms very clearly.  If the person does not agree with the company, it will sanction that person.  It states that if the person does not provide the company with information, it will prosecute him or her.  I never know if private companies can prosecute someone for not sharing personal information but according to the agreement a person signs with Turas Nua, he or she can be prosecuted if he or she does not share his or her information with the company.  The State will argue that this is not a contract.  The State has argued in court that it was a contract.  I have tonnes of records and audio recordings from people who have been in meetings and all of them contain the same thing, namely, the person must sign the contract or he or she will be sanctioned.  The contract term did not come from me or any other record.  It actually came from the Department.</p><p>While most people may not realise this, I check the records.  The State held joint information sessions on the JobPath programme on two specific dates and I have outlined these in my timeline.  The first was on 26 July 2013 when the then Department of Social Protection held two information sessions.  I provided the committee with a list of all those who attended that meeting.  The second, on 7 November 2013, was a joint information session by the Department of Social Protection and Enterprise Ireland.  I have provided the presentation to the committee.  At that meeting, Enterprise Ireland clearly told the companies they were to contract people in two separate ways.  It was, therefore, the Department that defined this as a contract.  If people agree to the terms of the contract, their rights are gone and they no longer have a choice about what career or educational course to enter.  That choice is made by someone else to make profits.  People must work for someone else's profit and for no benefit to themselves.</p></speech>

We had so many of these people, it was tragic.  People who are familiar with the adult education system will know that we have some wonderful full-time and part-time programmes.  Our voluntary training opportunities scheme offers those who have been unemployed for more than six months two years of full-time education to rebuild up to a QQI level 5 skill or sometimes level 6, depending on ability.  That is a fantastic opportunity.  We also offer part-time programmes which suit other people who may be back in work and are seeking to upskill.</p> <p>  I do not have a figure to hand for the number of people taken off the programme but it is available on our database.  Large numbers of people were taken off the programme.  The Intreo case officers tried to prevent people from being "turas nuaed", as they described it.  They tried to ensure we could get them in time to be able to place them on a programme.  In the case of the client I mentioned, I wanted him to go on a full-time programme but he had such a bad experience of education and his skills were so low that he did not have confidence.  It was difficult enough to get him to agree to my part-time programme, which was perfect for him as it offered a mix of practical skills, including basic information technology, and improving communications skills.  If he had taken the full-time programme, he would not have been "turas nuaed", so to speak.  However, he did not understand the position, as many people do not understand it because they are so honest.  These are people who are unemployed or who have just been made unemployed and are often vulnerable.</p> <p>  I refer to a question raised by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  We work with people who are on sickness benefits and people who have been sick for a very long time.  Some of my clients have worked in these services and have been so run down by their experience that they are now out sick.  We also work with many people who are not in receipt of payments to return them to employment through education.</p> <p>  To return to the people who have been "turas nuaed", the number was especially large in 2015 and 2016.  We noticed a considerable change in what is happening this year, which frightens us even more.  The client I referred to was not brought back to me but returned to Turas Nua yet again.  Now, as he says, all he must do is go for a chat.  It is very important for the companies that he  sign in each time he does so because it enables them to get their money.  However, he is not being asked to do anything.  He is such a shy man and is so afraid that it suits him to have to go into the office in town once a month.  What a ridiculous wasted opportunity to give him a chance of having a quality of life at the age of almost 64 years.  </p> <p>  Several of our clients are working with but not engaging with Turas Nua.  An example that very much upsets me involves a young man for whom I sought an educational assessment.  He was with Turas Nua but did not engage with the company, although the staff member in Turas Nua working with him has been good and has tried to get him back.  He has not attended meetings and has been sanctioned as a result.  I am concerned that he is self-medicating for what he considers to be depression and other issues.  He he is now off our books and everyone else's books.  He is lost to society.  That is happening over and over and it is a tragedy.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's wider question, there is work to be done by the local employment service.  It was doing a very good job and we were working very closely with our partners in the Intreo service with which we do not have any difficulty.  Intreo staff cannot speak out because we are all public servants in that sense.  I am here speaking as the chair of the Adult Education Guidance Association of Ireland.  Intreo staff do not support what is happening to the clients.  The Department's Intreo cases officers know these people need education and training if they are to get jobs and would like to help them access such opportunities but cannot do so.  I hope this programme will not continue for a further two years.  </p> <p>  We were asked for our general vision.  Deputy Thomas Byrne, who we met recently, told us he was reading about deskilling populations in America.  This project is a deskilling.  It is a contradiction of Government policy.  The national skills strategy is the central strategy pursued by the Departments of Education and Skills and Business, Enterprise and Innovation with the support of IBEC and others.  It aims to upskill people to the highest level possible.  Everyone is on board with the strategy on which a bulletin was produced recently.  Professor Brian MacCraith of Dublin City University is very good on the issue of artificial intelligence and a recent newspaper article cited the Taoiseach on the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs.  The need for upskilling is very well known.  Professor MacCraith argues that people need highly transferable skills, for example, customer service skills and emotional intelligence, which require a great deal of confidence to use.  People learn to use emotional intelligence by building up confidence, engaging in education and acquiring qualifications.  This provides people with transferable skills that they may use anywhere.  As Professor MacCraith has said, for the new world order and for the new jobs that we do not even know exist, the qualities we need are emotional intelligence and empathy.  However, the JobPath project takes people and keeps them in very low-skilled jobs.  </p> <p>  I will give another example of a woman who stayed on the programme for one year.  She wanted to come off the programme and hated the job she was in.  She would ring me from the toilet at a startup company.  She stayed the year because otherwise she would lose her rights and entitlements and would be unable to pay her rent.  She was a wonderful person with some challenges who was doing this all on her own.  On the day the scheme finished, she was made redundant.  The idea was that she would be kept on in the job.  She had a degree and during that year, I was about to get her on to a childcare programme.  These are the types of tragedies taking place.</p> <p>  Our vision is that there would be joined-up thinking.  My opening statement referred to the fragmented approach.  The State educates us to a high level to deliver a very good service.  The Intreo protocol with the Department of Employment and Social Protection was awarded to us, yet this project completely ignored it.  I ask that the committee push for the review of guidance which was due last September and has been delayed.  This would deliver the further education guidance strategy across all services.  If there are highly skilled people working in Turas Nua who wish to join us or the local employment service, the service should be amalgamated so that there is a properly run, integrated further education training and guidance service for the country for the future.  We are in relatively good times, but I have lived through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and have been through every recession in that period.  My career was affected but I had some career resilience because I have good educational skills on which I could work.  I have gone up, down and across the learning axis.  I have been awarded a level 5 qualification in early childcare.  My husband, who is a solicitor, lost his business in the crash.  I am very proud of him.  The rule has been changed but he was self-employed so he had to pay for training and became a carer.  He has had the most satisfying period until he recently became ill.  That is what is happening.  We need to be able to go up, down and across the axis of learning.  One cannot shove people into a progression route.  That vision is possible.  We have the people to deliver it and we have clients who desperately need the support and opportunities we can create.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-17a.1655" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ray Griffin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019011700002#P00100"><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is over 70 years old.  More than any other Department, it has held us together as a society, often through tough times.  We have enormous respect for the Department.  The forming of that Department and its considerable achievements over its life in dealing with poverty and building social cohesion are a substantial political achievement that for each generation needs to be renewed against strong opposition.  That is an achievement made in Leinster House.</p> <p>  We have a world-class system of social protection in many ways.  It was the envy of many other countries until recently when we started photocopying failing models' homework and replicating them unsympathetically here.  We need to get back to a human-capital-centric approach.  That is the approach which brought us to full employment.  When we are at international conferences, we are told we are one of the few countries which experiences full employment from time to time.  We have proved Irish people are not workshy.  We have gotten our long-term unemployment rates down to negligible levels.  That demonstrates that the ideology that people are workshy and we need to work them over is not the problem.  The problems of our labour market are the problems of our economy, which is about industrial policy and the creation of jobs.  We need to get back to our core values in this area which are held by most of the people working in the system who we have encountered in our research.</p> <p>  Research by Dr. Rod Hick of the University of Cardiff suggests the policy choices made here are Irish policy choices.  They are encoded in the deal we cut.  It was on the Irish side that the aspiration for this form of activation came.  It was not mandated.  We have a policy choice again, especially as we crest back into an era of near full employment.  The core target of JobPath, namely, long-term worklessness, is usually and more efficiently improved by a community-based response.  Such a response would focus on particular communities which experience unemployment and particular drivers of their unemployment, as well as geographic blackspots.  They are long-term developmental drivers with community activities.  There is a principle of community development which is nothing for us without us.  The JobPath scheme is being done to people, not with people.  In our research, all the 121 unemployed people to whom we have talked, attempted to navigate their way out of unemployment and were looking for help.  They existed in their own personal labour market, not the broad labour market.  They had specific geographic and educational restrictions, as well as aspirations, that they were trying to fulfil through the labour market.  They need to be supported in a meaningful and human-capital-centric way.</p> <p>  It is our sense, which has been relayed to us by many professional insiders in the Department, both at office and policy level, that much of what is being done would not survive judicial scrutiny.  This relies on the practical reality that unemployed people do not have access to our courts.  Sanctioning is against the principle of natural justice.  The sanctioners are judge, jury and executioner.  There is no sense of proportionality.  The natural justice cycle of clear, unambiguous notice, as well as formal warning, representation advocacy and appeal are not intact.  The level of oversight and transparency is a disgrace.  Little bits of information are figured out through parliamentary questions.  If they were proud of this system, it would be open to scrutiny and reporting.  We know from our county-by-county data that it does not appear that they work to a consistent standard.  What really delivers this is the high level of appeals which are successful.  If they worked to a consistent standard, there would not be that level of successful appealing.</p> <p>  Another concern is that the case officers working in JobPath are not appropriate individuals to work with a vulnerable population.  Typically, they are on short-term contracts because the JobPath contract is for only four years.  Clearly, they cannot be employed for a longer timeframe.  They are paid for a poorly thought-out system that is called a performance model but in reality is more of a luck-based one.  Essentially, if one is in a highly liquid labour market like Dublin, one has a good chance of placing people in any job.  However if one is in Mayo, Kerry or Wexford, one can forget about it.  Typically, the kind of people who are case officers are business and marketing graduates usually with an emphasis on sales experience.  While JobPath has doubled the number of case workers, this is done without reference to their capability character of contract situations.  We have a fear that this opens the State up to liability downstream.</p> <p>  Our sense is that JobPath does not work.  It damages users at the point of use and in the long term.  It damages everybody in the labour market.  If one thinks about the massaging of CVs, companies will no longer trust these because they suspect they have not been authentically written.  One cannot hoodwink employers through an office of the State.  Our sense is that the use of outsource providers takes those with a public service ethos out of the loop and, thereby, reduces standards.  It is expensive upfront.  Based on our concerns about judicial scrutiny, there may be downstream liabilities to it.</p></speech>

That data are protected by the Waterford Institute of Technology research ethics board and we are not in a position to share it in a straightforward way.  We publish reports and books which have anonymised data which deals with these matters in brief.  We have submitted several papers to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Minister.  We will hopefully produce more in the future.  It is important confidentiality is respected in this case.  Basically what happened was that the man was attempting to co-operate.  Then somebody told him this was his CV.  It was changed online more or less in front of him and submitted.  They took over the whole process for him.  He had no agency whatsoever.  They just did it to him without his consent.</p> <p>  Despite all the talk, JobPath is not really payment by performance or outcome.  What is performing is not the JobPath provider but the Irish economy.  If the economy performs, people get better jobs.  One can tell from the quantitative data, even though there is an initial bounce of people making commencements of employment, 25% which is higher than that without JobPath, these are people who do not stay in employment for any longer time.  The negative effects of using the stick with the threat of sanctions will have negative effects in the long term.  It only acts as a sort of an intimidating middleman which makes sure people apply for whatever jobs are going.  It is not intervening in a natural market but creating a market.  It is what we call market coaxing.  It forces people to enter the market and apply for jobs below what makes sense economically or personally for them.  It is a significant problem.</p><p>We have talked a great deal about what we want and come back to the fact that activation is an OECD and EU-wide policy.  For decades the Irish system was criticised for being too passive, which, to an extent, was a misunderstanding.  We were active, in that we provided training and back to education supports.  This conditionality was missing.  As several people have suggested and in replying to Senator Higgins, a system of work first does not work.  Human capital building, educational opportunities and training, in terms of whatever people choose, do work.  A system will be designed to follow up with activation of some form.  The question is what form that activation should take.  It is clear from what we have heard that it needs to be professionally run and focused on training and so forth, but we need to think about it realistically.  Even if they are properly administered legally, backed up and passed by the Oireachtas, with proper oversight by the Attorney General, sanctions are and were a part of the welfare regime, except that they were a nuclear option in that a person's entitlements were taken away entirely.  We now have smaller sanctions that can be applied with due caution.  We need to look at how they are applied.  We will not remove them entirely because then there would no stick whatsoever, but we need to look at how we apply them.  They need to be signposted clearly.  We must identify things that are compulsory such as attendance at meetings, but as far as possible everything can be optional.  There should be a way to include proportionality such as leniency for a first offence or a warning.  In France, there is a three refusal system.  I have talked to people in Brittany and their system appears to be that someone can refuse three jobs before he or she can be sanctioned.  They are regulated properly to ensure a job is suitable for the individual concerned.  We could do this.  We can photocopy a better policy than the UK policy.  A reoriented and changed welfare system which would be trumpeted in some way must undo a lot of the damage done to the economy by low wages and precarious work and also restore people's faith that someone will be helped and not subject to caprice.  The rules must be clear and explained.  Everyone should be given a chance and there should be a generous interpretation.  We need to renew the sense that social welfare is a safety net that can be relied on and that the regime builds cohesion and a better economy, with decent work for people and an expectation that, if one falls on hard times, there will be solidarity, that the system will help and that the State will offer support.</p></speech>

I was struck by the comment made by Dr. Boland in his concluding remarks that JobPath obviously did not work, that it damaged users and everyone in the workforce and that there could be liabilities downstream.  That was a huge statement to make.  I have said this is an investigation in the making and that we will come back to this issue because of the vast amounts of money involved and the High Court cases which stem from JobPath.  That is only the beginning.</p><p>I want to touch on the issue of sanctions.  This ties in with the need to get back to core values.  Oversight and accountability are important, but the problem many others and I have is the perception that sanctions are imposed by Intreo officers.  I know many fantastic people with real, core values who are working within Intreo offices and trying to stop people from getting into Turas Nua and who were opposed to privatisation from the outset.  However, it was imposed without their input or consultation.  </p><p>A paragraph in the document from WIT states:  </p><blockquote>While officially sanctioning decisions are made only by the Intreo office, in practice, in the experience of jobseekers, the recommendation of a sanction by a JobPath provider was a <i>fait accompli</i>.  In other research where we have spoken to counter staff and case officers in welfare offices, the JobPath providers are described as deciding on sanctions.</blockquote> <p>That is very important because the Minister has said it is the decision of Intreo officers, yet all of the evidence I have and the evidence given here is that the decision taken depends on the nature of the email sent.</p><p>Either Mr. Rudd or Mr. Fagan mentioned the contracts and rolling sanctions.  Whoever it was, reference was made to the fact that in the contract sanctions could only be imposed for up to nine weeks before the jobseeker had to be put back on benefit payments.  Could United People send the relevant section to us?</p><p>In her initial contribution Ms Green spoke about PEX 1 and people who had been unemployed for three months and how critical it was to get them involved and make them more employable.  We know that when JobPath was rolled out initially, its purpose was to have &quot;an approach to employment activation which caters mainly for people who are long-term unemployed (over 12 months)&quot;.  However, it has deviated completely from it.  I am encountering increasing numbers of people who are short-term unemployed, for days or weeks, who have been referred to JobPath.  That is an admission that the policy has failed.  By virtue of the nature of the contract, JobPath is a monster which has to be fed continuously.  It would be very useful for the committee if there was more evidence because time and again the Minister has said Jobpath is only for the long-term unemployed, but more and more we are seeing people who are short-term unemployed being fed into JobPath.  This is about the private model, not the individual.  Individuals who are short-term unemployed are being fed into it and it is easier because they are gaining employment and feeding the private companies the bonus that thereby accrues.</p></speech>

If the delegates or committee members have a response, it will have to be submitted in writing.  I want to be clear with the delegates.  A number of the issues which have been raised and some of the points made by Deputy Brady will form part of the consultative process when we are compiling the report.  If the delegates wish to comment in response to a number of the questions raised, will they, please, forward their responses?  As there is block voting in the D&aacute;il, the meeting is due to conclude.</p> <p>  Second and more important, this is the final set of delegates in this module of our work.  I make this comment to all delegates at all meetings.  If there is something a delegate, having reflected on it afterwards, to which he or she would like to add, he or she should, please, feel free to correspond with the committee.  I say this because shortly we will start to draft a report based on the hearings.  As I said, this is the final group of delegates.</p> <p>  On my own behalf and that of the committee, I thank Mr. Rudd, Mr. Fagan, Ms Green, Dr. Griffin and Dr. Boland for their attendance.  I also thank them for their opening statements and supporting documentation.  The documents from Mr. Rudd and Mr. Fagan only arrived last night and will be circulated to committee members long in advance of drafting the report.  I make the point clearly that committee members did not have an opportunity to see them before the meeting.</p></speech>
