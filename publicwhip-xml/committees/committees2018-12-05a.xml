This meeting has been convened to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 38 - Health.  In that regard, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Jim Daly, and his officials.  I thank the Minister of State for the briefing material, which has been circulated to the members of the committee.  Without further ado, I call on him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#B00400"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus na baill den choiste chomh maith.  I thank the select committee for the opportunity to bring this Supplementary Estimate for Vote 38 before it.  The total additional funding I am seeking for 2018 is &euro;655 million.  Of this, &euro;10 million is to compensate for a shortfall in appropriation-in-aid, &euro;20 million is towards capital works and &euro;625 million is towards overspends in current expenditure in various areas of the HSE.  I acknowledge that the amount sought is significant, representing as it does 4% of overall health expenditure in 2018.</p> <p>  This year, the anticipated level of overspend by the HSE is linked to the HSE's first charge in 2018 arising from the 2017 deficit, a shortfall in income, winter planning, growth in 2018 activity beyond plan, including the primary care reimbursement service, and additional funding required in the State Claims Agency.  Health funding remains a major challenge.  Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and an ageing population, mean we face challenges into the future.  We are implementing our strategic responses to these challenges, while continuing to focus on effective management of resources to ensure that services are delivered in line with the national service plan.</p> <p>  Ensuring the health service is financially sustainable is a key strategic goal of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The significant increases in the health Vote in recent years reflects the Government's commitment to improve access to health and social services for the people of Ireland, through investment across community and hospital services.  We need to keep the recovery going and the economy strong in order that we can continue to develop our health infrastructure and the provision of health services into the future.</p> <p>  Next year, the Health Service Executive's national service plan will be framed through the lens of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  The strategy provides the framework within which a system-wide reform programme for the health service will be advanced, and focuses on establishing the building blocks for a significant shift in the way in which health services are delivered in Ireland.</p> <p>  I will now set out the items that make up this year's Supplementary Estimate.  On the 2017 first charge of &euro;90 million, the HSE's recorded deficit for 2017 is &euro;139 million.  Under the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, any excess expenditure must be charged to the income and expenditure account the following year and is effectively a first charge on the following year's budget.  My Department and the HSE completed a comprehensive review of the anticipated outturn for 2018 and identified a number of once-off savings that will be allocated against the 2017 first charge, with the balance of the funding requirement being met from the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  There has been a significant reduction in the level of private patient income for public hospitals in 2018.  Health insurers, as members will be aware, commenced a campaign in 2017 aimed at discouraging members from using their private health insurance to avail of private inpatient services when they are admitted via an emergency department.  Instead, they have encouraged their members to consider being treated as a public patient, as is their right provided for under the Health Act 1970.  This, inevitably, is leading to a drop in income as more patients are opting to be treated publicly rather than privately.</p> <p>  The allocation for the winter plan of &euro;10 million from the Supplementary Estimate allows for the commencement of a range of measures aimed at alleviating pressure on the acute hospital system during the busy winter period.  Timely discharge of patients is vital to ensuring that a ready supply of beds is available to those patients requiring to be admitted through emergency departments.  Delayed discharges are a major contributory factor to emergency department overcrowding and adversely affect patient flow throughout the hospital.  It is essential that, insofar as is possible, egress meets demand and that hospital and community healthcare organisation, CHO, processes support timely and safe discharge.</p><p>Integrated hospital and community plans are the cornerstone of the 2018-19 winter plan, with nine key sites of concern selected based on previous winter performance.  Enhanced measures across acute, primary and social care will focus on critical demand pressures on the nine sites during a four-week focus period between 17 December 2018 and 13 January 2019.</p><p> With regard to the non-achievement of the &euro;150 million savings target, the value improvement programme included in the national service plan is a single overarching programme with three broad priority themes: improving value within existing services, improving value within non-direct services and strategic value improvement.  It is anticipated that none of the targeted savings under the strategic value improvement will be achieved at year end.</p><p> Acute hospitals are running at an expenditure level from 2017 which is over their approved funding level.  This level of expenditure was to be matched to the approved level of funding through achieving the savings attributable to the service level and corporate value programmes embedded in the division&rsquo;s hospital budgets.  The forecasted underachievement of targets under the corporate value programme by year end is contributing significantly to the estimated overspend.  Increasing bed capacity in public acute hospitals continues to be a priority in addressing the causes and challenges of emergency department overcrowding.  My Department is undertaking a health service capacity review in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, the findings of which are due to be published shortly.  In the meantime, there continues to be an urgent need for capacity in acute hospitals.  On that basis, it is proposed to allocate &euro;5.7 million to acute hospitals to address critical bed capacity deficits in 2018.  </p><p> Community services incorporates the delivery of primary care, mental health, disability and older persons health and social care services.  The main drivers of the overall deficit in community services include emergency placements for people with disabilities, costs associated with HIQA compliance and costs associated with Storm Emma.  </p><p> Support services incorporates a number of central corporate services including finance, health business services, legal, communications, health system reform, chief information officer and the office of the director general.  Expenditure in the area is running ahead of plan for a number of reasons, including the number of large legal cases, professional service costs for the programme for health service improvement and increasing software and professional fees related to support of acute hospital initiatives such as maternity and newborn electronic records.  </p><p> In 2018, there has been a significant increase in the number of payments made under the treatment abroad and cross-border healthcare schemes.  With the trend continuing upwards throughout the year, there is a need for supplementary funding to address this area of growing demand.  </p><p> The increasing costs of the clinical indemnity scheme are not due exclusively to the increasing numbers of claims but rather to the increasing costs of awards and the high costs associated with catastrophic injury claims.  In 2017, significant progress was made on legislation which is expected to lead to a reduction in costs over time.  From a health perspective, the most important aspect is the provision for periodic payment orders.  Courts will now have the power to award damages by way of periodic payment orders, where appropriate, having regard to the best interests of the plaintiff and all the circumstances of the case.  With the enactment of the Mediation Act in October 2017, which provides a wide-ranging statutory framework to promote the resolution of disputes through mediation as an alternative to court proceedings and to reduce the stress for parents and families that often accompanies court proceedings, it is hoped that more families will opt for this route.  In addition, &euro;46 million is sought towards the projected deficit in 2018 in the State Claims Agency.  </p><p> Funding will be provided for a number of GP fees and allowances including &euro;4.85 million towards the cost of providing free cervical check consultations.</p><p> The greater than budgeted number of medical cards is driving an increase in the number of items dispensed and it is proposed to allocate &euro;3 million to cover this increased cost.  It is proposed to allocate &euro;30 million to cover the continuing increase in high-tech drug costs for treating conditions such as rheumatology, cancer and cystic fibrosis.  With regard to long-term illness, &euro;7 million will be allocated to cover the cost of treating long-term illnesses, the most prevalent being diabetes and epilepsy.  </p><p> Appropriations-in-aid are received by Ireland from the UK in respect of health services provided under EU regulations.  The amounts received are based on the Ireland-United Kingdom healthcare reimbursement arrangement.  Costs associated with UK pensioners residing in Ireland account for the major portion of the total payment.  Historically, each country's pensioner liability was agreed based on the results of sample pensioner surveys undertaken every few years.  More recently both administrations have agreed in principle to work towards the introduction of a revised methodology for determining pensioner liability.  Trends in demography and migration between the two countries indicate a reduction in the number of pensioners for whom the UK is liable.  Initial discussions with the UK indicated that receipts in 2018 might be in the region of &euro;225 million against a provision of &euro;280 million, a difference of &euro;55 million.  Detailed discussions have recently finalised and a total payment in 2018 of &euro;270 million has been agreed, leaving only a difference of &euro;10 million.  </p><p> There is an ambitious programme of capital investment in health reflecting priority accorded to capital spending in the programme for Government position that health capital spending would be a priority.  Priority Government projects, most of which are either under way or about to commence, account for a substantial proportion of the health capital allocation in 2018 and the coming years, resulting a high level of commitments.  During 2018, extensive measures to actively manage the capital budget have been applied.  This has involved balancing as much as practicable the fulfilment of contractual commitments, delivery of projects and managing equipment and infrastructural risk issues, such that capital expenditure remains within profile.  Following this extensive engagement and management of issues, capital spending in 2018 remains within profile.  The HSE has informed the Department that, with the provision of an additional &euro;20 million in 2018 and the management of the projects' budgets, there will be no overrun in 2018 capital funding.  </p><p> A significant increase in funding for the health services has been achieved in recent years.  As I stated previously, the issue of health funding is a major challenge, not just in Ireland but internationally.  Dealing with a growing and ageing population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the increasing costs of health technology will continue to pose a financial challenge into the future.</p><p> Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a new roadmap to support the delivery of high quality care to our citizens.  Improving the way services are organised and delivered and reducing costs to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs, must remain our focus.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service continue to demonstrate good practice by delivering the best healthcare within the significant resources that have been made available by Government for 2019.  This additional funding in 2018, combined with the 2019 budget provision, is a practical example of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to use our economic growth to restore much needed funding to our health service.  The above items together with cash projections to year-end involve an Exchequer requirement of &euro;655 million.  </p><p> I seek the committee&rsquo;s approval of the Supplementary Estimates for Vote 38. </p></speech>

Is Deputy O'Reilly ready?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#C00300"><p>Yes.  I am sorry I was not here for the start.  I could say I was caught in traffic but I was getting coffee so I might as well be honest.  Honesty is the best policy.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is welcome.  I thank him for appearing before the committee.  We have previously commented on the fact the Minister is not available but in the circumstances, and given the lateness of the time we adjourned last night, I will not go down that road.  We thank the Minister of State for being here and for outlining the Supplementary Estimates to us.  I have a number of questions which I will run through and ask him to reply to them together.  </p> <p>  In the briefing note, we have been given a rough breakdown of the &euro;529 million and how it is spent.  I am looking for a more definitive breakdown, specifically of the &euro;220 million that is spent in acute hospitals.  How much of that was spent on agency staff?  The focus is on the &euro;346 million in savings to be achieved.  I have questioned people from the HSE about this previously.  Where did the figure of &euro;346 million come from?  A formula must been used.  How was it calculated?  What research went into it?  How was that conclusion arrived at?  It was unrealistic and it was not reached.  It was missed by quite a long shot. Whatever planning went into it was not sufficient.  I am also curious to know - the HSE could not give me a definitive answer - where the figure came from.  We all heard the tapes of the fellas telling us where they got the figures for banking.  I sincerely hope these figures did not come from the same place.  Can the Minister of State indicate how the figure was arrived at?  </p> <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, informed us that overruns in health have averaged &euro;500 million per year in current spending terms and that, in 2018, the overrun would be &euro;600 million.  Is it not then the case that the health service has been underfunded to the tune of approximately &euro;500 million per year since 2014?  We cannot keep having overruns and Supplementary Estimates and get to the end of the year and say we are not being underfunded.  One does not need to be a mathematical genius to figure out that if we keep overrunning, we are being underfunded.  The IFAC stated that health budgets should be well-founded and credible.  It further stated that weak planning and spending controls account for the genesis of many of the problems.  I am interested to know how spending &euro;234 million so far this year - or &euro;866,792 per day - on agency staff fits into a well-founded or credible budget.  Similarly the council stated health overruns are being masked by unexpected corporation tax and interest.</p><p>The council also states that as the top ten companies account for roughly 40% of all corporation tax receipts, unexpected revenue from this source should be deemed to be transient.  We cannot rely on this revenue but it seems that we are relying on it.  With that in mind, I ask the Minister of State to outline the Department's view on its duty to fund health in a responsible manner.  If one ran one's house in this manner, one would find oneself in MABS.  This is no way to run a household budget, never mind a massive budget for a very high spending Department.  </p><p> Immediately after the budget last year I said, as did others, that not enough money was being given to the health service to allow it to even stand still.  The budget was inadequate in terms of current service levels.  We could talk all day about the inadequacy of current service levels but there was not enough money to even maintain them.  Weeks later, the then head of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, wrote to the Minister and said that the HSE was being under-funded for 2018 to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro and that has turned out to be the case.  I am no fortune teller because if I were, I would pick the lotto numbers and leave this House.  That said, I could see that the budget was inadequate and I pointed that out at the time.  A few months later, it was also pointed out by the director general of the HSE.  At what stage in the year did the Department become aware that the health service was under-funded?  The Department was not going to take my word for it but Mr. Tony O'Brien wrote to the Department about this.  It strikes me as odd that he would have to write such a letter and that the powers that be would not be fully apprised of the position and aware that there was going to be a shortfall.  I was not the only person who pointed it out but when I did so, I was dismissed.  I was right, however.  I will not say it gives me no pleasure to say that because we all love to be right but if I could see it and Mr. Tony O'Brien was flagging it, when did the Department become aware of it?  That is material to how we keep finding ourselves in the same position at the end of the year, every year.</p></speech>

She has raised a number of broad issues.  I am not sure if we have a figure for agency staff here but I will get it to the Deputy as soon as possible.  She asked a very direct question about how much we are still spending on agency staff.  I know that there has been some conversion this year on that but I will endeavour to get the exact figure for Deputy O'Reilly.</p> <p>  The Deputy makes a very valid point about the savings figure of &euro;346 million in terms of how it was calculated and the details of that.  What I am clearly saying is that the HSE did not achieve the targets set for it in terms of making savings across the three very important areas identified.  What is wrong here?  Is the issue the HSE's inability to achieve targets or is it that the targets set were unachievable?  That is the question the Deputy asks.</p></speech>

There must have been targets.  Someone looked at this and came up with a figure of &euro;346 million, as opposed to &euro;350 million, for example.  Perhaps I am being cynical but maybe someone suggested a figure of &euro;350 million and someone else decided to make it &euro;346 million in order to seem more credible.</p></speech>

My memory of it is that the executive said it was given this target.  Someone should have sat down with the HSE to determine if the target was realistic, which we know now was not the case, and how the HSE was going to reach it.  Where was it going to find those savings?  It is not acceptable to just give the executive a savings target without figuring out how to help it to achieve it or even if the target is realistic.</p></speech>

She wants to know the origins of this figure, the basis for it and how it was calculated.  Someone must have seen it as an achievable target, based on some sums.  She wants to know what sums or calculations were done to generate this particular figure.  I will try to get to the bottom of that for her.</p> <p>  On the wider issue of trying to achieve savings, which ties in with the Deputy's next question as to whether HSE funding is sufficient, there is a constant ebb and flow and tension there.  As well as the highs and lows in economic terms, there is also an ebb and flow and tension that is necessary.  If we were to give the HSE another &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion, it would spend it.  In that context, we must try to push back and keep things as tight as we can.  It is possibly better to under-fund the executive to some extent because there can be no absolutes.  It is a demand led service, which is important to remember.  Nobody can-----</p></speech>

Deputy O'Reilly said that she does not have the power to tell fortunes or see the future and nobody on the other side of the House has that power either.  We cannot accurately predict how many people will present at accident and emergency departments or primary care facilities, how many people will require surgery and so on.  We cannot predict what new drugs will become available in any given year, how many people will require those drugs, whether they represent good value for money, what they will cost and so on.  There are lots of unknowns and variables from year to year in any health budget.  Ireland is not unique in that regard.</p> <p>  The demand led aspect of this makes it very difficult to quantify the budget required.  Something that may not be told as well as some of the other stories in the health service is the fact that there has been a significant increase in the amount of activity within the health service in recent years.  A very significant number of procedures have taken place and there have been enormous increases in day case activity and hospital admissions.  I know from my area that there has been a significant increase in the activity of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Approximately 26,000 people are being seen by CAMHS every year, which is a very significant increase.  The numbers waiting to be seen are continuing to increase but the full story must be told by pointing to the increased numbers of people who are being seen and treated.  That is where we get the real picture.  This is relevant to the issue of trolleys too.  I feel very strongly that the focus on trolleys is misguided.  It is so easy for politicians and those in the media to obsess about trolleys and trolley figures.  The real issues are how long people are waiting and delayed discharges.  We need to work on the numbers coming out of hospital and what is preventing them from being discharged.  For too long, we have been looking at how many people are blocked on the way in to hospital when the real focus should be on those whose discharge is delayed because of a lack of transitional care in the system.  </p> <p>  The Deputy's point about reliance on corporation tax belongs to a broader debate involving the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The issue is in the news again because there has been another unexpected increase in corporation tax receipts.  It is accepted by all Departments and the Government as a whole that corporation tax receipts can go up and down significantly.  We have seen that happen and will not be building in a reliance on such receipts.  I do not think there is a direct correlation between the funding of the HSE and the amount of corporation tax collected.  It just so happens that both are in the news at the moment.</p></speech>

Many other taxation sources will fund overruns in health.  That is the point I am making.  It is not only corporation tax.  My opinion on this matter is irrelevant because there are so many other tax heads contributing to the funding.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked about the Department approach to running a household budget.  This is the point I opened with.  It is a demand led service and it is difficult to quantify absolutely.  We cannot give too much to the health service.  If we do, it will overspend and over-utilise.  We must ensure there is tension if we are to get value for money.  It is the same with funding any demand led service.  We must have checks and balances, and that is difficult.  The difficulty is compounded with the highs and lows of economic activity.</p> <p>  The Department gets updates throughout the year from the HSE.  It is not at year-end when the Department becomes aware of the overruns.  It becomes aware during the year of the pressures and the likely pressures.  Many of them are projected and anticipated and efforts are made to avoid them.  We cannot be absolutely clear until later in the year.  In any event, the Department is engaging with the HSE from the start of the year to see that the executive is on target to meet spending targets.  That may answer the Deputy's question.  If there are any further questions, she should feel free to ask them.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned that he would provide me with some figures on agency spending.  He mentioned the issue of conversion.  When we had Mr. Stephen Mulvany from the HSE before the committee, we asked whether specific targets were set relating to the conversion of agency staff.  It appeared this was not the case.  I keep going back to the figure of &euro;346 million in savings.  Some of the savings relate to conversion from agency, which is highly expensive and a rather inefficient way to run the service.  Despite this, the Government is becoming more reliant on agency staff.  If there were no targets in place for the conversion of agency staff, then it would seem that no attempt had been made to control it.  HSE representatives have said to us that they try to convert from agency.  How can this be the case if no targets have been set?  Will the Minister of State give me some sense of how much of the &euro;220 million budget was spent on agency staff?  Of the &euro;346 million budget, how much was identified for conversion?</p> <p>  The Minister of State remarked on planning and the demand led nature of the service.  We have not had a major outbreak of disease.  There is nothing happening in the health service that could not have been predicted by looking at Central Statistics Office data.  We have an ageing population.  It is a good thing that people are living longer and are healthier.  There are no major unforeseen challenges.  The Minister of State mentioned the storm.  That was only a couple of days.  There was no major outbreak of disease.  There is no reason the Minister of State could not have looked at the CSO figures to enable him to plan ahead.</p></speech>

These include the outcome of the negotiations of the current general practitioner contract and the associated cost.  That is dependent on the outcome of the negotiations.  There are negotiations with drug companies as well.  There is a major cost in that area.  Another factor is whether a decision is taken or otherwise on pay increases.  A total of 32% of our staff are nurses.  If there was a Government decision taken tomorrow to give a pay increase, the HSE would not know in advance.</p> <p>  Several factors arise that cannot be anticipated simply by looking at the CSO figures.  It would be great if we lived in a world where we could identify all these things.  One of the major underlying challenges within the health system is the lack of an up-to-date information technology infrastructure to collect, share and analyse data.  Our structure is not fit for purpose when it comes to the planning to which the Deputy referred.  I imagine we would probably both agree on that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about agency staff.  I am not the financial officer within the HSE but I will ask the HSE's financial officer to give me a report on agency staff.  I will ask specifically that he address the question Deputy O'Reilly has asked about the HSE targets for conversion and how many have been achieved.  I suspect the HSE will not have the figures for me until the year end or that we will be unable to get a year-end figure for 2018, but I will ask specifically for that to be given to the Deputy early in the new year based on the year end conversion figures.</p></speech>

I am keen to put that on the record.</p> <p>  The Minister of State started by saying that health funding remains a major challenge.  I appreciate that but there seems to be a major lack of planning, especially with regard to winter cover - for want of a better term.  It is obvious that things will happen in the winter and the winter is not only December or Christmas anymore.  I find it difficult to get my head around why, year after year &ndash; this is my third winter as a Member of the Oireachtas &ndash; the Department does not seem to be able to get its act together.  I say as much with respect.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?</p> <p>  Anyone who is looking for more money needs to ensure we get value for that money.  Delayed discharges are a major problem.  There is nowhere for discharged patients to go and this needs to be addressed.  There is a lack of step-down beds and home care packages.  Delayed discharges are at the top of the cake.  We need to dig into the matter a little more.</p> <p>  Acute hospitals have exceeded their approved funding level.  Will the Minister of State expand on the reason this has happened?</p> <p>  I am keen for the Minister of State to comment on community services, especially in mental health.

What is the number of staff in the unit?  There is a lack of consultation rooms.  Is there a dietitian available?</p> <p>  Cross-border health care is crucial, but the HSE still has to pay.  There is a myth that this service is magic and free or else that Great Britain's health service is paying for it.  I am keen to highlight that we end up paying for it.  Will the Minister of State comment on why it is necessary for people to think they have to go up to the North when we end up paying for it anyway?  Why not do it here and make it more comfortable for people, especially those from west Cork who find it difficult to make the journey.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State comment on the primary care reimbursement scheme?  Have staffing levels have been increased?</p> <p>  People are still waiting for long periods under CervicalCheck, especially if their first test comes back as unclear.</p><p>I know of a few people in the constituency who have had to wait eight months because of an unclear result.

Her support for these initiatives is very much appreciated.  On winter planning, the Deputy asked the reason we need a winter plan given there is a winter, spring, summer and autumn every year, which is a fair point.  Notwithstanding that comment, there is a unique set of challenges that present during winter time and thus an onus on the Health Service Executive to be prepared for the acute peaks and troughs that occur during that time.  Challenges can become exacerbated during winter time.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, it brought services to a standstill although staff made incredible efforts to get to work.  I accept the Deputy's point but we must have contingency planning for particularly extreme events, which cannot be quantified year on year.</p> <p>  In regard to the flu vaccine for healthcare staff, there has been renewed effort this year to encourage staff to get this vaccine.  We cannot stress enough the importance of healthcare staff getting this vaccination, whether administrative, medical or catering staff.  It is very important that people who work in healthcare facilities get the flu vaccination.  When I was in New York recently I was told that healthcare staff there who have not had the flu vaccination must wear a mask on site.</p></speech>

A flu epidemic is especially problematic for elderly people in healthcare settings, whether acute hospitals or nursing homes.  A nursing home could have to send up to ten of its residents into an accident emergency department at the height of the Christmas period and during bad weather conditions.  Winter planning is important on many levels.  It provides an opportunity to reiterate some of the key messages, in particular the importance of the flu vaccine.  The Chairman will have heard about herd immunity.  The more healthcare staff who are vaccinated, the easier it will be to eliminate the possibility of the flu taking hold in a facility.  It is also important that the people who come into contact with them also get vaccinated.  These are all issues related to winter planning.</p> <p>  On value for money, we are all agreed that value for money has to be to the fore in terms of all that we do.  We cannot just give an additional &euro;20 billion to the health services next year such that all of its needs will be met because that provides no incentive to obtain value for money.</p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about delayed discharges, home help packages, step-down care and the need for approval of more home care packages.  She will be aware that we recently announced 550 intensive home care packages, which are separate and different from one hour's home help in the morning or the evening.  An intensive home care package facilitates people to leave hospitals.  I agree that all of the focus has been on the trolley counts undertaken by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, the HSE and so on.  Trolley counting is a waste of time.  I would have no difficulty with any of my loved ones having to wait in accident and emergency department for two hours for a bed.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Trolleys may not be comfortable but they are expensive.  What is important is that people are treated with dignity and respect.  However, if one of my loved ones was left waiting 19 hours for a bed when there were 20 empty beds in the hospital, I would have a difficulty with that.  Hospitals should be operating at capacity, within reason.  Two hours on a trolley should not be an issue but any longer than that is.  The length of time people spend on trolleys is important but I would argue that the focus should be not on the number of people on trolleys but the number of people in our hospitals who should not be there.  For a vulnerable older person to remain a day longer in an acute hospital than is necessary is dangerous.  Our focus needs to be on that issue rather on the trolley numbers.</p> <p>  On the Bantry hospital issue, I apologise to the Deputy that she did not get the information.  I did ask following the last committee meeting that it be sent to her.  I will follow up on the matter after this meeting.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  On the income shortfall, while I understand the unpredictability of income, it is possible to identify issues based on trends over the past four or five years.  To what extent has this been done?  Are the same issues arising repeatedly?  If so, how are they to be addressed because they are creating unease within the system, particularly for patients who need to access the system?</p> <p>  The issue of public hospitals versus private hospitals and the insurance shift was mentioned.  Perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on that issue.  It was mentioned that a public hospital receives a fee of &euro;80 per night up to a maximum of &euro;800 but this can drag on and become a larger amount.  While this can alleviate the burden on the private sector, it means the public sector is effectively subsidising the private wards.  I have no ideological views on this issue but if it is creating a problem in the funding for the public hospitals, then we need to examine it.  Now is as good a time as any to deal with this matter once and for all.</p> <p>  On the winter plan, much of what has been said today has been said before.  Every winter will test our resources.  I agree with the Minister of State's remark that the trolley count is becoming misleading and that the length of time one spends on a trolley is the critical issue.  It is better if everybody gets a trolley when they enter the accident and emergency department rather than being left in ambulances or at the doors of the hospitals.  The critical issue is the speed at which the patient is dealt with thereafter.  This is what we should be seeking to identify in future counts.  In the past, elderly people were left on trolleys for lengthy periods, which can cause considerable distress.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State will give us some idea of the extent to which we are keeping a tab on developments in that situation.</p><p> I may ask a further question in a minute.  I must get my functions together first.</p></speech>

He is aware of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  There is a wider issue of the use of public and private facilities.  On the question of health insurance, though, and as the Deputy will be aware, when people are admitted through an accident and emergency department, they can be admitted into either the public or private system.  They have been advised by their private health insurance companies to go through the public door.  That is perfectly legal under the Health Act 1970 and they are entitled to do that.  It is then an &euro;80 per night charge up to a maximum of &euro;800 for ten nights.</p> <p>  What were the Deputy's other questions?</p></speech>

He accepts that we should be more focused on the real challenge, that being, what is affecting capacity in our hospital groups and preventing the free movement of people in and out of hospital.  The Deputy was articulate in putting his point about the length of time spent on trolleys and that all of us should be damn glad to get onto a trolley straight away provided we are not left waiting, which is too often the case.</p> <p>  The Deputy made particular reference to older people.  That is a major challenge for us, as there are 1.4 million presentations to accident and emergency departments in a given year and people aged over 65 years amount to approximately 50% of that figure.  I hope I am right about that.  I met a group of consultant geriatricians in Cork recently and that was the figure they gave me.  Ensuring that older people in particular are not waiting unnecessary lengths of time to access acute healthcare is a challenge for us.</p> <p>  Was there another question?</p></speech>

The State Claims Agency seems to be increasing its demand as a percentage of the budget.  Will the Minister of State shed some light on the various issues covered?  Some of them come to mind readily, but to what extent has the Department examined where this is heading?  It looks to be heading in a burgeoning direction, for want of a better description, in the sense that it keeps popping up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#G00800"><p>As a keen observer of the legislative timetable, the Deputy will be aware that two Acts of note have been enacted in the past year or so.  Under one, there are periodic payments so that settlements, especially large ones and compensation awarded in the courts, can be paid out over a period while keeping in mind the wishes of and best outcome for the plaintiffs.  It is hoped that that Act will steady the sharp increases.</p> <p>  It is worth noting that the number of claims is not a massive increase.  This is as much about the size of the awards made by courts in catastrophic injury cases.  There is a separation of powers between the Deputy and me as public representatives and the Judiciary, so we must be careful in discussing this, but it is a matter of fact that the size of the payments is causing the increase as opposed to their volume.  Focusing on just their volume would be too narrow a definition.</p> <p>  I have read the briefing notes and am trying to remember.  The second Act was the Mediation Act 2017, which was enacted in October 2017.  It was an effort to bring about mediation as an alternative to the costly expense and personal trauma of going through court.</p></speech>

I will ask him a few questions one at a time to give him an opportunity to answer.  What was done differently in 2018 than in 2017 to mitigate the overrun?  The 2017 overrun was &euro;200 million.  This year, it is &euro;700 million.  What was failed to be achieved in 2018?  Has there been a change in how the health service plan, which is yet to be published this year, is developed so that the overrun does not continue year on year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#G01200"><p>That is a good question and probably gets to the heart of the issue we are discussing today, namely, the difference in planning and implementation between the two years.  Separate issues can arise, but demand was the main issue.  There was an increase in demand.  Our ageing demographic increased pressure on our health services, which has shifted the overrun's dynamic.  Demand is increasing at a faster rate than we projected.  That is the first difference.</p> <p>  Individual issues arise.  For example, we must guesstimate how much our complex appropriations-in-aid payment arrangement with Britain regarding pensioners in Ireland will cost and then negotiate it down.  Incidentals arise every year.  Storm Emma and so on were of a smaller scale, but other incidentals can be much larger.  I referred to a number of headline issues, for example, primary care and high-tech drugs.  The largest increase in demand in 2017 was down to pay awards.  That arose as the economy recovered and do not arise every year.  They came off the back of a recession.  Our appropriations-in-aid were small.</p> <p>  As the Chairman will know, we are currently agreeing the service plan with the HSE.  There is a keen focus on every aspect of that plan so that we do not perpetuate this cycle of overruns year after year.  Even at this preparatory stage, we are trying to monitor expenditure with the HSE stringently so that the service plan can be on target and realistic, but there will always be "Events, dear boy, events" that are unforeseen and detract from the plan.  For example, this year saw the CervicalCheck issue.  Its cost would not have been that major, but there were cost runs in that of, I believe, &euro;4.6 million for general practitioners.  Small payments like that are not massive in the bigger scheme of things, but they take up a lot of attention and many staff are moved onto such issues.  We want to try to be readier for such developments next year so that there can be a more consistent and constant focus on the implementation of the service plan month after month and that we are coming in on budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#G01300"><p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council maintains that there is weak planning in the HSE and the Department of Health to anticipate expected and unexpected events.  At the end of the year, there is an expectation that, if the health service runs over budget by &euro;700 million, it will be met and carried over into the following year in the hope that, in the following year, the budget will come in on target, but it never happens.  That is down to weak planning.  What can be done to strengthen planning so that we can have an accurate estimate of the cost of the health service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#G01400"><p>It is a difficult one to get right.  I am not a forensic accountant, which the Chairman appreciates, so I will not be able to answer as definitively as I would like.  In 2017, the overrun was much higher than the figure cited.  We are taking the &euro;139 million deficit from 2017 this year, but there was a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;200 million on top of that in 2017.</p> <p>  We could decide to provide &euro;300 million for unforeseen developments, but that would be absorbed by and used up in the day-to-day running of the HSE and none of it would be left by the end of the year.  It would be a blank cheque and could loosen the checks and balances on value for money.  Alternatively, more political decisions could be taken to do this or that or to make pay awards with the &euro;300 million.  Providing it in advance is difficult.  I am focusing on the macro, headline stuff instead of getting into the details with the Chairman.</p><p>That is one step that could be taken.  Then we just learn from the previous year and the anomalies that arose and try to use that in projecting as best we can for the year ahead.  There is an ebb and flow that will always have to be there and that tension between allowing an envelope, a little headroom, in the fiscal space and at the same time it being gobbled up by some demand-led service.</p></speech>

For instance, there was a shortfall of &euro;85 million in income from private insurance companies because they ran a campaign advising patients that they should not be admitted as private patients unless they felt there would be a benefit to them in a public hospital.  That is a substantial hole in a budget of &euro;85 million.  The Minister of State might speak about that first.  How can this hole be filled?  Sl&aacute;intecare speaks of removing private care from public hospitals.  There will be a hole of &euro;625 million or &euro;635 million if that were to happen over a period.  It is happening at present, however, because insurance companies are adopting a different policy in respect of their policyholders, advising them not to sign that they are private patients when going into public hospitals because they will probably get exactly the same treatment as a public patient.  Obviously, this will happen year on year, so how will it be addressed in this year's service plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#H00300"><p>The overarching issue of public versus private and the challenges presented in that regard are, as the Chairman knows, the subject of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, which the Minister expects by, I think, year end, judging from my last conversation with the Minister on the matter.  It is certainly imminent.  It will address a number of issues on both sides.  There will be positives and negatives to it.  It would have been agreed or recognised by Sl&aacute;intecare as well.  There will be a financial implication.  How does one adjust for this?  First, one must not only project for it, but also try to balance that on the other side of the house.  This is why we introduced value improvement processes, VIPs, last year.  The Deputy was trying to get to the heart of our identification of that figure.  One can try to meet somewhere along the way there, and that will address some of it, but not all of it.  Increased funding is probably the main answer to the question of how will we address that shortfall of &euro;635 million as a result, if that is what it comes to be.  We will try to mitigate it.  I was recently in UCD for an event related to Lean Six Sigma, which is a very impressive initiative taking place in healthcare in association with academia whereby they are trying to identify cost savings.  This is an annual and ongoing challenge that we must embrace more and more, to try to do more with less, to lower the level of care.  Sending people into accident and emergency departments for everything under the sun is not the answer.  We need to try to change our processes and reduce costs by getting people treated at a lower level and so on.</p></speech>

First, there is an increased focus on transitional care beds, that is, lower level step-down care.  We all know that the cost of keeping someone in an acute setting is anecdotally said to be in the region of &euro;7,000 a week, and in a community setting, a community hospital, about &euro;1,000 a week.  This is a matter of opening more transitional care beds.  Obviously, we are increasing capacity within the acute system simultaneously.  We are renegotiating the contract with the GPs.  We hope to have that completed by Christmas.  This is ambitious and there is no guarantee it will happen, but we are very confident.  A number of different measures will be involved in that which will move towards that Sl&aacute;intecare ideal of bringing more and more.</p> <p>  One of my hobby horses is telehealth, which I think offers enormous potential for bringing healthcare closer to the person using primary care in that the GP can access consultant guidance and advice and cover there and then from the primary care centre.  I am concentrating more on mental health on my side of things with telepsychiatry, whereby we do not have to have a consultant psychiatrist on site at every emergency department, ED, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  We can have provided by telehealth one person in a hub providing consultant psychiatry to six or seven sites in a 24-hour period.</p> <p>  There are many different strands to this that will be dealt with, and this will be led out by Laura Magahy.  There is about &euro;20 million, I think, to drive this forward.  I see the argument made on Twitter and such places that we only allocated &euro;20 million for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare this year, but Sl&aacute;intecare is a policy implementation, a shift in practice and so on.  It does not require that kind of massive &euro;2 billion funding straight up.  As one lessens the level of complexity and lowers the level of access for people and brings care to them closest to their homes, one can avoid an awful lot of the very expensive, reactive, acute-led medical care that has evolved in the country.  Everyone recognises the current system's dysfunctionality.  I think everyone understands and accepts the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare and agrees that it is the way forward.  However, there will be many steps along the way to reorienting a ship the size of the HSE, and a number of those will begin in the year ahead.</p></speech>

I may ask a couple of questions that were asked before.  Before I go into the budgetary allocations, the Minister of State raised the issue of telehealth.  What regulations is the Department preparing to oversee the roll-out of telehealthcare?  We had the Minister for Health before us in recent weeks and, as we know, in an Irish context, there are no such regulations.  There have been criticisms from the Care Quality Commission in the UK about some of the dangers of telemedicine such as the development of inappropriate prescribing and the lack of part of the clinical examination that occurs.  What regulations are being developed to match the Department's ambition with telemedicine?</p></speech>

Telehealth is a very interesting debate.  In essence, telehealth does not require a whole lot of additional regulation.  Telehealth is just a platform.  It is not a new way of doing medicine.  It is a screen-to-screen communication tool.  At the other end of the screen is a fully regulated doctor or consultant.  I refer to the example in my area of consultant psychiatry.  I want to deliver consultant psychiatry from a hub in Dublin, or it could be Cork, Limerick or anywhere else, whereby there would be one room with a consultant psychiatrist inside, and instead of having to be physically present in the Limerick, Cork, Tralee or Clonmel ED or any other hospital ED, whether in Naas General Hospital or wherever else, he could cover five or six of these sites from the one hub.  What one needs is technology at both ends in order that when my 14 year old son presents at an accident and emergency unit in a state of psychosis at 2 a.m., instead of telling us no consultant psychiatrist is available until 9 a.m., they will turn on a screen in front of him and there will be a consultant psychiatrist who will speak to my son and can assess him, diagnose him, prescribe medication and, if necessary, admit him to an adolescent unit.</p></speech>

I have had numerous engagements with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and it is very enthusiastic about and supportive of this development.  I held a national conference in the National Convention Centre Dublin and brought over clinicians who are doing this in the United States, Australia and so on to speak to the Irish clinicians.  The day was deemed to be an unqualified success from the clinicians' point of view because they learned about this new way of doing things and we challenged all the challenges and asked all the questions of the clinicians, the practitioners and the managers of the health service.  There were 200 or 300 people there.  They questioned all these people and got to the bottom of the matter.  There is no need for us to reinvent a wheel that is already moving.  I was doing this 20 years ago in education when I was a schoolteacher in Leap in west Cork.  We were giving special needs teaching out to islands through technology rather than the special needs teacher having to leave the Leap school, go out to Baltimore and get on a boat or whatever.  This is bringing healthcare 20 years on.  It is a platform, and I know Deputy Chambers' concern is videoDoc and the prescription-----</p></speech>

As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Daly's priority should be ensuring the Department fills the recruitment gaps in our hospital system and that we do not replace or dilute proper care provision in our acute hospital system.  He mentions not having to have a consultant on site 24-7.  They are not there anyway, but we should not dilute proper care provision and proper appointments for something that is not the same.  No matter what, face-to-face will beat telemedicine.</p><p>We should not have a policy of diluting the quality of care.  If one were to ask any 14 year old, he or she would prefer for there to be a team to assess him or her when he or she presents on an acute basis than to be handed a video screen or something like that.  While it is fine to develop a process of telemedicine, it is important we do not replace a proper recruitment provision in our acute hospital system.  Currently, many children who present at hospitals at, say, 2 a.m. must be admitted to adult beds and they are not seen by paediatric psychiatrists.  We should not encourage child and adolescent psychiatrists to work for six hospitals.  Rather, we should fill the recruitment gab.  It is a failure of Government policy on recruitment, retention and pay.  I would not like to see dilution and gaps in recruitment.  While it is fine to develop something different, it should not replace proper, direct care, that is, seeing the doctor at the hospital interface.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#J00200"><p>That was a lengthy and substantial contribution and, therefore, I must respond.  I could not disagree more with the Deputy.</p> <p>  It is a fact that there is a worldwide shortage of consultant psychiatrists.  We are short 60 of them in Ireland.  I cannot make two out of any one consultant, no matter how hard I try.  I can try breeding them or cloning them but I cannot make two out of one.  All the Government policy, pay and everything else will not make two out of one when there is a worldwide shortage experienced by the United States, Australia and elsewhere.  In those places and the rest of the modern world, they have caught up with technology to use it effectively.  There are now so many consultant specialties.  Time was when there was just a consultant psychiatrist, but now there are consultant psychiatrists for adults and for children, as well as consultant psychiatrists with a specialty in anxiety or in eating disorders for children and for adults, but there are not enough of them because people are presenting in their droves.  </p> <p>  Technology is merely a platform.  If there is a consultant on that screen, and if that consultant is fully trained, qualified and accredited and so on, the level of service to the child is not being diluted.  As a parent, if I went to Cork University Hospital at 2 a.m. tomorrow and was told there was no consultant psychiatrist available until 9 a.m., but if there was a remote consultant psychiatrist who was immediately available, qualified, could speak to the child, assess, diagnose, prescribe and admit if necessary, which would I prefer?  Would I prefer my child to be in a state of psychosis in accident and emergency services, with the craziness of it from 2 a.m. until 9 a.m.?  I would happily accept the screen psychiatrist.  </p> <p>  It has been proven that children with autism are more comfortable using a screen, although I am not suggesting that a screen is superior to face to face.  Rather, in a situation where there is a vacuum of 60 consultant psychiatrists in Ireland, I have two options.  I can continue to do what I always did but, as the Chairman noted, if we always do what we always did, we will always get what we always got.  I can answer parliamentary question after parliamentary question to say we have recruitment and retention challenges.  On the other hand, as Minister of State, I can accept my responsibility, step up to the plate and consider a new and alternative way of operating.  It does not make sense to have a consultant psychiatrist sitting for 24 hours a day in the accident and emergency department if there are only two presentations for him or her in that period.  We have to be real about what we do.  This is not to replace human beings.  </p> <p>  There is a vacancy in Wexford, where a consultant psychiatrist left his post in a high-profile manner.  A consultant from Galway visits Wexford every weekend to deliver clinics for children and adolescents, for which she travels a seven-hour journey in total.  I could remove those seven hours in the morning by providing a screen and she would not have to leave Galway because she could assess her patients there with a team which is not remote.  When one presents at accident and emergency services, there are doctors, registered general nurses and a whole team of medics.  The consultant psychiatrist will be part of that team but will not be physically present, and the input will be via a screen to make more available this precious resource that is not as widely accessible as we would like.  </p> <p>  It is the same with the consultant in Galway who requires a full child and adolescent mental health services team.  As the Deputy will know, it is a multi-disciplinary team with eight or nine professionals, but they are led by a consultant psychiatrist.  When a consultant psychiatrist leaves, we do not want that team to be paralysed.  A consultant psychiatrist from another area will be able to use technology, discuss the cases and the caseload, and give advice to the psychologist, the occupational therapist and so on.</p></speech>

I still believe that face-to-face assessment is better for a 14 year old in the circumstances the Minister of State outlined.  I am not sure how the full criteria can be met according to international guidelines, in the light of the information and communication technology guidelines, the mini-mental State examination and the whole process of examination.  While there might be advances in this regard, and while a platform can be built and it is fine to have a vision, if we are to reflect the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of healthcare in Ireland, the focus should be on replacing the posts rather than on what the Government is doing, namely, replacing proper recruitment with telepsychiatry.</p> <p>  In his statement, the Minister of State did not mention the elephant in the room, which is the 80% rise in management spending in the HSE in the past five years.  In 2012, there were 744 employees at grade VIII but there are now nearly 1,400.  What are the Minister of State and the Department doing to address the continuous growth?  Every year it seems the first task of the HSE and the Department is to fill the management positions for people at middle and senior levels and there is a merry-go-round of filling the vacant positions.  The reality of healthcare in Ireland is one of constant spending and bloating.  The front-line workers, whether they be doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals or even secretarial and clerical staff, are the ones at the coalface who are told they must manage and continue as they are if someone leaves.  The bloated top, however, continues to grow.  </p> <p>  I recognise that Deputy Jim Daly has had responsibility in the Department for only two years but, as a Minister of State, he has a duty of oversight to say "Stop."  What is he doing as part of the budgetary allocations to stop the continuous bloating in healthcare organisations, which frustrates everyone on the front line, and the growth in figures?  Even at the peak of the recession, people continued to be promoted to more senior positions and their own positions were filled.  It continues to become more top heavy.  If we are to grapple with difficult budgetary allocations, it needs to happen at all layers and levels, and management is an important issue.  </p> <p>  We know from representatives from the HSE appearing before the committee that nobody takes responsibility.  There are many managers in many different areas but the buck stops with nobody and they do not meet any of their targets or outcomes every year.  For the acute hospital budget, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that hundreds of millions of euro was allocated but there was no indication of the output or the service-level improvement, and there are more managers managing that budget every year.</p> <p>  What is the Department planning with the HSE to address the continued bloating?</p></speech>

I am not a spokesperson for the HSE.  I have a responsibility within the Department that oversees the work of the HSE, but the HSE is better able to answer these questions itself.  I intend, therefore, to give a broader context.</p> <p>  Politicians like to make the popular point that there are many managers in the HSE, that they are all fat cats with massive salaries who promote themselves and so on.  As politicians, we have accountability and responsibility.  We demand accountability, and we want answers for tens of thousands of parliamentary questions that are tabled every day.  The last Deputy that raised this issue with me on the floor of the D&aacute;il is probably one of the Deputies who table the most parliamentary questions on the HSE.  We cannot, however, have it both ways.  We cannot expect such accountability, demand we get all the answers and expect a team of those responsible to appear before us on every issue that arises on the 9 o'clock news that night.  We submit thousands of parliamentary questions and we make representations in their tens of thousands.  Somebody somewhere must deal with them but they are not dealt with by nurses, doctors or front-line staff.</p><p>Those issues are the responsibility of HSE management.  There was a pause on recruitment to managerial positions within the HSE during the recession unless absolutely necessary.</p></speech>

During the very difficult years of the recession, the Government of the time did everything it could to continue the recruitment of front-line staff but there was a pause in recruitment to management positions.  We are now catching up in that regard.  The figures indicate an increase in recruitment.  As I stated, the percentage of managers in the HSE is comparable to that in similar organisations internationally and those data are available for anyone who is interested.  One should consider the hard data and the broader picture rather than taking populist and opportunistic political cheap shots.  I am not unduly concerned on this issue.  I am entitled to my opinion.  As a Minister of State at the Department, I have no vested interest in protecting the HSE which is well able to answer for itself.  However, I am not concerned on this issue.</p></speech>

In fact, the bureaucracy inhibits their delivery of services because the amount of work which they must do to comply with the increasing bureaucracy required takes them away from their patients.  There is evidence from front-line staff that the managerial system is overburdensome and is interfering with the delivery of service.  It may be a political point but it is also a very practical point being made by front-line staff that there is a profusion of management which is interfering with rather than enhancing the delivery of service.</p></speech>

I am trying to broaden how we view and narrate this issue.  The political side of the issue regards how it is narrated in terms of the organisation being bloated and mangers being overpaid and so on.  I accept that HSE management is overly bureaucratic but that is being driven by politicians and the courts.  Reference was made to the level of awards.  The layers of bureaucracy also result from the demand for accountability, as well as European directives and so on.  There is not a culture within the HSE of seeking to create layers of bureaucracy to make life difficult for everybody.  Court cases and demands for accountability by the Committee of Public Accounts or through parliamentary questions result in further layers of bureaucracy.  We cannot have it both ways.  We must accept that those factors are driving the bureaucracy.  The parliamentary affairs division of the HSE is responsible for a significant volume of work, while a large number of staff in the Department are dedicated to dealing with queries from Members of the Oireachtas.  Do we want that level of accountability or not?  These are factors in the debate.  I am not putting forward a blanket defence of HSE management but we must accept there is another side to the issue.</p></speech>

As I have stated on many occasions, the HSE is not the appropriate structure to deliver health services in this country.  The sooner we return to regionalisation, as proposed in part under Sl&aacute;intecare, the better.  However, there are issues to be addressed.</p> <p>  I do not accept the notion implicit in the comments of the Minister of State that politicians asking too many questions is slowing down the system and costing a lot of money.  That is rubbish.  It costs no more to answer a question quickly than it does to answer it slowly.  In fact, the reverse is the case.  To answer it slowly could cost up to ten times as much.  People afraid of certain questions being asked are hiding behind claims that the questions cannot be answered.</p> <p>  How does the system work?  Is it working?  I do not think it is.  It should be simple to transfer a seriously ill patient from one hospital to another, but there are major difficulties in that regard.  Last summer I became involved in the case of a patient with private health insurance of whom a transfer was sought.  I thought the public sector would be delighted to take a patient with private heath insurance and so on, but that was not the case.  There was a shortage of beds.  The hospital had only a couple of vacant beds and they were reserved for emergencies.  The man was in a coma.  The hospital staff were asked whether his case would be considered an emergency.  We should find out what is slowing down the system and why it is not functioning as it ought.  Henry Ford devised a system that was far more efficient than others in operation at the time and produced better goods more quickly, cheaply, and effectively.  I do not suggest that we do things on the cheap, but we can do them far better and more quickly, effectively and efficiently than is currently the case.</p> <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is a means of removing patients from the most sensitive areas of our waiting lists.  The treatments must be paid for one way or another.  If it cannot be done in one system, let us do it in another system, whether that be inside or outside the system or country.  There should be an inevitability about treatment being provided.  If it cannot be provided within the public system, we should get somebody else to provide it.  The waiting lists are not a reflection on the present or previous Government.  Lengthy waiting lists have been common for many years.   Patients may unnecessarily wait up to ten years in excruciating pain for a hip replacement.  They are told to go to their GP and get more painkillers.  That is wasting money.  The way to use the time effectively is to go to the centre of the issue and deal with it.</p> <p>  I am a little concerned by the issue of the State Claims Agency and the increase in costs to which reference was made.  What is the reason for the increasing demand in that regard?  Is it a change in culture or is the State exposed to a greater number of claims arising from the delivery or non-delivery of services?  I will not go into the issue of unqualified medical personnel who infiltrated the system as that was addressed at a previous meeting.  The existence of such issues causes me considerable concern.</p></speech>

I am merely contributing another angle in the interests of the debate.  Of course, I have no difficulty with people holding the HSE to account and questioning it, but we must be aware of the other sides of the issue.  I want the accountability and transparency to continue.  The HSE should not be given a blank cheque to employ as many managers as it wishes.  I agree with many of the points made by Deputy Durkan but I must put the issue in context and broaden the debate somewhat.</p><p>It is not in the interests of winning or losing, or scoring points, or politics, or having to be defensive as a Minister of State.  I have no issue with taking challenges head on.</p><p> Deputy Durkan talks about the style of management within the HSE and if one considers how the private hospitals are run, some of them are run without the layers of management.  I think the Chair wants to make the same point.  There is no question that the private hospitals do not have the levels of management that are present in the public hospitals.  The efficiency of the private hospitals is probably much more impressive, in many cases, than in the public hospitals.  The private hospitals do not face the kind of issues that public hospitals face.  They probably do not have the same level of union issues.  They do not have issues of public accountability and do not have to come before the Department, or other organisations, or prepare parliamentary questions.  They do not have to deal with freedom of information requests and media queries to the same extent that the public hospitals do.  There is an element of that.  I am just saying that by way of contribution to the debate rather than defending what is happening. </p><p> Many people in the Chamber would be vehemently opposed to any further privatisation of health services and their ideological position would be that that is not the way to go.  There is a debate all around as to whether public or private is better.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the purchasing power the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has been given and its increasing power to purchase.  As we are aware, much of that is within the system itself.  It is identifying where there is capacity and moving funds around a bit.</p><p> What was Deputy Durkan's last point?</p></speech>

There was a reference made following an investigation recently about the chain of command.  How is the chain of command operating?  I do not think it is operating at all and I do not think it has for many years, certainly since the health boards and regionalisation disappeared.  There appears to be an amorphous mass somewhere in the centre, a hazy, foggy, no-go area full of pitfalls and traps and all sorts of things where nobody seems to go.  The Minister of State is hinting that everybody is afraid of something.  What are they afraid of?  There would be nothing to be afraid of if the system was working properly.  If everything is done in accordance with the rules, fine, although accidents will still happen.</p> <p>  I mentioned the various causes of claims.  The size and severity of the claims is one thing, but the reason for the claims is another.  I have dealt with a couple of cases recently where there was a clear indication to me that some things that should have been done were not done and patients suffered as a result.  There was a reluctance to admit it, even though full disclosure is supposed to be in operation.  What does one do?  I would have thought that, in such a situation, management would make a tentative offer without prejudice, or whatever the case may be.  None of those things happened.  Cases go to court and eventually, on the steps of the court, somebody decides to settle.  That is not the way to do business.</p></speech>

I remember, as a backbench Deputy in the last D&aacute;il, tabling parliamentary questions on the issue of the number of claims.  I thought, from looking at headlines in the newspapers in 2014 and 2015, that there had been a massive increase in the number but there has not been such an increase.  I do not have the latest figures for 2017 and 2018 but, back in 2015 and 2016, there was no massive increase in the amount of claims.  There has been a cultural shift towards open disclosure and we are trying to get people in and deal with that legislatively in order that people will admit and own up to their mistakes and acknowledge and inform the victims.  The aim of the Mediation Act is to avoid the courts.  There are also periodic payments to try to stagger large payments so they are not all done at the same time.</p><p>While we need to reduce the amount of claims, there is an increase in the number of procedures taking place in our hospitals.  I do not know the quantity of the <i>pro rata</i>increase because I have not seen the figures for 2017 and 2018.  I suspect there was a <i>pro rata</i>increase in the amount of claims.  I hope not but is it potentially the case.</p><p>The establishment of the HSE board will be a positive step towards the oversight of management, holding it to account and ensuring it is not overly bloated.  A good, effective board that will challenge the top layer of management of the HSE will be a positive step that will be established in the new year.  The four of us here all agree that the levels of management within the HSE need to be challenged, held to account and open to scrutiny.</p></speech>

The overrun in the various regions ranges from &euro;86 million to &euro;118 million.  The Minister of State has spoken about the causes of these overruns.  It is a demand-led service and there is an unpredictability about various flu epidemics, storms and snowstorms etc.  I put it to the Minister of State that there is a predictability to health.  For instance, 3,500 people will fall and break a hip every year.  It might be 3,400 one year and 3,600 the following year, but there is a predictability about it.  There is a predictability about how patients suffering from many chronic illnesses will present to hospital.  There is also a predictability about the aging process.  We know that 20,000 people per year go over the age of 65.  The aging population is increasing.  The population over 85 will double in the next number of years.  These are all predictable, actuarial events.</p></speech>

That is the issue.  Each year, the prediction of that variability is off by &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million.  We are spending as much money as the average country in the OECD on health but we are getting substantially poorer outcomes.  Continuing to do what we are doing, as I said before, is not giving better results.  The change that I am trying to get out of the Minister of State, or the idea I am trying to feed him, is that there are efficiencies to be gained by integrating our services.  Our services are not integrated and, because of that, there is a lack of efficiency and value for money.  Sl&aacute;intecare is proposing a huge level of integration.  The first part is integrating hospital groups and community healthcare organisations into a single budget.  That would drive efficiencies in hospital admissions and discharges in transferring care to the community.  Can the Minister of State state that this move will take place in the coming year to bring about that change in efficiency?  We can keep throwing money at the health system but, if it is inefficient, it will not deliver value for money.  The only way to deliver value for money is to have integrated services which, by definition, will bring efficiency.  Perhaps the Minister of State might comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#L00900"><p>I cannot definitively say that those efficiencies will be brought about in the year ahead.  I can definitively say there will be a relentless focus on bringing those efficiencies about.  We have a very dysfunctional architecture underpinning our health system and the committee is aware of many of those issues.  Integration is key to achieving a more cohesive and coherent health service delivery that works for people.</p> <p>  Someone came to my constituency office a number of weeks ago.  They had been in Germany and showed me the new card used there, the equivalent of a driving licence, with a little gold thing in the middle that is the health record for patients.  Every interaction a patient has had with the health service since the day he or she was born is recorded on that one little card.  We have nothing like that in Ireland.  If I go into SouthDoc, then to an accident and emergency department, into acute treatment and back to transitional care, there is shifting of files and paperwork generated and there is a lack of joined-up awareness for prescribing.  I can be prescribed the same thing twice or three times.  Anomalies arise in the system because of the infrastructure and that is the biggest challenge that I see and I have no monopoly on wisdom on this issue.</p><p>My perspective, as the Minister of State at the Department of Health, is to get the IT infrastructure up to scratch and if we can do that, then we can have the integration.  It is very difficult to achieve the level of integration desired.  Each person has a unique perspective and we want an IT system that will facilitate that.  I see that as the single greatest challenge and we must have a relentless focus on trying to get that together.  One can achieve so much more with data and information sharing and when everyone can speak to each other from a clinical, medical and management point of view.  The information we as parliamentarians seek in order to hold the service to account will be so much more seamless if the IT infrastructure is put in place.  That is the single biggest challenge.  While I cannot state we will achieve that in the year ahead, there will be a relentless focus on it.  We have received &euro;250 million from the European Investment Bank with a view to providing the infrastructure to establish the European electronic health record.  That will assist us in taking a significant step towards achieving that but there are many IT challenges in the system.</p><p> Currently, integration is ongoing to align the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and the hospital networks.  That will make for improved information gathering, sharing and the provision of health service delivery.  Such interaction between CHOs and acute hospitals is crucial to deal with an issue I am very animated about, namely, late discharges.  The required level of interaction does not exist currently and never the twain shall meet.  They are two separate domains and it is very difficult to try to get them to join up.  Thanks to Sl&aacute;intecare we are very good at recognising and distilling down the key challenges, as well as the optimum ones from which we will get the best results.  We must now move Sl&aacute;intecare along its journey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#M00200"><p>Could I get an update on the budgetary allocation for the children's hospital?  Has that capital allocation for that changed in the Estimates?</p> <p>  On one level of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, the Minister of State has said there will be a complete split between public and private care, but on another level he has said there will be a problem in terms of a shortfall.  There seems to be a perverse incentive whereby public hospitals are reliant on the private income which they are due to lose, but the Government's policy is to remove the private income.  What is the weaning phase and the plan for private care in public hospitals under the Sl&aacute;intecare plan?  The Department's position is that there is reliance on private income for public hospitals but then the ambitions for Sl&aacute;intecare will not be achieved.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the Minister of State in that regard.</p> <p>  I respect the fact the Minister of State wants to give a position in terms of management, but instead of saying it is an old political chestnut and an opportunistic comment he should acknowledge there is a problem.  The Chairman mentioned it.  Everyone working in healthcare gives feedback to us, and I am sure to the Minister of State, that there is an issue.  In OECD terms we have one of the highest spends but our level of front-line output is probably below average.  We have a mismatch and it is not due to a lack of investment or will on behalf of the Minister of State.  We have a lot of people in management that are not managing the budgetary allocation.  As Deputy Durkan mentioned, while the Minister of State talks about accountability and transparency, we are not getting accountability from anyone.  We cannot even identify who the managers are and how they are matching their targets because there are so many of them.  If eight people are responsible for a particular segment of a care pathway or delivery in a particular hospital, they are not accountable.  What tends to happen is that people get promoted out of their positions and they are rewarded for not necessarily delivering on their own service plans within the healthcare system.  Anyone in the Department, including the Minister of State, needs to build that into the promotion system for managers.  I am trying to be constructive.  I am not trying to raise an old political chestnut.  This is a significant issue and we will never have any progress in Sl&aacute;intecare if we continue to allow the layers of management to grow.  It is not the fault of the Government.  The system has been in place for 20 years.  All parties have had an input into the Department in those years.  I do not lay the blame at the door of the Minister of State but, politically, we need to grapple with it.  Hospital groups were created in recent years and there was a change in Government policy to get rid of them and to replace them with a Sl&aacute;intecare structure.  We have spent a number of years layering up hospital groups and now we are transitioning into another structure.  I am concerned that we are going to add additional layers because that is always a risk when an organisation transitions.  That is the lesson from the HSE.  The layers grew when we went from having health boards to the HSE.  I hope that we have learnt the lessons from that.</p></speech>

He asked about the children's hospital.  As the capital plan has not been agreed yet for this year, I do not have the updated figure or whether there is a projected overrun on the cost of the children's hospital.  I will get the information for the Deputy.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the complete split between public and private health care.  That is the subject of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, which is expected to be provided to the Minister imminently.  I cannot answer the question definitively as to what we will do to separate public healthcare from private healthcare until we get the report.  The details in the report will be used as a roadmap to achieve that end.  There will be cost implications that we will have to handle in that regard.  I cannot say any more until we get the report.</p> <p>  I am not trying to be provocative.  Anybody who knows me knows I am one of the least partisan.  When I talk about politics being opportunistic, I talk about myself and my party as much as anybody else.  I was not trying to be provocative and I apologise if that is the way it came across.  Sometimes, when people talk about the health service, whether it is at the pub counter or outside the church at mass, the blame tends to be laid at the door of the managers.  It is a simplistic solution to suggest that if management was addressed that we would have a great health service.  The point I was trying to make is that balance is required in the debate, but that does not take from what Deputy Chambers said.  My point is halving the number of managers in the morning would not be a silver bullet.  I am not sure that we would be much further advanced if that were to happen.</p> <p>  To clarify, we do not intend to change the hospital groups as part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Chairman can confirm if I am correct in that regard.</p></speech>

My concern is that we have spent four years establishing a system that is now going to be replaced and the Minister is not legislating for that.  The Minister told the committee two or three weeks ago that the Department is not progressing legislation on hospital groups to provide for a legislative and administrative framework, and that Sl&aacute;intecare takes precedence.  He said the hospital groups would be replaced with whatever model Sl&aacute;intecare proposes.  That is what the Minister told the committee and that is the basis for my remarks.</p></speech>

There has been a substantial increase in the cost of the treatment abroad scheme.  Many people are going to Belfast and people are also going to England and other places.  Could the Minister of State talk us through that?

It is a question of awareness.</p><p>They were not aware for a long time that they could travel to another EU state, not just Belfast.  They could go to Spain in the morning to have their hips done and perhaps avail of better sunshine during their recovery.  That is a prospect for people.  </p><p> People can come to Ireland as well to avail of healthcare.  There are different specialties and waiting lists.  Some countries have more capacity in their systems for some procedures and limited capacity for others.  We have capacity in some areas and lack it in others.  We are all aware of the areas where there is a lack of capacity.  They are well highlighted.</p><p> Irish healthcare is much sought after.  I spoke to the head of the police force in Dubai 12 months ago and he wants to do a deal with private healthcare in Ireland for coronary care because the Dubai police force believes the best cardiac care in the world is available in Ireland.  </p><p> The Belfast issue is primarily the increase because people are availing of it.

Deputy Murphy O'Mahony referred to misunderstandings about it, I think she meant politically, that it does not cost the State.  The Government and the taxpayer are still paying for these procedures to be carried out, whether in Belfast or in Dublin.  It is a question of capacity.

For instance, in Scotland front-line staff are asked to identify how efficiencies can be made in their sectors, as opposed to having it come from the top down.  Could the Minister of State inquire about that?  There are many front-line staff who can identify-----</p></speech>

It is substantially cheaper to do it in the GP setting but that never happens.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly mentioned that the &euro;700 million supplementary budget this year for the HSE was undoubtedly made possible by the windfall in corporation tax.  If we are to depend on a windfall in corporation tax every year to bail out the health service, sooner or later that windfall will not happen.  It is almost like depending on stamp duty, as we did in the boom times, to supply services.  We are now depending on corporation tax, which is based on a few American companies operating in Ireland, and if Donald Trump were to change his policy in the morning, that could substantially change our income from corporation tax.  While it goes into the general taxation pool, it almost mirrored the amount required to bail out the health service this year.</p></speech>

The more substantive issue is that we have an overrun in the health service this year of &euro;700 million.  Whether it is being funded by a windfall in that regard or is the result of an increase in another tax, it is probably more important that it is there.  My fear is that our focus will shift to the source of it when we should have a relentless focus on why there is an overrun of &euro;700 million.</p></speech>

In other countries, that is done in the community.  Generally the people on Warfarin are older and are more susceptible to illness.  According to the latest figures, people aged over 70 were the main unscheduled presentations in emergency departments.  If older people who are susceptible to illness are constantly exposed to the hazards of an acute hospital, it is only natural that they are they will be sicker.  There can be efficiencies built in with Warfarin as for haemochromotosis.  Giving the flu vaccine in pharmacies worked well.  I was among the first tranche of pharmacists doing that eight or nine years ago.  The morning after pill has worked and any interventions the Chairman and the Minister of State have made to make it available at the weekend have worked.  We have evidence that when initiatives are moved into the community, they can be more efficient in themselves but also reduce burden of disease as well.</p> <p>  A major reason for admissions to nursing homes and hospitals is polypharmacy, incorrect prescriptions and errors.  There is an incentive for pharmacists in the UK whereby if they make an intervention in a prescription, for example, bringing 12 meds down to six without interfering with doctor's orders, they get something like &pound;5.</p><p>It is not very much, but there is an amount available to make it worth one's while to do the paperwork.  That kind of approach has to be considered.  Sl&aacute;intecare is all about moving from acute care to primary care.  However, looking at the big picture, what is being done?  The money will run out and services will be cut in the future if they are not bedded down into the community with other people taking responsibility for them.  </p><p> I am particularly concerned about those aged over 70 in the winter months.  I do not see any major interventions to try and prevent them from requiring accident and emergency services.  There have been proposals, but perhaps the Minister of State could outline the interventions that have been taken.  Accident and emergency services are not necessarily the right services for those elderly people.</p></speech>

Whether seeking efficiencies, better outcomes or an increase in the number of people being treated, the answer lies in community-led services.  Interesting initiatives, such as that for pharmacies, provide normal rather than distorted incentives for good, common efficiencies in the prescribing and administration of drugs.  There is a significant issue of older people taking too many drugs or taking the wrong drugs.  There have been problems with poly-prescribing, where different sources prescribe different drugs for the same issue.  We should streamline that, which would lead to better outcomes for older people.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about initiatives for older people this winter.  The winter initiative has older people at its heart.  We are trying to provide local clinics and extending GP hours.  The Minister has spoken about this regularly in the past couple of weeks.  The measures are being taken with a view to helping older and more vulnerable people.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the flu vaccine.  I also spoke about it earlier in the debate.  We have to make sure more health workers are taking the vaccine to prevent outbreaks.  I referenced the fact that in some hospitals in New York, healthcare workers at any level who have not had the flu vaccine have to wear a mask when coming into contact with older people in an acute hospital setting.  We are also increasing home care packages.  The Deputy will be aware of the announcement that we have added a further 550 intensive care packages.  We are also examining the problem of late discharges and will take initiatives in that area, including a public communications policy which will advise people, in particular, older people, that the least safe place to be when one does not have to be there is an acute hospital setting.  That is a challenge to normal thinking and is a culture shock to some people, but we must raise awareness of the fact.  There are many hospital-acquired infections with which one might come into contact to which older and more vulnerable people can be susceptible.  Most of us think that the best and safest place for our loved ones aged over 70 is in a hospital.  We are about to start a communications policy advising that it is not; if one does not need to be there, it is the least safe place.  We are also taking other initiatives which seek to prevent people from having to go to accident and emergency services.  We are working with Nursing Homes Ireland to try to build awareness about nursing homes.  Admissions to accident and emergency services should be a last resort and should not be the first option people take, given that it is not the safest place to be unless one absolutely has to be there.  </p></speech>

I have repeatedly made the point that the current allocation model of home help hours is unsustainable.  The Chairman, as a politician and a practising doctor, will be aware that we face a number of challenges in the area.  We do not have the people to deliver the scheme.  We have undertaken to prepare a scheme, which will be underpinned by statute and which will be delivered like the fair deal scheme, where everyone looking for access to it will get it and will be fully funded.  However, we also need staff.  There is a lot of work going on in the background to ensure we meet the terms and conditions necessary for such a scheme.  We also need to reduce reliance on home help as it is in its current form, where it is being delivered eight miles north and south, and provide more options for people so that they can age in a better and more suitable environment, such as supported retirement villages.  This would reduce the drain on home help hours massively and provide a much more enhanced level of care for people.  The Chairman will be aware that the success of Kilmaley retirment village is one of the motivating drivers.</p></speech>

It is denied by some people within the health services that we pay on par with the highest paying countries in the OECD but we do not receive equivalent service.

The Deputy could read the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which goes a long way towards answering the question.  It identifies the steps towards addressing the problem, and shows how we can spend the same amount but achieve much better outcomes.  Essentially we are dealing with an infrastructure which was designed long ago and which is not fit for purpose any more, as I referred to earlier.  That is true in respect of the design of the administrative aspect of the HSE and how it was set up initially, and the lack of IT and lack of investment in infrastructure over the years.  Capacity is an issue that countries with a similar population do not have.  We face severe capacity issues in our acute and community settings, and are trying to reorient services back towards the community from the acute setting in that respect.  Sl&aacute;intecare is probably the best answer to the question the Deputy asked.  The reorientation would be provide much better value for our money, and Sl&aacute;intecare is the ten-year plan we have identified which will make that happen.</p> <p>  I often ask people to consider how far mental health services have come under A Vision for Change, which was also a ten-year plan.  In the 1960s, there were 20,000 people in long-stay, inpatient, acute psychiatric beds.  Today there are less than 1,000.  We have made significant reforms towards community-led service in mental health, and I have no doubt that we can do the same with physical health if we apply the same vigour to it over that ten-year period and embrace Sl&aacute;intecare, regardless of which politician is occupying a particular chair of office over those ten years.</p></speech>

Before we begin consideration of the Bill, I propose to deal with some minor housekeeping matters.  To ensure the smooth running of the meeting, any Member acting in substitution for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk now if he or she has not done so.  I propose that after two hours of consideration of the Bill, we take a short break for approximately ten minutes.  At 10 p.m., if the debate is not concluded, I propose that we consider whether to continue with consideration of the Bill.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with special responsibility for local government and electoral reform, Deputy John Paul Phelan, and his officials.  I ask members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on airplane mode for the duration of the meeting, as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, even when on silent mode.  We will now proceed to consideration of the Bill.</p></speech>

This relates to the new section 13, dealing with staff transfers and plans which is proposed for insertion in the Bill by amendment No. 25.</p><p>Amendment No. 25 proposes to insert a new section 13 about the staff transfer plan into the Bill before the existing section 13 dealing with the transfer of staff.  The new section deals separately with the staff transfer plan that the two local authorities will need to jointly prepare to facilitate the transfer of staff from the county council to the city council.  Section 13(1) requires the two chief executives to jointly prepare a plan referred to as the staff transfer plan in the Bill, which was added as a definition to section 2 by amendment No. 3.  </p>  <p>               It was added as a definition to section 2 by amendment No. 3.  It sets out the numbers and grades who prior to the transfer day were assigned to the performance of functions in the relevant area, whether fully or partly.  The proposal is to transfer staff to meet the staffing requirements for the relevant area.</p> <p> There are different subsections relating to amendment No. 25.  Subsection (3) requires that any disagreements on the preparation of the plan are to be referred to the oversight committee which will make a recommendation to the chief executives.  f Ithe chief executives fail to act in accordance with such a recommendation the Minister may give a direction on the matter under subsection (4), and in doing so, subsection (5) requires the Minister to have regard to the proportion that the population of the transferring area represents of the existing population of Cork County Council.</p> <p> Subsection (6) requires the chief executives to comply with any such direction given by the Minister.  Subsection (7) provides that a staff transfer plan may relate to classes of staff by reference to their grade or the operation of services by the local authority.  Subsection (8) requires the two local authorities to notify the oversight committee of the making of the staff transfer plan.  Subsection (9) provides that the chief executives can make more than one staff transfer plan.</p> <p> Arising from the new section 13 inserted into the Bill by amendments Nos. 25 and 26, which replaces subsections (1), (2) and (3) and the published section 13 dealing with the transfer of staff with a single subsection which provides that the chief executive of the county council shall, after consulting with the city council chief executive, designate for employment by the city council the members of staff required to implement the staff transfer plan prepared under the previous section but for the purpose of meeting the staffing requirements in relation to the relevant area.  Once the staff transfer plan is in place, indicating the numbers and grades required to transfer, the designation of the individuals concerned will be by way of volunteers initially and then on a last-in, first-out basis to make up any shortfall.</p> <p> Amendment No. 27 reduces the notice period in the published section 13 (4) from five months to three months, or any shorter period agreed with the staff member concerned, and this reduction is being proposed at the request of both local authorities.  Amendment No. 28 amends the published section 13 (5) because it is a county council chief executive function to make staff transfer designation.</p></speech>

This is a small change although not a radical one from what was initially outlined, but it inverts the process to some extent in that both local authorities come up with the plan together, whereas in the original Bill there was an expectation that the city council would outline what it required.  That said, the proposed method could work just as well.  I am conscious that amendment No. 26 seems to indicate that once the process is completed, provided there is agreement between them, the obligation rests entirely on the county council to designate the staff who are to transfer.  The potential for the Minister to interfere comes before that.  Could we have a situation where generally it looks as if there is agreement but at the last stage of the process things are slowed down, although probably not permanently?  This mechanism seems to vest more control in the county council for the transfer of staff across to the city council than was previously the case.</p>  <p>  I appreciate both local authorities probably feel the three-month notice period is necessary given that the timeframe is tight but is it absolutely necessary as three months is tight enough for an employee to change his or her responsibilities or, potentially, place of work, which might be the case especially for outdoor staff.</p></speech>

That is a key, sensitive and important part of the changes and it is important that it would be done right.  I could support amendment No. 25 provided that section 13 (7) and (8) in the original document are not replaced or deleted.  I think that is the case but I am seeking confirmation from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Section 13 (7) and (8) are still retained.  They are not being deleted.  The numbering may be different because of what we are inserting but they are not being taken out.</p></speech>

In response to the question from Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, what we are talking about is the transfer of staff from the county council to the city council.  Originally, most of the emphasis was placed on the county council being the authority that was giving up staff and the city council was going to examine its staffing requirements to deal with the transfer of population.  It has become apparent at various stages in this process that if we can get agreement between the local authorities themselves it is probably the best way to approach it.  The purpose of the amendments is to place more emphasis on the fact that we are allowing them to come to their own decisions.  What we have found in this process now that the discussions are getting into the nitty-gritty is that there is a lot more agreement than might have originally been expected given some of the comments that were made when the boundary maps were produced.  We want to place the greatest possible emphasis in the legislation on allowing the Cork authorities to come to their own agreement, but we still retain various measures that I have discussed such that the Minister can ultimately become involved if there is not agreement.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 4 replaces section 5(2) relating to directions of the Minister with a new subsection that spreads the content over two paragraphs.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 19 are minor drafting amendments to remove superfluous commas in section 11.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 21 to 23, inclusive, to section 12 are technical drafting changes.  Amendment No. 21 replaces section 12(2) with revised text that replaces &quot;document&quot; with &quot;other instrument&quot;, clarifies that the provision applies to instruments made by the county council and divides some of the content into two paragraphs.  Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 move some of the content of the existing section 12(3) into a new section 12(4).</p><p>Amendment No. 64 is a drafting change to make the word &quot;purpose&quot; in section 19(2) plural and amendment No. 66 is a drafting change to insert the word &quot;the&quot; before &quot;effective&quot; in section 19(3)(<i>c</i>).</p><p>Amendment No. 73 replaces the words &quot;in respect of&quot; with the word &quot;for&quot; before the first occurrence of &quot;municipal districts&quot; in section 21(3).  Amendment No. 76 has the effect of making the published section 23(3) applicable to interim polling district arrangements made by the county council only.  Amendment No. 75 inserts an additional subsection (2) into the section that is essentially a repeat of the published subsection (3), except applicable to interim polling district arrangements made by Cork City Council only.</p><p>Amendment No. 80 amends section 25(2)(<i>b</i>) by changing &quot;after the transfer day&quot; to &quot;from the transfer day&quot;.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 84 to 86, inclusive, reword the provisions in section 26.  The effect of the first two of these amendments is to move the position of the words &quot;in so far only as it is not inconsistent with this Act&quot; in subsection (1).  The third amendment rewords subsection (4) without changing the meaning or effect of the provision.</p><p>Amendment No. 90 is a technical drafting change to update the collective citation of the Housing Acts in the published section 28(3)(<i>b</i>) to include the most recent collective citation contained in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015. </p><p>Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 are two technical drafting amendments to section 29, the first of which changes the place within section 10(5) of the Local Government Act 2001 where the new paragraph referencing Part 2 of the Bill will be inserted and the second of which changes the order of the words in the first line of subsection 29(<i>c</i>).</p><p>Amendment No. 97 changes the reference to &quot;Local Government Act 1991&quot; at the start of the section 30 provision to use instead the abbreviation defined in section 2 of the Bill.

(1) On the transfer day and subject to <i>sections 10</i>and <i>11</i>, all lands situated in the relevant area that, immediately before the transfer day, were vested in the county council and all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with such lands shall, without any conveyance or assignment, stand vested in the city council for all the estate or interest therein that, immediately before the transfer day, was vested in the county council, but subject to all trusts and equities affecting the lands continuing to subsist and being capable of being performed.&rdquo;.  </blockquote>  <p>Amendment No. 5 substitutes section 9(1) with a provision that is to the same effect, but which is subject to two new sections proposed for insertion by amendments Nos. 8 and 9, rather than subject to subsection (5), the content of which will now be in a separate section if amendment No. 9 is accepted.  Amendment No. 7 deletes sections 9(5) and 9(6), the content of which will be in the second new section.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 is a drafting change that amends section 9(4) to provide that the functions connected with the transferring land shall after the transfer day be &quot;performable by or on behalf of the city council only&quot; whereas the published version provides that the functions are &quot;performable by the city council&quot;.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 create two additional sections, the first of which deals with the delayed transfer of land.  Its purpose is to allow the Cork local authorities to agree that the transfer of certain land should not occur on the transfer day, which is the default position under section 9, but instead should happen at a later specified date.  For drafting reasons, it was not possible to include the provision as an additional subsection due to associated performance of functions and vesting of related chose-in-action provisions needing to apply from the deferred dates rather than the transfer day.  Accordingly, the content of the new section is very similar to section 9 as proposed for amendment.  This provision to enable the authorities to agree the deferral of some land transfers is proposed for inclusion in the Bill at the suggestion of the implementation oversight group.  The associated amendment No. 24 inserts into the published section 12(5) an additional reference to the new section 10 that is proposed for insertion into the Bill by amendment No. 8.</p><p>The second new section created by amendment No. 9 deals with other agreements regarding land situated in the relevant area, subsection (1) of which restates the content of the published section 9(5), but also allows for the authorities to agree to share the use of land transferred to the city council under section 9(1).  Subsection (2) restates the content of the published section 9(6).  This material is being moved to a separate section for drafting reasons to facilitate the changes to the references in section 9(1) that will be made by amendment No. 5 if accepted.</p><p>Amendment No. 10 replaces section 10(1)(<i>a</i>) with two new paragraphs, the effect of which is to impose an earlier date than the transfer day of 30 April 2019 by which to make a designation and to require the local authorities to have regard to the implementation plan in so doing.  This and the other changes contained in amendments Nos. 12 and 13 arose from discussions with the implementation group on how section 10 should best operate in practice.</p><p>Amendment No. 11 is a drafting change to the wording of section 10(1)(<i>d</i>) that provides that the functions connected with the transferring property shall, after the transfer day and in relation to such property, be &quot;performable by or on behalf of the city council only&quot; whereas the published version provides that the functions are &quot;performable by the city council&quot;.  </p><p>Amendment No. 12 inserts two new subsections (2) and (3), the first of which provides that the oversight committee may make a recommendation to the two local authorities that they should jointly make a designation on such property or property of such a class as may be specified in the recommendation.  </p>  <p>               The second new subsection requires the two authorities to notify the oversight committee of the making of a designation under section 10.  The non-receipt of a notification will trigger the oversight committee deciding whether to issue a recommendation under subsection (2) and, if a recommendation has issued, will indicate that the recommendation has not resulted in a designation being made.  This is relevant to what would become subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) if amendment No. 13, proposing the insertion of a new subsection, is accepted.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 13 replaces the existing subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) with two new paragraphs.  The first of these empowers the Minister to also make designations of property by order for the purposes of the Act and the second provides that where the local authorities have failed to make a designation within one month of the oversight committee making a recommendation referred to in the preceding amendment, the Minister shall make the designation within the following two months.  Amendment No. 14 is a consequential amendment inserting into the published paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) a reference to the additional new preceding paragraph.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 15 is a drafting change to the wording of subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) to the same effect as amendment No. 11 and also inserts a further subsection clarifying that multiple designations may be made under the section and may be made in respect of different property and different classes of property.<br/><br/>In section 11, amendment No. 18 inserts a new subsection before the current subsection (2) in section 11.  Similarly to the current subsection (2) provision in respect of property, which will become subsection (3) if this amendment is accepted, this subsection is essentially repeating the subsection (1) paragraphs to apply in circumstances where land is transferred on a date or dates specified in an agreement for the delayed transfer of land.  Amendment No. 20 inserts a new subsection to clarify that the transfer of rights and liabilities arising by virtue of contracts or commitments includes those arising from development bonds that arise under the planning and development legislation.</p></speech>

I am seeking clarification as there is a large number of amendments in this group.  My understanding of the position in respect of transfer of assets from the county council to the city council is that, generally speaking, it was not always the case that any associated liabilities transferred across to the city.  For example, I think the county council was of the view that housing rent arrears might not necessarily follow.  It would be useful to clarify this across a number of headings.  Where assets are transferring across, particularly rent arrears, is the liability transferring with the asset to the city council?  There are a few other examples, including housing loans, but I have tabled a specific amendment on that issue so we can deal with it separately.</p></speech>

Generally, provisions are such that if assets are transferring, liabilities are moving too.  I think there is an amendment to that effect, possibly in the Deputy's name, in respect of the housing stock issue and housing loans.  The view is that if the housing loans are transferring and income will accrue to the city from that, the liability should transfer also.  I was looking at the Deputy's amendment before I came in, although I cannot remember which one it is.  If the councils agree between themselves that the liability should not transfer when an asset is moving, we are allowing them to do so.  Generally speaking, when assets are moving, the liabilities will move with them.</p></speech>

Both local authorities, perhaps unsurprisingly, put forward the position at various stages that they should be indemnified against unexpected liabilities.  It is hard to indemnify both of them against that.  Where there are unexpected liabilities, will the issue be addressed by agreement or in what way will they be split?</p></speech>

There are provisions that if a claim is submitted after the transfer day by a person who, say, had a fall before the date on land owned by the county council, the claim will be made against the city council.  It also means the city council will substitute for the county council in any contracts or services made by the county council before the transfer day that have not yet expired and relate exclusively to functions in the relevant area.  If such a contract applies to functions performable in both the relevant area and part of the county council remaining within that authority's administrative area, the city council will become another party to the contract and payments arising under the contract will have to be apportioned between the two authorities based on population.  Essentially, in the case of an individual who is making a claim against the county council for a fall that occurred in the area that is transferring, the claim will subsequently arise against the city council because the land is being transferred to the city council.  However, this also means the city council will substitute for the county council in any contracts for services that are made by the council before transfer day but have not been executed before that day.</p></speech>

The exception to this is the provision in section 18 dealing with compliance with the Act, whereby the oversight committee may report to the Minister on measures that it considers should be adopted to achieve compliance with the Act.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 58 is to make the section 18 provision dealing with the making of arrangements by the two local authorities for the performance of functions optional rather than mandatory.  It has been put forward at the request of the implementation group which does does not consider that a mandatory provision is necessary.</p><p>Other amendments I am proposing to section 18 are consequential to this change.  These are the deletion by amendment No. 60 of subsection (6) requiring the Minister to make an arrangement if the local authorities fail to so do; the replacement of subsection (7), dealing with the amendment of arrangements made by the local authorities and made by the Minister, with a new subsection that simply provides that the Cork local authorities, after consulting with the oversight group, may amend or revoke an arrangement made under the section; and the deletion by amendment No. 62 of subsection (10) providing that an agreement may not be revoked without the Minister&rsquo;s consent.  The latter subsection is now superfluous.</p><p>Amendment No. 59 is a technical drafting change to remove superfluous text in subsection (3)(a).  Amendment No. 63 is a drafting change to the order of the wording of subsection (11).</p></speech>

If it is to be deleted, there is not much point in amending it.</p>  <p>  My amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 49 are related and 49 and 48 are quite similar in some respects.  In all of my contributions on the Bill, I have been conscious to ensure that both local authorities are as financially sustainable as possible.  There is a strong belief in Cork County Council that there needs to be a commitment to an ongoing settlement which should not disappear after ten or 15 years.  The position after that period need not be as rigid as was the case up to that point but it is fair that there be an ongoing commitment subject to review and negotiation.  A deadline should not be set in that regard.  </p>  <p>                 There is a view that the base amount - the component of the financial settlement that is outside the transfer of assets, offsetting of liabilities, development contributions and so on - that is being paid from the city to the council should be index linked up and down.  The Bill allows for a level of flexibility in that regard, so not being able to rely on a base amount could make life difficult for the county council.</p> <p> There is also a view that some degree of certainty is required around the frequency of payments, which is the basis for amendment No. 49 and Deputy Michael Collins's amendment No. 48.  The financial settlement should be paid on an advance monthly scheduled basis so that the county council can account for it on a frequent basis.</p> <p> My amendment No. 53 is a compromise proposal.  Currently, the Bill provides for a review "not later than 3 years" after the first making of a financial settlement.  The county council fears that the review might start much earlier than the three-year mark, so I have proposed that it should start exactly three years after the transition and be completed within six months.  There has been some suggestion that the second review should be pushed out beyond ten years, but that is not right, as ten years is a reasonable interval.  Amendment No. 53 is a fair compromise.</p> <p> Amendment No. 56 addresses a similar point to one I have already made.  There should be some level of reliance on revising and renegotiating.</p> <p> The amendments I am tabling in this grouping all relate to section 17.  The Minister of State is proposing to do things differently.  I can probably live with that and return to these matters on Report Stage, but I would like some assurances on the general points that I have made before I consider what position to take.</p> <p> A point has been made about subsection (6) of amendment No. 69.  This provision appears in a few places.  I understand that there may be a concern about two local authorities ending up on opposite sides in court to settle their financial differences.  In many of the amendments, there seems to be an effort to address that concern by way of ministerial intervention, reference to the oversight group and so on.  However, a number of the Bill's provisions, including the end of subsection (6), retain that option.  It reads: "that contribution or that part of the contribution that remains unpaid shall be recoverable by the city council in any court of competent jurisdiction as a simple contract debt."  Ministerial intervention has been provided for, but is it necessary to include a provision that still anticipates both local authorities being against each other in a courtroom?  One would hope that they would not end up in that situation.</p> <p> My apologies, Chairman, but I will only make two further points, the first of which is on the proposed section 20(1) in amendment No. 69.  I am concerned by the fact that the county council will have until April 2020 to make a payment in respect of 2019.  If the city council is thin on finance at the end of 2019 for the areas that are being transitioned, will it have to wait until April 2020 to receive payment in respect of them?  Obviously, we hope that the county council would pay before then, but it is still being given that latitude.  I have a concern in that regard, as I am not sure it is wise.</p> <p> I wish to clarify something regarding amendment No. 72.  The new section 23(4) relates in part to development contributions.  Is it still the case that development contributions that relate to developments in the transition areas will go to the city council?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#H00400"><p>I have a 17-page explanation, so I will try to distil some of the points.  We are changing the numbering and ordering because we are inserting a new Part 3 dealing with financial arrangements consequential on the boundary alteration.  This involves replacing section 17.  There is a provision - I will try to find the exact reference to it - for indexation, or the time value of money, which is how I learned it.  I will provide it to the Deputy when I find it.</p>  <p>  We have made an effort to remove any potential route for litigation, but the contract debt provision remains as a precaution.  It is a legal thing, as there must be some bottom line.  We have tried to minimise its number of mentions.  It is like a backstop, to use the hackneyed phrase.  There has to be a final means by which that contribution can be recovered.</p>  <p>  The measure on a review after three years has been removed in direct response to contributions on Second Stage, which many of the Deputies present made.  They spoke about the potential impact of a review after three years.  In our current proposal, the city council can effectively communicate with the Minister of the day the reasons it believes that the compensation should either be removed or, after an examination, reduced.  It will be up to the Minister of the day to make that call.  Galway City Council was established as a separate authority in 1985 and is still making payments to Galway County Council on a compensatory basis 33 years later.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, we felt that a mechanism at the ten-year mark whereby an application could be made to vary or drop the compensatory package was probably a fair balance between the original three-year provision and the suggestion of stretching the review period out further.</p>  <p>  The reason Cork City Council is being allowed the flexibility to make the 2019 payments up to April 2020 is because a great deal of change will happen in the council in the next six or eight months and it will need a larger window than the normal calendar year to calculate and make the payments.  It is an attempt by officials in the Custom House to recognise the difficulties that local officials will face in reaching that calculation.</p>  <p>  In terms of indexation-----</p></speech>

It will actually be a payment from the county to the city.</p></speech>

I will be doing that a lot, I expect.</p>  <p>  Regarding indexation, the proposed section 22(12) in amendment No. 71 outlines the definition of "annual contribution".  In connection with amendment No. 40, this allows for an indexation value to be placed on the compensation.</p>  <p>  I believe I have dealt with many of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

He did not explain the 2020 deadline.  He visualised it the other way around but I am not sure the county council needs that flexibility.  I am not sure I agree with getting rid of the three-year deadline so I proposed a reasonable balance.  If the calculation is drastically wrong or disadvantageous to the city council, it is reasonable to wait three years for a first review.  To leave it ten years without reconsidering it is too much if it turns out to be wrong.  I am not sure it is fair.  There should be an ongoing commitment beyond the ten years.  Does the Minister believe that exists within this legislation?  The county council has to have some sense that it will continue beyond that.</p></speech>

The amendments to this section propose a much more detailed line-by-line description of expenditure heads.  It is believed, and hoped for, by the Department that it will not allow any unforeseen costs or expenses emerging.  The issue relating to the extra window for the county council is the same but in reverse.  There is certainty in that the city council will know that funding is coming and it can go to the courts to get the funding fully paid.  To have it all included in the calendar year could place too much of a restriction but it is not envisaged that it be allowed to drag on indefinitely.  It just places a looser timeline on the payment of that particular contribution.</p></speech>

If that does not happen, I may need to table an amendment on Report Stage, to which I must refer on Committee Stage, to change the necessary time allocated and the published Part 3 or Part 4 to provide for later dates for the publication and enforcement of the register of electors for the two Cork local authorities than those specified for all local authorities under the Electoral Act 1992.  There may need to be a specific extension of the time period.  It is a technical matter.  The amendment will seek to allow the Cork local authorities more time if we do not get our work done in time.</p></speech>

(2) Subject to paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section 18 of the Act of 2000, any local area plan in force immediately before the transfer day in respect of an area within the relevant area shall, on and after that day, continue to apply to the first-mentioned area until the next making of a local area plan by the city council in respect of the first- mentioned area in accordance with the said section 18. <br /><br />(3) The Cork County Council Local Economic and Community Plan in force immediately before the transfer day in respect of the functional area of the county council shall, on and after that day, continue to apply in respect of the relevant area until the next making of a local economic and community plan by the city council in respect of the functional area of the city council in accordance with section 66B of the Principal Act. <br /><br />(4) For the avoidance of doubt, the city council may&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) in accordance with section 13 of the Act of 2000, make a variation of the development plan first-mentioned in <i>subsection (1)</i>in so far only as that plan applies to the relevant area, <br /><br />(b) in accordance with <i>subsection (5)</i>of section 18 of the Act of 2000, amend or revoke a local area plan first-mentioned in <i>subsection (2)</i>in so far only as that plan applies to the relevant area, and <br /><br />(c) perform functions under section 66F or 66G in relation to the Cork County Council Local Economic and Community Plan referred to in <i>subsection (3)</i>in so far only as that plan applies to the relevant area.  </blockquote>(5) In this section&mdash;  <blockquote> 	&ldquo;development plan&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2000; <br /><br />&ldquo;local area plan&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2000.&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>The amendments relate to development plans and local area plans.  Amendment No. 77 provides for the replacement of section 24 with a new section, now to be headed &quot;Development plans, etc. relating to the relevant area&quot;, which is a restatement of the published section 24 but expanded to include the local economic community plans, LECPs, as mentioned on Second Stage by a number of speakers.  Subsection (1) provides that the Cork County Council development plan applicable to the relevant area before transfer day will remain in force in that area until Cork City Council makes a new development plan after transfer day.  Subsection (2) provides that any local area plan in force before transfer day, in respect of an area within the relevant area, will continue to apply until Cork City Council next makes a local area plan for that area.  Subsection (3) provides that the Cork County Council LECP enforced before transfer day will continue to apply for the relevant area until Cork City Council next makes its own LECP.  Subsection (4) is an avoidance of doubt provision which clarifies that Cork City Council may vary the development plan or amend or revoke the local area plan that continued to be in operation under the previous subsections but only insofar as the plan applies to the relevant area.  The city council may also perform functions such as monitoring and reviewing economic elements of the Cork county LECP and reporting on that assessment but only insofar as the plan applies to the relevant area.  Subsection (5) defines the development plan and local area plan as having the meanings assigned in the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>Amendment No. 78 will delete the words &quot;permission granted or&quot; from section 25(1) to clarify that the subsection is intended only to provide for a continuing role by the county council in processing planning applications made before transfer day to the point where a decision is made to grant or refuse the application.</p><p>Amendment No. 79 deletes the published subsection (2)(a) and replaces it with a new subsection (2)(a) to clarify that after transfer day, the city council will become the planning authority for planning applications decided or appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la determined before transfer day, apart from cases where enforcement proceedings had been commenced by the county council.</p><p>Amendment No. 81 amends subsection (2)(b) by inserting a requirement for the county council to consult the city council when finishing enforcement proceeding cases that had commenced before transfer day.</p><p>Amendment No. 82 replaces subsection (3) with a new subsection (3) that removes the reference to contributions paid under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 from the provision.  This change is proposed because of information received from the county council to the effect that isolation of contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in the area of the planning authority as a whole which are paid and not yet expended in the case of developments in the relevant area would not be possible.  The provision deals only with section 49 contributions that will vest in the city council, that is, earmarked contributions for specific projects, and that will continue to require to be expended on public infrastructure services and projects in the relevant area.  </p>  <p>               The final amendment to section 25, amendment No. 83, adds "development" to the terms defined as having the meaning assigned by the Planning and Development Act 2000 in subsection (5).</p> <p> Amendment No. 100 proposes to insert a new section, after section 30, dealing with the making and review of development plans by Cork local authorities, the purpose of which is to enable the Minister to extend by order the statutory time limits applicable to the development planning process.  The new section amends sections 9 and 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to enable the Minister, by order, to add an additional period of not more than one year to the normal six-year period within which Cork City Council and Cork County Council must make a development plan, and to provide similarly in regard to the four-year period applicable to the giving of notice of an intention to review the development plan.</p> <p> The new section 32 proposed by Opposition amendment No. 103, involving the amendment of section 13 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, is, I imagine, for the same purpose as Government amendment No. 100, which I have just discussed.  If so, I hope Deputies will take that into consideration when considering their amendment No. 103.</p></speech>

I will address those two amendments but, before I do, I have a question that is relevant to the grouping as a whole.  What happens to a Part 8 process that has started before the transition date?  There is every likelihood the county council or city council may not proceed in order to avoid that.  However, what will happen to Part 8 processes that either span the transition or are completed shortly beforehand?  We need to ensure projects initiated by the county council continue to flow to the city council as smoothly as possible.</p>  <p>  On amendment No. 103, the point is made by the city council that the regional spatial and economic strategies are due to be adopted in March 2019.  Under the Planning and Development Acts, the city council is generally required to start the process of a new city plan within 13 weeks, which would be June 2019.  This makes the process a busy one and some flexibility would be reasonable.  If it is covered, that is fair enough, but from the explanation the Minister of State has given, I am not sure it is.</p>  <p>  On amendment No. 102, I have discussed the issue previously with the Minister of State.  As a councillor for one of the largest transition areas, I had the experience of working in a municipal district.  Despite having been sceptical at the outset, and the experience of councillors in different municipal districts was different, we had a very good municipal district and it worked very well.  It kept local issues off the county council agenda and ensured they were dealt with at a local area level.  It is a good model.  I know there are area committees in Dublin and in other places but these do not have the same statutory basis.  While it might not be in order for full local area plans to be made by municipal districts in a city such as Cork, although there may be a value in it, municipal districts can make by-laws.  I believe it makes sense to do this at a more local level.  It makes sense for municipal districts to adopt or comment upon the municipal allocation or the budgetary allocation that is coming from the city council.  If that statutory structure is provided for dealing with very local issues and taking very local budgetary initiatives, it will be a value to those councillors in that ward or municipal district, but it will also ensure the city council as a whole is far more focused on the overall policy direction and strategy of the city and metropolitan area.  I think it is a good model and we should have it, or something like it, in the city.</p></speech>

The Part 8 process will stay with the county council until it has been completed and then move with the relevant area so the city council can continue and take up where the county council has left off, effectively.  It does not disappear.  It will not be finished for the county council until the process is completed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#L00700"><p>That is the formal process.  As the Deputy knows, the Part 8 process can take a while.  Rather than getting the city council to start the ball rolling from scratch again, the county council will complete the formal legal process and it is then part of the transfer for the city council to implement whatever the Part 8 is.  Amendment No. 100 takes account, at least partially, of the point the Deputy makes in amendment No. 103.  We propose to allow the Minister the discretion, if asked by the local authorities, to grant a time period of up to 12 months of an extension to the existing development plan to allow for the drafting of the new development plan.  That is not to say it is necessarily up to 12 months; it is just to provide a window for the planners and the councillors considering it, so they can do the thorough work that is involved in drafting county development plans.</p>  <p>  In regard to the municipal districts, the municipal district structure does not exist in city authorities in Ireland.  I understand the point the Deputy is making in the broader context of municipal districts.  Their impact and effectiveness vary greatly from local authority to local authority.  Some local authorities have very well embedded, supported and funded municipal districts that operate very successfully.  However, in other local authorities the structure is still weak and many of the issues the Deputy noted that should be dealt with at local district level end up going back to the full plenary session of the council.  That is a matter we will have to return to in the future.</p>  <p>  It is open to Cork City Council, as it is to Dublin City Council, to designate area committees, although these do not have the same powers and functions.  All of these sections of the Bill relate to Cork specifically.  A decision was taken that in providing for the planning and development of Cork into the future, we should look at Cork city as one entity rather than continuing the current system, where bits of it are in certain municipal districts in the county, with different local area plans.  There should be one plan for the city of Cork, regardless of whether there will be different constituent parts of the new city in the future.</p>  <p>  There are strong identities in some of the areas the Deputy represents on the south side of Cork city, as there are on the north side.  Effectively, urban villages that were in County Cork up to now will be in Cork city.  There is a particular issue in regard to Ballincollig, which has traditionally been separate.  Through continuous development over the years, Cork city has spread to Ballincollig, and it would be impossible for anyone here to envisage a Cork city in 20 years of which Ballincollig is not an integral part.</p>  <p>  I will have to talk to the Minister of State, Deputy English, about the provisions for separate local area plans for some areas which are a very identifiable component of the new extended Cork city.  I would be willing to talk to him before Report Stage to find if some leeway can be found in the Planning and Development Act that would allow for a more locally based area plan for specific parts of the newly constituted Cork city.  </p>  <p>               If possible, the Deputy might leave it with me until Report Stage.  I will talk to the Minister of State, Deputy English, to see if it can be included, although it may be that it cannot.</p></speech>

I am encouraged by that.  I would add, however, that it is not just the planning element; there are also the by-laws and the budgetary and statutory requirements.  There are area committees in Dublin which work pretty well and there are no statutory requirements in respect of them.  We need to look at that.  I would be obliged if the Minister of State could return to this on Report Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#M03000"><p>I move amendment No. 87:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 24, to delete lines 13 to 16 and substitute the following:<br /><br /><b>&ldquo;28. </b>(1) Any charge in respect of&mdash;  	 <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	(a) the local financial year in which the transfer day falls, or<br /><br />(b) any preceding local financial year,<br /><br />that, immediately before the transfer day, was due and payable to the county council shall, from the transfer day, continue to be due and payable to the county council unless the city council and the county council agree otherwise.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>This amendment seeks to replace subsection (1) of section 28.  While it is mainly a drafting change, it also allows the two local authorities to agree an alternative to the default position whereby existing arrears of the main revenue sources remain payable to the county council if such an agreed alternative suits them.  Similarly, amendment No. 88 again allows the two local authorities to agree an alternative to the default position, whereby the main revenue sources remain payable to the county council in respect of all of 2019, if such an alternative suits the two local authorities.  Amendment No. 89 inserts a new paragraph (b) into subsection (3) to include entry year property levy within the provision.</p><p>As I understand amendment No. 91, its purpose is for the mortgage debt of housing loan recipients in the relevant area and associated loan repayments to remain with the county council.  We were discussing this earlier.  I do not propose to accept this amendment because the normal arrangement that applies to a boundary alteration is that the housing loans and all associated management of those files will transfer across to the new local authority, in this case the city council.  It is the city council that will receive the subsequent repayments and will also deal with any consents to resale that might arise in the future.</p><p>The Bill provides that assets and liabilities will transfer to the city council on the transfer day and that repayments are payable to the city council from 1 January of the following year.  The liability owed to the Housing Finance Agency associated with the mortgages for the properties will transfer from the county to the city as will the income stream which will offset the debt owed to the agency.  There is not going to be any change to the term or tenure of the mortgage holders.  It would be unusual to change the position in respect of transferring the liability along with the asset.  For that reason, I will be opposing this amendment.</p></speech>

It is a loan.  There are approximately 150 of these properties in the transition areas, not a huge number.  However, there is concern that the level of administration involved in their transfer from the county to the city would mean proportionately a significant amount of work for the city while it would actually be far easier to just let it rest with the county.  There are numerous questions there.  All the transactional data would have to come across.  The county council would have to provide the city with complete paper files.  There would have to be a risk profile.  The county council may have initiated legal proceedings in respect of some of those borrowers, potentially.  There would be changes to statutory reporting requirements to the central credit register.  Then there is the issue of loan accounts that are in credit.  While I think the general approach that is being taken makes some sense, although I would hope that the Department will consider resources for a lot of these issues, I think the housing loans are a particular category and I am not sure they can properly be categorised as an asset.</p></speech>

I understand the point the Deputy is making.  He is saying that it is not a large number of housing loans.  However, we want to make a clean break and it would be very messy if these remained with the county council even though they are in the area that is being transferred to the city.  I do not dispute that it may take up extra man hours and we are providing additional substantial resources to both local authorities for the changeover period.  I do not think the fact that the process itself might be difficult is sufficient reason to make an exception for housing loans.  It is clearer and cleaner if the transfer includes them.  I do understand the issues the Deputy is raising but I think it should happen.</p></speech>

There is a contractual obligation with the council but there is no obligation in terms of housing maintenance, tenancy or anything like that.  If the Minister of State will take that into account in advance of Report Stage, I might withdraw the amendment.  I ask that he communicate with the city council.</p></speech>

I do not like saying "No"; I suppose I am a real politician.  The main purpose of all of these sections of the Bill is to expand Cork city.  It would not be consistent with that purpose to allow these to remain with the county council even though they will be physically in the city in the future.  It is cleaner that way.  I cannot accept amendment No. 91.  I have enough to be doing to talk about the other couple of amendments and about others in future.  I think this one is just messy.</p></speech>

How it came about I do not know; it has never happened before.  My own neighbours are contacting me continuously.  The Deputy is correct that I am the person who will sign the statutory instruments.  I could decide not to sign them but we must remember that there are local elections in the near future.  People are deciding to run and are making decisions about it.

This would result in a population of 6,357 remaining within the County administrative area (based on the census 2016).&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>I will try not to delay progress on this Bill because there are quite a few amendments listed tonight.  I want to revisit amendments Nos. 45, 48, 50 to 52, inclusive, 55 and 57 on Report Stage but for now I will discuss this amendment, which is hugely important for the people of Blarney.  We are talking about 6,357 people.  I have to take feedback from the areas represented by independent councillors, such as Councillor Kevin Conway, who has made it clear to me that the people of that area do not want to be brought within the city boundaries.  The people feel their voices have not been heard.  The people of Blarney certainly feel like that and I know something like 6,000 people signed a petition against this in Ballincollig.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could clarify to the people of Blarney that they will not be brought under the city council area.</p></speech>

The task was given to the implementation group to look at the maps and delineate between the areas which would be in the city in the future and the areas that would remain in the county.  Undoubtedly there was surprise when the maps were produced.  We are all politicians here, and we know that when boundary maps are produced, usually for electoral purposes, surprises often happen.  Some of them can be unhappy surprises.</p>  <p>  This is somewhat connected to the response I gave to the Deputy on the previous issue.  There already has been a designation of the areas that are expected to be in the city council for the next local election.  This also goes to the heart of the whole process of the group looking at where the boundary lines should be drawn.  I, no more than anyone in the Oireachtas, know how difficult issues about boundary lines can become.  Moving the lines goes to the very core of people's identity.  The Deputy would agree that if the proposal was to move Goleen and Ballydehob into south Kerry there would be ructions.  Some people in south Kerry might be happy about that-----</p></speech>

This agreement was subject to the inclusion of the necessary legislative provisions within the Local Government Bill 2018 and the future submission of more detailed proposals on the plebiscites and the questions to be put to the electorate, as well as the specific powers to be given to mayors.  The provisions proposed for inclusion in the Bill by this amendment facilitates the holding of the plebiscites.</p> <p> The proposed new section 32(1), inserted by amendment No. 104, contains definitions applicable to the new part 5 of "directly elected mayor", "local authority", "plebiscite" and "proposal".  "Directly elected mayor" means the cathaoirleach of a local authority elected by the electors of the authority&rsquo;s administrative area on whom is conferred some or all of the functions currently performable by the chief executive and such other functions as are provided for by legislation.  In this part, "local authority" means Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council or Galway City Council and Galway County Council together; "plebiscite" means a plebiscite of the electors of an administrative area that is required to be held under this part; and "proposal" means a proposal to provide by law for a directly elected mayor of the administrative area of a local authority.</p> <p> The new section 32(2) provides that the administrative areas for the purposes of this part are those of the five local authorities referred to.</p> <p> The new section 33, inserted by amendment No. 105, provides: in subsection (1), that the proposal is to be submitted to a plebiscite of the electors of the area to which the proposal relates; in subsection (2), that each plebiscite is to be held on the day and at the times appointed by the Minister by order; and, in subsection (3), that it be conducted in accordance with regulations made by the Minister under the new section 34(3).</p> <p> Subsection (4) states that at least 30 days before the day appointed for the plebiscite, the relevant local authority is to cause information relating to the proposal to be circulated so as to bring it to the attention of its electors.  That information is to contain a summary of the functions and office of directly elected mayors for the local authorities concerned, the likely impact on the relevant local authorities&rsquo; performance of their functions, relationships between the offices of directly elected mayor and those local authorities and with other relevant statutory bodies, the estimated cost and resource implications, the possible advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposal, any impact for the functions of any other statutory body and any other information the Minister considers appropriate, through subsection (5).  Subsection (6) requires the Minister to issue guidelines to the local authorities in relation to the information to be circulated under subsection (5).</p> <p> The new section 34, inserted by amendment No. 106, empowers the Minister, under subsection (1), to make regulations for the purpose of this part.  Subsection (2) lists a number of matters for inclusion in the regulations, including the form and wording of the ballot paper; the arrangements and requirements relating to publication of notices and the provision of information to electors; the appointment, duties and staff of the returning officer; the taking of the poll; voting and counting of votes; the maintenance of the secrecy of the ballot; the procedures to be followed in the case of misconduct, disorder, obstruction or interference; modification of electoral offence provisions applied by the new section 35; and other appropriate matters.  Under subsection (3), the regulations will require to be approved by resolution of the Oireachtas.</p> <p> The new section 35, inserted by amendment No. 107, applies to the plebiscite's relevant electoral offence articles that are contained in the local elections regulations of 1995, subject to any necessary modifications that are specified in the regulations made under the new section 34.</p> <p> The new section 36, inserted by amendment No. 108, specifies the persons entitled to vote in the plebiscites as those entitled to vote at local elections for Cork City Council, including those being transferred under this Bill from the county to the city, Galway City Council, Galway County Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council.</p> <p> Under the new section 37, inserted by amendment No. 109, within two years of the holding of the plebiscites, the Minister must submit a report to the Oireachtas specifying either legislative proposals to establish the office of directly elected mayor for any of the local authority areas concerned or his or her reasons for not submitting such proposals.</p> <p>  The new section 38, inserted by amendment No. 110, provides that the costs incurred in the holding of a plebiscite are to be borne by the local authority.</p></speech>

This is an entirely new section of the Bill and we have not had an opportunity to discuss it, or even to see it, until this evening.  I want to talk about issues that arise from it and expand upon views about which the people who vote for me feel strongly.</p>  <p>  I welcome the principle of what the Minister of State is bringing in.  He is bringing in directly elected mayors of certain local authorities, or combinations of them.  I will just talk about my own area of County Louth.  I have looked at the figures for population growth in the last census and, outside of the areas mentioned in these new sections, plus Dublin, the next largest town in the country is where I live in Drogheda.  That is followed by Swords, Dundalk, Bray, Navan and Kilkenny.  There are new changes in local government and I recognise the Minister of State has support of Members from Cork and other places for what he is doing.  I accept and acknowledge that it will not be possible in this Bill to get the outcome I want, but the Minister of State can start the process by master-planning for areas like Drogheda where there has been significant growth over the past number of years.  People may argue about the size of towns.  If, however, one compares the population of Waterford city, 53,504, with that of Drogheda, approximately 42,000, one discovers that they are relatively close.</p>  <p>  People want to be in control of their own local destiny.  Whatever decisions are made in places like Cork, and I have no issue with that, the people in south Louth, where I live, want to control their future.  Drogheda and Dundalk are major towns.  Drogheda is the sixth largest town in the country and Dundalk is the eighth largest.  These are huge urban areas.  The population of each is greater than the populations of Leitrim and Longford.  I am not arguing for changes in those counties.  They have their county managers or chief executives, the relevant infrastructure, etc., but Drogheda, the populations of which is greater than those counties, does not have that and will not get it under this legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this aspect.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State might consider a master plan that includes Drogheda, the sixth largest town in Ireland, through the urban renewal generation fund, or whatever other mechanism he can find, to fund, control and plan for proper and accountable local government in that area.  The problem that will then arise is with the area contiguous to Drogheda in County Meath.  There are different views on this.  The general population of east Meath, Drogheda and the greater Drogheda area is in excess of 80,000 and yet there is no definitive one-stop shop for administration there.  The Minister of State's second tranche of amendments will probably cover some of this.</p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister of State to come back on Report Stage, or any other appropriate time, to look at the master-planning for areas like Drogheda which need to be in control of their destiny.  They have the population and urban pressure.  They have infrastructural deficits that need to be addressed and which were not addressed in the latest round of funding from the Department.  I am not blaming the Minister of State for that and I will take the matter up with the officials later.  Would the Minister of State consider that as a constructive way of engaging with a significant need?  </p>  <p>               Finally, the spread of the greater Dublin area, GDA, is highlighted by all of those large towns, almost all of which are on the east coast adjacent to Dublin city.  They all face significant pressures that are not being dealt with.  Certainly, the existing local government infrastructure neither meets nor is accountable to the needs of their population.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.550" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#R00200"><p>When we debated a motion in the D&aacute;il to allow these amendments through, one of the concerns a number of us raised was that we only received the amendments the previous evening.  While the Minister of State had signalled his intention to bring them forward, it still gave us little time to properly scrutinise and get our heads round them.  I acknowledge that he made time for us today to go through some of them but given that we were only able to ask for that last night and schedule it today, we did not have a great deal of time.  That is no criticism of those seated on the other side of the room but it begs a question.  I will repeat some of these points when we deal with the next set of amendments because it is even more substantial.  Substantial changes to local government are being proposed by way of amendment with limited scrutiny at almost 9 p.m. in the middle of a bunch of other matters.  I am on the same side as the Minister of State on this in the sense that I am a supporter of directly elected mayors and if the powers and the relationships between those offices and the other structures of local government are correct, I would encourage people to vote for it, but the Government is making it difficult for us.</p>  <p>  The reason I say that is I was part of the mayoral reform in Dublin when the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Hogan, proposed a plebiscite in Dublin for a directly elected mayor.  Councillors from the four Dublin local authorities were asked to debate and vote on this and if all four local authorities voted in favour of the plebiscite, we would have it.  The difficulty was we were having that discussion in a vacuum.  We had no idea what the powers would be.  We had no idea whether powers would be sucked upwards from the local authorities into the office of directly elected mayor and whether powers would be devolved from Government agencies, Departments, etc.  While three of the local authorities, including mine in south Dublin, voted in favour of the plebiscite despite the fact that we did not know, the major problem in Fingal County Council was that in the absence of any certainty, the local authority was not willing to allow the proposal to go forward.  The Minister of State will tell the committee, as he did earlier, that next year we will deal with the more substantive issues of powers and relationships, etc., but that legislation will not be passed before these plebiscites.  The Government might be able to say what it would like to do if the plebiscite passes and if it gets the legislation through.  That involves many ifs and buts.  That is as sure way to lose a plebiscite or, certainly, a way to confuse the public and make it difficult for the public to engage with the issue.  I am on the Minister of State's side on the principle of this but I am genuinely concern about the sequencing of it.</p>  <p>  Given that the Minister of State is telling us that if the legislation goes through and the plebiscites pass and the people in the respective areas support the proposition, it could be up to two years before he publishes a report to set out the legislation, does that mean the timeline for directly elected mayors is subject to the passing of a plebiscite for the local government elections, not next year but subsequently?  If that is the case, why are we rushing what essentially is separate legislation in amendments to this Bill?</p>  <p>  I also have some minor concerns on which I may table amendments on Report Stage.  I would much prefer if the Minister of State would examine them because if he tables amendments in this regard, they are more likely to pass.</p>  <p>  Without opening up the Galway debate because we will have that afterwards, it is presumptuous the way Galway is inserted in this.  I understand there will be a plebiscite in the two local authority areas as they are currently constituted but if, for example, the good people of Galway city and county in their wisdom at a later stage decide to follow the Cork model and instead of a merger opt for a boundary extension, although I do not say the Minister of State would propose that, then the plebiscite in May of next year will not be valid for what the new enlarged Galway local authority.  That is a matter for folks in Galway to go through in detail.  It is none of my business as I do not represent the area but it is a significant problem under section 32.</p>  <p>  Section 33, which I raised at the briefing earlier, relates to the information to be provided.  We are aware of the difficulty we have in referenda.  An independent Referendum Commission has been set up because of the difficulties relating to Government bodies issuing information on referenda.  It is all very well to state that the local authority, following regulations from the Minister, will provide factual information but let us wait to see when we have the plebiscites whether facts become opinions and opinions become differences.  I am concerned that those regulations might not require sufficient independence in the presentation of the information that we are accustomed to in referenda.  That could just be a genuine difficulty.</p>  <p>  I do not understand the timeline in section 37.  Why two years?  Why not six months after the passing of the plebiscite?  If, for example, the good people of Cork or Limerick vote in favour of this, why wait two years?  Why not, within a relatively short period, bring forward at least the Government's outline proposals?</p>  <p>  I have a concern about costs under the new section 38.  We are being asked to impose the costs of these plebiscites on the local authority but we do not know the costs.  I raised this with the officials, who stated that they had some indicative costings.  If they could share these with the committee, that would be good.  For example, a cash-strapped local authority that has passed its estimates might have to take a decision to limit the distribution of material to fit the budget available to it when it comes to the plebiscite next year, and that could impact on the overall turnout whereas if the local authority were to decide to send literature to every house in the city or county and place new advertisements in the newspapers, the costs will become significant.  For some of the smaller local authorities, &euro;20,000 can become &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000, and while I appreciate these plebiscites will be carried out on the day of the local and European elections in order that the count and related costs will  be covered, even the dissemination of information could involve a significant cost.  Does that mean, for example, if we agree the amendment to section 38, that Galway city or Limerick city and county councils must revise their estimates, even to find &euro;20,000, &euro;50,000, &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000, depending on the cost?  If the Minister of State can reassure us on his estimations of the cost, I would be grateful.</p>  <p>  It is unclear to me why Dublin is not included.  I do not seek an amendment to include Dublin because there is a set of complexities in Dublin but many parties, including my own, would support such a proposal if the configuration is correct,.</p>  <p>  My party will not oppose this amendment, although I will, subject to the replies, at least have recorded my opposition to the proposed new section 38.  As somebody who would like to enthusiastically support this, the Minister of State is making it difficult for us.  If he is making it difficult for us, the debate in the public arena will be even more difficult for much of the electorate when it comes to the plebiscite.</p></speech>

I have a concern about the timing of something as fundamental as this being included at a late stage in the Bill.  I recognise that the Minister of State and his officials briefed members earlier.</p>  <p>  I recall the proposal of a previous Minister for a directly elected mayor in Dublin when my local authority was the only one of the four in the region that opposed it.  The reason the councillors in their wisdom did so was there was no detail as to how the directly elected mayor would operate and how the functions of that mayor would integrate with the existing local authority structures, and I agreed with them.  That question still remains.  It is happening now because we have a local election and a European election in May next year and the Department or the Government has taken a view that it would be expeditious and cost effective to have these plebiscites on the same day.  The Minister of State might clarify that.  I would like the cost element in the new section 38 clarified.</p>  <p>  I would like to understand the logic of the inclusion of the four areas the Minister of State has selected.  One could question the Minister of State's native city.  The people of Kilkenny are always at pains to tell us it is a city.  Why is the other city in this country not included?</p>  <p>  I refer to the points Deputy O'Dowd made.  I could mention Swords.  We could mention towns that are larger than cities such as Kilkenny and ask why one would do it.</p>  <p>  I would like to get a handle on the timeframe.  </p>  <p>               In the amendment to section 33 the proposal is that: &quot;For the purposes of a plebiscite, the local authority concerned shall, not later than 30 days before the day appointed under <i>subsection (2)</i>, cause information relating to the proposal to be published&quot;.  How advanced is the work within the Department on the functions of directly elected mayors?  What functions will they take from the chief executive?  What will be the term of a directly elected mayor?  Those are fundamental aspects of how a directly elected mayor would operate.  In section 33 the Department is effectively saying that we would have that information 30 days before the plebiscite but I think we need to do a lot better.  I accept the Minister is setting that as the minimum, but when people are unsure about things they generally vote against them.  As an individual who supports directly elected mayors, as does the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, we want to make sure that we are going to get this right and that it is not rushed.  The measure appears rushed.<br/><br/>The proposed section 37 deals with the reference to two years.  It states: &quot;The Minister shall, in respect of each administrative area in respect of which a plebiscite is held in accordance with this Part and not later than 2 years&quot; lay a report.  The reference is to an &quot;area in respect of which a plebiscite is held&quot;.  I take it that it means where a plebiscite is passed.</p></speech>

We want to make sure that people have the information in good time to make an educated judgment about this.  The functions are the fundamental piece behind this.  Does the Minister of State have a timeframe for bringing those proposals back to the committee and to say here is what we are looking at by way of the functions of the directly elected mayor?  Does the Minister of State intend to do so or does he intend to leave it to the Department to simply publish them within 30 days of those plebiscites being held?</p></speech>

I do not agree with what the Minister of State is proposing on the plebiscites for a directly elected mayor.  I have always supported the system we have in Galway.  I think it works very well.

We passed a mammoth memorandum to do with pre-legislative scrutiny on Government notices, but in the main for Bills that have approximately three sections.  Without any pre-legislative scrutiny the Minister has written a new Bill in an old Bill.  He has doubled the size of the Bill.  I could not believe it when I looked at my computer this morning to check the amendments for this evening's debate.  There are 41 pages of amendments to the Bill and there are 37 lines of text in every page.  When I pick up the Bill itself I find that it is not even 30 pages because the back page is taken up with the Long Title.  There are more pages of amendments than pages in the original Bill.</p>  <p>  I am long enough in the House to know the form.  When one comes back after the summer break or the Easter break the House is looking for something to debate for weeks and weeks.  Those of us who are around here for long enough know that nothing ever changes.  We can have all the reform we want but in those weeks we discuss reports and look for something to do and especially coming up to Christmas we suddenly have to do a year's work in two or three weeks.  This Bill adds insult to injury because not only are we doing a Bill but we are doing a Bill within a Bill.  It is Shakespearian; it is like a play within a play.  We got the amendments after Second Stage and they have significant implications.  As a Minister I once foolishly added something to a Bill after the Bill had gone through the Seanad and it was in the D&aacute;il.  It was not a major issue and although it looked very innocuous at the time it was probably the decision that caused me the most grief as Minister subsequently.  I learned that one should not trick around with the Houses or with the people.  The longer a Minister spends in a committee going through a Bill in a constructive and interactive manner, accepting changes and making amendments, the less grief the Minister will face in the future.  A Minister should never dismiss amendments, no matter who suggests them, as long as they have validity.</p>  <p>  What we are getting at the moment is a different approach.  The approach is that what we have decided we will push through.  I am astounded to find that Galway is included in the plebiscites.  We will come to the more substantive issue when we get to the opposition from my party and from a number of my colleagues to the section on the joint chief executive.  It seems to me that despite the fact that the vast majority of public representatives in Galway believe that the Government should adhere to Eoin O'Sullivan&rsquo;s report, which says money first and all other issues after that, the Government insists on trying to put the cart before the horse.  This is a very serious situation.  Rushed Christmas legislation is seen as the norm.  It is used as a device because people are busy with visitors in the House.  There are so many things going on around the place that one would want to have bilocation to get to all the events this evening.  The view is that people will take their eye off the ball, get tired and that the Bill will be passed.  </p>  <p>               The Government probably will get it passed, but if the Minister of State believes that will be the end of things, I guarantee that it will only be the beginning of the grief the Government will suffer.  It is making a major mistake in its approach.  It would have been better to introduce a separate local government Bill next year that incorporated all of these provisions.  Instead of waiting until the last minute and proceeding without any public discussion or consultation, it would have been wiser to hold off and do what we all promised at the beginning of this D&aacute;il, namely, to be open, transparent, interactive and inclusive.  It was to be new politics, there would be no more ramming things through and we would bring democracy back to Ireland.  Other elements of this Bill smack of not trusting elected representatives.  For some time, there has been a consistent theme of trying to reduce their power over matters.</p> <p> I have learned to be wary of bulky documentation and amendments where there are words and words and words.  I encountered the perfect example of this yesterday.  At a meeting with the National Transport Authority, NTA-----</p></speech>

It is dangerous not to address the issue when it arises in a form such as this.  Obviously, it is difficult early on to engage the public in light of all these dry words, but it will have massive consequences.  At a meeting with the NTA yesterday, I sought an explanation as to why the cost per kilometre of fares to Claregalway or Carraroe is twice the cost of fares to Oranmore or anywhere in Galway city.  According to the chief executive of the NTA, the fundamental reason is the national planning framework in that people would be encouraged to live outside the cities if bus fares were fairer.  When we passed the national spatial strategy, we might not have realised that the effect of doing so would lock us into a double-fare basis for those who live outside the magic circle.  Like that situation, I am convinced that, if we pass this Bill as is and opt for plebiscites in Galway, we will eventually find that there were many hidden agendas because the Government was afraid that, if it was upfront with the people, they would reject them.</p></speech>

The first line of the report on Galway points out that it needs funding.  Some moves are afoot and the Minister of State has had two meetings with us, for which we thank him, but this is not just a question of &euro;500,000 or &euro;1 million, it is a question of many millions of euro.  That has been pointed out to him.</p>  <p>  There is a major concern in rural areas of Galway.  The municipal districts are under pressure.  Unfortunately, populations in particular areas are not what they once were.  We must face the fact that some rural villages will go into decline.  Representation in such places is important.  We must ensure that money is ring-fenced to try to keep them vibrant.  All politicians are trying to ignite small villages in rural areas, including in Galway.</p>  <p>  We are putting the cart before the horse.  It is fine if the changes in Cork are going to go through - the Opposition supports them - but I do not know much about Cork.  We will vote on those changes but we will know damn all about them.  The people from Cork know more about them than any of us.  In terms of Galway, though, the changes need to be well thought out and done right.  The first step is to put the money in place so that Galway is on a level playing field.  It is agreed by nearly everyone that the system of allocations is flawed.  We need to right that for Galway and every other county that has not got its fair share.  Galway borders many counties and has many peripheral areas.  Every Deputy and councillor is working hard to try to pull a few quid to those areas.</p>  <p>  By its nature, Galway city will expand.  It is already nearly out to Barna.  There does not seem to be a plan for Galway.  I would have a Luas or something in it.  The outer bypass is being built but transport infrastructure is needed.  I can get to Dublin as quickly as I can drive to Galway, which is only 40 miles away from my home.  That is not a good situation for people who travel to the city in the mornings.</p>  <p>  Those in Galway's peripheral areas are very worried that they will become the forgotten people.  Regardless of whether we like it, the city will extend out past Oranmore.  That is a fact.  The areas in question will become more prosperous, which is good and no one would disagree with it, but there would then need to be extra city councillors who would look after their own areas.  I do not know much about mayors in different places, but my understanding is that there were many problems in Limerick.  People have referred to Tipperary.  What are the Minister of State's thoughts in that regard?</p>  <p>  We are from Galway and we do not know enough about Cork.  I mean no disrespect, but it would be like someone from Cork talking about Galway in that he or she would not know the ins and outs.  Galway deserves something of its own.  There is no such thing as "we are willing to engage" - we are actually willing to work with the Minister of State.  The first lines of the report say enough.  They basically say, "Show me the money".</p></speech>

It is wrong.  Galway should not be included in the Bill at all.  It is a simple matter.  Galway has been included in the Bill and the reason for that leads to a lack of trust.  We are now discussing plebiscites.  I am not against plebiscites in general but I have an issue with the manner in which this is being done and the extra stuff we are to be given.  I will not repeat what I stated in the D&aacute;il.  However, this is a cynical exercise meant to deflect us from the real problems on the ground in Galway, which I will address when speaking to the amendment.</p></speech>

The budget for Galway was not passed last Monday when it was supposed to have been.  This was because the council does not have the funds to pass the budget and it is not the first year but the third year it has found itself in this position.  None of us is against a plebiscite but the lack of trust among all the sitting councillors in Galway is unbelievable.  The further one goes away from the city and into the rural communities, the more one feels aghast at the disparity between city and county.  The fact that this has found its way in with Cork has increased the distrust.  I attended all the meetings around the merger and the report stated at the outset that funding was required so I am here to say, "Show us the money".  This comes at a price and this is what councillors are looking for.  I am representing them as their voice.</p></speech>

I support Deputies Fitzmaurice, Connolly and Rabbitte on this issue.  There is a major problem with funding and offering a small amount of money to the various municipal districts is not much of a carrot because the deficit is so big.  The city and the county have a total population of roughly 320,000, which is very large, with 275,000 in the rural areas.</p></speech>

Numbers often do not add up and perhaps that is at the heart of this discussion.</p>  <p>  In reply to Deputy O'Dowd, the amendments were circulated on Monday evening.  Other Deputies have stated that more time would be desirable but it was firmly indicated on Second Stage that there would be amendments in respect of the plebiscite and on urban area committees.  The plebiscite chunk of amendments concern the actual structure of how a plebiscite would run and the subsequent actions the Minister of the day might take.  It would be inappropriate to spell out what powers the directly elected mayor might have.</p>  <p>  In early 2019, perhaps in February of that year, the Government intends to consider a memo, though it has not been drafted yet.  I suggest we have either a meeting of the joint committee or statements in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I am perfectly prepared to do this for as many hours as necessary because there is not as much to divide parties on the issue of direct election as there is on other issues.  It would be good to have this well in advance of when the memo goes in so that we can feed into it.  Once the memo is adopted it can form the basis of the information to be made available to the public in advance of plebiscites taking place.</p>  <p>  Members asked questions about timelines.  It is stated that it must be done within 30 days but that does not mean it will be done on the 31st day.  It is a statutory minimum.  Another issue concerns reporting within two years.  If the plebiscites are held and rejected, the reports should be short and sweet, and very quick.  The report on actions to be taken if the plebiscite has a positive result would be more lengthy but it puts a backstop to it.  As Deputies &Oacute; Broin and O'Brien stated , this discussion has been taking place for years in Dublin but there has never been an end point.  The plebiscite issue would have an end point of two years but it would not be my intention to make this a minimum period.  In fact, it would be a maximum.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd asked about urban area committees.  Part 6, which comprises four sections, speaks to that issue.  It is a big issue in the Deputy's part of the world, with a huge chunk of Drogheda in County Meath.  A huge chunk of Waterford city is in Kilkenny but we will not go into too much detail on that.  I only looked at the headline issues in the applications which were made by the different local authorities and, as I understand it, some local authorities opted out of making any decisions themselves under the urban regeneration fund and put in nine or ten applications.  That is not the basis on which to secure funding for anything.  Some local authorities put in very specific proposals and secured funding but the Drogheda relief road was not, to the lay person, urban regeneration.  A master plan for Drogheda, or for any town, would very much be part of urban regeneration.   The application system will open again next February.  Before Report Stage, I will speak to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for planning issues, Deputy English, regarding the reasonable suggestion that areas which have been designated under the national planning framework as areas for development should get more resources to allow them to pursue that development.</p>  <p>  In answer to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, there will be a memo in January and I have no problem having a debate in committee or elsewhere.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about pre-legislative scrutiny but my understanding is that the committee did not seek prelegislative scrutiny on this.  The Galway proposal was in it when the decision was made so I cannot be accused of not being available.  There have been multiple meetings on this issue and there will be many more but it is factually incorrect to talk about prelegislative scrutiny as the committee made a decision not to do it.  It is not my fault nor the fault of my officials.  I am not saying it is the committee's fault because this is a particularly busy committee.  In fact, there is great merit in the idea of local government having its own full committee because of the amount of stuff that comes before the committee.  </p>  <p>               The Cabinet adopted a report about three months ago.  It was one of the first reports I presented to Cabinet and it was on the issue of directly elected mayors.  It received some publicity in the newspapers and it was submitted to the committee for consideration.  The committee is busy and it was not considered by it.  That is not my fault or the committee's fault because it is grappling primarily with housing.  It is also not a fair criticism to say that the discussion did not happen.</p> <p> There are certain time sensitivities associated with this Bill, not least the fact that people will contest local elections next year.  In Cork, people who are considering running want certainty about boundaries.  There are issues about the establishment of electoral registers, which we mentioned with regard to an earlier section of the Bill.  I know the point that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is making about rushing legislation.  I have been here for 16 years and there is always a pre-Christmas rush.  We have been looking to get on the schedule with the Business Committee for a long time.  I would say to all members who have representatives on the Business Committee that we want their support to get legislation to the committee more quickly.  Now that we are here, we should have the discussion.  It is not any effort on our part to stop it from coming to this point.</p> <p> Deputy Grealish spoke of a merger.  If the merger goes ahead, it should and will be in a separate Bill.  There will be a local government Bill 2019 next year, which will primarily be about Galway, but like all other local government Bills, there will be other sections relating to other aspects of local government.  It is an area in which there is legislation which often refers to different issues.  Galway will have its own Bill next year.  The Deputy does not agree with directly elected mayors and I would suggest that many people in local government do not agree with them.  There is no answer.  People differ and the public will decide ultimately.  Galway was included in this Bill with regard to chief executives because all the mergers that have happened in Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary started with the appointment of a joint chief executive officer.  I will go into some detail on what we propose to do with regard to funding.  When I got this position, about 18 months ago, there was a significant long-running problem in the funding of Galway County Council.  It stems partly from the fact that the city council established in 1985 had an impact on the funding for the county.  It was never dealt with properly.  I will speak about that later.</p> <p> Deputy Eugene Murphy spoke about issues which I will come back to, including finance, as did Deputy Fitzmaurice.  He spoke about the understanding in Limerick.  One can ask our Oireachtas colleagues in Limerick about it.  The city has transformed.  Whether it is transformed by the merger of the local authorities or not-----</p></speech>

There is a geographic issue in Galway.  It is a huge county.  Deputy Connolly mentioned this on Second Stage.  The geographic area will not change much.  The population is obviously changing.  How do we ensure that we create a powerhouse on the west coast?  I would see a united local authority as being a leading part in transforming the fortunes, particularly of County Galway.  Many of those towns and villages have become dormitory towns.  Their centres are gone because people are doing their shopping and business in Galway city.  That is an argument in itself for having a single, unified local authority.  I do not know if Deputy Connolly is necessarily aiming this at me.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  When one looks at the county and city of Galway, where the city is doing okay and the county has, in certain areas, suffered for a long time, it is partly due to funding of the local authority but partly due to planning and the lack of retail, business and infrastructure in those towns and villages in County Galway.  I think a unified local authority will benefit those places that have become dormitory towns which we want to become functioning towns again in the future.  That is the purpose of the Galway change from my point of view.  I do not want to be seen as bullying anything through.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned it and threatened grief on me afterwards.  There is no attempt to bully.</p></speech>

In accordance with subsection (11), the members who are not councillors are non-voting and cannot be the chair.  The chairperson of the urban area committee is to be appointed from among the members by the members, unless the members fail to do so within two weeks of their appointment to the committee, in which case the Minister will appoint a chairperson.  </p><p>The urban area committees are to hold as many meetings as are necessary for their functions, and their local authorities are to set the date and place of the first meeting of the committees.  Committee meetings are to be chaired by the chairperson, if present, or else by a member chosen by those present.  Questions are to be determined by a majority of the voting members, with the chairperson having a casting vote.  The meeting quorum is four voting members.  </p><p>Subsection (12) provides that the committees may act notwithstanding membership vacancies and subsection (13) provides that they may regulate their procedures, subject to this section.  In accordance with subsection (15), administrative support to the committee is to be provided by members of staff selected by the committee from nominations made by the two local authorities in consultation with each other.  Subsection (16) requires the assignment of support staff to perform functions on behalf of the committee under its direction and control.</p><p>Amendment No. 113 inserts a new section 41.  It relates to the designation of the greater urban area and local area planning.  Subsection (1) provides that an urban area committee may designate any part of a local authority administrative area that adjoins the urban area for the purpose of this section, dealing with its functions.  Subsection (2) provides that if the committee has not made such a designation within three months of its appointment the Minister may make the designation by order.  Subsection (3) provides that the functions of the planning authority under chapter II of part II of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which concerns local area planning, are to be performed by the urban area committee in relation to an urban area, and subsection (4) provides similarly in relation to a greater urban area. </p><p>The main function of the urban area committee will be the production of the local area plan for the cross-boundary urban area and its contiguous areas as designated by the committee, including the appropriate zoning as an explicit function.  In the case of these towns and cities, the current position whereby the local area plan is required to be consistent with the local authority's development plan will be reversed, and the development plan content for both local authorities will have to follow on from, and be consistent with, a local area plan made for the cross-boundary area. </p><p>It will not be possible for either local authority to amend or revoke the local area plan approved by the committee.  Transferring responsibility for local area planning to the urban area committees in this way necessitated a number of provisions to adapt how the local area planning provisions within the Planning and Development Acts are to operate in respect of the committees.Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) in subsection (3) accordingly amend or adapt how sections 18 to 20 of the 2000 Act apply to urban area committees performing local area planning functions for the urban area.  Subsection (4) applies many of the subsection (3) modifications to the performance of local area planning functions for the greater urban area and also adds a number of additional adaptations in that subsection's paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>).  </p>  <p>               Subsection (5) disapplies section 131A(1) of the Local Government Act, 2001, which relates to the performance of reserved functions in respect of municipal district members and part 2 of the associated Schedule 14A includes local area planning functions from the urban area committee functions prescribed in this section.</p> <p> The final section in this part - the new section 42 &ndash; is an amendment of section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 114.  It amends section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to add a new subsection (11) providing that a provision in a development plan that is inconsistent with a local area plan made by an urban area committee under this Act shall not have effect in relation to the urban or greater urban area concerned.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that they are coming so late and I want to put on record that we might need to make amendments to these on Report Stage.  I hope the Minister of State will accept those amendments on Report Stage because we have not had a chance to have a decent discussion on this whole section.</p>  <p>  I assume this urban committee is made up of the two cathaoirligh from each administrative area, six councillors and two to four members of society, based on auditing.  I have a slight concern as to why we need four members of society at this stage on a committee when we trust our local councillors to adopt local area plans, to adopt county plans and to adopt regional plans at assembly level.  Why are we bringing in private people at this stage to a democratic process that has served us well in the past?  I would like to get some of the reasoning behind that.</p>  <p>  It is equally being said that the private sector has no voting rights if I am reading the Bill correctly.  On the election of the chairman of that committee, do they have a say at that point?  I ask  because it states: "The chairperson of an urban area committee shall be appointed from among the members".  It does not say anything about voting rights in that respect.</p>  <p>  What sort of powers are being given to this urban committee?  I am not sure if it has to follow the same rules as the local authority when it comes to local area plans or county development plans.  Is it short-circuiting that process?  At one point it is proposed that "For the purpose of this section, an urban area committee may designate any part or parts adjoining the urban area concerned of an administrative area of a local authority in which part of the urban area is situated."  Is the Minister of State proposing that without any consultation, this committee has the power to expand the boundaries wherever it deems fit?</p>  <p>  When this committee does its own urban area plan, must it follow the same procedure as a local area plan or a county development plan or can it short-circuit that process?</p></speech>

This was designed to fix a particular problem and the difficulty is that the way this is designed may work for some areas and not for others.  Alternatively, it may work for one part of a geographical area that would become one of these urban area committees but we do not have the opportunity to tease that out with those organisations or individuals.  While I can see the logic in introducing the measures on plebiscites, particularly with the deadline for registration, I am still at a loss as to why we are dealing with this significant proposed change to our local government structures in this way.</p>  <p>  If I read it right, there could be an urban area committee that is made up of a very large geographical portion of one county and a very small geographical portion of another county but they will have exactly the same number of representatives.  There is a democracy question around the proportionality of the representation that they have.  As the voter base difference can be very substantial, I ask the Minister of State to clarify that with as much detail as possible in order that we know where the upper and lower limits of all that would be.</p>  <p>  While the only voting members of the committee are elected members, there is no guidance on those elected members being in some way representative of the councils that they come from.  For example, if one party has a simple majority in the council, it could dominate all three elected positions, rather than having something that is proportionate.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify exactly how that would work.</p>  <p>  I refer to the staff in the proposed new section 40(16).  Correct me if I am wrong, because we have only had two days to read this, but it seems to be that the staff requirements can be decided by the committee, irrespective of whether the city or county manager or the chief executives approve.  I do not understand how that works from a HR, staff management and resources point of view.  Who will replace those staff for a period?</p>  <p>  There also does not seem to be any level of consultation with the elected members of the broader electoral authorities.  Again, I ask the Minister of State to correct me if I am reading it wrong.  The super-committee of eight, with two chairs and six ordinary members, will agree the plan, but as an extension of Deputy Casey's question, does it have to go back to its two respective local authorities to get that approved?  Does it approve it itself?  How is that process outlined?</p>  <p>  I refer to the issue of costs.  This committee will make profound decisions.  By the way, it might make really good decisions and decisions that are very popular but the local authorities will have to bear the costs of those decisions.  Is that the most democratic way of doing it and how is all of that determined?  The same issue arises with zonings.  There could be very controversial decisions on zonings, which could raise all sorts of complicated issues and I am not clear around all of that.</p>  <p>  I am very uncomfortable with amendment No.-----</p></speech>

I am genuinely interested in the logic of that and what was the thought process.  I am not convinced that there has been sufficient consultation with the elected representatives and the managers in the affected areas.  Can the Minister of State tell us the areas to which this will apply in the first instance and what engagement there has been with the elected representatives there on this specific proposal?  I am not asking about what consultation happened in terms of the boundary reviews previously but specifically on this point.  I may come back with a supplementary question on that.</p>  <p>  Without wanting to recommence the war, given the difficult week the Minister of State has had in the courts, could he give us a real life example of how this works?  Whether it would controversially be the Minister of State's area or another area, I ask him to talk us through how he sees it because I am thinking of-----</p></speech>

It would have been better if it was brought forward as a stand-alone Bill because at least then there would be an opportunity to properly tease out what it all means and the implications of the proposed Part 6 for local authorities.  It would have provided the opportunity to consult with the stakeholders and also to have a consultation process.  I am a bit concerned it has been brought forward as an amendment to a Bill that deals with something else.  It will cause concern for councils across the State that will be affected by it.</p>  <p>  I have a number of questions that flow from the amendments because there are a number of things that are not clear.  It states the urban area committee shall appoint members from local authorities - six in total.  I imagine if there are two local authorities, it would be three from each.  What does it mean by "appoint"?  Are they elected by the members of the local authorities?  How are they appointed?  How does it work?  What is the relationship with the local authority when they are appointed or elected?  It also states the people who are appointed should have experience and expertise in the provision of transport and housing and the development of infrastructure, business and trade.  Who determines that?  Who determines what expertise is and what experience is?  Will it be more defined?  </p>  <p>  I have a concern about the making and amending of local area plans.  Perhaps I am wrong and the Minister of State might clarify it for me.  It seems to suggest that, once established, these urban committees can formulate their own separate local area plans that could supersede local area plans already agreed by local authorities.  It would be very problematic and cause a lot of tension and difficulties for local councils and their CEOs.  How it will work needs to be properly explained.  It also refers to "a local area plan prepared by a planning authority insofar as it applies to the urban area in respect of which that urban area committee was appointed."  It causes me concern.  </p>  <p>  Another area of concern is in the area of development plans.  It seems to suggest the urban committee could amend development plans that are crafted democratically by local councils.  How will that work out?  I am struggling to come up with an example of how it will work.  Waterford-Kilkenny is a good example.  I think the Minister of State would agree the population of the metropolitan area of Waterford city is 45,000.  If this was put in place for the Waterford-Kilkenny area so that it included the part of Kilkenny known as Ferrybank, the urban area committee would then cover an area with a population of 50,000, the vast majority of which would be in Waterford.  If there were three representatives from Waterford and three from Kilkenny it would not be seen as very democratic and would be highly problematic.</p>  <p>  What consultation has there been with the CEOs of any of these councils?  What consultation has there been with the elected members?  I contacted a number of elected members from all parties from Waterford and none of them was aware of the amendments or what it would mean.  What engagement was there with the representative bodies of local councillors?</p>  <p>  For all those reasons, notwithstanding whether or not there is logic to what the Minister of State is proposing, although I have some concerns about it, it should be brought forward as a stand-alone Bill.  My suggestion is to withdraw the amendments, come back with a stand-alone Bill and let us have the full consultation and Second Stage contributions.  If the Minister of State feels there is logic to it, it can be teased out and people can put forward legitimate and proper amendments.  Tabling amendments in this way to a Bill that has already passed Second Stage is not the way to deal with a very complicated and contentious issue.  It will be treated with suspicion for that reason.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendments and come back with a stand-alone Bill.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.648" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#EE00300"><p>I agree with much of what Deputy Cullinane said.  These changes are very significant and in many respects could be very positive.  I see the objective, particularly in areas that cross council boundaries.  It is a question I had.  I thank the Minister of State's officials for the list of the eight urban area committees.  How were they selected?  Is it restricted to those eight?  I could give examples of many others that cross council administrative boundaries in the four Dublin local authorities, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others could.  If I take the Clongriffin area between Fingal and Dublin city, it is a massive area.  An urban area committee such as this would be a very positive thing there.  Fringe committees, such as the northern and southern fringe committees, tend not to work.  They tend to be run by officials.  There are no elected members on them.  There is no buy-in.  There is much to the concept.  </p>  <p>               I have some questions.  I am conscious of the time but something as significant as this deserves more scrutiny than we are able to give it in the time available.  The municipal district councils are not mentioned in this section.  On the appointments to the urban area committees, will the three members from each local authority be from the municipal district councils in the relevant areas or will they be drawn from anywhere in the councils?  That is not specified.  Perhaps I am missing it but I cannot see it.  It is fine if it is there, but it would better if it was stated that members would come from the municipal districts in the relevant areas.  <br/><br/>There is also the matter of the ratio of members.  In circumstances such as the Waterford and Kilkenny case I discussed with Deputy &Oacute; Broin or a case involving the transfer of a small portion of one local authority into another, will a three-and-three split between the two authorities still be allowed or will the split be proportionate?  If it is not proportionate, there will be a much greater weight of numbers from one local authority compared with the other.<br/><br/>There is also the issue of the appointment of the four laypersons, for want of a better phrase, who will be experts in four specified areas.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane on this.  Who decides that someone has experience and expertise in these four areas?  I have no fear of having non-elected people involved and I know these appointees will not have a vote, which was my initial concern.  While it is good that they will provide advice at committee level, given that these laypersons do not have a mandate, it is right they do not have a vote.<br/><br/>On local area plans and development plans, section 48(3)(<i>a</i>) allows for the insertion of a new section 17A on definitions in the Planning and Development Act 2000.  It seems that an urban area committee may at any time prepare a local area plan.  How does that work with the sequencing of development plans and the preparation of local area plans in local authorities?  The former are currently submitted to the Department.  Do the local area plans supersede the development plan in these areas?  From my reading of this, that seems to be the case, although I may be incorrect.  If an urban area committee decides to bring in a local area plan, do changes made in that plan automatically carry over to the development plans of the two local authorities in question?  Will the council members, who now have the reserved function for development plans, have to ratify those changes?<br/><br/>Many questions arise.  While the thinking behind this amendment is very good, it was only produced yesterday.  I would like more time to add to this because I think we can work out something that would be very good.  This could work in other urban areas besides the eight that have been selected.  If we worked on this together as a committee, I do not envisage delaying the Bill until after Christmas.  I do not think we necessarily need separate legislation.  Perhaps we could address this again on Report Stage.  I do not want to be negative about this but I have many unanswered questions.  There is much good in it but perhaps more work is needed before Report Stage.  Some input from the other parties and members of the committee should be allowed to strengthen the Bill.<br/><br/>I promise this is my final point.  Deputy Cullinane wondered if there had been consultation with the members or chief executives of the local authorities in the eight urban areas that have been selected.  It is important to ask their views because this is significant and potentially very positive legislation.  I am not raising any of these questions from a negative standpoint.  </p></speech>

In counties Louth and Meath the two county councils met and decided they needed an area plan which covered both jurisdictions.  When that happened, the plan was produced and published and people on the councils bought into it.  However, the local district committee did not agree with it because it did not like the zoning provided in it.  The legal decision was that the consensus of the officials of Meath County Council and Louth County Council in the area plan was null and void and had no status.  The local area committee then rezoned hundreds of acres.  This is a major scandal in planning in east Meath.  That is what the laughing was about, but that is the problem the Minister of State is trying to address.</p></speech>

The areas I mentioned earlier have experienced some of the problems in the areas the Minister of State has identified.  Drogheda and Bray are on that list but Swords, Dundalk, Navan and Kilkenny are not on it.  Those are the biggest towns.  The point I raised earlier holds water.  The reason for this is the increase in the urban areas, particularly around Dublin.  I do not disagree with the idea but how and by whom will it be initiated?  Must both councils initiate it and must they both agree?  Another issue is that planning is not included along with transport, housing, infrastructure and business and trade as one of the areas for people outside of the elected members with specialist expertise.  It should be included.</p>  <p>  If a group is around a table, will they have equal status in terms of voting on the plan?  There will also be problems between elected and non-elected members.  I am not against the proposal in principle.  However, I know of a case where consensus was achieved among county councils but it did not work.  The difficulty I foresee is where municipal districts in the councils do not buy into this.  In a co-joint area, would the municipal districts in the councils make the recommendations or would it be the whole council?  It is important to clarify that because there could be a difference of opinion.  The municipal district might not want this.  Difficulties could arise in scenarios similar to the one I outlined in the case of counties Meath and Louth.  I, too, welcome the discussion in principle but we need to think this through.  Perhaps it can be fleshed out on Report Stage.</p>  <p>  There are serious dangers with this proposal because the areas can have as many as 99,999 people living in them.  The point is well made about moving outside of a small map.  The area covered could be very large.  In parallel with this, a paper is needed on why those eight towns were selected.  I am not disagreeing with the selection as it reflects my own point of view.  However, this needs to be planned because in some cases an area committee could be set up when what is needed is a complete reform of the whole functional area of the council.  It is late in the day to be discussing this but there are important issues here.  I welcome the Bill in principle but I would like to tease out these issues, if possible. </p></speech>

If I had not noticed two issues in the Bill, one in Galway and another that came up yesterday, I probably would not have engaged in detail.  </p>  <p>               I do not think anybody can argue with the idea, whether it is Carlow, Athlone or wherever, of trying to have some creative planning between the two parts of the town.  That has to be grappled with.  The basic idea of a committee is fine but we all know that the devil is in the detail.  Big, broad policy is very easy.  It is the implementation and the detail that are the difficult parts.  There are a number of serious trends here that I would worry are a precursor for a much wider application of a new process.  If there is a little bit of one county with a massive part of another, for example a little bit of Kilkenny in with Waterford, how are they going to divide up the elected members?  I am not going to repeat what was said.  I do not like corporatism as a form of government.  I really like democracy.  I like its egalitarianism whereby the so-called least in our society in terms of the elites have the same shout as those who have the PhDs and all the other things after their names.  The life I have led has been very interesting.  Having moved from a middle class Dublin upbringing, where most of my family and classmates had access to third level education at a time when not everybody did, to the west of Ireland, I found the ordinary people who had been to that greatest of universities, the universities of life, could buy and sell me thought-wise, in terms of foresight, any day of the week.</p></speech>

I hit an unavoidable problem on the way in which was none of my own making.  I thank the Chairman and committee for the opportunity to present details of this Supplementary Estimate for my Department.  As the members will be aware from the advance brief circulated, there are two elements to the Supplementary Estimate.  I refer to a sum of &euro;6 million from the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, dividend and &euro;37.5 million, which has been agreed with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to boost investment in the transport, tourism and sport sectors.</p> <p>  Given the IAA&rsquo;s strong financial performance and significant surplus cash reserve, it was agreed it was sufficiently well funded to pay at least one special dividend.  This is in addition to the agreed annual dividend policy of 30% of profits after tax.  As part of that agreement, the IAA committed to further special dividends in 2019 and 2020, subject to prevailing conditions.  As was the case this year, I will consult the Minister for Finance with a view to retaining a portion of the special dividends, to again be reinvested in the work of my Department.  The second part of the Supplementary Estimate, &euro;37.5 million, is being allocated for a range of projects.</p> <p>  The Estimates for 2018 provide an overall gross allocation to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of &euro;2.03 billion.  This additional money will now bring the total allocation to &euro;2.07 billion.  The total allocation is used to provide investment in critical infrastructure and to ensure that vital services are available to the public during 2018.  I will briefly go through the areas that are recipients of this additional money.  Funding of &euro;1.5 million for aviation will assist with operational grant applications from the regional airports.  The majority of this funding focuses on supporting the wage costs for the provision of essential safety and security services.  In the public transport area, &euro;5 million has been allocated for bus and Luas investment.  This will partly fund bus fleet purchases and partly fund a stage payment for the eight additional Luas trams being purchased under the green line capacity enhancement project.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;200,000 will go towards an Irish Rail accessibility app which will assist rail users with sensory or mobility impairments and &euro;400,000 will be invested to improve the safety of cyclists by installing cyclist detection systems at junctions.  There will also be &euro;3 million for working capital relating to the bus market opening, BMO, programme, which commenced on 9 September.  The working capital requirement for BMO arises from the gross cost contract arrangement with Go Ahead and Bus &Eacute;ireann for routes that have been opened to competition.  In this case, the National Transport Authority, NTA, will collect all fare revenues and carry the associated revenue risk.</p> <p>  In the roads area, the main allocation will be to regional and local roads, with an additional allocation of &euro;15.03 million towards roads maintenance.  As the committee will be aware, in recent years the impact of severe weather has intensified the vulnerability of a weak network in need of maintenance and repair.  This amount will be allocated to local authorities affected by such events this year under a new special maintenance grant.  In addition, &euro;700,000 will also be allocated to the purchase of salt for use on regional and local roads.  The severe winter just gone resulted in exceptionally high salt usage and, therefore, this additional money will ensure adequate stocks are again in place.  Funding for national roads will be increased by &euro;3 million to cover winter operations, public lighting and other outstanding maintenance.  A sum of &euro;7 million will be used for a payment to FBD in respect of the compensation, legal costs and court interest payable on a case from 2009 where a court of appeal found the State had liability.</p> <p>  Under the maritime heading, search and rescue helicopters have been adapted for the night vision imaging system, NVIS, and the necessary night vision goggles have been purchased.  This system is necessary to improve search and rescue capability.  The allocation in the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1.7 million will go towards the provision of training on the use of the NVIS.  This will complete the project adapting search and rescue helicopters and crews to night vision imaging systems.</p> <p>  In sport, &euro;1.5 million is being allocated to Sport Ireland for high performance sport.  This funding will be used to assist athletes' preparations for major competitions, including the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo and key world and European championship events.  A sum of &euro;1.12 million is being provided to Sport Ireland to meet the following costs.  A sum of &euro;750,000 has been allocated to the Irish Open golf event, &euro;100,000 to Paralympics Ireland, &euro;120,000 to anti-doping and &euro;150,000 to the women in sport programme.</p> <p>  In regard to tourism, &euro;500,000 will be spent by F&aacute;ilte Ireland targeting short breaks over the winter specifically to visitors from Northern Ireland and it will also spend &euro;100,000 supporting more international publicity.  A sum of &euro;250,000 will be spent to enhance the programme for the New Year&rsquo;s Festival Dublin to deliver an even better festival and to attract and grow additional tourist traffic at a time of year we have spare airline and accommodation capacity.  Tourism Ireland will spend &euro;2.5 million on a range of tourism marketing initiatives.  My Department has a vital role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic prosperity and I am pleased that this additional allocation, together with the funding committed over the lifetime of the national development plan, should enable us build a better Ireland.  I am happy to address any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

There was not a gap.  This is additional money, which came through mid-year.  The figure is approximately &euro;1.5 million for aviation.  It came from the IAA dividend.  In a sense, it was a windfall.  We decided to distribute it accordingly.  Committee members received a list with details of how the &euro;6 million was distributed.  Where there was need that had not been provided for, we provided for it.  The allocations are mostly for security and safety in the regional airports and for where there are needs that might not have been fulfilled.  It is something of a bonus rather than to cover a deficit.</p></speech>

I will explain the dividend in case anyone does not understand it.  The issue arose when I was speaking to the Minister for Finance during budget negotiations.  He and I agreed that if I could negotiate a special divided from the IAA, it would be welcome because it would be additional money and the authority was getting a dividend.  When we agreed on that, I went to the IAA.  The IAA had a vast cash pile in the bank.  The view was that the State could make use of that money rather than have it in the IAA coffers.  The IAA agreed to give us a dividend, all other things being equal, of &euro;12 million per annum.  The Minister for Finance agreed that we would split that with &euro;6 million for the Exchequer and &euro;6 million for the Department.  When that was agreed we had a certain amount that was extra.  Some &euro;1.5 million of that went to the regional airports.</p></speech>

I gather committee members received a note on the matter.  The majority of the funding is focused on supporting the operational costs of the provision of essential safety and security services.  The point is that this money can never be considered as state aid because it has no economic benefit.  It does not yield extra income to the airport.  If it did, it would be subject to state aid rules.  It comes with the qualification of being for security and safety, which is important.</p></speech>

There is a &euro;5 million allocation for bus and Luas investment.  The Minister said an additional &euro;5 million will be assigned partly to bus fleet purchase and partly to stage payments for eight additional Luas trams.  How many new buses will be acquired with the funding?  When will they be delivered?  Will these be new buses?</p> <p>  The money is being used to purchase new buses.  Will they be hybrid buses or conventional buses?  As the Minister will be aware, the State has decarbonisation targets to reach by 2020.  Transport is now the second largest contributing sector to greenhouse gas emissions.  It is important to have a clear move away from fossil fuels in transport.  We need to accelerate our migration towards renewable energies.</p> <p>  There is an allocation of &euro;200,000 for the Irish Rail accessibility app, which is a welcome proposal.  The joint committee held hearings on how we can make public transport more accessible for people with a disability.  The allocation is welcome, positive and to be complimented.  Will the Minister give a timeline for when the app will be up and running?  Given the intention of the app, will there will an additional requirement to ensure that the necessary personnel and supports will be at the various train stations?  When someone arrives at a station, will operative assistance be available?  I know from a previous briefing with Irish Rail representatives that many of the stations are not fully wheelchair friendly.  We are putting in &euro;200,000 for the app and that is welcome, but it may raise problems.  If a person wants to travel from a particular station but that station is not wheelchair accessible, then there may be a problem.  Can the Minister comment on that?</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;400,000 is allocated for the cycling package, which is small.  We are still well below where we were when the Minister took over in terms of our annual spend on cycling.  When does the he envisage that he will be back at the level of spending where the Department was before he took office?</p> <p>  Additional road money is welcome but we are still somewhat below our steady-state requirement.  Does the Minister have any indication of when we might be in a position to meet that requirement?  Ultimately, the longer we prolong investment in our roads, the more it will cost in the long run.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;3 million is allocated for the BMO project.  We were all told that the opening of certain routes was to save money.  Now we see that a large amount of capital expenditure is allocated at the outset.  What exactly is the &euro;3 million for?  Will it go towards the provision and purchase of garage facilitates?  How much money has the Department expended on the bus BMO project in total?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.722" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018120500002#C02000"><p>The Minister has allocated &euro;3 million to working capital for the BMO project.</p><p>I note the Minister did not allocate a single euro to the public transport obligation, PSO, despite the fact that public transport is in dire need of significant investment.  That probably shows us what we have known all along.  While the Minister might argue over the word, outsourcing is a means to the end goal of privatisation.  It is very disappointing that the Minister did not seek to give an allocation to the PSO when he got the extra money.  He is giving more money to speed up the process of privatisation to the detriment of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the public transport network.  He knows himself in doing that and by outsourcing the most profitable routes that he is weakening Bus &Eacute;ireann's business model and reducing its revenue which would enable it to fund less profitable routes.  Could the Minister make a statement in that regard?  It is clear that he is following that agenda and doing it in stages.</p><p> I am surprised extra funding was not provided, given the increasing need for security on the public transport network, in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann, something that has been in the media so much of late.  Workers have had to endure more frequent assaults and attacks and they are vulnerable.  The current security arrangements are not sufficient.</p><p> I too welcome the allocation of &euro;200,000 for the rail accessibility app.  Will the funding be sufficient to get the app up and running or will extra funding be required?  We had a report on disability and we had the groups in here before the committee.  All of them flagged up the nightmare of trying to go about their daily business on public transport.  As Deputy Troy said, due to the lack of staff one must give 24 hours notice, and 48 hours notice at the weekend, and one cannot decide on the day that one will make a journey.  The lack of staff at train stations is part of the problem.  If I think of anything else I will come back in later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.724" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018120500002#D00200"><p>I wish to ask the Minister a question on the same topic.  A total of &euro;3 million is being allocated for working capital relating to the bus market opening programme.  It arises from the gross cost contract arrangement that will go ahead in Bus &Eacute;ireann for routes that have been opened to competition.  In this case the National Transport Authority, NTA, will collect all fare revenues and carry the associated revenue risk.  The announcement by the NTA of further privatisation of Bus &Eacute;ireann services is a real blow to workers and trade unions who were of the belief that they had an agreement in 2015 to the effect that if any further routes were to be opened up to privatisation a period would be allocated for the assessment of how Go-Ahead Ireland has been doing.  The Minister is meant to be a guardian of public money, but we hear now that the intention is to hand over &euro;3 million to open bus routes to a private company.  The State will end up subsidising millions to a multinational company and it will inevitably end up providing subsidies in welfare due to the low pay of the workers that will be employed.  My understanding from talking to members of the National Bus &amp;amp; Rail Union, NBRU, is that Go-Ahead Ireland is having real difficulty recruiting workers, who are on reduced terms and conditions compared to established workers in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister will dissociate himself and say this is up to the NTA, which is independent in its operations, but none of us believes that.  We see the payment of &euro;3 million as being ideological.  Because the issue needs further exploration we should bring in the NTA and the unions in the new year to discuss matters.  The unions are of the belief that, as I outlined, this is a breach of the agreement that they had on there being a period of assessment before any further routes would be opened.  The cost effectiveness of the proposal was to be assessed, yet the Minister is now doling out more public money to allow the privatisation of services on worse terms and conditions for the workers.  I assume the private sector is being handed the Dublin to Drogheda routes and the Dublin to Wicklow routes, which are in the commuter belt and are heavily trafficked, so would inevitably be profitable.  The Minister is cherry-picking services.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann makes extra money at least it goes back into the economy whereas the private companies hand it out in dividends to their shareholders.  How long will the public purse have to subsidise companies coming in at the taxpayers' expense?</p></speech>

We must put even more emphasis on road improvements because of the safety issues that arise when there are potholes.  Deputy Munster will be aware that travelling from Drogheda, coming in from the motorway, when one leaves the national primary route, there is no proper lighting.  There are not even proper roads.  The road network is from the early 20th century rather than the 21st century.  Any additional money to be spent on the roads is very welcome.</p> <p>  I fully support the Irish Rail accessibility app.  That is an important and welcome development.  I invite the Minister to respond to the questions.  If members wish they can respond to the Minister.</p></speech>

He is correct that the &euro;5 million will go towards buses and the Luas due to the growth in passenger numbers.  There will be a staged payment for the Luas green line enhancement, which is a problem area.</p> <p>  The revised allocation will enable the NTA to take delivery of extra bus vehicles this year, enabling some of the additional services to be operated with a new bus fleet instead of older end-of-life vehicles.  Discussions are ongoing with manufacturers as regards delivery scheduling.  As the Deputy identified, there is a great need for new buses, rail and DART trains.  We are moving as fast as we can on that.  On the rail issue, we have been making some progress but the proposed refurbishment proved to be extremely expensive when it went out to tender.  Irish Rail is now looking at buying second-hand carriages.  Refurbishing some of the old carriages was going to be almost as expensive as buying new ones.  Irish Rail is now looking at leasing and buying second-hand carriages.</p> <p>  The app will be introduced early in 2019.  It is moving full steam ahead.  On cycling, Deputy Troy said the allocation of &euro;400,000 is too little but it is an extra &euro;400,000 in funding which we did not expect to have in the first place.  It is going towards trying to prevent cycling accidents.  The number of accidents last year increased by almost 50% to 15.</p><p>Fortunately, it has decreased this year, but we cannot depend on that continuing.  We are very conscious that we need to encourage cycling.  There is regularly criticism from the committee and others about the amount of money the Government is spending on cycling in the light of the number of cyclists.  We are putting in a considerable amount and have committed to spending a great deal more under the national development plan.  We have bought into cycling.  We know that it is part of the equation and helps the environment and the health of the nation and will relieve the traffic problem.  It is probably unfair to criticise the Government on the basis that we are not doing enough regarding cycling.  There was a reluctance to commit funding at one stage, but that is no longer the case.  We made very serious commitments in the national development plan to triple the amount spent on cycling.  A large amount is being spent on greenways.  Under the BusConnects project, we have committed to 200 km of dedicated and segregated cycleways to run alongside the bus corridors.  The commitment is there and it is underlined by the fact that an extra &euro;400,000 from this windfall will be spent on making the roads safer for cyclists, particularly at junctions.  We intend to continue in that vein.</p><p> On the BusConnects market opening addressed by Deputy Troy, there is probably something of a misconception.  The money is not being handed over as a current or capital payment.  It will not be allocated to Go-Ahead as Deputy Coppinger suggested.  It will be used to address a cashflow issue involving a probable gap in revenue and will enable the project to progress.  It is certainly not being allocated to Go-Ahead.</p><p> Deputy Munster raised the issue of privatisation being the end goal.  We have had this conversation before.  It is not and will not be the end goal.  Although the Deputy refers to it as privatisation, nothing is being sold.  Privatisation only occurs when an asset is transferred from one person or company to another.</p></speech>

A tendering process is being set.  To the best of my knowledge, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus are tendering for all of the routes.  It is open to outside companies, including those from outside the State, to tender.  The selected provider will get a contract which will probably run for five years.  However, it will not get any assets.  We are not selling any assets.  The contract will last for a limited period of time.  There is an open competition to provide the services.  The State companies will compete to provide the services.   They have won such tenders previously and presumably will do so in the future.  The objective is not privatisation but, rather, to introduce more competition in the market in order to benefit the consumer.  Obviously, competition is healthy.  It may not be welcome from the point of view of the incumbents, but they compete very successfully for such tenders.  We must realise that we have some very successful bus companies of which the Deputy would be very supportive which are carrying far more passengers.  The introduction of new routes and companies can only help passengers and expand the service.  That will not necessarily be to the detriment of the incumbents.  The Deputy and I probably differ in our definitions of privatisation.  She seems to believe that the tendering of the routes is privatisation.  It is true that some of the routes will be operated by new companies for a finite period, but no assets are changing hands.</p></speech>

Does the Minister accept that if Bus &Eacute;ireann does not win the tender, it will experience an immediate reduction in revenue because the majority of routes put out to tender are the most profitable ones?  The most profitable routes are being creamed off such that our national bus service is weakened every time a route goes to tender.  As the Minister knows, it is all about business models.  Bus &Eacute;ireann's chance of successfully tendering for contracts is weakened because some of the most profitable routes have been privatised and its revenue is down as a result.  It is being progressively weakened.  This is privatisation.   Assets may not be sold but the constant outsourcing to the detriment of our public transport network is privatisation.</p></speech>

What is happening in the bus and public transport market is quite exciting.  It should not be knocked.  We should welcome the fact that outside companies want to tender for these routes because, as members are aware, the passenger numbers are increasing very quickly as a result of a boom in the economy.  As a result of that, everybody is benefiting.  It would be wrong to say that it is damaging to Dublin Bus.  It is currently expanding its services because of the increase in passenger numbers.  There is room for the incumbents.</p><p>The great beneficiaries here, hopefully, will be the passengers and there is evidence of this.  Those are the people who we want to see benefit.  The introduction of new operators has benefitted the passengers.  It has not created any unemployment.  At present, the expansion in the demand for public transport services is being filled successfully both by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and by outsiders, and this competition is working.</p></speech>

We need to interrogate this further.  None of us here has to hand the figures of the routes being spoken of and we cannot really get into this.  We need to get those figures.

The point being made is that a cost-benefit analysis was not done in this regard before deciding to put them out to tender.</p> <p>  We need to interrogate the claim that it will benefit consumers.  Is the Minister saying the prices will go down?  Generally, what happens is that routes that are not so well populated lose out and that is not of benefit to the consumer overall.</p> <p>  Lastly, the Minister might explain what he meant.  I took it down as I have a bit of shorthand.  The Minister stated this &euro;3 million was for a cashflow issue while there is a gap in revenue.  The Minister stated it was not to help the private company.  I did not understand what was meant by a cashflow issue while there is a gap in revenue.</p></speech>

That is not what happens.  It is a cashflow issue.  In other words, it is bridging a gap.  It is a working capital requirement for bus market opening.  It arises from the gross cost contract arrangement, to which the Chairman referred, with Go-Ahead and Bus &Eacute;ireann for BMO routes whereby the NTA will collect all fare revenues and bear the associated revenue risk.  In other words, it is bridging.  The working capital requirement is driven by a combination of the timing difference between the contractual payments to the relevant operators and the subsequent drawdown from the Department.  It includes an amount to mitigate the revenue risk of the annual estimated fare revenue in the event that forecasted revenues are lower than expected.  It is a bridging cushion.  It is certainly not handing over money to Go-Ahead.  The &euro;3 million is not going to Go-Ahead.</p></speech>

That is not true.  It is a public service route.  Some public service routes are profitable.  What has been used in the past is the ability of profitable routes to cross-subsidise unprofitable routes.  We know the routes.  They are: the 17A, the 33A, the 33B, 45A, 45B, 59, 63, 63A, 75, 75A, 102, 111, 175, 184 and 185.  Those are the routes that are currently operated by Go-Ahead.  They are publicised routes.  They are on the website for anybody, including the Minister, to familiarise him or herself with.</p> <p>  The question I have relates to the &euro;3 million in taxpayers' money that is being made available for market opening.  What exactly is it for?  First, it was stated that because it is only a contracted service, it is for capital expenditure and the money is being spent to upgrade State infrastructure.  Now we are being told it is some sort of bridging finance.  Certainly, any time I got bridging finance I had to pay it back.  We are told then Go-Ahead is not getting it, the NTA is getting it and there is no need for paying anything back.  I am a little confused about exactly what the &euro;3 million is for.  The Minister should state clearly what the &euro;3 million is being spent on.</p></speech>

It is going in specifically as working capital, as bridging finance.  That is what it is.  It is not money being transferred somehow from the State to a private company.  It is going in as working capital and that is its pure purpose.</p><p>I will read this definition carefully because I asked for it.  It states that the working capital requirement is driven by a combination of the tiny difference between the contractual payments to the relevant operators and the subsequent drawdown from the Department.  It is purely bridging.  It also includes an amount to mitigate the revenue risk of the annual estimated fare revenue in the event that forecasted revenues are lower than expected.  It is, therefore, simply a cashflow issue.</p></speech>

There is a contract between the NTA and Go-Ahead, and payment must be made to Go-Ahead, but the payment falls due in advance of moneys being transferred from the overall PSO pot from the Department.  That is one aspect, while the other is that this is a gross-cost contract.  It is not like the Dublin Bus contract, which, like Bus &Eacute;ireann, collects all the fare revenue and keeps it.  The difference between its costs and the fare revenue is the PSO payment to those operators.</p> <p>  In the case of the two Go-Ahead contracts and the Bus &Eacute;ireann contract for Waterford, they are gross-cost contracts, which means the NTA collects the fare revenue and Go-Ahead does not keep it.  It is paid an amount to provide the particular services.  Fare revenue is only estimated and, therefore, there is a revenue risk for the NTA and the fare revenue might not be as robust as forecast.  For that reason, it needs to hold working capital within the NTA to counter it. </p></speech>

There was some toing and froing but I asked the Minister a number of questions which were not answered.</p> <p>  Of the &euro;5 million for bus and Luas investment, how many new buses will it deliver?  Will they be hybrid buses?  When were the eight additional Luas trams ordered and when will they be delivered?  I also asked how many rail stations are not fully accessible.  While the allocation of &euro;200,000 is most welcome, have we quantified how much it will cost to make all our rail stations fully accessible?  The Chairman and I attended the briefing with Irish Rail, and he is aware there is a significant problem with accessibility at rail stations.  It will take considerable capital investment to address it.  While the app is welcome, if people are being brought to a station but they cannot be facilitated when they arrive, that is another question.</p> <p>  On the cycling budget, according to the Minister's own figures, he is not spending what was spent by his predecessor.  In 2015, the annual cycling budget was &euro;18 million but last year, it was just over &euro;10 million.  The allocation of &euro;400,000 is welcome, and the Minister claims that I am being overly critical by saying it is not enough, but we are not where the Department was before he came to office.  I welcome that the Minister says he is a late convert to cycling and that he has bought into it, which is positive, but he should demonstrate his conversion by giving back the money his Department stopped giving to cycling infrastructure for the past two years.</p></speech>

Golf is a very wealthy sport so why does it need such a subsidy?  The Irish Open was sponsored by Dubai Duty Free last year.  Is that also the case this year?  Prize money for golfers is stratospheric so why does the taxpayer have to fund Irish Open golf to the tune of &euro;750,000 while the Women in Sport programme gets &euro;150,000, with Paralympics Ireland getting even less?  Well-funded sports in which well-heeled people take part seem to enjoy quite a lot of subsidies and grants.  I do not see how the Irish Open could need a handout from the public purse.</p></speech>

The funding represents an increase of &euro;250,000 on the level of funding provided in 2018.  The money being provided to Paralympics Ireland is to meet a cost overrun from the hosting of the World Para Swimming European Championships at the National Aquatic Centre in August.  On 5 April last, Sport Ireland was contacted by Paralympics Ireland with a request for support in delivering these championships.  Paralympics Ireland stated that it was experiencing significant financial challenges in the context of hosting the championships in Dublin from 13 August to 19 August.  These financial challenges centred on two areas, transport and accommodation, which were mostly due to costs escalating since the bid stage in August 2014.  They requested an underwriting agreement to the value of &euro;140,000 from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure the financial viability of the event and to eliminate any risk of the event cancellation, the effects of which would be very significant for Paralympics Ireland and the Irish sport sector.  It is now anticipated that the drawdown will be close to &euro;100,000.  In meeting this request, Sport Ireland noted that Paralympics Ireland would provide an additional &euro;100,000 and the International Paralympic Committee would provide an additional &euro;150,000.  With the provision of these additional funding streams, Paralympics Ireland delivered a successful championship.  They probably met what was needed at that time.  The issue relating to the Irish Open is somewhat different from that relating to golf clubs.  I appreciate that the Deputy has an interest in golf clubs.</p></speech>

Are we going to subsidise something which is very well funded as it is?  There are many events that bring people into the country, such as the marathon.</p></speech>

The soccer team was probably more successful than the men's so the amount allocated to women's sport seems quite small.  When officials are in meetings with Sport Ireland, these are things they should be asking about.</p></speech>

It looks quite poor that we are only giving &euro;150,000 in additional funding to Women in Sport, but I am conscious that it is a Supplementary Estimate.  What does this bring the actual 2018 figure to?  What percentage of the overall sports expenditure is geared to women in sport?  I would hate the perception to go out from this committee that golf is elitist and in my county, many small golf clubs do great work with juvenile golfers.  Any teenager should be able to participate in the sport of their choice.</p> <p>  A portion of this money comes from a special dividend from the IAA.  Are we confident that this money will be available for the various sporting bodies next year?</p></speech>

The point she makes is fair.  We should examine in detail the proportionate amounts given to these various organisations, as we do.  The &euro;150,000 for the Women in Sport programme comes from the Supplementary Estimate.  The Deputy rightly points out that, superficially, that is only one fifth of the amount given to golf.  We doubled the funding for the Women in Sport programme to &euro;2 million.  In the area of disability, we created a new &euro;1 million programme for disability sport through the deployment of sports inclusion disability officers in all 26 local sports partnerships countrywide.  We also gave a &euro;1.5 million allocation to high-performance programmes in support of the Tokyo 2020 preparations.  We have certainly acknowledged, through the supplementary grant of &euro;500,000 to women's hockey out of the IAA dividend, the tremendous success of Irish women in sport in the past year.  We will continue to provide support in the future.  We have a bit of catching up to do in that area.  That is readily acknowledged.  We are determined to do that.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman raises a good point.  Golf is always painted as very elitist.  In many clubs playing golf at a high level is only open to the better off, but there are pitch and putt clubs all around the country.  That should be acknowledged.  People derive a huge amount of benefit for their health and mental health from pitch and putt.  It is to be found in every village in Ireland.  It is not an elitist sport which should not be encouraged in the same way as any other sport.  It works at all sorts of levels.  We must not forget that high-performance sport is one thing and big events another, but participation at village and street level is more important.  While we all applaud the great achievements of our sportsmen and sportswomen around the world and the medals and great titles they have brought back, I have no hesitation in saying that the real benefit of sport to the nation is found in the young boys and girls one sees every weekend getting huge benefits for their mental and physical health while being kept away from other pursuits which might not be so good for them.  That is the great benefit of sport.  Participation is equally important - and probably much more important - for the health of the nation than the medals, which we applaud.  The medals and icons are very important.  It is important to have people who are great achievers, but having large numbers of people actively participating on the ground is emphasised in our sports policy equally to, if not more so than, the achievements of high-performing athletes.</p></speech>

We are talking about giving &euro;750,000 to one event at which the winner received prize money of $1.116 million - whatever that is in euro - and for which there is a $7 million total prize fund.  We are not talking about helping people with their mental health.  We are talking about subsidising very well paid people.  That is all I am saying.  If we are giving money to this one event, my question is whether it is needed.  This event is run my Rory McIlroy and sponsored by Dubai Duty Free.  I am not going to labour the point but the Minister should not pretend that it is for the benefit of village pitch and putt clubs.</p></speech>

I was just trying to say that participation at street level is equally important.  I do not want to dismiss the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open because its benefits to tourism in Ireland are significant.</p> <p>  On the Acting Chairman's question, I have not worked out the percentage but we can do that very easily.  It is extra money.  The &euro;51.6 million goes to sports in general.  It would be easy enough to work out what percentage of that this figure is.</p></speech>

The amount of funding being spent on the Irish Open as opposed to on Paralympics Ireland, anti-doping measures and the Women in Sport programme can be perceived badly.  That is why I was using the example of the percentage of this year's overall expenditure being spent by the Department on the latter programme.  This is IAA funding.  As the Minister acknowledged, it was a windfall.  Will this windfall be available next year?  In the event that it is not, will the Women in Sport programme or the high-performance programme suffer a reduction in funding?</p></speech>

I cannot guarantee that dividend will be available next year but we anticipate that it will.  In other words, the expectation is that we will get the same &euro;12 million per annum, &euro;6 million of which will come to the Department, but it is not certain.  It depends on the conditions in the IAA at the time.  If it is in a similar position to where it is at the moment and where it was when we got the last dividend, I would anticipate that we will get the same dividend.</p></speech>

The Great Britain market has been particularly challenging for Ireland in the wake of Brexit.  The numbers have fallen so it is a positive development that additional funding is being allocated.  It is a little bit outside what we are talking about here but, in terms of the additional funding secured in the 2019 budget, has the Minister engaged with the key stakeholders to ensure that the necessary supports are put into the various regions that will be most adversely affected by the reintroduction of the 13.5% VAT rate?</p><p>Has the Minister engaged with key stakeholders to ensure the necessary supports are put in place in the various regions that will be most adversely affected by the reintroduction of the 13.5% VAT rate?</p></speech>

The achievement in tourism is phenomenal considering the drop in the currency in the UK as a result of Brexit and the fact that the number of visitors from Britain has increased this year despite the fact that we have suffered so much in the context of currency movements.  That is due to a large number of factors.  Tourism worldwide is increasing but there have been some very effective marketing campaigns by both Stage agencies.  Tourism is flourishing.  The problems with tourism are the problems of success including not having a sufficient number of hotel bedrooms and other accommodation to meet the need of the demand of the people coming here.  However, we anticipate that the money being given will be spent wisely, not just in diversification but also in defending the British market, and the signs so far are that that is happening.  We anticipate a great deal of further success in the tourism industry this year and next year.</p> <p>  On the 13.5% VAT rate, it was a disappointment but we do not anticipate that it will result in some sort of permanent downward movement in the tourism industry because of the &euro;35 million that has been granted to give incentives and promote marketing by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  We believe that will be sufficient to keep the tourism numbers at a very healthy level.</p> <p>  There will be supports for the regions.  The Acting Chairman will be aware that in his own region, the Hidden Heartlands is something to which the tourism industry and the Government are fully committed.  We anticipate that will increase in the coming years.  It is the last geographical branding the country has and means the entire country is now covered by a message which has been a very successful strategy by the tourist agencies and by the Department.  The supports, if necessary, will certainly be put in place.  That is the reason the money is being provided, namely, to give incentives and make life more successful for those who may suffer from the difficulties Brexit produces for the tourism industry, but the current signs are that we will be able to fight it successfully.</p></speech>

He will acknowledge that some regions are not benefiting to the same extent as and face greater challenges than others.  While it must be acknowledged that the extra money is being allocated, it is important that the supports are put in place.  We must ensure that industry and stakeholders are consulted in order to make sure that the best supports are provided.</p></speech>
