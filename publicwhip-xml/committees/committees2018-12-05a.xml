I am new to this job and I am sure many of those here are better informed than I am on some of the challenges but I can report on the blunt message from Katowice this week where I attended the UN climate change conference.  It will not come as a surprise to the committee that the themes were stark.  One was that the window to act in respect of climate disruption is fast closing and we have a limited time to get our house in order globally if we are to respond.  The second point is that, by and large, the technology to deliver the targets being set is there now.  It is not a question of inventing new approaches but implementing those technologies and delivering the necessary change.  The third point is that the consequences of failure are appalling in terms of the impact on the natural environment, the environment of many countries, migration, and the disruption of economic and social life around the globe, quite apart from the experiences we know about, such as the severe weather events that are in our daily news.  It was a blunt message and it puts in context the work the committee is undertaking.  It has undertaken this on the back of the Citizens' Assembly and its 17 recommendations.  The defining issue of this century is whether we can address this adequately as a nation and as a global community.</p> <p>  The numbers for Ireland are not good.  We can see what happened.  The benchmark was set in 2005 and, in the early years as the recession took hold, our emissions fell rapidly.  By 2011, they were down by 11.4%.  They were well on target for a 20% reduction at that stage but since the recovery started, it has become clear that we did not decouple economic recovery from emissions growth.  It has grown to the point that, based on forecasts for 2020, the big industry, emission trading scheme, ETS, sector which has a cap and trade model, has done pretty okay.  It will be down 37% because we have successfully made many changes in the power sector and others.  In the non-ETS sector, however, which has to come down 20% we will be down only 1%.  In harsh terms we are 95% off target.</p> <p>  The growth in emissions since 2011 has been led by sectors we all know about: 13% in agriculture and industry, and 7% in transport.  The energy, residential and commercial sectors have sustained downward progress in the sum total of their emissions.  There are, however, challenges in every sector for which we are responsible.  The committee is examining the policy options.  I can give it a flavour of these.  Our carbon in transport is 1.6 tonnes per head of population, putting us fifth highest in the EU, 90% of our journeys are single passenger and only 16% of houses are either A or B rated.  As we go down the ratings the carbon impact escalates dramatically, from 1 tonne per annum for the low-rated ones to 11 tonnes per annum in the poorly-rated ones.  Carbon per dwelling is approximately 50% higher in Ireland than in the rest of Europe, which is a challenge.  </p> <p>  The national mitigation plan, NMP, was published in July 2017 and was an important first step.  It was to set a direction, putting up the signposts for where we are going but did not describe itself as a roadmap.  The challenge we now face is to do the more detailed roadmapping and develop the policy tools that will get us there. </p> <p>  The national development plan, NDP, project 2040, is a significant statement because not only does it indicate a commitment to invest &euro;30 billion in climate action and sustainable transport, which is a significant part of the &euro;116 billion in the project, it has set important policy objectives, such as increasing the number of houses whose energy rating is improved to &euro;45,000 per annum, taking Moneypoint out of the system by 2025, increasing our ambitions for renewable energy, getting 500,000 electric vehicles, EVs, onto the road, and establishing the climate fund, the first tranche of which we put out last week.  That is a small piece of the jigsaw but, for example, we will create a network of electric vehicle chargers around the country, which will support 40,000 electric vehicles compared with the 7,000 that are there now.  No matter what way we cut it, and estimates have been done, which the committee will see in the presentation and the transition statement, the NDP, along with changes in biofuels and some other measures, will take 22 million tonnes out of the target.  Even allowing for what we are allowed in the transition, where we can take into account forestry and our better performance in ETS, we still have a long way to go.  We have approximately 25 million tonnes for which we do not have policies to deliver the change we need to make.  </p> <p>  To meet our targets for 2030, we need to be ambitious in every sector of activity.  In transport, we need to be more ambitious regarding EVs; for a modal shift in buildings, about retrofitting, and heating systems; in power, we need to be more ambitious with renewables; in industry with biofuels; in agriculture with farming methods and forestry and so on.  Coming from my background, it is important that we do not just set targets but that we develop concrete policy tools and actions that will be delivered against a rigid timescale with people accountable for delivering actions, which will be whole-of-Government endorsed in order that we can ride shotgun on their delivery.  I have worked in the education sector and more relevantly on the Action Plan for Jobs where we faced similar challenges.  Ambitious delivery was necessary and we needed a whole-of-Government approach.</p><p>This will not be resolved by a capital programme alone.  It will require every Department, community, individual and enterprise playing a role, but the public sector must accept responsibility in showing leadership in this area, partly because it controls many of the policy tools but also because it must demonstrate it is serious about this.</p><p> Regarding the approach I am taking, the committee will probably demand detailed lists which we are only at the early stage of developing.  There are six policy headings where I believe step change is achievable.  Five of them were outlined in a letter to the committee; one was omitted.  I will have to correct the letter to ensure it is not omitted.  The six items probably self-recommend.</p><p> One is the regulatory framework.  Clearly there are major areas of the regulatory framework relating to the foreshore, the mandates given to State companies and the standards set in various codes.  That is important.</p><p> The second is how we get the adoption of known technologies in all those sectors we know about.  The EV is a good example where laying down an infrastructure to deal with range anxiety is an important first step in helping us realise those achievements.  In agriculture, members will have seen the work Teagasc has done in identifying changes in agricultural methods that could, if fully implemented, deliver change.  Clearly, we have to find a way of implementing some of those changes.  With regard to renewables, heat pumps and many areas, the adoption of known technologies is a key challenge.</p><p> The third category relates to addressing market failure.  Deputy Eamon Ryan has rightly singled out carbon tax as a key area where we need a clear trajectory.  The reasons are clear.  In producing carbon, we are doing damage to our global environment for which we are not paying.  Economists call that an externality.  Doing damage but not taking it into account in decision-making makes no sense.  We have to find a way of allowing people to take into account the damage they do.  From a behavioural point of view, it is important.</p><p> For example, each of the 3.2 million vehicles on Irish roads will be replaced before 2030.  How do people make their minds up about that decision?  If there is no carbon-price trajectory, they will make up their minds on a business-as-usual basis.  If there is a carbon-price trajectory, they then factor in what it will cost to run such a vehicle in three, four or ten years.  We must encourage people not to lock themselves into high-carbon-use technologies.  That is the importance of having a carbon tax trajectory.  As the Taoiseach said on a number of occasions in the Chamber, that can be recycled back to people through tax breaks.  This is about getting them to change their behaviour and not to collect tax.  It is to create the opportunity that people avoid high-carbon activities and do other things.  It is not a smash-and-grab.</p><p> There are many other areas of market failure, including the circular economy and the concept that we do not take into account the full cost throughout the cycle of product from inception to waste.  The other area of market failure clearly is funding.  In many cases where we are trying to fund investment, the payback times will be relatively long compared with someone borrowing in the consumer market.  They will also not necessarily be secured on an asset.  We need to be imaginative on how we will fund that.  That covers the market-failure package.</p><p> There is also the opportunity side of this.  Many Deputies will be aware that while a low-carbon economy can be presented as being all about behavioural change, it is also about great opportunities for people who move first.  For those who are leaders and not followers, there are great opportunities to be innovative, create employment and get out there with new technologies.  We clearly need a policy to develop that.  That is partly about management development.  It is also about innovative hubs, supporting activities, and helping people who are being displaced in one sector to find opportunities either by retraining, new research and development and so on.  It is an important part of the agenda.</p><p> The fifth area is the public sector leading by example.  Clearly the public sector is not only an exemplar of good practice, but also a significant player in procurement, with the &euro;116 billion capital programme and how that is shaped and evaluated.  When Mr. Robert Watt, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, appeared before the committee I believe he signalled that he anticipated a price of carbon from a public expenditure point of view of &euro;100 million in 2030 and &euro;265 million in 2050.  That gives a scale of his Department's attitude to how it should be doing the cost-benefit analysis of individual projects that come to it, which ones should get priority and how projects should be framed in their make-up to pass cost-benefit analysis when they come to be delivered.  There are many other ways, including the smart infrastructure that we set up, smart metering and so on.</p><p> The final area - I do not know how it got dropped out of the letter - is at the heart of this.  It is how we engage citizens and communities to come on board the challenge we all share.  Some successful initiatives have been sponsored by SEAI.  There is increasing emphasis in community involvement in the renewable area.  Last week, we had Deputy Stanley's initiative on microgeneration and community.  There is also simple information and being able to understand how changes in individuals' lifestyle can make an impact on our performance.</p><p> The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is going through each sector using that framework to identify the areas with the greatest scope for change.  Clearly we need to develop the best policies that can be implemented at the least cost.  There is no point in expensive measures.  We must be conscious that other priorities need to be met in both public expenditure and personal lives.  We have to look to the least-cost ways of achieving the targets and we have to be ambitious.</p><p> Beyond 2030, we need to start exploring the possibility not just of the 80% reduction in carbon use by 2050, but zero-carbon usage by 2050.  That is the message that is coming from Katowice.  We need to be even more ambitious than we have been and we are not delivering the targets we set.</p><p> I hope that is helpful to the committee.  I am keen to work with the committee, which has representation from every party and those of no party.  We have some good ideas here to work through.  We will work, and we expect to work, to a timeframe after the committee has completed its work.  We are targeting producing a cross-government plan by the end of February.  Of course, just as the committee is doing, we will also have to work across government with other Departments to sweat the proposals that may emerge and can be included in the plan.  There is potential for working together on what is an enormous challenge.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute.</p></speech>

He announced this all-government plan for tackling climate change and reaching our 2030 targets and beyond.  I presume that is based on his previous work in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation where he had an Action Plan for Jobs.  How does that work within Departments?  Is it from the Department of the Taoiseach down?</p><p>I presume that every Department was brought in to say what it could do to reduce our unemployment figures.  I commend the Minister on the work he has done in reducing unemployment from 15% to 5%.  This committee has to look at governance and oversight beyond the work of the committee and how that works within Departments from the Office of the Taoiseach down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120500002#D00200"><p>The model we had then was to identify up to 200 actions per year right across the spectrum of Government.  Each action was timelined.  During the course of the year, the then Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation then reported on the progress of those targets to the Cabinet committee, chaired by the Taoiseach.  We published, in each quarter, the extent to which actions had or had not failed.  The Americans say it is important to be able to bite with the President's teeth.  The fact that the Taoiseach will be holding a Secretary General to account for failing to deliver in certain areas where commitments had been made is an important element of delivery and shifting the agenda.</p> <p>  It was not a static plan.  There were some actions that stretched across five or ten years but there was a review each year to see which were working and which were not working so well, to establish why some things had failed and others were successful.  There was a consultative element in its evolution.  Similarly, the various climate consultations that are occurring at regional level are an important way not only to buy in support for the initiative but also to get feedback on what is possible and viable and what is being overlooked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Chairman" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120500002#D00300"><p>Should our national policy position be enshrined in legislation?</p> <p>  The first round of the climate action fund was announced last week designating &euro;77 million for seven projects.  I understand that has the potential to reduce annual emissions by more than 200,000 tonnes.  Those seven projects leverage about &euro;300 million.  How does the Minister see the next rounds of that climate action fund rolling out?  Will specific areas and technologies that will help us with our 2030 targets and beyond be targeted?  There is a concern about the measures and actions currently in place.  How would the Minister like to see that climate action fund spent on technologies that will come on board to help us reach our targets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018120500002#D00400"><p>To answer the question on legislation, we will need regulatory change.  We will need legislation in areas like foreshore.  There is a need for guidelines and standards.  We need to consider whether an omnibus item of legislation will be produced to enshrine all of those or whether they will be developed individually.  There are legislative or statutory bottlenecks that are holding sectors back.  Foreshore is a clear example of where we need legislation enacted to support an offshore wind sector.</p> <p>  I am open-minded about putting targets into legislation.  Doing that will not achieve the targets, policies make that happen, but inserting targets in legislation concentrates the mind.  The committee will probably have a view on that.  Targets can be good and useful.</p> <p>  The first round of the climate action fund had about 300,000 tonnes on the emissions trading system, ETS, side and about 200,000 tonnes on the non-ETS side.  The network of road lighting was on the ETS side.  It could be criticised for being very strongly public sector-led, although there were applications coming from the private sector.  It probably needs to evolve.  We probably need to consider having expressions of interest at an earlier stage and having boot camps, for want of a better word, to help projects come forward to be competitive in the context of what it would do.  The headings are probably still relevant but, to get a wider engagement, the State companies or the big companies with the networks, or the local authorities, were in a position to come forward for the first bid.  It is important that we got out of the traps and they are really good projects in their own right but we need to broaden it and do more than a simple call for projects for the next round.  There needs to be a bit of preliminary support work to get good projects emerging and to get clusters to form to make them happen.</p></speech>

Different officials representing Departments, including the Minister's Department, have appeared before the committee from way back.  Their attitude was that this process does not mean anything and does not have an impact on their work.  Is that still the attitude of the Department?  If things can change in the space of a couple of weeks, who is to say it will not change and fall back again in the future?  What basis is there to say this climate action will continue?  The Minister needs to step up and do an awful lot more to deal with climate action.  I am worried whether the commitment is there from Government and Departments.  It has been starkly evident that all of the Departments to appear before the committee consider this to be a nuisance rather than anything else.  The Minister's Department was one of the most stark in this regard and that is worrying.  How does the Minister feel about that and how will that progress?</p> <p>  Who is actually going to co-ordinate this at Government level?  Will it be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment?  Who will take ownership of it?  The Secretary General from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine stated in here that methane was not a climate gas.  Will that be the cross-governmental attitude in the future?  Who will deal with that?  That is important and needs to be clarified before we go on.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely right to ask if a global ambition that requires everyone to move will be treated by people as an added extra and not their core work.  The key to that not happening is the mandate of the Taoiseach and the decision of Government, both of which I have received.  These requirements need to underpin reportage and require commitment that timelines are expected to be delivered.  That is the key.</p> <p>  As to co-ordination, the Action Plan for Jobs is the best model that I have worked on.  It was jointly overseen by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach.  There was dual oversight.  It was not a lonely Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment appealing to the big Departments to suss up and shape up.  I reiterate we were biting with the President's teeth, or the Taoiseach's teeth in that case, when accountability came knocking on the door.  Those are important elements if it is to sustain its impetus.</p> <p>  The work of the Oireachtas and groups around the country in sustaining interest will also be hugely important.</p></speech>

The Committee on Climate Action has a fixed term and a mandate to deliver.  There is no doubt that the oversight of my Department, whether it reverts back to the standard committee or remains under this single purpose committee, will stand and fall over whether we successfully deliver on the climate action agenda.  We have communications and other really important things too, but climate action will be central and Oireachtas oversight is central to any public service performance.</p></speech>

The national mitigation plan was produced in July 2017, which is some time ago.  The numbers tell their own story.  For a while, due to the impact of the recession, Ireland looked as if it was going well.  It was when the recovery came that we realised that the type of structural change that needed to happen had not happened.  The national mitigation plan was the first whole-of-Government address of the issue.  Undoubtedly, it would be easier if we had started earlier but equally one must bear in mind that it was a lost decade.  We all know that.  One can look at other sectors of our economic and social provision.  We were unable to make the investments in health and other sectors in those years that one would have wanted.  I will not comment on what has happened before me.</p></speech>

That is the current criterion.  It is crazy but that is type of climate reaction we have.</p></speech>

When I was the Minister for Education and Skills, although we included retrofit energy as a big part of the ten-year plan, I also had to say most days that getting bums on seats was my top priority and that I had to cater for 20,000 more pupils than in the previous year.  One of the messages Robert Watt is signalling is that this must change and that there must be a reappraisal of the priorities in big spending Departments such as the Department of Education and Skills.  If I was there now I would be expecting whoever was in this seat to be forcing that agenda on me.  Hopefully, with support across the Government, we can get changes in the type of attitude the Deputy has described.  I do not know enough about boilers in schools to give the Deputy a detailed answer but he is correct that some of these attitudes must change.  We must find ways of doing that.</p></speech>

It outlined the spheres where we have to make changes and what changes needed to occur.  It has rightly been criticised for not being a roadmap.  The climate advisory committee is a strong critic that what we need is a proper roadmap, not a series of signposts, but that is what we are doing now.  It is a natural evolution of the mitigation plan followed by the national development plan, which has some big spending commitments for a decade, followed by this detailed work which we must do to underpin those ambitions with the type of policy tools that will make them happen.</p></speech>

Funding of lighting would not be at the challenging end of funding.  Obviously, the Department and the local authorities must come up with how they fund it.  This was priming the pump to get something done to make an impact on climate change.  As it is well developed, they will be borrowing for it, which is natural enough.  It is the type of area where one can borrow to deliver because it has a rapid payback.  The more challenging areas in funding will be the ones that have a slower payback.  It had the lowest proportionate grant because it was largely self-funding, as well as the fact that it was in the ETS sector, and we are really seeking change in the non-ETS sector.  Six of the seven projects were in the non-ETS sector, such as transport and so forth.</p></speech>

This committee has been trying to move matters forward in as non-adversarial and non-partisan a manner as possible.  The Minister's frank analysis is helpful is assisting us in trying to do that.  The Chairman asked the Minister about targets.  I published a Bill that seeks to reintroduce targets.  The reason is that in Ireland, we are quite good generally and culturally at doing something tomorrow, next week or next year.  When one speaks to policy makers, as the Minister indicated with regard to the Department of Education and Skills, there is always another priority that seems to be far greater at a point in time.  As climate change is something in the future, we tend to leave it on the back burner.  I recall talking about this in 2009 and 2010 when people were talking about 2020 and 2030 targets.  We are nearly at those dates and we are a long way off the targets.</p> <p>  We are probably safe to some extent because for the past three or four years the concern was all about what it was going to cost us.  As we were coming out of an economic downturn, money was a priority and that captured people's attention.  Now we have more money than we had and people have moved on.  The focus is now on the damage that is being done and the window the Minister rightly identified for when we can make some changes.  We must be about action from now on.</p><p>The Minister talked about the mitigation plan of July 2017 not really being the full suite of policies needed by 2020.  Does the Minister hope that his next mitigation plan will have a more comprehensive suite of measures with clearly set out implications?  Many will have negative implications and it is better to address it up-front.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine gave one of the better presentations here.  It seemed to have given it more thought and one might say that so it should.  It was in a position to say that if we need to do more, we can do more, but that will have a significant impact on the economy.  We need to have that debate.  If we are going to have a significant impact on climate change, our economy will have to change significantly and there will be cost implications.  Anything we can do to push that up front is good.</p><p> Carbon tax did not happen in the budget.  There is no point in going back over that.  Does the Minister see himself or the Department being in a position to publish their trajectory for the next ten years or the trajectory that we should be on?  I do not want to play the politics of this.  There was a discussion at a recent Fine Gael gathering about significant tax cuts for a certain squeezed middle.  The political debate from that centred around tax-raising measures being carbon taxes.  We have seen what happened in France this week, where people have become mightily frustrated with the inability of the Government to reinvest the carbon tax into measures to decarbonise the economy.  I think only 5% of what is collected goes into the decarbonisation fund.  People are ahead of us and understand what needs to be done, but they will not want the State to become dependent on carbon tax as we have on so many other duties and levies, whether on fossil fuels, cigarettes or alcohol.  We need to be clear that the moneys collected are ring-fenced and used to decarbonise the economy, such as in assisting and supporting cleaner and greener energy generation, for example, offshore generation.</p><p> The Minister talked about foreshore licences.  There will be a requirement for much greater interventions than just offshore energy.  It is nascent technology, especially in deep sea, so will require significant support from the State, but that is where there is long-term potential for us.  If we manage to bridge that gap and harness the wind in that zone, we will have significant benefits to economic activity elsewhere.  There are other areas, such as investment in the deep retrofitting of homes.  The moneys collected in taxation need to be seen to be used.  We need guidelines for onshore wind generation.  It is not done by the Minister's Department but he will have to drive it.  We know how good Government is regardless of who is there, with one Department passing the buck to the other.  That happened with the Airbnb issue during the week, where no one wanted to carry the can.  This is a much bigger issue than Airbnb so somebody will have to be prepared to take those tough decisions.  I think the Minister has the experience, ability and leadership capacity to do it.  I think he will find, from my experience on this committee, that there is willingness to do this in a bipartisan way.  Deputy Bruton is the Minister so he will have to lead and we will be beside him on that.</p></speech>

If one says it is fair that every sector takes a 30% cut, the cost of that in some sectors may be dramatically different from others.  One has to be careful in setting a target because one then forces perhaps a very high-cost solution in one sector.  We were just talking about agriculture.  The impact of setting the same target in agriculture as in some other sector could be quite high for certain rural communities.  It is important that we have sectoral targets.  We have to work through policy options and towards the targets so that they are consistent about where we get to but do not overprescribe.  That is the only advice I have.</p> <p>  We aim to have a comprehensive suite of measures.  The Deputy rightly signalled that there will be a balance to strike.  Some sectors will argue that reducing carbon is a significant handicap to our sector.  If this was a smoking chimney and the Deputy said he needed to continue to have a smoking chimney in the middle of his community to support a business he was running, people would give him short shrift.  There is not much difference here.  Damage is being done and we need to factor that into decision-making.  The challenge in some areas is how we get people to take decisions which factor that in.  The message will be that where carbon continues to be used for whatever reason, it has to be used very effectively.  There have to be good, effective minimisation policies in place.  Having carbon use mitigated by carbon sequestration is not a full end but that is the message.</p> <p>  With regard to the carbon tax, if one had built spending plans on the back of the plastic bag tax, one would be pretty disappointed because people just stopped using plastic bags.  In an ideal world, people would stop using carbon so the amount of money raised from this tax would fall rapidly.  It is instructive to see what happened in Paris.  If people see they are paying for certain behaviours but getting something back, they can also see that taxpayers are not having money taken off them but are being nudged towards doing certain things.  One would hope that it would be easier to sell a carbon tax in that context.</p> <p>  Of course we will need mitigation measures and they will cost money but, at the end of the day, mitigation measures and whether they should be in the form of penalties, incentives, tax breaks or whatever, have to stand on their own and on their merits.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his Department would say that one cannot create a charmed area of public spending that is guaranteed the money.  If we are making an investment in climate change and arguing for an incentive for whatever, we will have to show that that is the best use of public money against carbon targets and other targets.  Public spending rules must still apply but they have to factor in the price of carbon.  It was very positive to see that come from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I recognise that offshore generation is at an earlier stage of development.  That is correct.  I thank Deputy Dooley for the positive support.  This is not a partisan issue.  We have to deliver it as a group of politicians.</p></speech>

Did he answer what pathway he sees for agriculture towards carbon neutrality by 2050?  How will that work?</p><p>It is fair to say that agriculture has been singled out for particular criticism for carbon emissions, and we need only look at the Citizens' Assembly.  We all know, however, that we are the most carbon efficient when it comes to dairy, fifth best when it comes to beef, and we have great ambitions to do better.  Does the Minister see it as a difficulty or obstacle for us that in the EU compliance regime we are given no credit or recognition for the fact that we produce food more carbon efficiently than other EU countries?  Notwithstanding all of the efforts that farmers have made when it comes to the sector being assessed, other than it being put into the general pot to consider what our carbon emissions are, they get no credit for it and their hands are tied.  Surely this is not fair.  People have to be fed.  Being fed is not optional.  We know that world markets show that more people are getting the protein in their diet from dairy and beef.  The demand is there.  If we do not supply it, another country will fill that gap, I have no doubt.  I am not talking about another EU country but a country that does not have the same strict standards as we do.</p><p> We are encouraging farmers towards renewables, microgeneration and perhaps anaerobic digestion and solar panels, but I am very concerned that while we speak about these things as options for farmers, we need clarification that if farmers are given State grant aid to put a solar panel on a roof or are assisted with anaerobic digestion, it will not give them a credit on their farms whereby they can state they are reducing their emissions, taking personal responsibility and going whatever way they can on the road towards carbon neutrality on their farm, but instead it is all put into the general pot.  I am not saying it is not a good thing if more people use solar panels, but we need to have a more tailored approach to farming given the efforts farmers have made and the successes they have had.  This needs to be recognised and put out there.</p><p> I have a question on the carbon tax.  Farmers were identified by the Citizens' Assembly in particular for an additional carbon tax in certain circumstances, but I want to ask about the bigger picture.  This is a worldwide problem.  Are Middle Eastern and OPEC oil-producing countries being taxed?  What is the principle?  What are their commitments?  The problem is fossil fuels and that is what we are trying to rid our system of.  They are producing them.  How will they pull back on them?  Will they be carbon taxed in some way?  Have they signed up to it?</p><p> As I see it, if a carbon tax is put on fuel in this country, which was not done in the recent budget and which I believe was a wise move, it will be the consumer who pays it.  We are here asking farmers potentially to take on an additional cost, as nothing has been decided, but what about the big oil-producing countries providing to the market and making it so cheap and attractive?  I have my doubts.  We keep being told about the oil that is still there and there is the debate about peak oil, but we have to drill down into this.  There are ramifications for individuals in a sector that has a lot of positivity and has a lot to add to our economy.</p></speech>

In each sector we have to work out these pathways.  The Senator made the point rightly that Irish agriculture is more efficient in milk production and that the carbon intensity of milk is lower in Ireland than anywhere else, but the EU still had to set national targets.  Where there were big sectors such as this, they brought them inside the emissions trading system, ETS, cap and trade model.  Some sectors were brought in so, for example, if we were efficient in wind power we could get it onto our grid and get credits in the ETS.  Agriculture has not been considered for the cap and trade arena, but in such an arena, whoever brings in a carbon efficient measure can sell carbon credits and get a direct return.</p></speech>

In Ireland alone we have 350,000 enterprises so it would be very difficult if we multiply this by 27 member states.  It would be very difficult to have cap and trade targets for all of those multiple sectors.  It would be very difficult to administer.  The reason cap and trade was done was there were a small number of large producers and this was a good way of getting a cost-effective change.  There were critics of it, as the Deputy probably knows.  They are facing a 43% reduction in the ETS and they are not being allowed off scot free.  They have to reduce their carbon emissions by 43%.</p></speech>

In adopting measures, we cannot be looking over our shoulder and asking what the Arabs or Russians are doing.  We have to take responsibility.  We have to do it in a way that recognises other pressures, which is why it is important the measures we adopt are consciously least cost, which means least cost in terms of their social impact and impact on our communities.  We cannot say let us not think about carbon tax because someone might not be paying it.  Carbon tax is a tax on final users.  It is a tax that will mean that in the way we live, eat, sleep and work we will take into account the price of carbon, regardless of whether it is manufactured in Polish coal mines or Arab oilfields.  We will seek to cut our intensity of carbon use and we will use price to do it.  That is what the issue is about.  It is not a production tax.  It is a tax on the final user.</p> <p>  With regard to grants and credits, some of the investment on farms can give a payback and Teagasc's work shows there is payback for very many of them.  We are not asking people to do something whereby they are playing for the board, as we used to say in cards, whereby people take a sacrifice on themselves for no return.  This is improving the efficiency of their operation, allowing them generate their own power and heat and sell it into the grid when they have surplus.  Some of these are very positive economic opportunities for farmers to take on.  Of course, they may have to be promoted by tariffs into the grid.</p></speech>

The three major pillars are set out fairly well - the car fleet, public transport and then walking and cycling.  That is the logical order although it might be turned the other way around in terms of priority.  They are included, which is welcome.  In respect of the charging network for electric vehicles, EVs, &euro;10 million was announced the other day in the first round of funding from the climate action fund.  If I heard the Minister's opening remarks correctly, he said we would move to half a million EVs by 2025.  The &euro;10 million will support a fleet of 40,000 EVs.  At that pace, does the Minister foresee us being able to reach our target at this rate of investment?  The issue of ownership of the network is very important.  Until recently, the ESB was being told by the regulator that it had to divest itself of it, as I understand.  What is the situation now?  I do not think the State should be boxed in by the EU on this matter.  The ESB is there and has the network.  It is easy for it to put in new charging points, including home charging points, from public electric lighting columns.  Will it be owned and run by the ESB?</p></speech>

The expectation is that the number purchased will double next year, so another 4,000.  The support for a fleet of 40,000 gives us headroom for a few years but it is by no means thought of as a charging network for 500,000 vehicles, which is the target for 2030.  It is a matter of kick-starting the system.  The issue of range anxiety, which is at the heart of it, will be addressed.  This funding is for 180 fast chargers and 500 other chargers.  Clearly, over time, the network is going to expand very rapidly if we are to deliver our target, and 500,000 may not be ambitious enough.  If we are to move forward, we need to be more ambitious.  The regulator has changed its approach to the ESB and its role in respect of the charging network.</p></speech>

Obviously, it will be doing it in partnership with others so I expect other players will come in over time.  The application is to be validated and the full detail of where and with whom is to be worked out.  The other thing I should say is that those who buy electric vehicles get &euro;600 towards a home charger, so they can have a charger of their own.  Presumably the 7,000 vehicles have 7,000 home chargers in place, so there is a network.  We will have to build that network.  These measures are front-loading the chargers so that people can feel confident to buy.  By the time up to 40,000 vehicles have been purchased, we will have to have anticipated that and will have to have pushed the provision out well beyond that again.</p></speech>

It places an obligation on fuel suppliers to include a proportion of biofuels in the fuel supplied.  The obligation was to move from the current 8% to 11% from January 2019.  What is the state of readiness for the biofuel mix changes to happen by January?  What kind of challenges does the Minister anticipate in terms of reaching the 11% target?  There may be an argument about land use and all that but the move to 11% is in the transition statement.</p></speech>

I cannot remember the coupon but it was a very keen rate; I am sure we can get the figure for the Deputy.  I do not know the projects for which it is being deployed but I know it was oversubscribed by several multiples.  There is a market for raising funds for green bonds.  The challenge in respect of some of the more difficult investments to fund will be to find funding vehicles that can avail of green bonds and other appetite in the sector.  We will have to think a little bit outside the box.  In the case of farming, which we were just talking about, we might look at the role of co-ops.  There are other players we may need to enlist to be able to facilitate-----</p></speech>

We have a very narrow portfolio of renewable energy, mainly onshore wind.  Our difficulties with that have been well rehearsed.  The planning reform needed for offshore is a very cumbersome process at the moment.  I am not advocating that we burn all the planning laws or anything but there is wide recognition that we need to consolidate them.  It should be dealt with by one body, perhaps a local authority, in that functional area along the shoreline of a particular part of the State.  There was some provision made for offshore wind in the renewable energy support scheme.  The heads of a Bill in respect of the planning reform needed for offshore development have been published.  Has any progress been made on that legislation?</p></speech>

Planning regulations may be an issue as well.  For as long as I have been in politics, there has been talk of reforming the Foreshore Acts.  This goes back a long time.  My understanding of the difficulty is that they are trying to accommodate in one fell swoop the transport, fishery, and offshore wind needs.  It is complex legislation.</p><p>The issue will be whether, in the case of offshore wind, one could develop some sort of purpose-built instrument that would allow the development of that asset or whether it has to remain within the much wider context of foreshore activity.</p></speech>

One of my criticisms is that it is a bit Dublin centred although the seven projects are all very worthy in their own right.  The Bord na M&oacute;na transition is not included and there is no allocation for that organisation.  We know from meeting Bord na M&oacute;na representatives that they need funding to make the transition.</p> <p>  The three peat stations are moving to biomass.  The Edenderry plant is 50% co-fired with biomass.  It is a little crazy that we are converting the peat plants to biomass without having the supply chain in this country.  We have talked about diversification in farming.  Before I came in here, I met representatives of Friends of the Earth and when I go out I will meet representatives of the IFA.  They have contrasting positions.  Bearing those in mind, we have to make sure we have a supply chain.  Some work has been done, particularly regarding forestry waste and thinnings, but an issue arises over hemp and other agricultural products.  I flagged this a lot with the Minister's predecessor.  I wish to flag it with the current Minister because we could end up in crazy circumstances in which we will be hauling biomass material from the far side of the world to here.  It will look clean going into the power station but the carbon footprint associated with getting the material here will be substantial.  Environmental damage is being done in some of the countries where the biomass material is coming from, including countries in South America, in terms of deforestation.  I am flagging this as an area for action.  Is any work being done on this?  </p></speech>

There was the scheme for electric vehicles and there were schemes associated with public lighting and natural gas.  The latter was agriculture-based, using natural gas injection.  Therefore, there was a mix.  The schemes were not all Dublin-based.  There were two district heating schemes in Dublin but that is because the incinerator is there.  Some of the network piping has been installed in anticipation of the possibility.  There is the capacity to reach 50,000 homes.  There was another scheme in Tallaght.  On the next occasion, we will be seeking to have more engagement from regional and community groups and clusters of enterprises with common sectoral-----</p></speech>

Obviously, there is independent adjudication so decisions have to be based on the quality of the proposals.  There was a marking system.  The marking system covered the impact on carbon emissions, the degree of innovation and so on.  A very fair marking system was put in place.  The schemes that won were ones that could have a wide community impact, to be fair to them.  Some of the others were more individual, with enterprises proposing combined heat and power facilities.  They did not pass the rating tests.  Whether we need to change the rating tests, I do not know.  They sounded like good tests to me.  I signed off on them at some stage after seeing them.  They seemed to be correctly weighted.  Certainly, we will be working to have more clusters of enterprises and sectors of opportunity, including and definitely from the midlands.</p> <p>  I do not know whether there is work on a sub-supply sector for biomass.</p></speech>

He has been very open and engaging.  I perceive from him a sense of energy regarding what needs to be done here.  With that in mind, is the all-of-government approach modelled on a Cabinet subcommittee whereby all the line Departments will report directly to the Taoiseach via the Minister's Department?</p></speech>

I doubt if it will involve establishing a separate Cabinet committee.  I do not know yet.  We will have to decide the best model and hear people's input.  I chair a high-level group of assistant secretaries, representing five Departments.  That group will probably be key.  Whether the Taoiseach chooses to have an individual Cabinet committee for this agenda or whether it becomes part of a wider initiative remains to be seen.  The important point is that the structure overseen by the Taoiseach will have the endorsement from the top that gives it impetus.</p></speech>

We now need to start reaching serious milestones.

It will also involve overseeing the delivery and working with the Oireachtas and other groups to populate the coming year's agenda.  This is not a static process whereby we decide in February that this is it for all time and that we should just continue to implement as before.  It is evolving.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke highly of the intervention of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt.  Is is envisaged that carbon budgeting will be used as a tool by line Departments to ensure a decarbonisation agenda?  Representatives of the IPCC who were before the committee spoke about the successful application of carbon budgets.  They gave the example from France.

We would welcome any move towards that.</p> <p>  The Minister gave very specific examples, including on market failure and regulatory frameworks.  I am sure he is interested in ensuring the deep retrofitting of buildings, including public buildings, private dwellings and schools.  We had very positive engagement with the Tipperary Energy Agency.  I believe strongly that if the Minister were to visit Nenagh and speak to staff in the agency, he would note three bespoke examples.  One is a primary school, one is a municipal health centre and the third is a house.  The Tipperary model is a very good stakeholder model based on a social enterprise model.</p><p>If the Minister could engage on replicating it regionally or right across the country, it would be possible to use the carbon fund, and also possibly the green fund, in a way that would allow a financing instrument to bring the model to fruition.</p></speech>

Each year, the SEAI encourages community-based initiatives.  At present, it has a call out for such an initiative in respect of a mixture of schools, enterprises and homes.  We will address this matter by finding clusters within our communities or across enterprises that can create the impetus for change.  I very much recognise the value of this.  There are some instruments already in place but we need to see if they can be improved upon.</p></speech>

I respectfully ask him to examine the Tipperary model and kick the tyres in that regard.  It is an excellent model.</p> <p>  The other point relates to the just transition.  If the Minister cannot respond now, he can come back to me.  The language of the just transition has gained serious traction.  It refers to fairness for workers who are moving into a decarbonised society to ensure that there are supports and social protection-type structures put in place so that the transition is just.  This matter has been discussed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Will the Minister consider engaging with ICTU to see if funding similar to that available in Spain and other countries could be put in place?  In the mining industry in Spain, for example, a &euro;250 million fund was put in place to assist workers who are getting out of the sector.  I am merely putting this on the agenda for further discussion, perhaps offline.</p></speech>

It will be around retraining, new opportunities, setting up enterprises, and seeding enterprise hubs.  Some of the machinery for that is already in place.  When I was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department had regional enterprise bodies, which are generally led by someone from the private sector, with representatives from all relevant entities involved.  We have regional enterprise funds, disruptive technology funds, climate changes funds and funds for rural and urban areas.  Some of the material we have put out relates very much to the development of bottom-up initiatives but if there is need for additional catalysts to bring this together, I am open to that.  The conference in Poland is taking place in Silesia, which is located in the depths of Polish coal-mining country.  The emphasis there is very much on how to develop a transition for such a region to a new economy.</p></speech>

My question may not be fair but I will ask it in any event.  In view of the challenge we are facing in the context of the need for climate action, is it not time that we had a Minister whose sole responsibility would be to steer us through the transition to decarbonise our economy?  In other words, should we not have a Minister with responsibility for climate action?</p> <p>  My other question relates to the climate action regional offices and where they are based.  It is great that a whole-of-Government approach is being taken - this is something that has been strongly advocated at these hearings - but we also need a whole-of-society approach.  I hear that in what the Minister is saying but it is important to recognise that every single person needs to be engaged.  There are great opportunities to get the message out in that regard.  We need to focus on communications in respect of what is happening on climate change.  That brings me to the role which can be played by RT&Eacute; and Met &Eacute;ireann.  Has RT&Eacute;, as the State broadcaster, done enough to address the fact that the climate is changing?  Are the station's correspondents focusing on the latter in their news reports?  Forecasters from Met &Eacute;ireann broadcast many times daily.  Is there an opportunity for them in this regard?  If legislation is needed, it could be fast-tracked.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Sherlock about the unions and the just transition forum they have advocated to manage this.  There is a question as to whether a new or, given that Ireland is a small country, an existing organisation would do this.  My question relates to the unions being influencers for 800,000 to 900,000 workers they represent.  They could be massive influencers.  There is a tremendous opportunity for them to communicate on climate change and, perhaps, negotiate on behalf of their members in respect of matters such as electric or hybrid vehicles.</p></speech>

The process must be Government-led.  The key to success is the amount of effort made put into the challenge by other Departments rather than the one with "Climate Action" in its title.  That requires the authority coming from Cabinet and the Taoiseach, not from one individual member of the Government.  In the past, we have occasionally salved our consciences by putting some words into a Minister's title and stating that the job was done because we had a Minister for "X".  The quality of what we do will be judged by the quality of the actions that we bring forward and our ability to implement them on time.  I do not believe that packaging it off into one corner will work, although I acknowledge that others take a different view.</p> <p>  I have no reason to criticise RT&Eacute; or Met &Eacute;ireann.  The latter is involved in a very ambitious project relating to prediction, flooding and so on, which is designed to improve our capability in the context of adaptation and anticipation.  I am sure both organisations are doing excellent work.  At a broader level, every State agency should have a carbon mandate and a responsibility in procurement, at its lowest level.  State agencies should also be working on those areas in respect of which they can play a role in influencing policy.</p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na was mentioned.  It could have such a profound influence on what is happening across entire communities, as well as fulfilling its core role of operating as a commercial enterprise.  We need to examine how we can recast some of the mandates of our State agencies and integrate the expectation that their client bases will undertake change in the context of their work.  That may only involve a soft nudge or it may involve a harder one, but we need to get every agency thinking about it.  There will soon be results for public buildings and how well certain Departments have been doing.  I have had sight of some of the relevant information prior to publication and, although it is not complete, the range of performers, from low to high, is evident.  Low performers should have a mandate that they are expected to report annually as to why they continue to perform below par and whether there is a justifiable reason for that.  We need to think about lifting the mandate of organisations.  We will need to enlist the help of all groups - including trade unions and community groups - that can influence people's behaviour in the context of climate change.</p><p>I do not know about block purchases.  That is probably a matter for its own membership as to whether it is an advantage.  However, the GAA, for example, looked seriously at energy retrofitting.  I do not know whether that developed, but I know the organisation was certainly looking into it a couple of years ago, and is a project that might be revived.</p></speech>

I believe that because of my own experience in government during a very difficult period.  However, in 2011 we were on target to meet our 2020 targets.  We were on 11% and were heading in the right direction.  While much of that was due to the recession, and in particular the loss of transport, EPA analysis at the time showed that half of it was due to political commitment.  The Department of Justice and Equality had a collective agreement in this area.  I was working in the Minister's job at the time, and had a sense that the regulators, the agencies, the business community and the public were all behind the shift and we were going to be able to do it.  We were the first country in the world to introduce a charging network for electric vehicles.  We had to practically shoot through the Department of Finance in what was the toughest budget, in 2009, but we got it through.  During the toughest time we managed to put money aside for the greenway in Mayo, which is an incredible example of what can be done when sustainable travel is promoted.  We got everyone behind a retrofitting scheme for homes, which is the best investment we can make.  It took off and the public loved it as it led to better and healthier homes.  We set a 40% target for electricity, which everyone at the time said was impossible and could not be done.  We are going to be late achieving the target but we will get there.  We had leadership.  We set higher building standards, which helped to set up Irish companies which export insulation materials across the world because we are good at it.  We can be good when we approach an issue collectively.</p> <p>  I apologise for being political here, but what went wrong after that was not just that a recession hit us.  We were able to achieve some of the things I outlined in the teeth of a recession.  The problem was that Fine Gael took its eye off the climate agenda; it had no interest in it.  The public service also did a disservice to the public by not holding the line in terms of thinking long term and making sure we stuck to what we knew we had to do.  The national mitigation plan is recognised as an unmitigated disaster.  Climate Action Network Europe assessed how the different countries are engaging in the recent European climate process and rates Ireland just above Poland, which is an incredible disgrace for our country.  We learned that there was no consideration of climate in our national development plan which runs until 2040.  John FitzGerald was right when he said that we are completely off course and heading in the wrong direction.  I have to say that unfortunately the first three or four presentations we heard today from our public service were deeply disappointing, culminating in the jaw-dropping moment when the head of the Science Foundation Ireland reassured the committee that we should not worry about climate change because technological solutions, including carbon capture technologies, will become available.  It beggared belief.  </p> <p>  We are at a point of change.  Various Deputies have mentioned that we should act with a common purpose and agree that now is the time for change.  I attended the Stop Climate Chaos meeting earlier at Buswell's Hotel.  People were genuinely worried.  They can see it happening and can read all the statistics, which show that we are 95% off target.  There is a sense that the Oireachtas is not doing anything, and people are really anxious about that.  I told them that we are changing, and that now is the time for change.  Things are about to turn in a really dramatic way, and I hope that this committee can help achieve that goal.  It means changing everything.  </p> <p>  The Minister said that there are six different categories.  Does he believe we should structure our approach in that way?  Is that how he plans to approach the European Commission in terms of carrying out a report under those six headings?  I would add a seventh; we have to look at the whole concept of systems change and how we use our land.  We should start with a national land use plan that really thinks big and brave about the type of farming done in Ireland and where it is done, about wilderness, about how we bring back biodiversity, which is connected to this climate issue, where we put forestry and what type of forestry we should have, and considers what we should do with our sea area, which is massive and which could be turned into a marine conservation area as part of our contribution to the global fight against the loss of biodiversity and climate change.  I believe we are at the point of change, but the annual transition statement, presented yesterday to the Seanad by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, was a further disgrace.  We all know the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has been completely absent from any discussions on climate change.  It is an open secret.  There was no recognition yesterday that the fundamental system change we have to make is to ensure that there is less demand for transport and to reverse the trend we have seen of ever-lengthening commutes.  There was a 30% increase in the number of people commuting for over an hour between 2011 and 2016.  That has to stop.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport seems to have no knowledge of that.  The Minister said correctly that 90% of the cars we pass every morning have a single occupant.  We have to think about systems change and get away from this car-based, individual, atomised system and move towards one where car sharing and cycling is the absolute norm and that public transport is given the first priority.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland is solving our gridlock and climate transport problems by widening all the approach roads to Dublin at the moment.  If we are at a moment of change there has to be brutal recognition that TII is fundamentally confused, misguided and wrong, and it needs to change.  The national development plan does not achieve our objectives and must change.  </p> <p>  The Minister has said he will submit this plan to the European Commission in February.  We were always working on the assumption that this-----</p></speech>

If we have to go into private session we should do it, by all means.  We wondered whether there were additional projects because there is a shortfall, as the Minister recognised, and wanted to get an understanding of those projects so that we could write our report in a way that would help the Department and the Minister in the task it faces.  What is the timeline here?  Are we going to write a first plan that admits that we are at this point of change and that we do not have all our plans worked out yet?  It will take us some time to work on this system change, including the internal governance change, which I agree with the Minister on.  Could this committee help by getting agreement before Christmas on the carbon tax issue?  We should acknowledge that it will provide a dividend for citizens, as the Taoiseach has suggested and as the Green Party has also said.  Would it help if we could agree on that as one of the items of system change we need?  What is due in February if that is-----</p></speech>

We have to produce a draft energy and climate policy in December 2018 and a completed policy in December 2019.  There is a one year window between the draft and the completion of the policy.  I am working to a similar deadline to the Deputy and aim to have a whole-of-Government policy in place by February.  What we submit to the EU in the next couple of weeks will contain many of the elements we know about, including initiatives in the national development plan, the national mitigation plan and other initiatives already in place.  Much of what we already know of will be included in that, but there are areas we have to push further on where we do not have established consensus on, and that is the work I have to do between now and next September.  Hopefully, there will be a degree of cross-party support for some of the initiatives.</p><p>That is my understanding.  The last word is not what goes in to the EU in December, nor does it regard it as the last word.  It regards it as a draft.</p></speech>

We will not get agreement on everything because it is so difficult and such a huge challenge.  It is bigger than the jobs task, as I said to the Taoiseach a number of weeks ago.  However, would it help the Minister if we were to get agreement on proposals that, for example, we go for 20,000 ha of continuous cover forestry that really restores our biodiversity and do likewise in restoring our peatlands or consider using Bord na M&oacute;na as one of the key vehicles to deliver a deep retrofit of 45,000 houses?  Does the Minister want these big, chunky projects from us?  What does he want?  What does he think this committee could do that would help his Department in this process?  We will not have it all written by Christmas but we could set ourselves on the right iterative and constant process and track to get ourselves to the sort of system change we need.</p></speech>

It is a matter of setting an ambition that must be not only ambitious but also achievable and realistic.  I do not expect the committee to go down to the granular level at which we will have to engage at cross-departmental level.  Carbon tax is self-evident.  As for forestry, again, we are well off the targets we have set ourselves, as I understand it.  Bigger areas and direction of change would be really important for the committee.  It cannot be the case that all the mystery of solving this is just left to someone else.  The committee cannot propose that we have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 and not give us some kind of indication of the route that would get us there.</p></speech>

I was caught up in another committee.  I have just a few pointers.  I was part of the delegation that met the Tipperary Energy Agency.  I found the trip extremely educational.  I do not have an environmental or climate background but I have an interest in the area.  As Deputy Sherlock said, we need to look at this more and consider rolling it out more across the councils or local government.  We have a blueprint there.  The grassroots or people on the ground and local government are mentioned in the briefing we got today.  This would be my emphasis, given my background in local government.  However, the biggest reservation I have about all this and whatever decision we will make in January will be how it will be communicated and how we will implement it on the ground.  We must get that right, and I am talking as a collective.  I could be very political here if I wanted to be but I will remove the politics from this.  If whatever agreement we put in place is to work, our communication strategy will be vital.  I stress that if we do not communicate it properly and we lose the ground on it, we will set ourselves back further.  I would stress to whoever will be the communications lead on this that that should be front and centre.  It is all very fine putting out a good solution together, but if we cannot implement it or if people on the ground do not buy into it, we will be setting ourselves back.  We have plenty of experience of this down through the years where we have got it wrong.  I very much agree with the Minister that we must be ambitious but also realistic.  I am not a climate denier.  We know what is happening and we know it is out there but, as I said, it all goes back to how this will interact with human nature and on the ground and how people will buy into it.</p> <p>  Some work on this has been done in other committees.  Specifically, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has done a report on climate change.  I do not want to come in with one big sweeping stick and make these massive changes that, again, will not work or be able to be implemented on the ground and which people will not buy into.  This goes back to the kernel of agriculture.  I represent a rural, agricultural community.  This is on the minds of the people I represent.  Farmers are talking about it because they understand that issues are coming down the tracks, it has been spoken about on the airwaves and it is becoming more politically mainstream.  We must be mindful of this and take on board what the agriculture industry is coming back to us with because that is a huge part of who we are and our economy.  It is our natural resource.</p></speech>

There is no doubt but that we will fail if we do not get communities to engage.  Much of this is about people changing the way they travel, work and heat and insulate their homes and the choices they make in all kinds of lifestyle areas.  To make this effective, one must be aware of the constraints with which people are living their lives.  One cannot come in from Mars with some view of the perfect way to live, so this will be challenging.  Equally, one cannot pay for the adjustment.  The sorts of changes that will have to be made are beyond the State's capacity to fund.  To take as an example the housing sector, I think &euro;50 billion would be needed if we were to upgrade our housing to the level stated.  The national development plan is making &euro;4 billion in total available, I think.  There are many individual homes and communities, and we are going to have to find ways other than subsidies to encourage people to make this happen.  It cannot just be by fiat; we must bring people with us.  The urgency is the other side of it.  We do not have the time to say this will be done over an extended period during which one will hardly notice the difference.  It must be done rapidly.  This is why we have some of the best minds in politics together in this room to try to come up with ways in which we will do this.  It is not easy and I do not pretend it is, but I go back to what I said at the beginning.  The window for doing anything about this is closing very rapidly, so we do not have the time to hang back.  As the Prime Minister of Fiji said, we are all in the same canoe.  If we puncture the canoe, we all go down together.  We would not avoid the impact of the kind of disruption that would happen globally if we failed to respond to this.  We must therefore act with conviction and belief in the importance of this while also recognising communities' role in buying into it.  That is the challenge.  All suggestions will be gratefully received.  I cannot do this on my own.  Collectively, the body politic must square up to this.</p></speech>

I have a certain sympathy with the suggestion but the matter is a little more interesting because the first recommendation of the special Citizens' Assembly on this issue was for a new independent body with a broad range of functions and powers in respect of climate change.  This was to ensure as a matter of urgency that the body would be "resourced appropriately, operated in an open and transparent manner, and be given a broad range of new functions and powers in legislation to urgently address climate change".  The reason I read this out is that when this was before the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I think it was Robert Watt who responded in an extraordinarily passionate way in opposition to it.  He was absolutely, 1,000% against the idea of an independent body overseeing the implementation of climate change policy.  It struck me how deeply he felt about it.  I would not mind if the Minister would comment on this because I think that is what is needed to ensure that not just the Minister but the next Government and the Government after that do what is required.</p><p>As we have been discussing, the challenge is enormous.  Transition is the big issue.  I argue, however, that events in France and Australia indicate to us that the question of a just transition is not all it seems on paper.  Deciding to put a carbon tax on fuel, heating, etc., does not cut the mustard even if there are dividends that are given back to the poor.  France is a good example because it is not unlike here.</p><p> Most of the blockades in response to the issue took place in Paris and the outskirts of the city.  Reading the background to these events, what has happened is that people have been pushed out of the city.  They are now living in satellite towns and cities elsewhere.  At the same time, public transport has been reduced, with some 11,000 km of railway track being removed.  I am not proposing we do anything like that here.  It is a different scale of a country.  The resentment, however, that average French workers - not the very poor - have towards the French Government derives from their having been pushed out of the cities, being forced to use their cars and then being told that they have to pay for it.  In addition, the wealth tax in France was reduced at the same time.  </p><p> A just transition has to be that - it has to be just.  If it is unjust, then, as all of us have argued here, communities, people and workers, like those in Bord na M&oacute;na, will not buy into it.  Why is the Minister opposing the Bill People Before Profit is, hopefully, about to put before the D&aacute;il?  The Bill is intended to stop the issuing of any further licences for offshore fossil fuel exploration.  When we raised this with representatives of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, who appeared before this committee, I asked Professor Sonia Seneviratne if she thought this Bill would make a difference or had a role to play in fighting climate change.  Her answer was that we have to make every effort not to add additional CO2, and engaging in further oil exploration is, therefore, not a solution.  What was said makes sense.  It would make sense for Ireland to turn away from fossil fuel as a source.  Any additional CO2 emitted will contribute to the problem and yet the Minister and his Government are opposing this Bill when it has received broad cross-party support.  </p><p> The other point I would like to put to the Minister is an argument against a carbon tax on the average person.  A carbon tax should be placed instead on the profits of the fossil fuel companies.  An economist told this committee yesterday that to put a carbon tax on the profits of fossil fuel companies would require an EU-wide response.  In other words, corporation tax rates would have to be agreed on a European basis.  This Government, and this country, however, consistently resists that sort of approach.  We do not have much time left and the Minister has acknowledged that this is urgent.  There is not much of a window left to address this issue.  We are all up the same creek without a paddle.  Can we get this right?  Can we put the taxes on industries instead of on ordinary people and can we get support from the Minister's party for a simple Bill which seeks to halt the issuing of any further licences for offshore fossil fuel exploration?  </p></speech>

It is not to raise money.  A carbon tax is to ensure people pay for the carbon damage their activities cause.  In an ideal world this carbon tax would eventually raise no funds.  It is not a question of finding some profitable enterprise and raising funds from it.  This is about getting people to change their attitude to how they heat their home, choose their travel options, etc.  That is the purpose of a carbon tax.  It is to signal to every enterprise, home and community that when we create carbon we are, to use the Deputy's word, doing something that is "unjust".  We are causing damage for which we are not paying.  Carbon tax is being widely canvassed as one instrument we need to use to tackle that unfair use of resources.</p> <p>  It is one I believe profoundly we should do.  People are going to make decisions about the car they are going to drive, the boiler they are going to install, the insulation they are going to use in their home, etc.  If there are different balances between the cost and the benefits of doing that, people will change their behaviour.  We have seen that with all sorts of other examples where people take stock of cost-benefit.  It is not all going to be done through pricing.  It also has to be done by bringing the community with us.  Deputy Neville was very clear on that.  This involves much more than a few smart instruments and that is why ideas of just transition and involving, respecting and trying to help communities manage the change facing them are really important.</p> <p>  Turning to the use of carbon in our economy, even the most optimistic projections of how we decarbonise our economy do not see fossil fuels disappear.  They will remain an element of our energy profile for decades to come.  We will have other activities that will offset that.  The real issue, however, is to stop carbon being part of the way we behave in our lives and to come up with policies to bring that about.  It is a different question, if we are using gas, whether that should be gas we find in the Irish Sea or gas that we get from Russia or the Arab countries.  Deciding not to explore in any of our waters for fossil fuels would mean we would become dependent on Russia, or some other locations, to provide what will remain an element of our energy make-up.  We have to have regard to the security of our supply of energy as well as the carbon agenda.  The EU recognises that there is a balance to be struck.  That is why I think ending the search for fossil fuels is not the correct approach.</p> <p>  Regarding the establishment of a new body, I did not hear Mr. Watt.  My own view is that this is an intensely political issue.  It is about how politicians elected to make decisions for the community can resolve the inherent conflict in changing the behaviour of people to the extent necessary.  Creating some independent outside body, that is not elected or accountable and which is outside of what we do here and the accountability of politicians, would not deliver the sort of just transition of which Deputy Smith has spoken.  I am also referring to the kind of balanced response Deputy Neville mentioned.  One might say that is coming from a politician, and I have been a politician all my life.  I see the merit in politics, and our job is to try to resolve these conflicts.  We may not be very good at it but, as Winston Churchill said, democracy is the worst form of Government until the alternatives are tried.  That is the case.  We have to muddle along, find solutions and be accountable for the decisions we take.  People will kick us out if they do not like what we do.</p></speech>

It is to stick the cart before the horse, however, to do what has been done in France.  People there were put in the position of having to spend much of their already reduced income on getting to and from work when public transport was not up to scratch.  Only yesterday, the cost of a cash fare on a bus in Dublin went up again.  It now costs &euro;3 to go from Donnybrook to Stillorgan village, which is only a couple of stops.</p><p>There has been an increase of 87% in the cash cost of transport in Dublin since 2011.  If we had such an increase in our wages, that would be great.  We are pushing people off public transport and into private cars.  This is particularly true in the satellite towns.  We all know that the M50 looks like gridlock.  We need to provide an alternative and we need to retrofit homes.  The fuel poverty rate in Ballyfermot is 25%.  People are already deciding whether to eat a hot meal or to turn on their gas for the winter.  This plan will penalise them even further, even if the Government decides to give them back a bit.  It is not that I do not recognise the need for it, but I suggest the cart is being put before the horse.  No alternative is being provided.  The Government is being completely contradictory in its failure to answer questions about how corporations are taxed on the wealth they make.  Even though we are facing an urgent situation, this aspect of the matter is not being addressed by Governments.  Funds are needed to retrofit homes and to increase public transport.  That money could come from the sort of tax that is being considered.  This possibility is not being addressed at a political level.</p></speech>

We have to invest.  The price of the fuel that is chosen is an important factor when encouraging people to invest in better energy systems.  If we want to see more people using public transport, we must acknowledge that the price of the fuel they use in their private cars is part of what will determine their decisions.  It is not the only factor, however.  We cannot put off serious climate action until metro systems are in place.  That will not meet the challenge we face.  The opportunity to address this matter is closing fast.  The price of carbon is an important element of this issue.  Of course we have to protect people who will be impacted by whatever we decide to do, especially the vulnerable.  That has been always the case.

I have been feeling somewhat optimistic during the course of this meeting.  The Minister said at the outset that he recognises the urgency of this matter and the need for ambition.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on the point made by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith about licences.  If the Government were to withdraw from the issuing of any new licences as part of a "keep it in the ground" approach, it would go a long way.  The Government can send a strong signal to the people of Ireland that it is serious about the issue of climate change and global warming by saying there will be no more exploration.  Equally, keeping Moneypoint closed would go a long way.  Hardly anyone has noticed that it has been closed for the past two months.  We have managed to get most of our energy through renewables and gas.  We should keep Moneypoint closed as a way of recognising the urgency of the climate change problem we face.</p> <p>  Earlier this week, I attended a public meeting organised by a climate action group in Midleton, County Cork.  I was there as a representative of the Green Party and representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party were also in attendance.  The Minister's Fine Gael colleagues were invited, but none of them showed up.  A similar meeting was held two years ago, when I had just come into politics with the Green Party.  Again, there was no one from Fine Gael in attendance on that occasion.  I suggest that their non-attendance represents a significant lost opportunity for the Government.  I noticed a palpable difference in the sense of urgency among the people who attended this year's meeting.  As others have said today, fear and anger are beginning to set in and questions are starting to be asked.  It is clear from the report of the Citizens' Assembly that the citizens are ahead of the politicians.  I agree that communication is critical.  As the Minister has said, he has been in politics for years.  I have not been in politics for quite as long.  If the Government does not move on this issue, it will lose ground and it will tie a noose around all our necks.  We will all suffer as a result of the Government's inaction with regard to climate change.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the investment of &euro;30 million under Project Ireland 2040, but I ask him to re-examine that plan in the context of climate proofing.  Will he consider increasing the funding and resources being given to the Climate Change Advisory Council to help the council to develop its functions in support of Government agencies and businesses and to seek opportunities to decouple economic activity from greenhouse gas emissions?  As the Minister has said, there are many opportunities out there.  If the Government does not benefit from the leadership it needs to show it where to make changes, I am afraid it will just not happen.</p> <p>  The final matter I would like to raise also relates to money.  There is no doubt about the need for urgency.  Is there any chance that some of the rainy day fund of approximately &euro;1.5 billion could be put into new technologies like solar panels, heat pumps and microgeneration?  In light of the seriousness of what we are talking about, could some of the rainy day fund be used to ensure public buildings, particularly schools and hospitals, have solar panels and are properly insulated?</p></speech>

It involves setting aside resources that are temporary in nature as a feature of the present stage of the economic cycle.  I think that is a prudent approach to the public finances.  The Senator will have read the comments of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which has taken issue with the approach we are taking, even with the rainy day fund.  It is important that we are increasing investment in the public sector by 25% this year.  All of that is being funded out of taxation.  The golden rule used to be that a Government should borrow to fund its capital expenditure, but should not borrow for current expenditure.  We are using taxation to fund all of our capital expenditure.  Much of that is designed to try to create a more climate-resilient economy.  I believe that by expending investment, we are showing ambition for the decade ahead.</p> <p>  While I take Deputy Eamon Ryan's criticism, I suggest that a certain view of what Project Ireland 2040 is trying to achieve must be taken.  It is completely different from anything that has been done previously.  As I have said, I have been around for a long time.  I have never before seen a Government try to put a solid investment behind a vision of a regionally balanced, compact, connected and sustainable programme.  The growth in cities like Waterford, Cork, Galway and Limerick, which will be on a fixed footprint, will be 50% faster than the growth in Dublin.  The Project Ireland 2040 plan is a really ambitious statement of where we are trying to get to.  While I would be the first to admit we do not have all the tools to get us there, I do not accept that the plan was drawn up with no consideration of the sort of carbon-resilient community we need to create.  I believe such consideration is at the heart of the plan.  We have to do a lot of building out from the plan to make it purposeful.</p> <p>  I have met Professor John FitzGerald of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  I would certainly support useful research in this area.  We have put out the disruptive technology fund.  We also have the climate action fund and the other funds.  We are looking to tap into bottom-up solutions.  We do not pretend that the solutions to all of these challenges are in Merrion Street.</p> <p>  I think it is simplistic to say that Moneypoint should not be used.</p><p>We need to build out our renewables so that we do not need to use it.  It is there as a reserve.  It will be the last plant to be brought into the grid much of the time.  We are moving to 55% renewables by 2030 and that is probably not enough.  We probably should be more ambitious.  We will phase out Moneypoint but that has to be planned.  It is not a case of switching it off, going home and saying we do not use it any more until we have interconnection and other ways of ensuring that we can have renewables.  The ESB has to deliver power when it is there.  Similarly, keeping it in the ground will not reduce carbon emissions at all.  It just changes where the fossil fuels we use are sourced.  I do not agree that it is a signal and the trouble with a signal like that is that it is not encouraging any of the behavioural change that needs to happen.  It is purely a political signal that will not shift the dial on our carbon emissions.  I want to concentrate on changes that will have an impact that we will start to see quickly.  </p></speech>

Does the Minister know how many public buildings are under construction or completed which meet the specifications of the energy performance of buildings directive of 2018?  On what date precisely did this come in?  I hope it covers the new development or construction of the new children's hospital and the two satellites at Tallaght and Blanchardstown, which is the biggest construction for health in the history of the State.  I happen to live next door to it and would like to know if they are included in the energy performance or did they just miss it?  It would have been prudent to include them because this plan has been on the table for some time.</p> <p>  The warmth and well-being insulation grants and the various other schemes have been rolled out successfully in Dublin South Central.  We need to do this more quickly and a lot more of it &ndash; there are millions of homes to be retrofitted, apart from the new buildings.  The criteria for the grant are quite limited.  Could the Minister include or expand those criteria to include age, for the most senior of our citizens, who are those most affected by ill-health?  Cold, poor insulation and fuel poverty have a detrimental effect on their health.  While people are struggling and money is tight, they become more green aware, even though the priority is the food on the table.  They want to play their part.  There must be some incentive for people to carry out that green wish, whatever it may be.  Certainly that urgency is beginning to be felt, not just among those who have the money and leisure to do it but also those who find that money is tight and hard to come by.  We need to encourage their green awareness.</p></speech>

The warmer homes scheme applies and there was a three-year pilot scheme of 900 homes in a specific community healthcare organisation area, namely, CHO 7.  It differed in that it was not just a grant.  The HSE was also working on it to identify the clients and in so doing it secured a lower fall-off of people who considered it.  There was a very high take-up.  It was a pilot to see would this have an impact on health, as well as on energy.  It is drawing together the evidence.</p> <p>  In the long term, we have to find a way.  We will always be funding people with low incomes and poor health and we will have to find the resources for that.  We will not be able to fund all the change that happens in the household sector.  We will have to find some ways to encourage people other than from State grants to bring the building energy rating, BER, for their houses up.  That is one of the challenges.  We will not have the money to fund all the change that is needed on this agenda.  We have to recognise that while coming up with clever grant schemes is a small part of it, the estimate is &euro;50 billion in housing alone and the State will not be able to fund that across all sectors.  We have to think outside the box to find other instruments to encourage the funding of these changes.  </p></speech>

The Taoiseach indicated that he was supportive of it, as was Deputy Eamon Ryan, the leader of the Green Party.  The Taoiseach made the comment that it would be good if the committee as a whole reached consensus around a trajectory for it.  Such a consensus would help its implementation.  We all will be aware that some of these changes, although necessary, can be difficult to implement.</p> <p>  I have not commented on a specific pathway.  The Deputy will probably be aware that the climate advisory committee indicated it would be &euro;80 a tonne by 2030.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform talked of &euro;100 a tonne in public service projects by the same date and indicated that this is likely to grow rapidly thereafter.  It is an important signal, as I stated, to encourage decision-making.</p> <p>  There are local adaptation strategies being developed.  These are due by 30 September 2019.  Part of the work of the climate offices is to develop that.  I must get the Deputy more detail on their work to date.</p> <p>  The new regulations are in respect of renovations.  Where a home renovation constitutes more than 25% of the surface of the building envelope, one must have the entire building brought up to a higher energy performance standard.  That is coming in on 1 April 2019.</p> <p>  My understanding is that the green bond is a public bond for public investments.  There is a very substantial appetite for that sort of investment.  The NTMA raised funding to the tune of &euro;3 billion at a low coupon and it was very much oversubscribed.  It is for State investments in the green area.</p></speech>

He is accompanied by his fellow council members, Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Ms Martina Lawless, Mr. Michael Tutty and Mr. Eddie Casey.  We are meeting with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, to discuss its November fiscal assessment report.  It raises a number of concerns with the Government budgetary policy.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight will engage with the council to tease out these issues.  As always, we acknowledge IFAC's engagement with the committee.  As the witnesses will know, IFAC is a regular and frequent visitor to the committee, and we appreciate it accommodating us in its schedule.  From the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's perspective, we wish to identify certain strategic issues that we will be able to raise with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to improve the framework for parliamentary scrutiny of the budget.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the joint committee.

Joining me today are Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Ms Martina Lawless and Mr. Michael Tutty, who are all council members, as well as Mr. Eddie Casey, our chief economist and head of the secretariat.  Mr. Niall Conroy, Mr. Kevin Timoney, Ms Ainhoa Os&eacute;s Arranz, Ms Friederike Vogler and Mr. Killian Carroll, members of the council secretariat, are also present.  We continue to value these engagements.</p> <p>The council published its 15th fiscal assessment report on 28 November.  The report covers all aspects of the council&rsquo;s mandate, as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013.  The council&rsquo;s mandate does not cover commenting on the choice of individual tax measures or spending items or priorities, but rather allows us comment on the overall fiscal stance.</p> <p>  There have been significant improvements to macroeconomic conditions in recent years.  The council assesses that the pick-up in growth since approximately five years ago has been driven by a cyclical recovery in demand.  These improvements have been most visible in the labour market, with unemployment falling to approximately 5.5%.  Most plausible estimates suggest that the domestic economy has been growing faster than its potential growth rate since 2014 and is now, in 2018, close to its potential.  Central forecasts suggest that it will move beyond potential from 2019 onwards, with overheating emerging in later years.  While short-term growth prospects look favourable, there are significant risks evident in both directions, and a slowdown in coming years is inevitable.  Significant overheating pressures could build up if a faster-than-expected pick-up in housing construction materialises.  On the other hand, Brexit could be more costly than assumed.  There are also risks posed by the concentration of Ireland&rsquo;s exporting sector in a handful of specialised areas, the global rise in protectionism and possible future changes in the international tax environment. </p> <p>  Substantial progress was made from 2008 to 2015 to move the public finances to a safer position.  The Government is close to a balanced budget, debt ratios look to be on a downward trajectory and near-term growth and interest prospects are still relatively favourable.  Although efforts to stabilise the public finances since the crisis have proven successful, improvements on the budgetary front have stalled since 2015.  This is despite a strong recovery in the economic cycle, both domestically and internationally, in addition to a supportive monetary policy environment.  </p> <p>  Non-interest spending has risen at virtually the same pace as tax revenue since 2015 and, as a result, the strong cyclical recovery and favourable external environment have not led to any notable improvement in the underlying budgetary position.  It is clear that recent revenue growth has been supported by short-term cyclical developments and a possibly transient surge in corporation tax receipts.  Looking through these effects, the underlying budgetary position appears to have deteriorated since 2015.  Budget 2019 forecasts indicate that a small deficit will be run again next year, with a surplus now planned for 2020.  It is notable that budget 2016 had planned a budget surplus for 2018, budget 2017 had planned a surplus for 2019, while budget 2018 had planned a surplus for 2020. </p> <p>  These delays are against a backdrop of stalling improvements, while Ireland&rsquo;s debt burden is still among the highest in the OECD.  When set against a more appropriate measure of national income, namely, GNI*, Ireland&rsquo;s net debt burden for 2017 is close to 100% and remains the fifth highest in the OECD, behind only Portugal, Italy, Japan and Greece.  Two recent developments on the budgetary front have contributed to a further slowdown in improvements on the budgetary side: a substantial within-year increase in spending in 2018 and a larger-than-planned budget package for 2019. </p> <p>  Shortly before the budget, the Government decided to increase spending in 2018 by a further &euro;1.1 billion beyond what was envisaged just four months earlier.  The increases were largely due to health overruns.  While some variation relative to initial plans is inevitable, these expenditure increases are likely to be long lasting.  Within-year increases in expenditure of this nature should be funded through sustainable increases in taxation, reallocation of existing spending or by reduced spending increases in later years.  The council assesses that the within-year spending increases this year are not consistent with prudent budgetary management.</p> <p>  For 2019, the council set out in its pre-budget 2019 statement how an appropriate fiscal policy could be arrived at.  The council noted that the economy was close to its potential, that the budget deficit was almost closed and that the structural budgetary position appeared to be near balance.  It noted that little further adjustment would be required to close an underlying deficit or enable a steady pace of reduction in the government debt ratio.  To maintain this position, net policy spending could rise at or below the pace of sustainable revenues.  Various estimates put this at approximately 3.25% per annum in real terms.  When combined with inflation, this would imply a limit of up to &euro;3.5 billion for spending increases or tax cuts for 2019, or a 4.5% increase.  By not indexing the tax system, revenue would be raised, thus enabling a further &euro;0.6 billion spending increase over and above that limit.  This total of almost &euro;4 billion is far from what might be considered a tight budgetary constraint.</p> <p>  The actual budget day package for 2019 amounted to &euro;1.1 billion, which was higher than the &euro;0.8 billion package that was planned prior to the budget.  Taken together, the within-year increases introduced in 2018 and the larger-than-assumed budget package in budget 2019 exceed the limit that the council had assessed as appropriate.  Government spending is now planned to increase, net of tax measures, by &euro;4.5 billion in 2019 compared with what was originally planned for 2018.  This compares with the &euro;3.5 billion that the council had assessed as an appropriate limit.  If additional spending measures beyond the quantity in the summer economic statement 2018 were to be addressed, the council assessed that these should have been funded by additional tax increases or through reallocations of existing spending.</p> <p>  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s own budget 2019 Estimates also indicated that Government plans were not consistent with complying with the fiscal rules for 2018 and 2019.  The Government should aim to comply with the fiscal rules as a minimum standard when setting out its budgetary plans.  A separate assessment by the European Commission has since assessed that 2017 outturns and 2018 plans showed a number of possible breaches of the fiscal rules, but that the 2019 plans were compliant.  The European Commission also expressed concern about the overspending within the health sector, noting that, &ldquo;much of the better-than-expected revenue for 2018 is being used to fund within-year current expenditure increases in healthcare, which raises concerns both about the long-term fiscal sustainability and the pace of adoption of the Strategy.&rdquo; </p> <p>  The council&rsquo;s assessment of the fiscal stance is based on a broader economic assessment than just a mechanical application of the fiscal rules.  The council has highlighted on a number of occasions that the fiscal rules at this stage of the cycle are becoming less helpful for the overall sustainability of the public finances.  Focusing on the right budgetary stance and being prepared to be more cautious than the fiscal rules allow is the correct approach for the Government to follow over the medium term.</p><p>This is particularly true, given that the strict legal application of the current fiscal rules using the EU's commonly agreed methodology for potential output estimation, which will not necessarily prevent a repeat of pro-cyclical fiscal policy mistakes made in the past.<br/><br/>The Minister for Finance echoed these concerns in his foreword to the summer economic statement 2018.  He noted the following:</p><blockquote>We must continue to be prudent in relation to management of the public finances.  The fiscal rules are currently unhelpful in this regard.  A full and literal application of the fiscal rules would involve the adoption of pro-cyclical policies not remotely appropriate to our position in the economic cycle.</blockquote><p>The repeated failures to prevent unplanned spending increases have resulted in long-lasting increases in spending that are difficult to reverse.  These failures represent a repeat of the policy mistakes of the past.Pressures in the health sector and elsewhere should be funded through sustainable tax revenues or decreases in spending categories elsewhere.  These unfunded spending increases have left the public finances more exposed to adverse shocks, with the budget balance in deficit rather than in surplus.<br/><br/>Health spending for 2018 is set to exceed the level of spending budgeted yet again.  The Department of Health has experienced numerous overruns historically and the problem of unrealistic forecasts, coupled with a soft budget constraint, has undermined the credibility of expenditure ceilings.  Given previous experience, there is a strong possibility that health spending will exceed budget forecasts in 2019.  In addition, the Christmas bonus, which will be paid in full this year, has not been budgeted for in 2019.  It is somewhat disappointing that the Oireachtas will pass a budget over the coming weeks that excludes significant spending that everyone in this room knows will happen.  These two items alone pose significant upward risks to expenditure forecasts for 2019.<br/><br/>The council welcomes the return in budget 2019 to forecasting five years ahead.  The council also wishes to acknowledge the substantial progress that the Department of Finance has made in terms of macroeconomic forecasting.  The Department has developed and published its own estimates of the supply side of the economy.This means that better measures of medium-term economic growth and of the underlying state of the economy can be used to inform policy.  However, the Government's budgetary plans for later years lack credibility.  Specifically, the medium-term spending forecasts are based on technical assumptions that look and are unrealistic.  Expenditure is assumed to grow at a modest pace, resulting in increasing surpluses in later years.  The expenditure growth forecasts for the later years would only barely cover the council's stand-still estimates of the costs of maintaining current service levels, given demographic and price pressures.  The current intention to run budget surpluses for the foreseeable future, if conditions allow, is vague.  Previous commitments to outperform the requirements of the EU fiscal rules and reduce debt to 55% of GDP over the medium-term are no longer referenced.<br/><br/>In addition, the Government's system of three-year budget ceilings is not working, with repeated, procyclical, upward revisions to ceilings.  The council welcomes the introduction of the rainy day fund, which is the national surplus (exceptional contingencies) reserve fund.  Although it is useful, potentially, the current design is insufficient to offset faster than prudent growth rates allowed under the spending rule as it is currently applied.  Annual allocations to the fund have been lowered from previously planned amounts, despite a surge in corporation tax receipts. <br/><br/>I thank the committee for again providing us with the opportunity to attend today.  We look forward to taking questions and hearing the views of members.</p></speech>

I compliment them on a very impactful report that is full of analysis and details.  All the council's arguments have been comprehensively backed up.</p> <p>  I will start by discussing corporation tax, particularly as the Exchequer returns were announced yesterday.  The Government has put forward the defence that Mr. Coffey, in a personal capacity, was commissioned by the Government to conduct a report in 2017.  He said at that stage that the level of corporation tax receipts, with the step change in 2015, would be sustainable out to 2020.  However, as one can see from the figures, we have had a few step changes since then.  Does he still believe that the corporation tax receipts are sustainable?  </p> <p>  The report is based on 2016 numbers and at that point we collected about &euro;7.4 billion.  This year we will probably break the &euro;10 billion mark, as the profile for December is &euro;600 million.  The figure will be one third higher than the 2016 figures.  Let us not forget that the assessment was based on 2016 figures.  Can Mr. Coffey give us his perspective on the issue now?  Is it his view or that of the council that corporation tax receipts are sustainable?  To what extent is there a real risk to the Irish economy that we are, again, building up permanent expenditure commitments that will repeatedly recur on the back of receipts that could well prove to be temporary but we know to be volatile? </p></speech>

The report I previously wrote showed my personal view and that of the council.  Today, I am primarily here to represent the views of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We have clearly highlighted this aspect as a risk.  We referenced that the situation echoes our past reliance on significant amounts of receipts from one tax source.  As the Deputy said, it looks like corporation tax will be 18% of the Exchequer tax revenue this year and that supports a huge amount of spending in the economy.</p> <p>  If I take off my IFAC hat and discuss the report, as published, within the past year I discussed the sustainability of receipts with either this committee or the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  My view, in terms of the report, would not really have changed.  I would consider that corporation tax is a volatile tax.  It is likely to go down at some stage.  I would continue to be of the view that the receipts are sustainable to at least 2020.  Admittedly, the level is different so that means the risk is higher.  Given that the step change occurred in 2015, and there has repeatedly been a step change since then, the evidence would suggest that the point I made around 2016-2017 still holds that the receipts are sustainable until 2020.</p> <p>  From the perspective of IFAC, the level of risk keeps getting higher and the amounts keep getting bigger.  It is good to get this money.  It is much better to collect &euro;10 billion in corporation tax than not to do so.  From the perspective of IFAC, we would be aware of the risk that this possesses.  The report did not explain where the money came from.  We have seen a huge surge but, as things stand, we have a limited knowledge as to why this happened.  The amount could go back down.  From the perspective of IFAC, we would be concerned about introducing permanent increases in spending on the basis of these, potentially, temporary revenue sources.  That is what we have seen over the past number of years.  We have referenced the fact that the delay in moving the public accounts into surplus has not been due to a deterioration in the economy.  The delay could have happened naturally.  The surplus has been pushed back even though the economy has performed stronger and we have these huge additional corporation tax receipts.  The reason for the delay is policy, not the economic environment.  I would hold the view that the receipts are sustainable.  The year 2020 is not too far away so I am not putting myself too much on the block at this stage.</p></speech>

The budget is based on the central scenario of a relatively benign outcome.  I mean that a transition period will be followed by a deal with free trade terms.  To what extent does Mr. Coffey think the Government should have provided a what-if or sensitivity analysis in terms of the impact in 2019 if all of this goes wrong?</p> <p>  A vote on Brexit is due to take place next week but it does not look positive.  We will have to wait and see what happens next.  There is a distinct possibility that we could be facing a cliff-edge Brexit.  If that happens the basis for the budget will become obsolete overnight.  Yet, no analysis or possible scenarios were included in the documentation available on Brexit.  I ask the witnesses to make observations on the matter.</p> <p>  The fiscal council is very critical of the within-year changes or growth in expenditure.  That is principally accounted for by the Department of Health and is in the region of &euro;700 million.  Let us say the Government asks the council what it can do when the HSE runs out of money with just a few months to go.  We are all aware of the pressures on the health service such as life-saving operations and essential treatments for people.  What would be the fiscal council's argument in response to that?  How do we prevent this happening every year?</p></speech>

It is true that all the forecasts by the Department of Finance, and endorsed by the fiscal council, were based on what seemed like a very reasonable central scenario of a transition agreement and extension until 2021, and then some sort of deal.  Obviously, given that it is a very fast-moving environment, it is difficult to update the what-if scenarios but we will know more after the parliamentary vote next Tuesday.</p><p>It is difficult to update those types of "what if?" scenarios but we will know more with the parliamentary vote next Tuesday.</p><p> On the effects it could have on the Irish economy and it throwing the budget out of date, the work done by the Department of Finance and the ESRI on the overall effect of Brexit on the Irish economy showed long-term reductions in GDP in the order of 4%.  Those were all based on a stable transition period and a long-term effect.  If we look at analysis in the UK which was released last week by the Bank of England, it took what had been a similar analysis of a transition period and a smooth Brexit and looked at what the additional effects of a cliff edge, disorderly Brexit next March would be and it effectively doubled the size of its negative impact on the UK economy.  Given the level of integration between the Irish and the UK economies, it is not unreasonable to assume that something similar in terms of the Irish forecasts if they were updated to include a disorderly Brexit.  A lot of the-----</p></speech>

Much of the impact that it was taking into consideration in terms of why it would increase the impact so much was the length of time that it would take firms to adjust to delays on the Border in terms of checks and customs.  Given the amount of Irish trade that transits the UK, any delays in UK port processing times would potentially have a knock-on effect on Irish trade routes as well.  Our report highlights that as a risk and that there is a central scenario, which seems reasonable based on the odds of a deal and a transition period being put in place, but that the current estimates of how large the impact would be on the economy in the long term could be understated if this deal does not come into play and there is a cliff edge Brexit next March.</p></speech>

If there are overruns every year, there is obviously something wrong in the system and it needs to be changed.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published a paper on this subject examining why it is happening and what needs to be done.  Undoubtedly, the forecasts each year are not based on reality.  Some &euro;700 million does not just suddenly arrive as the year goes on, there has to have been a shortfall right from the start in the figures.  We need to find a mechanism where correct or reasonable forecasts are given in the budget, rather than unrealistic ones.  I know from my days in the Department of Finance that the Department can be at fault in saying that the HSE cannot have all the money it is looking for and so the HSE has to go back and see where it can cut back.  The HSE then it finds that it cannot cut back so there are overruns.  There may be fault on both sides in that respect.</p> <p>  There needs to be much more supervision of the expenditure as the year goes on so that big overruns are not just discovered in October but they are flagged as the year goes on so that there is time to take action.  There is no time to cut back on other expenditure in October or to raise more revenue.  We need to look at how the health expenditure estimates are formed and how they are supervised and managed over the year.  Even the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council would not find ways of offsetting it if it was only identified in October.</p></speech>

We are not absolutists when it comes to overruns.  The Government's budget is very large and we do not expect every line to match the amounts set out at the start of the year.  We focus on the overall amount.  The issue in health is the systematic nature of these overruns that happen every year but in a budget this large there will be some items that are higher and some that are lower.  We would expect that the overall aggregate would be close to what was set out at the start and that we should be able to accommodate those through one form or another.  To some extent that happened last year.  The overall amount of expenditure did not increase dramatically last year and what we have this year are Supplementary Estimates in health and a range of other areas and they are all adding to the full amount of spending and there are almost no savings elsewhere.  Some variation in the budget is fine but the issue we have with health is the systematic nature of the repeated overruns and the fact that this year, by and large the additional spending is added into the total for 2018 and becomes part of the base for 2019.</p></speech>

There are a huge amount of data in the report and in the appendices so I would suggest it would be circulated at midnight as it is going out to the press because it leaves us at a disadvantage in that we are commenting on something we have not seen until the next morning.  However, that is just a minor issue.</p> <p>  I want to pick up on the issue of Brexit and the commentary in the report on the reasonable probability that a transitional agreement may not be in place and, as the report mentioned, in the context of a hard Brexit, the reduction in Irish output would be 7% as opposed to a maximum of 2.8% in a soft Brexit.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has called even those figures into question again in terms of the model that is being used that underestimates the intensity of Irish labour in terms of exports and how we model that in the value of exports.  To my knowledge this is the second time the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has done this, so is it suggesting that the impact of a soft Brexit or a hard Brexit could be underestimated by the Department's modelling and how convinced of that is it?</p></speech>

What we have noticed when we have used the models that are typically run to estimate the effects is that they treat the UK like any other trading partner, as though the labour intensity and the number of people working for each sector exporting to the UK is the same as any other export market but we know that there is way more labour involved in the types of sectors in question such as agrifood, machinery and equipment.  Many more people work for each item exported to the UK and because of the way the models are set up, they work on averages and representative markets, and that means the models could be underplaying the extent of the impact that might happen because those labour channels are so much more important for the UK.</p></speech>

Is it talking to the Department about this and does the council have a conclusion on what Mr. Casey has very reasonably outlined about the high intensity of the labour market in respect of those exports?  Does the council have an opinion that this is what is happening or is it just a potential outcome?</p></speech>

We talked to the Central Bank, the ESRI and the Department to the extent that they seemed to agree with the principle that this model underestimates the impacts but we cannot say how much higher the impact would be.  It would be a phenomenal amount of work to get into that level of detail and we just have not gotten there.</p></speech>

I am sure members know that I also work at the ESRI, which is deeply involved in many of these forecasts.  The type of modelling the ESRI has done and the scenarios are based on a long-term effect and the long-term impact Brexit will have on the Irish economy once it has happened.  One of the issues that we and the Department of Finance raise as a risk is that we do not even know the timing of when Brexit will happen and while the long-term estimates might be exactly on point, the precise transition mechanism of how quickly that would come into play is still very much unknown.</p></speech>

There is language in these reports that we have not seen in previous reports.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council talks about non-realistic projections, a lack of prudence and repeating the mistakes of the past and it draws conclusions around the stamp duty issue and suggests that at that time it was taking some of the heat out of the economy while what it happening at this point is not.  It makes it clear that the budgetary projections are not credible into the future.</p><p>Does IFAC expect anything to change or will we just have a nice note back from the Minister, thanking the council for its views?  What does IFAC expect out of this?  The council has put an enormous amount of work into this and the language therein is very strong.  What would the council like to see happening, given that the Finance Bill has already been passed?  All that is left to deal with is the social welfare Bill.  The most significant point about that Bill is that it does not budget for &euro;250 million in expenditure that is likely to happen next year.</p></speech>

The public finances have recovered substantially in recent years and are in a reasonable position but there are still significant risks.  If we are not leaving sufficient leeway to allow for those risks, both within the public finances themselves and the economy at large, that leaves us unnecessarily vulnerable.  The report this year was slightly different to previous reports because what happened this year was different.  In 2017, for example, the Government set out a plan and by and large, it stuck to it.  There were within-year spending increases last year but there were savings elsewhere to offset them.  The Government kept the amount of spending increases for 2018 at the time of last year's budget within the range that we assessed to be prudent.  We did not use that strong language last year because the things we would look for were actually in the budget.  This year, those things that we would look for were not there.  The Government did not stick to the plan.  The budget day package was larger than previously signalled.  We had significantly greater within-year spending increases for 2018 with little or no savings elsewhere to offset them.  When those spending increases are put into the base for 2019, we get a very large increase in spending for next year relative to what was originally planned for 2018.</p> <p>  In terms of what we would like to see happening, we would like to see the budget becoming credible, that budget 2019 as set out is delivered on and that we do not get more increases.  The Government has already admitted that we are going to get &euro;250 million of additional gross spending through the Christmas bonus next year and other overruns in health cannot be ruled out.  When it comes to the summer economic statement of 2019, we would like to see the Government setting out a plan that is within the range that is considered prudent and then delivering on that.  If we get that, the language of our report will be different next year.  It is a cumulative thing in terms of the budget recently passed.  There were things that we looked for and saw last year that we did not see this year.</p></speech>

It was quite frustrating for us, as an Opposition party, when we were trying to get an estimate of the likely overrun in health.  That overrun was not calculated by the Department of Health or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform until days before the budget.  They did not have the information.  It was not that they were not providing it; they just did not have it.  They came up with a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;655 million, &euro;625 million of which is current expenditure.  The November report published yesterday shows that we have already surpassed that by &euro;74 million.  The current expenditure is now at &euro;699 million above profile as opposed to &euro;625 million.  If just a couple of weeks ago they could not figure out what expenditure would be in six weeks' time, how are we ever going to get this right?</p> <p>  The excellent table on page 88 of the IFAC report shows that the overruns intensify at the latter end of the year.  We are likely to see an even higher December figure, which could mean that we need a second Supplementary Estimate in health for the last eight weeks of the year.  That is not a joke.  We are probably overrunning the health budget again by another &euro;100 million.  This is because the Department of Health is not, as IFAC puts it, "credibly" budgeting in the first place.  We describe this as an overrun but in reality there was no credible budget for health in the first place.</p></speech>

At the moment a formal figure about the likely overrun does not come out until October but within two or three months of a new year, there should be information available that would allow a dynamic estimate of the expected spending amount for the year.  We should have information on the level of spending and the level of likely overrun as we progress through the year.  We should know whether it is on, below or above target.  We would agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty's view that there should be increased monitoring and an increase in the information made available.  Health is by far the largest spending area and within net voted spending, it will reach &euro;17 billion next year.  It is pretty clear that the overruns in recent years have a systematic pattern to them.  Improved monitoring is required and if the information is not currently being collected, efforts should be made to collect it.  We would like to see, if possible, dynamic assessments of those overruns as we progress through the year.</p></speech>

The overrun is about &euro;460 million and &euro;420 million on health in November.  Part of it could be just down to timing and when receipts arrive in the Department.  The Supplementary Estimate might not need to be increased in the next month if the Department does not get some of the receipts it is expecting.  I would not see the need for a further Supplementary Estimate at this stage.</p></speech>

Given that we have had years of a lack of investment in these areas, I welcome the fact that we are increasing the future productivity capacity of the economy.  What is the council's view on that?  If the much-needed capital investment did not take place, would our deficit position be better?</p> <p>  On health and following on from what Deputy Pearse Doherty has said, there is a recruitment drive under way in the health sector at the moment.  We have an ageing population which will put further financial strain on the health budget.  I do not think anybody would argue against the need to streamline and overhaul expenditure in the Department of Health.  As has been suggested by others, we need to keep a closer eye on it at particular points in the year.  I ask the witnesses to give us their views on the health budget and where they believe the biggest increases will arise within that budget.  Will the increases stem from investments in infrastructure, staffing or just general overspends?</p> <p>  Mention was made of additional tax increases.  The council suggests that additional spending should have been funded by additional tax increases or through the reallocation of existing spending.  What kinds of tax increases was the council referring to there?  Was it referring to the introduction of new taxes or increases in existing taxes?  The IFAC report also suggests that "significant overheating pressures could build up if a faster-than-expected pick-up in housing construction materialises".  What is that suggestion based on?  I ask because we have a significant skills shortage here and are probably not going to be building what we need by 2020.  We need to be building approximately 30,000 new units per year and it will take us at least another two years to get to that point.  What level of overheating does IFAC envisage?  </p> <p>  My final question is on health.  Are health spending overruns not a feature of most developed economies or are they unusual?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018120500002#F01200"><p>I will group the questions into those relating to investment and then those relating to health.  In terms of investment, a couple of years ago the council expressed concern about investment which was at a very low level.  Investment was exceptionally low by international standards and by way of historical comparison and was not even sufficient to maintain the existing capital, let alone expand it.  In that context, increased capital investment is very welcome, particularly as there are very significant pressures in housing at the moment.  It is good that there is space within the budget to allow for the higher investment that is necessary.</p> <p>  On the health side, there are pressures in many countries, as the Deputy suggests.  Those pressures come from multiple sources, including ageing but also cost pressures.  Health spending overruns can be related to specific drugs.  They are also related to the fact that the sector is very labour intensive, with high demand for skilled labour in particular.  There are many pressures on the health system.  </p> <p>  The previous two points demonstrate the importance of medium term budget planning and good forecasting.  We have not seen that with this budget but we did see it with previous budgets.  Accommodating increased capital investment, all other forms of spending and pressures in health poses a big challenge.  That is why the Government needs a clear plan around how it is going to do that with the revenue that is available.  Those political choices need to be made.  This budget, because it did not have credible medium term forecasts, does not help in that process.  It does not very clearly illustrate the choices that people face.  People take different views on how to allocate funding but one must have a clear baseline.  What we have seen is that the overall amount of spending budgeted for is not even enough to keep things at a constant level in real terms.  It does not leave space to improve services but only barely allows enough to keep things at their current level and in the outer years, not even that.</p><p>These questions are political choices as to how much to tax and what to spend money on.  It is vital there is a clear framework in this regard, and that is missing from this budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018120500002#G00200"><p>We assessed capital spending previously and do see Ireland moving from a relatively low level to a relatively high level.  The concern we would have raised, however, is that we cannot do everything and that if we choose to devote significant resources to capital spending, we will spend less in other areas or require additional tax increases.  One point that was made about the budget is that for 2018, 2019 and 2020 current spending is growing at 4.5%, which seems to be in line with the fiscal council's view that it is fine to have increases of 4.5% for current spending, but capital spending this year is increasing by 27% and will increase next year by 13%.  The overall increase in spending, current and capital, is therefore much above the level we would consider sustainable.  The increase in capital spending is not a temporary spike; it is due to rise to a much higher level.  It is a structural increase from low levels which is being maintained at high levels.  This growth will not then be cancelled by a subsequent fall, so the overall package of spending is quite large.  We assessed the increase in capital spending to be, as my colleague said, necessary to develop the capital stock in the country.  It was not possible, however, to do everything.  In this budget we see current spending rise to the limit of what we consider sustainable.  If the capital spending is then put on top of that, one exceeds that level.</p></speech>

First, we need an increase in housing output.  That is no doubt necessary, but is there space in the economy to do it?  The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.3%.  In construction and professions and skills related to construction there appear to be shortages.  People have either left the country or left the industry and will not come back to it.  It looks like housing output this year will be 18,000 or 19,000, again below most estimates of the equilibrium level for Ireland, which seems to be approximately 30,000 or 35,000, and that would cover only the houses we need annually.  We have almost a decade of a deficit to meet so we need housing output to rise significantly above 30,000.  This could happen but only if, as would be hoped, we rise temporarily to 50,000 to meet the 30,000 we need and cover some of the deficit that has built up in recent years.  This could be a temporary or unsustainable level of output.  Housing is very tax-rich, so this could have an impact on the public finances and lead to a temporary increase in demand in the economy.  Our concern would be that an attempt be made to avoid such overheating pressures.  Have the houses been built?  We all recognise that more houses need to be built but, again, one cannot do everything.  If it is necessary to take some money out of the economy to make the resource space, to provide the resources for this housing construction, we should be aware of what is happening and take some heat out of the economy if necessary.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.</p> <p>  To paraphrase, it seems that when the Government has it, it spends it.  That seems to be the message the witnesses are conveying.  I have a number of questions about the health spending.  I think there is an expectation, notwithstanding what Mr. Barnes said, that when there is a serious overrun, that one particular aspect of health spending may account for it.  It might be a matter of dealing with the trolley crisis or accident, emergency departments or whatever else.  When one drills down into the spending, however, it looks like there is an equal distribution of this overrun right across the health budget, which seems to imply that the Department of Health is becoming used to overruns and is building them into its annual budgets.  There is no one big chunk in health accounting for the overrun; each section within health seems to be getting an equal share of the overrun.  Could the witnesses comment on this?</p> <p>  We are almost at full employment.  The social protection budget has not declined correspondingly; in fact, it has increased.  Do the witnesses have a comment on this?  We are just lucky that additional 11th month windfall in corporation tax was not known to the Government at budget time.  I am neither an economist nor an accountant and I am not great with figures but I remember the pain of the past, and we are back to overruns and underestimates.  Do the witnesses have any handle yet on how corporation tax is being underestimated at such a scale by the Department of Finance?</p> <p>  The witnesses are not mind readers or crystal ball gazers, but why do they think a Government would not factor in a Christmas bonus payment for 2019?</p> <p>  Since last April, everyone who has come before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight - whether the IFAC, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Minister or any other agencies or witnesses - has highlighted four or five themes, one of which is our over-reliance on corporation tax.  Do the witnesses think the Government has done anything in this budget, aside from the rainy day fund, to address this in a tangible way?  The other measure that has been highlighted is carbon tax.  The third is petrol and diesel equalisation.  The Government fudged these two the day after a major climate change report reinforced the urgency of taking measures to deal with it.  What is the witnesses' response to this?</p> <p>  My next question concerns what Mr. Coffey talked about.  He mentioned oversight and the need for increased monitoring.  Which Department's responsibility is this?  We invited the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before the committee and before the IFAC came in.  We have correspondence from the Department stating that, having considered the matter carefully, the health budget is not really a matter for it but, rather, for the Department of Health.  Either we have responded or we are going to respond.  Who do the witnesses have in mind as having this oversight and invigilation responsibility when it comes to overruns in the health budget?  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in his budget speech indicated that he would have the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, into his office regularly over 2019 to check out how the budget is going.  What kind of structures do the witnesses think we can put in place?</p> <p>  Mr. Coffey has hinted at my final point.  This overrun pattern is becoming contagious.  It is not applying only to health; it is now also applying to education and justice.  What advices or response do the witnesses have to that?</p></speech>

I have been through many decades in the Department of Finance looking at this happening time after time.  While the Minister would say at this point that we are not spending all that we could spend, it is still spending more than we think is appropriate at this point in the cycle.  The Government also says, "All the other parties tell us we should be doing more, so how can we avoid doing it?"  However, one of the reasons the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was set up was to try to stop this cycle of spending more and more in good times and then having to have big cutbacks in bad times.  We must try to push this view and convince both Parliament and the people that there is a better way that could save us from the big cutbacks when we inevitably get into a slowdown.  Even though we would not say that what is going on now is hugely over-expansionary compared with some of the things that happened in the past, it is still moving in the same direction as we had been moving in the past and not learning from the past.</p><p>The Christmas bonus was never put into the Estimates.  No matter how many times officials and people from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said it must be put in because it would be spent, Governments of all hues left it out and hoped there would be savings during the year that would finance it rather than showing it in the budget.  They still spend it even if there are no savings.  We think that long-standing practice should stop.  A budget is not realistic if it does not make provision for it.  However, another year and another budget come and it is still left out of the figures.  </p><p> With regard to the widespread increases in health expenditure, we have not looked in detail at where exactly the increases are.  We are not aware of specific increases or particular areas where there are big increases.  It may be right there are just widespread overruns in all areas, which is what happens if no budget constraints are imposed.  If people see the budget they are given every year can be exceeded and there are no consequences they will inevitably be lax in implementing budget controls.  </p><p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is probably a bit removed from the day-to-day supervision of what is happening in the Department of Health and other Departments.  That is why we have line Departments which should be looking at it in detail.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should start setting down how the control should be exercised to make sure the Department of Health gets the information from the HSE and the HSE gets the information from all the bodies under it aegis on how expenditure is going every month and every quarter.  It should then feed that information to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Undoubtedly, the Department of Health should have primary control over the budget it has been given to run the health services.</p></speech>

Overall, the unemployment component is a relatively small part of the social protection budget.  It is probably in the region of 20% to 25%.  Pensions are by far the largest part.  There are other areas such as child benefit and disability.  The unemployment component has fallen significantly but that has been offset by increases elsewhere in the number of recipients.  The number of people aged over 66 has increased by around 20,000 per annum as life expectancy has increased.  There have been increases in rates for the past number of years.  The unemployment element of it is falling but there have been demographic pressures elsewhere that have seen the number of recipients elsewhere rising.  Policy decisions and increased rates have meant the effect is roughly neutral.  The unemployment component is falling.  Other elements are causing it to rise.  We would not necessarily expect to see the overall social protection budget fall, given the demographic and policy decisions that have been taken.</p> <p>  On the rainy day fund and corporation tax, we have continued to see corporation tax surge.  It was pointed out by Deputy Michael McGrath that there were further increases in corporation tax yet the contributions to the rainy day fund are not changing.  They are about saving some of these windfalls in preparation for negative events that might happen in the future.  However, at present, the design of the rainy day fund does not appear suitably dynamic to take into account the windfall revenues we are receiving now and the ability to spend it in the future.  It has not changed even though corporation tax receipts have increased.  </p> <p>  On some of the other overruns mentioned and why we treat the Supplementary Estimates for education and justice differently, if we look at education and justice, much of them are driven by issues in forecasting the number of people who are retiring.  If one looks at the Estimates, by and large they are for superannuation and the lump sum payments made to public servants when they retire.  This is expenditure that will happen anyway but if more people retire in a particular year, the amount of those lump sum payments will be greater.  Essentially all it does is drag spending that would happen in the future into the current year.</p> <p>  The issue with health is somewhat different.  It is not based on an increase in the number of people retiring, it is based on an increase in the number of people being hired.  That spending becomes permanent and long-lasting.  There are differences.  In education, justice and other areas such as Army pensions, it looks like there are repeated Supplementary Estimates to address failures to correctly forecast retirements throughout the year.  Perhaps there are issues there with how those forecasts can be assessed.  The impact they have on public finances is not as severe as in the current spending increases in health.</p></speech>

In terms of risks and our net debt ratio we seem to be moving up the table.  We have almost moved out of the relegation zone if we compare it with Premier League football.  Is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council happier with the overall debt risk situation?  It is still very large but net debt seems to be reasonably under control.  We have the rainy day fund, which I understand from the Minister is also a net figure.  Is it an overarching risk for the future that we should be much happier with?</p></speech>

The State has significant assets.  One can look at the gross debt and the overall amount owed but it is equally as important to look at what is owned.  The State has significant cash assets built up through the NTMA and various other sources so we subtract that to get a measure of net indebtedness.  We think that remains at an elevated level.  It is close to 100% of GNI* for 2017.  That is quite high.  It is the fifth highest in the OECD.</p></speech>

The NTMA experiences significant demand when it issues bonds and far more than the amount it wishes to raise.  The rates at which debt is being issued are historically low.  The current refinancing environment is relatively benign but Irish experience shows that can change very quickly.  If one goes back to 2006 and 2007, similar comments were made about our ability to refinance debt and the margin we were paying relative to larger countries such as Germany.  While the environment may look relatively benign now, it can change quite quickly.</p> <p>  One issue with regard to Ireland is whether people are paying that much attention to what is going on, particularly if standard international metrics are done in terms of GDP.  If one looks at the chart, Ireland's net debt to GDP is below 60%.  People might view that as being a safe level.  We are of the view that greater use should be made of the alternative measures provided by the CSO such as GNI* which would put our net debt ratio at about 100%.  If we require to borrow significant amounts in the future, it leaves us with limited borrowing capacity.  At present we are refinancing debt and doing so quite easily.  There are legitimate reasons for Governments to borrow and run deficits.  If we hit circumstances where large deficits need to be run and perhaps should be run, we may find there are difficulties in raising the amount of money and in refinancing debt.  Our concern is the debt remains high.  It is on a downward trajectory but we should look carefully at the level and continue to bring it down.</p></speech>

The reader has to work a bit harder to get to page 144 to see them.  They are instructive because such a high level of debt is very sensitive to shocks.  Ireland is very volatile.  We can easily think of shocks that would mean the debt would either start decreasing or increasing.  If it was on an upward trajectory, it would require more drastic policy action to cut spending or whatever is necessary to improve the budget balance.  Those scenarios are hopefully helpful to people in understanding the risks associated with these high debt levels.</p></speech>

However one looks at this report, it is a devastating critique of the Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il Government and of the budgets.  In terms of risks, does the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council ever think about including the electoral cycle?  It is quite striking that 2015 was mentioned.</p><p>We have been in election readiness for the past three years and will be, possibly, on the march next year.  For example, at the Fine Gael Party conference the Taoiseach might announce major income tax cuts over a number of years but not announce carbon tax increases because he is not into sustainability.

The Australians recently celebrated a quarter of a century of unbroken growth.  Taking into account the international situation, a downturn would seem pretty inevitable but given, as other colleagues have stated, our infrastructural deficits and so on and the desperate need for housing, this should not be the case.  Reference was made to net policy spending.  What does that mean and how is it determined?</p></speech>

We have had very strong growth for four or five years, with the economy growing above its potential for a sustained period.  No economy, not even Australia, can grow above its potential forever.  If an economy could do that, its potential should be higher.  Our view is that there will be a slowdown in growth, including employment growth and increases in domestic demand given the high rates we have experienced recently.  We should not be expecting, as happened in recent years, to be able to continue with the rapid expansion in budgetary measures we have experienced in the past number of years, which we are now measuring with this new measure of net policy spending.  We are trying to look at the impact of policy decisions on the level of spending by the Government.  There are various reasons why Government spending changes, outside of policy.  </p> <p>  Earlier, we were asked about changes in unemployment and the level of unemployment.  If unemployment was to rise, we would not view that as a policy change.  Currently, unemployment is decreasing and the savings being made do not constitute a policy change.  We subtract those savings and take them out.  Equally, if there was to be a slowdown and unemployment was to increase, we would not take the view that this should detract or subtract from the amount of the so-called fiscal space because that is separate.  Also, Government spending can fall because of changes in interest rates.  Again, that is not a policy change.  It is based in the external environment when it comes to refinancing debt.  We take both of those areas and we look at the policy measures, including the change in spending after adjusting for unemployment and interest.  We also look at the change in revenue, particularly the change in revenue measures.  For example, when looking at a measure of policy spending, we tend to reference spending but we are looking at both the tax and spending sides.  We use shorthand.  A tax cut is spending fiscal resources.  We combine those to get the change in the adjusted measure of spending that is the result of policy, including what decisions are being taken and what might be the outcome.  For example, in recent years the rate of spending increase has been accelerating.  Throughout 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 Government expenditure growth has been accelerating but on the tax side, things have been changing.  Budgets 2016 and 2017 were revenue reducing in that they provided for income tax cuts, which reduced the level of revenue.  Budgets 2018 are 2019, however, have been revenue increasing on foot of the stamp duty change in 2018 and the increase in the VAT rate for the hospitality sector in 2019.  Even though the rate of spending growth has been accelerating, once an adjustment is made to take account of that change in revenue the rate becomes quite flat but as it is flat at 5%, it is relatively rapid.  What we are trying to do is assess the impact of policy on the level of spending.  For the last number of years, it has grown at 5% in real terms, which we consider to be above the sustainable growth of the economy.  For 2019, it is forecast to grow at 3.5%, which is, perhaps, right at the limit but we always have the issue of the Christmas bonus.  We were asked why is it not in the budget but it seems to be a historical fact that we would like changed.  Another issue is the possibility of health overruns.  We are already starting at the limit for 2019 and it could be higher.  The purpose of this measure is to isolate the impact of policy on spending changes because Government spending changes for a variety of reasons.  We think it is a useful addition and one we intend to use into the future.</p></speech>

On the issue of overheating, which we touched on previously in regard to non-residential construction, if we were to ramp up house construction we would have to dampen that sector, perhaps by way of stamp duties.  The new heat map produced this year by the council indicated that another area with potential for overheating is employment.  We are almost at full employment now.  It is more difficult to dampen employment growth because it would require people to be laid off.  How do we dampen it?  Can it be done by investing in childcare or by bringing in workers from other jurisdictions?  What are the real ways of dampening this particular sector?</p></speech>

We agree that housing output is below the required levels and that it needs to increase above the required levels for a time to meet some of the shortfalls.  The issue is what happens in the overall economy to avoid additions or stimulus in other areas.  One could make room for housing construction through reduced spending in other areas and, possibly, increased taxes in other sectors to allow room for demand in the housing sector.  It is not about dampening one particular sector, it is about looking at the overall aggregate of what the economy is trying to do.  Increasing housing output to 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 units per year in an environment where the unemployment rate is 5.5% is difficult to do.  If there is continued strong cyclical growth in other sectors, from where do we get the workers to build those houses?  If we have to bring them in from abroad we have to have housing in which to accommodate them.  If there are workers coming in for other sectors, it may be that we are asking the economy to do too much.  If we believe housing is the priority, we should be making the space in the economy to allow that housing output to increase.  As I said, it is not necessarily about dampening down a particular sector; it is about making room in the overall level of activity in the economy.  There are various ways in which this can be done.</p></speech>

Outside of bringing in workers, what can we do to increase the workforce?  We hear constantly that we do not have a childcare system in this country conducive to people working long hours.  Instead, people in many cases work for reduced hours because of childcare costs.  If we had a proper childcare system, would that help to free up people to work?

Mr. Coffey referenced overall demand in the economy and fiscal policy in terms of reducing spend in particular areas and increasing taxes in others.  The Deputy is right that things also can be done on the supply side.

I thank the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, for the information and advice it has given.  I am one of the newer members of the committee and one of the newer Members of the D&aacute;il.  One issue that concerns me is that we are entering into a skills shortage right across the economy.  Reference was made to building more than 30,000 houses but there are not enough plasterers or builders.  Last week, 680 additional care packages were announced but we do not have the care staff.  We experience that phenomenon all the time on the ground.  We hear announcements to the effect that there will be new psychologists in the mental health area or new speech and language therapists in the education sector.  There is a constant brain drain of teachers going to the United Arab Emirates, UAE, and other places to work.  In the context of all the promises that are made to improve services, does the IFAC look at such shortages and how we can address them?  We hear commitments on new services day in and day out.  Perhaps that is not an area the IFAC examines but I would welcome a comment from the witnesses.</p> <p>  I am sure the witnesses have discussed Brexit and its implications.  I come from a Border county.  In the event of a cliff-edge Brexit, has an analysis been done on cross-Border trade and barriers to trade?  Nobody wants to see customs and barriers to trade.  Has the IFAC carried out any assessment in that regard?  I do not know whether it is an area the IFAC has fully covered but I would welcome a comment.</p></speech>

It shows pretty significant decreases in trade.  The impact is felt in particular by small firms that do frequent but relatively low-value transactions across the Border, so the impact on the number of firms trading is a lot more substantial than the impact on the value of trade.</p> <p>  That analysis did not look at a cliff-edge major distortion such as, for example, major checks on the Border; it merely considered the impact of tariffs.  Given the high degree of uncertainty currently, such as whether there will be a backstop or separate treatment for Northern Ireland and whether the UK will stay in the customs union for a significant amount of time, it is difficult to come up with an estimate based on any degree of precision about how it would impact, other than to get a sense of the ordering of priorities, whereby those firms in Northern Ireland will be more exposed than elsewhere.  The exact magnitude of the effect is not really possible to estimate.</p></speech>

We do look at it in broad terms.  To go back to housing and the unemployment rate, we consider whether we have the resource capacity in the economy to deliver the overall level of activity that is desirable but we do not assess the issue in terms of particular skills and professions.</p></speech>

Mr. Coffey referred to the sustainability of corporation tax out to 2020.  The definition of sustainability probably goes beyond 24 months.  Could Mr. Coffey elaborate on that?  He answered a previous question by referring to a report from a number of years previously.  If we can only predict that those revenues are likely to be maintained at the current level for the next two years, I do not think that equates to sustainability.  I would like Mr. Coffey to elaborate on that.</p> <p>  Looking at the fiscal monitor that came out in November, the Government had projected &euro;1.1 billion above profile, &euro;700 million of it non-recurring, with the rest recurring.  Now we see that it has gone up by another &euro;470 million, and possibly one might see the same in December.  We are now more than &euro;1.5 billion above profile.  We evidently have serious challenges in terms of predicting where corporation tax is at.  I assume that is also due to the fact that there is a small number of very large players that can distort the figures in a very positive way.  Does Mr. Coffey believe something can be done from the viewpoint of the IFAC to come up with better projections in terms of corporation tax?</p> <p>  The most alarming thing for me in terms of the budget is that we are funding the necessary increase in health expenditure from increased corporation tax receipts.  While the IFAC report shows the increase in corporation tax and the reduction in the net interest rate and the in-year spending has increased, it became very obvious this year that we decided to use this year's bonanza to fund health and, to say the least, that is madness.  Could Mr. Coffey comment on corporation tax?  Sometimes one sees headlines such as that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council says that corporation tax is sustainable but I would argue that if the council is only suggesting it will be at that level for the next two years, it probably is not sustainable.  People could take the view that everything is okay and there is nothing to see here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.259" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018120500002#K00900"><p>I reiterate that it is not something the IFAC said.  That was something I said in a different capacity.  I am not sure I can elaborate very much on that.  I still stick by the conclusions of the report.  I agree with the Deputy that 2020 is not that much further into the distance but it would require further analysis to look ahead and that is not something I have undertaken.  Subsequent research could be undertaken to look into that.  Some of the reasons for the increases in 2015 and 2016 were assessed in the corporation tax review.  The conclusion based on the evidence at the time was that it was sustainable until at least 2020.  That is a personal view, and it is one I continue to hold.  Further work would be required if one wants to go beyond that.</p> <p>  On the unpredictability of the receipts, to a certain extent the November receipts that were announced yesterday would not have been much of a surprise because of their links to the June receipts and the way in which corporation tax is paid.  Companies make a preliminary payment in month six of their financial year and they pay the remaining amount, up to 90% of the amount due, in month 11.  If companies have their year end on 31 December, month six is June and month 11 is November, so based on the June returns one can get a good indication of what will happen in November.  The June returns were quite strong.  If one extrapolates forward, one would expect to see quite strong receipts in November and that is what we did see, so it was not necessarily much of a surprise.  June is halfway through the year.  It does not allow one to predict at budget time, so if one wants to know what will happen in November 2019, the situation in June 2019 is a good indication but the budget is set already.</p> <p>  One issue with the predictability of the returns is that, by and large, although we are unsure of the sources of it, it is likely to remain highly concentrated.  As the Revenue updates its figures for subsequent years, we think the concentration is likely to be maintained at the same level or possibly even increased, and potentially the amount being collected from multinationals could increase.  Corporation tax should increase in an economy experiencing a cyclical upswing.  It is just that we are seeing an increase in corporation tax far beyond that.</p><p>In the context of capacity within the economy, which we discussed earlier, one area where we said we could make space was by an increase in taxes.  We have seen a huge increase in tax revenue from corporation tax but it is not coming from the domestic economy.  In the main, it is coming from multinational companies outside the economy.  It is coming through this international trade but is staying in Ireland and is flowing into the Government coffers and, because of the delays in moving to a budget surplus, it is being spent.  We try to assess the impact of fiscal policy on the economy.  It is likely that we are underestimating it because the primary balance, ignoring interest payments, is being boosted by corporation tax receipts which come from an external source.  It is possibly providing a stimulus to the economy because it is not tax revenue coming out of our pockets and being spent on providing services to us.  It is coming from the pockets of American companies, something we highlight in the report.</p><p> The predictability of this remains quite difficult.  It has clearly overshot for a number of years but, because it is not linked directly to changes in domestic economic activity, I am not sure how we can overcome that.  As the year progresses, there can be changes.  The Minister noted that a certain share of the 2018 receipts is deemed to be a one-off and there is no way a permanent increase in spending should be based on one-off receipts.  We would like to see a clearer division between annual developments in revenue and annual developments in expenditure.  If corporation tax was declining, our position would be that there should be no change on the spending side.  As corporation tax has gone up, however, it has been linked to increases in spending.  We feel that maybe half of our advice will be listened to and we will be ignored when we say there should not be spending increases.  If corporation tax was to decline and we were to hold a consistent position, people would say the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was happy for spending to be at this high level.  They would say it should not decline but we say there should not be increases, and this would be to avoid a decline in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Tutty" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018120500002#L00200"><p>The international position is also a factor.  Changes in the US tax code can have a very big impact on our corporation tax revenue because of the high American presence here.  In the OECD, to which Mr. Barnes belongs, the BEPS project is another thing that can be a factor and all these things are evolving.  They have, to some extent, led to the increase in our corporation tax but they may also lead to a reduction in the tax in the future.  Whenever there are big, unexpected increases that cannot be fully explained, one certainly should not base long-term expenditure decisions on the notion that one will have that revenue forever.  We are a little dubious about all this tax revenue remaining with us in the long term, particularly the last half billion euro that arrived yesterday.  We would need to know if it is a one-off and where it comes from.  Mr. Coffey has a theory that it is associated with the June ones but if it was, surely the Department would have added it in on budget day as something it was expecting to get.  However, it did not do that.  We need to be very wary of this and I expect that to be the main stance of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p></speech>

We looked at almost ten different models and found that none of them was any good as it is a really unpredictable revenue source and the most volatile of the main tax heads, with the largest forecast mistakes year in, year out.  It is also really concentrated so when an individual firm has a patent which runs out, or there is some other shock to profitability, it can lead to big changes in corporation tax receipts in a given year.  As Mr. Tutty said, the international tax environment can also change and these are things that are beyond our control.  The key is not to build up a reliance on this one tax head by spending it in a long-lasting way.</p></speech>

The council has beaten the drum about medium-term projections since I can remember its reports coming out but there is stronger language in this instance.  It states that the plans are not credible and it has highlighted all the different figures which it thinks are dubious.  Nevertheless, it is engaging with the Department of Finance, as well as this committee.  If the figures are based on an expenditure increase of 1.2%, taking into account inflation and demographics etc, they are not credible as we all know this is not going to occur.  Why, then, is the Department ignoring the council's advice?  Why are we still getting projections for medium-term budgets that are the bare minimum?  Everybody knows it is not going to be the case.  Nobody believes social welfare is not going to increase for five years, or that there will not be an extra penny put into health above demographics and inflation, so why is the Department not responding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018120500002#L00500"><p>There are long-standing issues and we have been discussing them in this room, or the one next door, for many years.  Things have actually got better and in the past couple of years, the Department had moved to doing medium-term forecasts that were consistent with the Government's stated policy.  Last year, it also produced the alternative presentation, which was an alternative table which broke the figures down across departmental areas.  We welcomed both those things because they represented a step forward.  However, this time around the Department went backwards on both of them.  It moved back to the technical assumptions that do not really mean anything while, in the alternative presentation, which gave a very helpful breakdown by Department and which might have helped in the case of health, for example, it put in very low numbers and had a big unallocated amount.  This is one of the reasons we used very strong language.  Not only is this the wrong way of going about it, which is widely accepted, but it is a slip backwards.</p> <p>  Part of the reason it has happened is that the commitments for the medium term have weakened as well.  Forecasting for the medium term is not actually that difficult and, like all forecasts, there will be mistakes but forecasting spending based on demographics is one of the easiest bits of the forecasting we do on the council.  The really difficult bit is forecasting policy and in recent years the stated policy was to outperform the EU fiscal rules.  The plan is to spend more or less what the expenditure benchmark would suggest, which is only a guide.  That allows the Department to do the rest of the work, which was to come up with the forecast that was consistent with that.  Unfortunately, there is no reference to that commitment any more.  There is no reference to the debt-to-GDP ratio commitment and, by weakening the medium-term fiscal commitments by having less of an anchor and just having a policy to run surpluses and do the right thing, there is nothing which can be translated into forecasts.  It is not really a technical forecasting problem but a political commitment problem.</p> <p>  In the letters from the Minister responding to our report, he often says this cannot be done because of parliamentary terms and such things.  However, in the past, projections have been made that go beyond the life of a parliament.  We understand that if there is an election and a new Government, the plans might change but to us there seems to be no logical reason why a Government cannot, at least for the medium term, set out the continuity of what it is doing as a baseline for others to work on.</p></speech>

During the crisis in 2010 and 2011, when the intention was to run the 3% GDP deficit target in 2014 and 2015, the projections were that it would be achieved but it was not clear what policies would be introduced to meet it.  Realistic projections were set on the basis of expectations of policy to meet the 3% deficit target by 2015.  Once that was achieved, there was a move to flat nominal forecasts but there was no change in anything.  In recent years, there has been a change to demographics and to some of the precommitments that were being built in but, again, the forecasts were not realistic as to the likely policy.  The forecasts were probably done on a realistic basis during the crisis, to signal that Ireland could deliver the 3% deficit target by 2015, but it was done on a completely unrealistic basis for a few years.  There has been some improvement recently but we definitely feel more can be achieved.  The overall fiscal figures set out for 2021, 2022 and 2023 are not what is going to happen.</p><p>These are numbers that we have to assess.  It would be better if it was done on a more realistic basis.  I take the point about some of the political issues but a move to medium-term budgeting will happen and an improvement will come in this forecasting.  We should be ahead of that, not waiting for it to be forced on us.</p></speech>

The committee will be involved in a number of meetings which look at health and, flowing from the report, the health expenditure.  We need to start getting this right.  The council has made a number of suggestions in the report.  One which I was not aware of was the Connors report, with regard to what is set out in legislation about job increases and the number of staff.  That is the main driver for the yearly increases in health expenditure.  I was not aware that these reports were being submitted in October and November, which makes a farce of it all.  They are technically within the law.  I must look back at the legislation but it is helpful to have that footnote.  We can pursue that as a committee.</p> <p>  The council has called for more adequate data to be made available and that the Government should develop and publish more data on health expenditure than are currently provided, including monthly in-year forecasts of the expected annual outturn for health expenditure.  How challenging would that be?  How difficult is that?  Will the Government tell us it cannot do this?  We know the challenges it has.  We did not know what the overrun was until days before the budget.  It is trying to forecast as well as it can.  If it cannot do that up until a budget where it really needs to do it, otherwise it does not get the money, how difficult would it be to do what has been called for by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council?  Are there any other measures outside of the issues of staff recruitment and the monthly in-year forecast that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council would suggest so that we can improve our forecasting and monitoring of health expenditure?  We call these overruns for the HSE but I believe it is underprovision.  The HSE tells us that it thanks us for the budget but cannot deliver the services.  It is not like other services because we are dealing with HSE managers who have just knocked off all home care packages.  Only palliative care patients now get it.  Somebody was discharged from hospital last week but the home care package is not there because of the overrun.</p> <p>  It is an underprovision and an unrealistic budget.  We can monitor how the Department of Health is spending the money that it has but is there not a step which needs to be before that?  The confidence and supply letter between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael said they will not allow for unrealistic budgets and they are supposed to be independently assessed.  Every budget in the last three years has had an unrealistic overspend.  What is the council's advice?  Is there anything further?  How difficult would it be to do monthly in-year forecasts?  What would the council say about making sure that the budget provided to the agency which has to deliver the service is realistic?  If it is not realistic in the first place, the council is only monitoring that it is overrunning again.</p></speech>

There are two necessary changes, as Mr. Tutty suggested earlier.  We do not have a view on which side it should happen on.  It is perhaps a case that both should change.  Credible expenditure Estimates need to be set out.  Once those Estimates and scenes are set out and adhered to, either one or both must change, but we do not have a view on which it is.  It seems likely that both need to improve and what we have seen over recent years is what we consider to be a soft budget constraint.  The budget is considered to lack credibility, which reduces the incentive of those who operate within that budget to stay within it, because I think it will be revised.  Improvement could be made on both sides, to the credibility of the Estimate as set out and the adherence to it.  I do not think we disagree on the fact that a number of things could change.  It is not necessarily about reducing stocking spending but about improving budgetary practice.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that it will be difficult.  A good way to think of this is that the first step one needs to take in getting a handle on health expenditure is understanding what is happening.  A good way to do that, which we have learned on the fiscal council from endorsing macroforecasts, is trying to forecast what expenditure will be.  Through doing that, one puts in place a framework and system for understanding exactly what expenditure will be today and, eventually, tomorrow, looking into the medium term.  Forecasting monthly will allow them to understand what is reasonable to expect and what is happening right now.  Another way to understand what is happening right now is to move to a better accounting system in the sector.  Right now in health, it is hard to get a clear sense of how much is being spent on all healthcare.  We do not have a monthly, consolidated, general government and audited set of accounts for health spending.  With regard to realistic forecasts, as Mr. Barnes said earlier, two basics need to be considered, which is what the demographic pressures are and what price pressures one will face.  Those are important in health where price pressures tend to push drug prices and wage prices higher.  If one gets those things on a realistic footing, since it is not that hard as a starting point to get them reasonably right, then one might have two arms improved.</p></speech>

Before we conclude, speaking as a member of the committee more than as the Chairman, I have strong disagreements with some of the views the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has on the budget.

It is quite a lengthy update as it has been a busy period since we met last September.  I ask members to indulge me and allow me to go through my statement.  I am happy to take questions afterwards.  This month&rsquo;s General Affairs Council meeting, which takes place next Tuesday, will focus on a number of issues, including a presentation by the Commission on the European Semester; the rule of law in Poland and the values of the Union in respect of Hungary.  However, I expect the most substantial discussions to focus on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and preparation of the December European Council.  With your permission, Chairman, I propose to focus on four key headlines.  Of course, members are free to raise any matters they choose during the question and answer session later.  The four key areas are, first, of course, the current state of play in respect of Brexit; second, the MFF for the period 2021 to 2027; the Single Market, particularly in respect of services and the digital Single Market, which is going to be a key focus; and the future of Europe debate and citizens' dialogues, on which I will outline what we have done and the report we have published as well as discussions and meetings last year.</p><p>Since I last spoke with the committee, we have seen significant progress with respect to the Brexit negotiations.  The withdrawal agreement ensures that the UK will leave the EU in an orderly manner.  It will avoid a scenario where the UK instead crashes out without a deal, a scenario that would have severe consequences for everyone, but particularly for Ireland.  The withdrawal agreement achieves our negotiating priorities.  Since the beginning of the negotiations, we have insisted that there could be no scenario that would result in a return of a hard border to the island of Ireland.  The backstop provisions constitute an important insurance policy that we will not see the return of any kind of a border on this island.  If invoked, these rules will apply unless and until another agreement, which delivers the same outcome, is in place.  This agreement was achieved with the support of our EU partners as well as the tireless efforts of Michel Barnier and his taskforce, as well as all of our own Irish officials at home and abroad.  We are very grateful to them for their understanding and solidarity.  As the Taoiseach said, there could be no better example of the advantages of EU membership for a small country.  Under this deal, the Good Friday Agreement and the gains made by the peace process are protected.  Rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement are protected and EU citizenship rights for people in Northern Ireland are confirmed.  This agreement underscores continuing North-South co-operation, which is vital to all of this island.</p><p>Last month at the European Council, member states gave their unanimous approval to the agreement.  They also approved the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  This document provides us with a roadmap to begin negotiations with the UK on what kind of relationship the EU and UK will have in the years ahead.  While the UK may be leaving, it will remain an important partner both to the EU and to Ireland and to that end it is extremely important and welcome that both sides have committed to agreeing a deep and comprehensive relationship.  The withdrawal agreement represents important compromises on both sides.  However, it ensures that the key interests of the EU and the UK are addressed.  As EU leaders have made clear, it represents the best way ahead for all of us, delivering an orderly withdrawal, which we all want, including through an effective transition period, and lays the foundations for a constructive negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  It is a fair and balanced agreement achieved after long and difficult negotiations and it is in all our interests that it is ratified and not reopened.  Of course many challenges lie ahead, and the withdrawal agreement will be subject to a meaningful vote in the UK House of Commons on 11 December, next Tuesday.  We hope that Prime Minister May can succeed and that it will be accepted.  However, nothing can be taken for granted, and the Government will continue its intensive programme of work to prepare for all eventualities, including a no-deal Brexit, to make sure the Government, industry and citizens are as prepared as possible.</p><p><b></b>On the MFF, the European Commission published its overall proposals for the EU&rsquo;s financial framework from 2021 to 2027 in May.</p><p>I shall now turn to the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  The European Commission published its overall proposals for the EU Multi-Annual Financial Framework 2021-2027 in May 2018.  Since then an intense programme of analysis and negotiations has been continuing at official and political level under the Bulgarian and Austrian Presidencies.  The MFF is now a standing item on the agenda of the General Affairs Council, GAC, and I expect that will continue to be the case under the Romanian Presidency, which begins in January next year.  At the General Affairs Council next week, we will discuss the latest Presidency report on the state of play of the negotiations.  The Austrian Presidency has focused on identifying the key budgetary and associated elements and principles on which agreement is needed.  These components will be included in a set of draft conclusions but without the actual financial amounts.  The purpose of the so-called &ldquo;negotiating box&rdquo; is to single out issues that will be for Heads of State and Government to decide under unanimity.  Broadly, Ireland agrees with the elements identified as requiring political agreement.  They are broadly balanced and reflect competing priorities for all member states.  At the European Council later next week, Heads of State and Government will discuss the progress report.  My expectation is that the European Council will welcome the significant progress achieved under the Austrian Presidency and will call on the Romanian Presidency to continue that work on the basis of the Austrian progress report.</p><p> It will continue to be a Government priority next year that we secure Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s financial framework for the seven years from 2021 to 2027.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, as all members will agree, remains a priority for Ireland.  Agriculture expenditure helps to support at least 44 million jobs across the EU and contributes to food safety, animal welfare, rural sustainability and environmental standards.  The Government is also supportive of programmes to keep pace with the rapid changes in the global economy and to help support jobs and growth.  I am thinking specifically of measures such as cohesion funding, the research and innovation budget, known as Horizon Europe, Digital Europe and the Connecting Europe Facility.  We also welcome the focus on young people, with increased funding for an expanded Erasmus+ programme, among others.  Lastly, we must ensure flexibility in the budget to deal with the potential negative consequences of Brexit and possible consequences of other issues that might arise in years to come.</p><p> While there had been initial ambitions to conclude the MFF negotiations by next year, when we know the European elections will take place, that timeframe has become increasingly unlikely.  The most important thing is to get the budget right.  I expect that the European Council will look to reach agreement on the MFF later in 2019 after the elections.  An agreed budget that meets our requirements to deliver on the EU&rsquo;s programmes and on which agreement can be reached by all member states is essential.</p><p> This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Single Market, a landmark achievement of the European Union.  The March European Council called on the Commission to present, by the end of the year, an assessment of the functioning of the Internal Market and remaining barriers to intra-EU trade of goods and services.  The Commission&rsquo;s communication - adopted on 22 November and presented to the Competitiveness Council on 29 November &ndash; is entitled The Single Market in a Changing World &ndash; a Unique Asset in Need of Renewed Political Commitment.  The European Council had been expected to hold a policy debate on the Single Market at its December meeting, based on that Commission communication.  In fact a detailed discussion is not now expected to take place until March 2019.  Ireland is, however, working with a large group of like-minded partners to ensure that the European Council adopts meaningful, focused conclusions this month calling for a new forward-looking approach for digital policy and Single Market policy, including for services.  This is extremely important given that more than 50% of our exports are in the area of services this. </p><p> Last month in Brussels, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, together with her colleagues from Finland, Denmark and the Czech Republic, launched a report examining the functioning of the Single Market, particularly in the area of services.  The report is titled Making EU Trade in Services Work for All and was commissioned from Copenhagen Economics, from which we have had a number of reports in recent years.  It finds major shortcomings in EU services sector performance but great potential for future development.  Although the Single Market is a key to the EU&rsquo;s welfare, prosperity, and competitiveness, it has not delivered the same benefits for services - in terms of reducing barriers to intra-EU trade - as it has for trade in goods.  The service sector gaps are critical in an economy where digitalisation is becoming the norm, and where services are increasingly an intrinsic part of manufactured goods.  The flipside is that there is great potential for improving the functioning of the EU services sector, global competitiveness, productivity, and the EU share of the world economy.  I share the Minister's hope that our report will help shape the discussions in 2019.  As the Minister said last week in Brussels, making it easier for companies to buy and sell services, especially across borders in the Single Market, is crucial to our competitiveness as digital activity grows.  The study is a concrete example of alliance-building by Ireland.  The project illustrates Ireland&rsquo;s ability to build and leverage relationships with other member states to advance common policy interests.</p><p> I shall now turn to the debate on the future of the EU which has been ongoing across Europe.  As the committee will be aware, last year the Government launched a Citizens' Dialogue on the future of Europe, in which many members here have taken part.  It has taken me all around Ireland listening to people discuss about the Europe they want.  They shared their views on how we can build a Union that is prosperous and competitive; safe and secure; sustainable; socially responsible; and how we can best equip ourselves to meet the challenges of the future in an ever increasingly global world.  The level of engagement was fantastic and the overriding message I heard was one about fairness.  People want environmental protection, intergenerational fairness and opportunities for young people while supporting and protecting our older generations.  It was also striking to see how much our citizens see the EU through the prism of values.  Words like peace, community, education, solidarity and diversity continue to come up in all of the discussions we have.  We need to use them and  make sure they are at the heart of all the decisions we take about the future of the Union.</p><p> In October, I was joined by my colleague Gernot Bl&uuml;mel, the Austrian Federal Minister for the EU, Arts, Culture and Media for the launch of the narrative report on the Citizens' Dialogue.  I was delighted to have the opportunity to launch the report, not just with the EU Presidency, but in close co-operation with the EU.  I was also very pleased that members of this committee were able to attend and I thank them for that.  On a broader stage EU leaders are committed to listening and to responding to the concerns of their citizens.  We all want to offer a vision of Europe that people can trust and support.  The Citizens' Dialogues are part of wider citizens&rsquo; consultations taking place across the European Union; both in member states and at a pan-European level.  All of these presentations will be concluded at a dialogue in Sibiu next May when EU leaders will come together.  Despite its imperfections, Irish people see Europe at the heart of their future and Ireland at the heart of Europe.  In May, an opinion poll found that 92% of Irish people believe that Ireland should remain a part of the EU.  This rises to 97% among young people, so it is obviously very positive.  These numbers are encouraging, but they are no reason to be complacent.  I am sure that each and every member here would agree that people do not spend their lives thinking about Europe on a daily basis.  The European Ombudsman, Emily O&rsquo;Reilly pointed out at our final Citizens' Dialogue that politics continues to be local for people.  We need to make sure that people know and understand how the EU impacts on their daily lives and not just what happens on a larger scale, and how what we are doing reflects the treaty-based values that bind us together as Europeans.</p><p> Before I conclude, I will briefly outline two important topics that have been preoccupying the General Affairs Council lately, namely the rule of law in Poland and the values of the Union in relation to Hungary.   The committee members will be aware of these issues.  The central issue is the rule of law and its application in Poland.  In October, the European Court of Justice issued an interim ruling, ordering Poland to adopt measures to temporarily suspend the application of the relevant Polish legislation.  Poland has since adopted legislation to amend the Supreme Court law and enable the return to work of judges who were forced to retire.  Following on from the hearings in June and September, the GAC will hold another hearing next week.  Ours is a Union based on shared values, including democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  Ireland has consistently supported the Commission in this matter.  We have also emphasised that dialogue between Poland and the Commission needs to result in substantive outcomes that address the concerns identified.  Ireland has taken part in both of those hearings to date, and will take part in the hearing next week.</p><p> Separately, in September, the European Parliament adopted the report that was a reasoned proposal inviting the council to determine whether there is a series risk of a breach by Hungary of the values on which the European Union is founded.  The Hungarian Government has issued a written response in relation to the report.  The Commission has also prepared a paper on the values related infringement procedures that it has taken to address concerns with the situation in Hungary.  At next week&rsquo;s GAC meeting, there will be a smaller  discussion on these documents and hopefully a proposal on how to move forward.  The main issue on people's minds relates to the Central European University in Hungary.  I very much regret that it has been forced into a situation where it is required to relocate from Budapest to Vienna.</p><p>Academic freedom is one of the fundamental values of the Union and it is a sad day when an institute feels that it has no other choice but to leave an EU member state in order to continue its operations in the way it should.  These are issues that we need to raise and address.</p><p> I thank committee members for their attendance and apologise for going on for so long.</p></speech>

We wish her, her family, her staff and everyone else the very best of luck.  We also thank the Minister of State for attending.  She put a great deal into her comprehensive report.</p> <p>  I will call Senator Craughwell first, who is under a time constraint.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018120500002#C00500"><p>The Minister of State will forgive me for flinging a few questions at her before running out the door.  I have a name for throwing the grenade and running anyway, but on this occasion I have other meetings arranged, so I apologise.</p><p>I will start by congratulating the Minister of State and, more importantly, those officials who work on behalf of Ireland all over Europe - the ambassadors and their staff with whom the Minister of State engages on a daily basis.  Their work on Brexit must be acknowledged by those of us in political life.  Without them, we would not have half the work done.  There is not a corner of Europe that is unaware of Ireland's unique situation in terms of Brexit.  While the Minister of State breaks her heart ensuring that is so on a daily basis, her officials have been doing that in each country.</p><p>My fear is that all of that work will have been for nothing if Britain falls apart in Brexit.  We are hearing screams for a second referendum and so on.  It looks like Prime Minister May will not be able to carry her Government and the House of Commons on the Brexit vote.  If so, we will be thrown into a quagmire.  We do not know where they are going.</p><p>We in this country have never addressed the concept of a hard border or where we are going.  There has never been a hard border in Ireland since the foundation of the State.  There have been what I would call militaristic crossings, Border crossings have been difficult to get through and border management has been a major problem, but there have never been barbed wire and walls across fields and unapproved roads to stop people crossing back and forth.  However, there is now a likelihood that we could find ourselves going back to border management again.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party made the point on television on Sunday night that we needed to increase the number of garda&iacute; to look after the Border should such a situation arise.  We reorganised the Defence Forces in 2012 and moved all of the troops south. Most soldiers, airmen and naval personnel are accommodated south of a line from Dublin to Galway.  We only have military people in Donegal and Dundalk, with the latter's units providing day-to-day security services in Dublin.  With the barracks in Cavan and Monaghan closed, has the Government war gamed a managed border as we had during the horrible 1970s to 2000s?  Have contingency plans been put in place on the military side as opposed to the Garda side?</p><p>The Minister of State will forgive me if I move through a number of issues quickly.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has been the backbone of the Irish agricultural industry.  As we move towards a new Europe, will the CAP become more aligned with environmental concerns?  Agriculture is our backbone, but if it is destroying the environment, we have to find a balance.  I do not wish to see the farming community suffer, but the CAP will have to be reorganised.  I will read the Minister's response.</p><p>With her colleagues, the Minister of State has done a tremendous job in engaging the population in a discussion on the future of Europe.  The Timmermans task force is moving towards subsidiarity and proportionality, that is, bringing decision making to the lowest common denominator in terms of lawmaking, regulation, etc.  Surprisingly, though, we in Ireland seem to be centralising rather than distributing power.  We are moving towards larger councils and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is taking more and more away from local authorities.  How does all of that fit into the future model of Europe?  The Minister of State referred to 92% of Irish people, and 97% of our young people, being totally committed to Europe.  That is the micro level.  At the macro level, though, there is a disturbing movement of people condemning Europe.  We in politics have to take a bit of blame for that insofar as we constantly blame Brussels for decisions that we have agreed to in the first place.  Has the Minister of State anything to say on the question of subsidiarity?</p><p>The ability to travel throughout Europe and take educational and training courses has committed every young person to Europe.  To a certain degree, however, that is something for the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, those who can afford university education and so on.  I want to see more movement on training and apprenticeships across Europe.  Has the Minister of State seen any real desire to bring that idea on board over the 2020-27 period?  Will there be a greater effort to engage at that level?  I am referring to training rather than academic and to apprenticeships rather than university.  A great deal of apprenticeships will be undertaken in technological universities, but the Minister of State understands what I am talking about.</p><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me this opportunity.  I will take the time to read the Minister of State's answers.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to leave now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018120500002#C00600"><p>I apologise for having to pop out for a vote in the Seanad.  I welcome the Minister of State back to the committee for one of her regular and appreciated updates on a range of areas ahead of next week's important GAC meeting.  I will start at the finish and work back to the meatier subject of Brexit.</p><p>Needless to say, what has been happening in Hungary in recent days is worrying.  The Irish Government has repeatedly raised the matter with the Hungarian Government at official and political level.  However, we now need to do more than simply voice our concerns with the Hungarian Government.  I welcome the measures taken in Poland and the efforts that the European Commission and Council have made in that regard.  We need to step up the pressure on the Hungarian Government, and the sooner, the better.</p><p>Looking ahead to the key Council meeting in Romania where everything about the future of Europe has been compiled for discussion, has the Minister of State an insight into what the results might be?  Given the report that she produced and launched, what will be the key aims of the Irish Government and how will we work to influence other member states?  She mentioned her Austrian partner at the launch.</p><p>Regarding the multi-annual financial framework, I will leave the issue of CAP to colleagues who have a more rural focus in their constituencies.  I am greatly enthused by the potential increases for Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020.  However, they pose a unique challenge to our Government in our approach going forward.  We are under-represented in Erasmus+ receipts at academic and civic society levels.  We could be doing much more.  Compare the number of French students coming to Ireland under Erasmus+ with the number of Irish students going to France.  There is a large deficit.  We need to plug those gaps and encourage more young Irish people to take up the opportunity of an Erasmus+ place in third level and, through that, develop their European language skills.  We could also work that into the EU jobs campaign.  We need more Irish people taking the <i>concours</i>and taking up positions in European institutions.</p><p>I acknowledge the massive efforts made by the Minister of State and her Department in encouraging EU jobs.  That has been vital.</p><p>Horizon 2020 will pose a unique challenge after Brexit.  Many of the co-ordinated efforts of the Irish third-level institutions in the research area involve British alternatives.  Many institutions are receiving grants in respect of work they are doing in partnership with British universities.  It will be difficult for them to replace their British partners with universities from continental Europe, particularly those that do not use English as a first language in academic terms.  Obviously, no other remaining member state uses English as a first language.  We need to be alive to this.  It is great that the multi-annual financial framework will award more funds to these two really important programmes, but there is no point in increasing the funds if Ireland is not in a position to avail of them.  I know the Minister of State needs to work with the Ministers, Deputies Zappone and McHugh, in this regard.  We need to be poised to take those funds and use them in the best possible way.</p><p> It is very difficult to know where to start when it comes to Brexit.  The ongoing pantomime at Westminster is proving to be quite a distraction during the overall management process.  The UK reaction to the withdrawal agreement package, which is quite simplistic, is in marked contrast to the reaction here and on the Continent.  When we see some of the rhetoric and revelations, for example in respect of court rulings and UK Attorney General advice, it seems that this is new news for certain people.  Much of this stuff has been known and has been on the record for a long time.  I appreciate the consistent approach to this matter that has been taken by the Government and the EU as a whole.</p><p> I am interested in a finding that has been produced by JP Morgan today.  It has changed its prediction significantly.  I know that analysts in many countries have to be very wary with their predictions.  According to JP Morgan, the likelihood of an orderly Brexit has decreased from 60% to 50%, the likelihood of no Brexit has increased from 20% to 40% and the likelihood of no deal being reached has decreased from 20% to 10%.  It is welcome that JP Morgan believes we are moving further away from a no-deal scenario.  The Minister of State rightly spoke about preparations for all scenarios, which is something that has been mentioned by Donald Tusk.  Senator Craughwell has also gone into detail on that.  I know that work is being done as part of a whole-of-Government approach.</p><p> I am of the view that an orderly Brexit is where we are going.  It is quite clear that there is just one deal on the table.  It is a question of this deal, no deal or no Brexit.  I presume it is taken as a given that no Brexit would be welcomed.  If the UK were to change its mind at government level, obviously Ireland would be the first EU member state to say "Stop the rollercoaster and get off".  It would be difficult, but we could go back to a relationship with an EU of 28, and hopefully of 29 or 30 in due course.  I continue to believe fundamentally that there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  It would be far more beneficial for the UK to remain within the EU than to leave the EU under any deal at any stage.</p></speech>

I compliment her on the role she played in the recent long-running Brexit debates and negotiations.  I also compliment the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, all other Government Ministers and all Opposition people who played a role in this intricate operation.  The Government adopted the correct position in respect of this matter.  That position has been held throughout.  There is a very good reason for this - there was no alternative position.  There was no alternative to the role adopted by the Government.  I think that was recognised by the EU, particularly by Michel Barnier.  The way the rest of the EU member states supported the Government is to be recognised and acknowledged.  It underlines the importance of having support at a crucial time in business of that nature.  There was no other place to be.  I compliment and thank the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Many people have been inquiring about what plan B might be.  I would very respectfully advise them to stay away from that spot.  When one is negotiating, it is like playing poker - one must never announce what one's next move is going to be.  The point at which one makes such a disclosure immediately becomes the position from which one will resile.  That is not a good place to be.  We have had 100% success so far.  It was very important for us to hold the position that was being held.  That position will continue to prevail and will eventually bring about something that is acceptable right across Europe.</p> <p>  I will not go over all the issues.  The future of Europe comes to mind.  I am not certain that we always get the full benefit of the Single Market.  I have spoken about this at meetings of the health committee and other committees.  We need to be constantly aware of the fact that we are part of the European Single Market.  The power that goes with being part of a population of over 500 million is very important.  When one is sourcing goods, materials and services, one is in a far better bargaining position by virtue of being part of a market of 500 million people than one would be if one were coming from a market of 5 million or whatever the case may be.  When we are negotiating with the pharmaceutical sector or any other sector of business throughout Europe or globally, we need to reiterate the need to avail of the full benefits of being part of the Single Market.</p> <p>  Like many of those who have already expressed their opinions about the future of Europe, I am concerned that some Europeans have recently shown a tendency to look outside Europe or to move away from the central core of fundamental European policy that has stood the test of time extremely well.  As I have said previously, I think that is a dangerous place to go.  It runs contrary to the ideals of modern Europe.  Our combined history shows us that this is not the place to be.  We have had a peaceful and prosperous Europe for a considerable period.  We continue to have a peaceful and prosperous Europe, albeit under duress.  We would not want to lose sight of the fact that the EU has been the biggest single peace arrangement in the world for the past 50 or 60 years.  People will have issues from time to time.  They will look at alternatives overseas.  It is a very good thing for them to look again and again so that they are not under-impressed by the success of Europe as it was, as it should be and as it will continue to be as long as it is supported.</p> <p>  I would like to comment on what Europe is to us.  I believe we have taken ownership of our part of Europe.  We are Europeans.  We should never resile from that.  I think that has been our strength.  I do not believe every country on the Continent of Europe and within the EU is fully committed to that process at the present time.  There are slight indications of a movement away from the centre.  I think it is a dangerous place to go.  If we really want to know what the dangers are in this respect, we can consult our combined history.</p> <p>  I welcome the success that has been achieved in respect of the issues in Poland.  We are worried about some of the tendencies that have shown up in Hungary in recent times.  We are worried about tendencies that have emerged in the last couple of years.  We have spoken about such matters at this committee.  It is not because we are furthest away from the immigration issue across Europe that I am saying that barbed wire and walls do not resolve a problem.  Unless that is recognised by everyone right across Europe and the globe, we will have a serious issue to deal with at some time in the not too distant future.  If we want to avoid conflict, we need to recognise that.  It is very difficult to say to people that they are on the wrong side of a line or a border, that they must stay there and that we will ensure they do so.  As an EU member state, Ireland must show solidarity with European principles in this regard.</p> <p>  I disagree with Senator Craughwell, who is now absent, in the context of the CAP.  The policy will continue to be very important for this country and for a number of other food-producing countries throughout Europe.  It is important that we do not lose sight of its importance.  People have to eat.  One of the reasons the European Economic Community was founded in the first instance was to ensure that starvation was eliminated.  Europe had first-hand experience of starvation in the aftermath of the Second World War.</p> <p>  Like other members, I will have to go to the D&aacute;il shortly.  We would like to offer our congratulations to all the negotiators - officials and politicians - who took part in the crucial negotiations over the last couple of years.  We wish them well in the future.  We are absolutely certain that the route being pursued is the right one.  There is no other route.  We could not be in any other place.</p><p>We could not have done anything else for this island, in terms of North-South trade and the Good Friday Agreement.  To act in any other way would have been a disaster.  I compliment the Minister of State and offer her our support.</p></speech>

On the special European Council meeting, the political declaration and the future relationship generally between the UK and the EU, could the Minister of State tell us what Ireland's priorities in those areas are?  I asked the Taoiseach about the European Council meeting earlier today in the D&aacute;il, and he told the House that all Heads of Government were consulted about their priorities.  Is there general agreement among the EU 27 about what it wants to see happen in terms of the future relationship, having regard to the declaration?  More importantly, what are Ireland's priorities for those negotiations, which we hope will proceed in due course?</p> <p>  I note the Minister of State has said that the Government is preparing for all eventualities and scenarios in terms of Brexit, including for a no-deal Brexit.  Can she give us a little bit more information on that?  Are we talking about the upgrade of our ports and airports?  Does it include supports for small businesses and SMEs?  I believe we are facing a rocky period, especially if the vote on 11 December goes the way we all think it will go, although it is true that a week is a long time in politics.  We must brace ourselves economically for anything that might happen after that date, including changes in the value of the pound, cross-Border trade and Christmas shopping.  Things could happen quite quickly.  Can the Minister of State please reassure us that the Government is prepared for all eventualities and scenarios?  </p> <p>  I wish the Minister of State well in her endeavours with the Single Market.  It is an ideal worthy of further action and should be pursued.  It is in the interest of the citizens at the end of the day; they will greatly benefit from the agenda set out for the future of the Single Market, and that is to be welcomed.  </p> <p>  On the future of Europe, I note there will be a major European Council meeting in Romania in May 2019.  How does the Minister of State see that panning out?  Does she envisage that big decisions will be taken at that meeting or that big changes will take place?  Will it be more aspirational?  Will it set out a new vision for Europe or will major practical steps be announced on the future of the European Union?  I am particularly interested in moves towards further integration, which we discussed last week with the representative of the European Commission in Ireland.  Is there a move towards further integration among many or all of the EU states?  How is that likely to proceed?  I agree with what has been said about Poland and Hungary; democratic, liberal European values are dear to us all and I welcome the moves taken by the European Commission in that area.  </p></speech>

I agree with my colleagues generally, and congratulate the Minister of State and her colleagues at Government level for all their inputs at the various meetings in the recent past.  On Brexit, the most significant of the three votes in the House of Commons yesterday was the final one, the motion proposed by the former Attorney General of the UK, Dominic Grieves.  He is a very learned man.  While Downing Street would not admit it, that motion could be interpreted as a Downing Street backstop.  It is clear that thankfully there is no majority for a no-deal scenario in the House of Commons.  Parliament will have a stay if, as expected, the Prime Minister loses the vote next Tuesday.  The important thing now is to consider the future arrangements; I am sure the Minister of State has begun to think of those arrangements already.  While nobody envisages any change to the deal hammered out, I understand that the declaration document on the future arrangement can be tweaked.  Perhaps it is largely a fudge anyway; the Minister of State will be more familiar with that than I am.  It might not be appropriate for the Minister of State to comment on that.  At this stage we have to look beyond next Tuesday.  Presumably the Prime Minister will attend the following summit, and it is possible that things will happen there.  There will then be subsequent votes in the House of Commons due to the decision on the Grieves motion yesterday.  I look forward to the comments of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Please let me know if I do.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell asked about Brexit and the concept of the hard border.  As we have said throughout this entire process, and in particular over the past year, our preparation for all possible outcomes has increased.  This ranges from the best possible outcome, where we have a close and comprehensive free trading relationship with the UK, to a no-deal scenario.  We have been working with all Departments and Ministers, who have been asked to identify the possible challenges they and their industries, sectors and Departments may face in that regard.  They have been asked to identify possible measures, be that funding, changes to legislation or additional supports or measures, they would need in those scenarios.  They are doing this without the knowledge of the full extent of what might happen, but as much as they can.  Each Department, if it has not already done so, is now preparing a report or action plan to be put in place.  Those plans have not been published and given that we are still in negotiations, it is not something that would be published.  In the interim, we have been trying to support businesses that have been impacted already.  There is such uncertainty out there.  Some &euro;750 million from the past three budgets has been provided to directly support small and medium businesses.  This year alone, an extra &euro;115 million was allocated to support Government agencies to continue with expanding programmes such as Global Ireland 2025, which seeks to expand our horizons beyond the UK and Europe to the rest of the world by doubling our global footprint.  Many measures have already been put in place.  We are making contingency plans for when we know what the actual outcome will be.</p> <p>  We are not preparing for a hard border, to answer the question the Senator asked.  We are looking at customs and checks for east to west transportation of goods because we know that, even with the best possible outcome, there will still be some changes.  Funding was approved in this year's budget for more than 500 staff, including customs officials and officials for Revenue, sanitary or phytosanitary checks.  The remainder will be allocated in time, but we are not preparing for a hard border between North and South on the basis that every political party, the UK Government, every member state, the European Commission, the European Parliament and indeed the Irish Government have all committed that there will be no return to such a border.  We believe that, irrespective of the outcome, we all need to maintain and uphold that commitment. </p> <p>  There was a proposal to reduce the overall Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget.  We do not agree with that at all, and I have consistently reiterated at every General Affairs Council I attend how important it is, not just for our rural farming community but for our towns and villages, for the production of food and for all the reasons I outlined in my earlier presentation.  We recognise that there are other priorities which need to be addressed, and our farmers in particular are very willing and ready to work with the environmental pillar to ensure that anything they do can help to mitigate the impact of climate change and reduce our carbon footprint.  The EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, is very much in favour of co-operation and allowing both of these agendas to work together to reduce our carbon footprint, while at the same time supporting our farming and rural communities.  We should be able to do that.  This is an ongoing discussion within the European Parliament, the European Council and in the General Affairs Council, of which I am a member.</p><p>We have always indicated that we would be willing to pay more in the upcoming budget, but only if CAP and the Cohesion Fund are protected.  The latter are traditional programmes which we feel provide added value to Europe.</p><p> There were a few questions on the future of Europe and subsidiarity.  One of the early questions on the future of Europe discussion related to whether Europe should do less more efficiently and whether it should be big on the big things and small on smaller things.  We feel we should focus on the areas to which we are already committed.  There was considerable discussion on the Single Market.  The Single Market is only 80% complete in the context of goods and 40% complete in the context of services.  The digital Single Market, which people are saying will be like the fifth freedom, is only approximately 30% complete.  Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands, recently suggested that completing all three would add &euro;1 trillion to the overall GDP of the European Union.  While it is not all about the economy, when that money is coming back into our economy we can obviously use it to improve our social settings as well as invest in our infrastructure and other key areas for us.  Our focus is to continue the work we have promised to do but obviously we would not be particularly fond of anything that would suggest further treaty change, which is often asked.</p><p> Senator Craughwell referred to education and training.  The new Erasmus+ programme is not just for people who attend university; it can apply to students in primary school or secondary school, or people working in trades and possibly even outside the European Union.  I attended an event last night at which a question was asked about people from Africa taking part.  I am of the view that even something like this would be possible under Erasmus+.  It is about broadening the horizons and ensuring that as many people benefit as possible.</p><p> Senators Richmond and Coghlan and Deputy Haughey asked about Hungary.  Many things are happening with which I and the Government disagree.  On the rule of law, dialogue with Poland has been ongoing for some time.  It reached a point where the ongoing dialogue was not making an impact.  That was obviously when Article 7 was triggered.  We have had two hearings within the General Affairs Council and will have another hearing next week.  Through that dialogue we have started to see progress and change.  The EU is built on dialogue and we all agree that is the best way to address issues.</p><p> Of course, if a country is not upholding the core values of the European Union, there must be accountability and we need to be able to hold each other accountable - we would expect the same to happen in our case.  The debate on Poland is continuing.  We have seen changes but we need to see further change.  With Hungary, we are probably starting at the beginning of that process.  On the many occasions I have met my Hungarian colleagues, I have encouraged them to engage with the Commission.  There is a legal process we need to follow.  Ultimately, the key priority for us is to see results.</p><p> Senator Richmond asked how much we are using Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020.  Approximately 55,000 students have availed of Erasmus since it began and since Ireland took part.  We can always improve that and increase our numbers.  We are focused on that particularly with Erasmus+.  There is an increased focus on languages with the publication of the languages strategy in September by the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  We want to increase by 25% the number of students taking two languages in the junior certificate and leaving certificate.  I hope the renewed focus on languages will encourage people to study abroad, to travel to other countries and to become more integrated in that sense.  Obviously, further work remains to be done and we need to focus on it.</p><p> On EU jobs, we are only reaching approximately 40% of our target regarding graduate programmes.  We are significantly lower than we should be.  We have always had a very proud tradition of holding very high positions within the European institutions.  It is not because of any reduction in calibre, but unfortunately the numbers are decreasing.  Many people are reaching retirement age and we do not have the same level of people applying.  We are asking the Commissioner to provide geographic-specific competitions to target countries that have the same problem as us.  Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden hold views similar to ours.  We are having an ongoing discussion but if we do not address the issue now, we will have increasingly less representation around the table within the institutions and we know how important that can be.</p><p> Senator Richmond asked about Brexit.  I do not know whether the changed predictions happened on foot of last night's vote or whether the idea of a no-deal scenario has changed that.</p></speech>

We will all keep an eye on how things go next Monday most importantly.</p> <p>  Would no Brexit at all be welcome?  I would say "Yes".  While obviously this has taken considerable time, cost, energy and effort, nobody wants to see the UK leave.  It has been an instrumental partner in the EU for the past 45 years, joining at the same time as us.  We have many of the same priorities, goals and objectives.  Of course in the way the conversation is happening on the future of Europe there would be questions we would have to be able to answer and address.  This is something the UK would need to request.  I do not think we would be stopping it.</p> <p>  As the Senator stated, we do not want people to leave; we want the Union to expand.  We want the process of enlargement to continue.  The ambassador from Georgia is present.  We want states in the western Balkans and further afield to benefit in the same way that Ireland has, once they comply with the rules and regulations.  We should be looking out and not looking to make the Union smaller.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan talked about staying away from a plan B.  We are not preparing for a border on the island of Ireland.  It is not that we are hiding any planning from it.  We are just not because it is not something we feel we can countenance happening.</p> <p>  I was asked if we get the full benefit of the Single Market.  As with anything, there are winners and losers.  In certain parts of it we will benefit more.  Ireland has made its membership work over the past 45 years through the Single Market, allocations from the Cohesion Fund, infrastructural investment funds and CAP.  The focus now should be on improving the commitments we have made and ensuring we complete the digital Single Market, the services Single Market, banking union, capital markets union and all the other key areas on which we have focused.  This again goes back to whether we are a Europe of a Single Market or a peaceful Europe of values.  While it is important financially to complete all these other areas, we need to return to our values and ensure the issues being raised in terms of the rule of law, the freedom of speech, freedom of the media, and particularly education are upheld at all times.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about CAP.  It is very important to engage with our colleagues.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has had meetings with like-minded agricultural Ministers and this is at the top of his agenda.  He is also keen to ensure the budget is not reduced but if possible increased, which we would all appreciate.</p> <p>  Deputy Haughey asked about the political declaration.  We cannot get into too much of the detail until the UK is a third country.  First and foremost, the commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and the continuation of PEACE+, which is the new PEACE and INTERREG programme being proposed, are obviously significant for us.  There were significant commitments on transport and aviation.  As an island country this has been a priority for us and in particular the commitments given on the land-bridge, which was something we welcomed and which is in the political declaration.</p> <p>  Senator Richmond asked how Erasmus will operate if the UK is not part of it or the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.  The UK has given a commitment in the political declaration that it wants to be part of the Horizon 2020 the research and innovation programme and Erasmus+.  This has been a priority for us.</p> <p>  Two key areas that were not specifically included in the context of the customs element of the backstop are fisheries and financial services.  These two industries are significant for Ireland and the UK, as well as for some of the other member states with coastlines.</p><p>We have a commitment in these areas.  Many of our priorities are very similar to those of other member states, especially the provision of PEACE programme funding, as well as in the areas of transport and aviation which are of significance to us, given that we are an island nation.  Fisheries are also important.  Member states are still engaging on the European Council meeting to be held in May and what will be announced at it.  We finished the citizens' consultation process last May, have published our report and will present an outline of it at the December Council meeting next week.  Other member states are still putting theirs together, but between now and next May we will have a clearer idea of what their priorities are.  I am not sure if we will have any announcement of specific policy directions at the event in Sibiu in May, but we will have much greater clarity on the direction we want to take and some of the specific issues people want to address within individual member states.</p><p> In response to Senator Coghlan, a lot of the discussion was about Brexit.  I hope I answered most of the questions.  </p><p> I thank members for their indulgence and those in the Visitors Gallery.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#B00400"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus na baill den choiste chomh maith.  I thank the select committee for the opportunity to bring this Supplementary Estimate for Vote 38 before it.  The total additional funding I am seeking for 2018 is &euro;655 million.  Of this, &euro;10 million is to compensate for a shortfall in appropriation-in-aid, &euro;20 million is towards capital works and &euro;625 million is towards overspends in current expenditure in various areas of the HSE.  I acknowledge that the amount sought is significant, representing as it does 4% of overall health expenditure in 2018.</p> <p>  This year, the anticipated level of overspend by the HSE is linked to the HSE's first charge in 2018 arising from the 2017 deficit, a shortfall in income, winter planning, growth in 2018 activity beyond plan, including the primary care reimbursement service, and additional funding required in the State Claims Agency.  Health funding remains a major challenge.  Demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and an ageing population, mean we face challenges into the future.  We are implementing our strategic responses to these challenges, while continuing to focus on effective management of resources to ensure that services are delivered in line with the national service plan.</p> <p>  Ensuring the health service is financially sustainable is a key strategic goal of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The significant increases in the health Vote in recent years reflects the Government's commitment to improve access to health and social services for the people of Ireland, through investment across community and hospital services.  We need to keep the recovery going and the economy strong in order that we can continue to develop our health infrastructure and the provision of health services into the future.</p> <p>  Next year, the Health Service Executive's national service plan will be framed through the lens of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  The strategy provides the framework within which a system-wide reform programme for the health service will be advanced, and focuses on establishing the building blocks for a significant shift in the way in which health services are delivered in Ireland.</p> <p>  I will now set out the items that make up this year's Supplementary Estimate.  On the 2017 first charge of &euro;90 million, the HSE's recorded deficit for 2017 is &euro;139 million.  Under the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, any excess expenditure must be charged to the income and expenditure account the following year and is effectively a first charge on the following year's budget.  My Department and the HSE completed a comprehensive review of the anticipated outturn for 2018 and identified a number of once-off savings that will be allocated against the 2017 first charge, with the balance of the funding requirement being met from the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  There has been a significant reduction in the level of private patient income for public hospitals in 2018.  Health insurers, as members will be aware, commenced a campaign in 2017 aimed at discouraging members from using their private health insurance to avail of private inpatient services when they are admitted via an emergency department.  Instead, they have encouraged their members to consider being treated as a public patient, as is their right provided for under the Health Act 1970.  This, inevitably, is leading to a drop in income as more patients are opting to be treated publicly rather than privately.</p> <p>  The allocation for the winter plan of &euro;10 million from the Supplementary Estimate allows for the commencement of a range of measures aimed at alleviating pressure on the acute hospital system during the busy winter period.  Timely discharge of patients is vital to ensuring that a ready supply of beds is available to those patients requiring to be admitted through emergency departments.  Delayed discharges are a major contributory factor to emergency department overcrowding and adversely affect patient flow throughout the hospital.  It is essential that, insofar as is possible, egress meets demand and that hospital and community healthcare organisation, CHO, processes support timely and safe discharge.</p><p>Integrated hospital and community plans are the cornerstone of the 2018-19 winter plan, with nine key sites of concern selected based on previous winter performance.  Enhanced measures across acute, primary and social care will focus on critical demand pressures on the nine sites during a four-week focus period between 17 December 2018 and 13 January 2019.</p><p> With regard to the non-achievement of the &euro;150 million savings target, the value improvement programme included in the national service plan is a single overarching programme with three broad priority themes: improving value within existing services, improving value within non-direct services and strategic value improvement.  It is anticipated that none of the targeted savings under the strategic value improvement will be achieved at year end.</p><p> Acute hospitals are running at an expenditure level from 2017 which is over their approved funding level.  This level of expenditure was to be matched to the approved level of funding through achieving the savings attributable to the service level and corporate value programmes embedded in the division&rsquo;s hospital budgets.  The forecasted underachievement of targets under the corporate value programme by year end is contributing significantly to the estimated overspend.  Increasing bed capacity in public acute hospitals continues to be a priority in addressing the causes and challenges of emergency department overcrowding.  My Department is undertaking a health service capacity review in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, the findings of which are due to be published shortly.  In the meantime, there continues to be an urgent need for capacity in acute hospitals.  On that basis, it is proposed to allocate &euro;5.7 million to acute hospitals to address critical bed capacity deficits in 2018.  </p><p> Community services incorporates the delivery of primary care, mental health, disability and older persons health and social care services.  The main drivers of the overall deficit in community services include emergency placements for people with disabilities, costs associated with HIQA compliance and costs associated with Storm Emma.  </p><p> Support services incorporates a number of central corporate services including finance, health business services, legal, communications, health system reform, chief information officer and the office of the director general.  Expenditure in the area is running ahead of plan for a number of reasons, including the number of large legal cases, professional service costs for the programme for health service improvement and increasing software and professional fees related to support of acute hospital initiatives such as maternity and newborn electronic records.  </p><p> In 2018, there has been a significant increase in the number of payments made under the treatment abroad and cross-border healthcare schemes.  With the trend continuing upwards throughout the year, there is a need for supplementary funding to address this area of growing demand.  </p><p> The increasing costs of the clinical indemnity scheme are not due exclusively to the increasing numbers of claims but rather to the increasing costs of awards and the high costs associated with catastrophic injury claims.  In 2017, significant progress was made on legislation which is expected to lead to a reduction in costs over time.  From a health perspective, the most important aspect is the provision for periodic payment orders.  Courts will now have the power to award damages by way of periodic payment orders, where appropriate, having regard to the best interests of the plaintiff and all the circumstances of the case.  With the enactment of the Mediation Act in October 2017, which provides a wide-ranging statutory framework to promote the resolution of disputes through mediation as an alternative to court proceedings and to reduce the stress for parents and families that often accompanies court proceedings, it is hoped that more families will opt for this route.  In addition, &euro;46 million is sought towards the projected deficit in 2018 in the State Claims Agency.  </p><p> Funding will be provided for a number of GP fees and allowances including &euro;4.85 million towards the cost of providing free cervical check consultations.</p><p> The greater than budgeted number of medical cards is driving an increase in the number of items dispensed and it is proposed to allocate &euro;3 million to cover this increased cost.  It is proposed to allocate &euro;30 million to cover the continuing increase in high-tech drug costs for treating conditions such as rheumatology, cancer and cystic fibrosis.  With regard to long-term illness, &euro;7 million will be allocated to cover the cost of treating long-term illnesses, the most prevalent being diabetes and epilepsy.  </p><p> Appropriations-in-aid are received by Ireland from the UK in respect of health services provided under EU regulations.  The amounts received are based on the Ireland-United Kingdom healthcare reimbursement arrangement.  Costs associated with UK pensioners residing in Ireland account for the major portion of the total payment.  Historically, each country's pensioner liability was agreed based on the results of sample pensioner surveys undertaken every few years.  More recently both administrations have agreed in principle to work towards the introduction of a revised methodology for determining pensioner liability.  Trends in demography and migration between the two countries indicate a reduction in the number of pensioners for whom the UK is liable.  Initial discussions with the UK indicated that receipts in 2018 might be in the region of &euro;225 million against a provision of &euro;280 million, a difference of &euro;55 million.  Detailed discussions have recently finalised and a total payment in 2018 of &euro;270 million has been agreed, leaving only a difference of &euro;10 million.  </p><p> There is an ambitious programme of capital investment in health reflecting priority accorded to capital spending in the programme for Government position that health capital spending would be a priority.  Priority Government projects, most of which are either under way or about to commence, account for a substantial proportion of the health capital allocation in 2018 and the coming years, resulting a high level of commitments.  During 2018, extensive measures to actively manage the capital budget have been applied.  This has involved balancing as much as practicable the fulfilment of contractual commitments, delivery of projects and managing equipment and infrastructural risk issues, such that capital expenditure remains within profile.  Following this extensive engagement and management of issues, capital spending in 2018 remains within profile.  The HSE has informed the Department that, with the provision of an additional &euro;20 million in 2018 and the management of the projects' budgets, there will be no overrun in 2018 capital funding.  </p><p> A significant increase in funding for the health services has been achieved in recent years.  As I stated previously, the issue of health funding is a major challenge, not just in Ireland but internationally.  Dealing with a growing and ageing population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the increasing costs of health technology will continue to pose a financial challenge into the future.</p><p> Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a new roadmap to support the delivery of high quality care to our citizens.  Improving the way services are organised and delivered and reducing costs to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs, must remain our focus.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service continue to demonstrate good practice by delivering the best healthcare within the significant resources that have been made available by Government for 2019.  This additional funding in 2018, combined with the 2019 budget provision, is a practical example of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to use our economic growth to restore much needed funding to our health service.  The above items together with cash projections to year-end involve an Exchequer requirement of &euro;655 million.  </p><p> I seek the committee&rsquo;s approval of the Supplementary Estimates for Vote 38. </p></speech>

I am sorry I was not here for the start.  I could say I was caught in traffic but I was getting coffee so I might as well be honest.  Honesty is the best policy.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is welcome.  I thank him for appearing before the committee.  We have previously commented on the fact the Minister is not available but in the circumstances, and given the lateness of the time we adjourned last night, I will not go down that road.  We thank the Minister of State for being here and for outlining the Supplementary Estimates to us.  I have a number of questions which I will run through and ask him to reply to them together.  </p> <p>  In the briefing note, we have been given a rough breakdown of the &euro;529 million and how it is spent.  I am looking for a more definitive breakdown, specifically of the &euro;220 million that is spent in acute hospitals.  How much of that was spent on agency staff?  The focus is on the &euro;346 million in savings to be achieved.  I have questioned people from the HSE about this previously.  Where did the figure of &euro;346 million come from?  A formula must been used.  How was it calculated?  What research went into it?  How was that conclusion arrived at?  It was unrealistic and it was not reached.  It was missed by quite a long shot. Whatever planning went into it was not sufficient.  I am also curious to know - the HSE could not give me a definitive answer - where the figure came from.  We all heard the tapes of the fellas telling us where they got the figures for banking.  I sincerely hope these figures did not come from the same place.  Can the Minister of State indicate how the figure was arrived at?  </p> <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, informed us that overruns in health have averaged &euro;500 million per year in current spending terms and that, in 2018, the overrun would be &euro;600 million.  Is it not then the case that the health service has been underfunded to the tune of approximately &euro;500 million per year since 2014?  We cannot keep having overruns and Supplementary Estimates and get to the end of the year and say we are not being underfunded.  One does not need to be a mathematical genius to figure out that if we keep overrunning, we are being underfunded.  The IFAC stated that health budgets should be well-founded and credible.  It further stated that weak planning and spending controls account for the genesis of many of the problems.  I am interested to know how spending &euro;234 million so far this year - or &euro;866,792 per day - on agency staff fits into a well-founded or credible budget.  Similarly the council stated health overruns are being masked by unexpected corporation tax and interest.</p><p>The council also states that as the top ten companies account for roughly 40% of all corporation tax receipts, unexpected revenue from this source should be deemed to be transient.  We cannot rely on this revenue but it seems that we are relying on it.  With that in mind, I ask the Minister of State to outline the Department's view on its duty to fund health in a responsible manner.  If one ran one's house in this manner, one would find oneself in MABS.  This is no way to run a household budget, never mind a massive budget for a very high spending Department.  </p><p> Immediately after the budget last year I said, as did others, that not enough money was being given to the health service to allow it to even stand still.  The budget was inadequate in terms of current service levels.  We could talk all day about the inadequacy of current service levels but there was not enough money to even maintain them.  Weeks later, the then head of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, wrote to the Minister and said that the HSE was being under-funded for 2018 to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro and that has turned out to be the case.  I am no fortune teller because if I were, I would pick the lotto numbers and leave this House.  That said, I could see that the budget was inadequate and I pointed that out at the time.  A few months later, it was also pointed out by the director general of the HSE.  At what stage in the year did the Department become aware that the health service was under-funded?  The Department was not going to take my word for it but Mr. Tony O'Brien wrote to the Department about this.  It strikes me as odd that he would have to write such a letter and that the powers that be would not be fully apprised of the position and aware that there was going to be a shortfall.  I was not the only person who pointed it out but when I did so, I was dismissed.  I was right, however.  I will not say it gives me no pleasure to say that because we all love to be right but if I could see it and Mr. Tony O'Brien was flagging it, when did the Department become aware of it?  That is material to how we keep finding ourselves in the same position at the end of the year, every year.</p></speech>

She has raised a number of broad issues.  I am not sure if we have a figure for agency staff here but I will get it to the Deputy as soon as possible.  She asked a very direct question about how much we are still spending on agency staff.  I know that there has been some conversion this year on that but I will endeavour to get the exact figure for Deputy O'Reilly.</p> <p>  The Deputy makes a very valid point about the savings figure of &euro;346 million in terms of how it was calculated and the details of that.  What I am clearly saying is that the HSE did not achieve the targets set for it in terms of making savings across the three very important areas identified.  What is wrong here?  Is the issue the HSE's inability to achieve targets or is it that the targets set were unachievable?  That is the question the Deputy asks.</p></speech>

My memory of it is that the executive said it was given this target.  Someone should have sat down with the HSE to determine if the target was realistic, which we know now was not the case, and how the HSE was going to reach it.  Where was it going to find those savings?  It is not acceptable to just give the executive a savings target without figuring out how to help it to achieve it or even if the target is realistic.</p></speech>

She wants to know the origins of this figure, the basis for it and how it was calculated.  Someone must have seen it as an achievable target, based on some sums.  She wants to know what sums or calculations were done to generate this particular figure.  I will try to get to the bottom of that for her.</p> <p>  On the wider issue of trying to achieve savings, which ties in with the Deputy's next question as to whether HSE funding is sufficient, there is a constant ebb and flow and tension there.  As well as the highs and lows in economic terms, there is also an ebb and flow and tension that is necessary.  If we were to give the HSE another &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion, it would spend it.  In that context, we must try to push back and keep things as tight as we can.  It is possibly better to under-fund the executive to some extent because there can be no absolutes.  It is a demand led service, which is important to remember.  Nobody can-----</p></speech>

Deputy O'Reilly said that she does not have the power to tell fortunes or see the future and nobody on the other side of the House has that power either.  We cannot accurately predict how many people will present at accident and emergency departments or primary care facilities, how many people will require surgery and so on.  We cannot predict what new drugs will become available in any given year, how many people will require those drugs, whether they represent good value for money, what they will cost and so on.  There are lots of unknowns and variables from year to year in any health budget.  Ireland is not unique in that regard.</p> <p>  The demand led aspect of this makes it very difficult to quantify the budget required.  Something that may not be told as well as some of the other stories in the health service is the fact that there has been a significant increase in the amount of activity within the health service in recent years.  A very significant number of procedures have taken place and there have been enormous increases in day case activity and hospital admissions.  I know from my area that there has been a significant increase in the activity of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Approximately 26,000 people are being seen by CAMHS every year, which is a very significant increase.  The numbers waiting to be seen are continuing to increase but the full story must be told by pointing to the increased numbers of people who are being seen and treated.  That is where we get the real picture.  This is relevant to the issue of trolleys too.  I feel very strongly that the focus on trolleys is misguided.  It is so easy for politicians and those in the media to obsess about trolleys and trolley figures.  The real issues are how long people are waiting and delayed discharges.  We need to work on the numbers coming out of hospital and what is preventing them from being discharged.  For too long, we have been looking at how many people are blocked on the way in to hospital when the real focus should be on those whose discharge is delayed because of a lack of transitional care in the system.  </p> <p>  The Deputy's point about reliance on corporation tax belongs to a broader debate involving the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The issue is in the news again because there has been another unexpected increase in corporation tax receipts.  It is accepted by all Departments and the Government as a whole that corporation tax receipts can go up and down significantly.  We have seen that happen and will not be building in a reliance on such receipts.  I do not think there is a direct correlation between the funding of the HSE and the amount of corporation tax collected.  It just so happens that both are in the news at the moment.</p></speech>

Many other taxation sources will fund overruns in health.  That is the point I am making.  It is not only corporation tax.  My opinion on this matter is irrelevant because there are so many other tax heads contributing to the funding.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked about the Department approach to running a household budget.  This is the point I opened with.  It is a demand led service and it is difficult to quantify absolutely.  We cannot give too much to the health service.  If we do, it will overspend and over-utilise.  We must ensure there is tension if we are to get value for money.  It is the same with funding any demand led service.  We must have checks and balances, and that is difficult.  The difficulty is compounded with the highs and lows of economic activity.</p> <p>  The Department gets updates throughout the year from the HSE.  It is not at year-end when the Department becomes aware of the overruns.  It becomes aware during the year of the pressures and the likely pressures.  Many of them are projected and anticipated and efforts are made to avoid them.  We cannot be absolutely clear until later in the year.  In any event, the Department is engaging with the HSE from the start of the year to see that the executive is on target to meet spending targets.  That may answer the Deputy's question.  If there are any further questions, she should feel free to ask them.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned that he would provide me with some figures on agency spending.  He mentioned the issue of conversion.  When we had Mr. Stephen Mulvany from the HSE before the committee, we asked whether specific targets were set relating to the conversion of agency staff.  It appeared this was not the case.  I keep going back to the figure of &euro;346 million in savings.  Some of the savings relate to conversion from agency, which is highly expensive and a rather inefficient way to run the service.  Despite this, the Government is becoming more reliant on agency staff.  If there were no targets in place for the conversion of agency staff, then it would seem that no attempt had been made to control it.  HSE representatives have said to us that they try to convert from agency.  How can this be the case if no targets have been set?  Will the Minister of State give me some sense of how much of the &euro;220 million budget was spent on agency staff?  Of the &euro;346 million budget, how much was identified for conversion?</p> <p>  The Minister of State remarked on planning and the demand led nature of the service.  We have not had a major outbreak of disease.  There is nothing happening in the health service that could not have been predicted by looking at Central Statistics Office data.  We have an ageing population.  It is a good thing that people are living longer and are healthier.  There are no major unforeseen challenges.  The Minister of State mentioned the storm.  That was only a couple of days.  There was no major outbreak of disease.  There is no reason the Minister of State could not have looked at the CSO figures to enable him to plan ahead.</p></speech>

These include the outcome of the negotiations of the current general practitioner contract and the associated cost.  That is dependent on the outcome of the negotiations.  There are negotiations with drug companies as well.  There is a major cost in that area.  Another factor is whether a decision is taken or otherwise on pay increases.  A total of 32% of our staff are nurses.  If there was a Government decision taken tomorrow to give a pay increase, the HSE would not know in advance.</p> <p>  Several factors arise that cannot be anticipated simply by looking at the CSO figures.  It would be great if we lived in a world where we could identify all these things.  One of the major underlying challenges within the health system is the lack of an up-to-date information technology infrastructure to collect, share and analyse data.  Our structure is not fit for purpose when it comes to the planning to which the Deputy referred.  I imagine we would probably both agree on that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about agency staff.  I am not the financial officer within the HSE but I will ask the HSE's financial officer to give me a report on agency staff.  I will ask specifically that he address the question Deputy O'Reilly has asked about the HSE targets for conversion and how many have been achieved.  I suspect the HSE will not have the figures for me until the year end or that we will be unable to get a year-end figure for 2018, but I will ask specifically for that to be given to the Deputy early in the new year based on the year end conversion figures.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the announcements made.  I am keen to work with the Minister of State to ensure that what he said would happen will happen.  I am keen to put that on the record.</p> <p>  The Minister of State started by saying that health funding remains a major challenge.  I appreciate that but there seems to be a major lack of planning, especially with regard to winter cover - for want of a better term.  It is obvious that things will happen in the winter and the winter is not only December or Christmas anymore.  I find it difficult to get my head around why, year after year &ndash; this is my third winter as a Member of the Oireachtas &ndash; the Department does not seem to be able to get its act together.  I say as much with respect.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?</p> <p>  Anyone who is looking for more money needs to ensure we get value for that money.  Delayed discharges are a major problem.  There is nowhere for discharged patients to go and this needs to be addressed.  There is a lack of step-down beds and home care packages.  Delayed discharges are at the top of the cake.  We need to dig into the matter a little more.</p> <p>  Acute hospitals have exceeded their approved funding level.  Will the Minister of State expand on the reason this has happened?</p> <p>  I am keen for the Minister of State to comment on community services, especially in mental health.  I am still waiting for an answer to a question about Bantry and the psychiatric unit there.</p></speech>

What is the number of staff in the unit?  There is a lack of consultation rooms.  Is there a dietitian available?</p> <p>  Cross-border health care is crucial, but the HSE still has to pay.  There is a myth that this service is magic and free or else that Great Britain's health service is paying for it.  I am keen to highlight that we end up paying for it.  Will the Minister of State comment on why it is necessary for people to think they have to go up to the North when we end up paying for it anyway?  Why not do it here and make it more comfortable for people, especially those from west Cork who find it difficult to make the journey.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State comment on the primary care reimbursement scheme?  Have staffing levels have been increased?</p> <p>  People are still waiting for long periods under CervicalCheck, especially if their first test comes back as unclear.</p><p>I know of a few people in the constituency who have had to wait eight months because of an unclear result.  I would welcome the Minister of State's comments on that issue.</p></speech>

Her support for these initiatives is very much appreciated.  On winter planning, the Deputy asked the reason we need a winter plan given there is a winter, spring, summer and autumn every year, which is a fair point.  Notwithstanding that comment, there is a unique set of challenges that present during winter time and thus an onus on the Health Service Executive to be prepared for the acute peaks and troughs that occur during that time.  Challenges can become exacerbated during winter time.</p></speech>

A major outbreak of influenza coupled with a storm could have catastrophic implications in terms of people being able to access services, so there is need for forward planning each year.

As the Deputy will be aware, it brought services to a standstill although staff made incredible efforts to get to work.  I accept the Deputy's point but we must have contingency planning for particularly extreme events, which cannot be quantified year on year.</p> <p>  In regard to the flu vaccine for healthcare staff, there has been renewed effort this year to encourage staff to get this vaccine.  We cannot stress enough the importance of healthcare staff getting this vaccination, whether administrative, medical or catering staff.  It is very important that people who work in healthcare facilities get the flu vaccination.  When I was in New York recently I was told that healthcare staff there who have not had the flu vaccination must wear a mask on site.</p></speech>

A flu epidemic is especially problematic for elderly people in healthcare settings, whether acute hospitals or nursing homes.  A nursing home could have to send up to ten of its residents into an accident emergency department at the height of the Christmas period and during bad weather conditions.  Winter planning is important on many levels.  It provides an opportunity to reiterate some of the key messages, in particular the importance of the flu vaccine.  The Chairman will have heard about herd immunity.  The more healthcare staff who are vaccinated, the easier it will be to eliminate the possibility of the flu taking hold in a facility.  It is also important that the people who come into contact with them also get vaccinated.  These are all issues related to winter planning.</p> <p>  On value for money, we are all agreed that value for money has to be to the fore in terms of all that we do.  We cannot just give an additional &euro;20 billion to the health services next year such that all of its needs will be met because that provides no incentive to obtain value for money.</p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about delayed discharges, home help packages, step-down care and the need for approval of more home care packages.  She will be aware that we recently announced 550 intensive home care packages, which are separate and different from one hour's home help in the morning or the evening.  An intensive home care package facilitates people to leave hospitals.  I agree that all of the focus has been on the trolley counts undertaken by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, the HSE and so on.  Trolley counting is a waste of time.  I would have no difficulty with any of my loved ones having to wait in accident and emergency department for two hours for a bed.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Trolleys may not be comfortable but they are expensive.  What is important is that people are treated with dignity and respect.  However, if one of my loved ones was left waiting 19 hours for a bed when there were 20 empty beds in the hospital, I would have a difficulty with that.  Hospitals should be operating at capacity, within reason.  Two hours on a trolley should not be an issue but any longer than that is.  The length of time people spend on trolleys is important but I would argue that the focus should be not on the number of people on trolleys but the number of people in our hospitals who should not be there.  For a vulnerable older person to remain a day longer in an acute hospital than is necessary is dangerous.  Our focus needs to be on that issue rather on the trolley numbers.</p> <p>  On the Bantry hospital issue, I apologise to the Deputy that she did not get the information.  I did ask following the last committee meeting that it be sent to her.  I will follow up on the matter after this meeting.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  On the income shortfall, while I understand the unpredictability of income, it is possible to identify issues based on trends over the past four or five years.  To what extent has this been done?  Are the same issues arising repeatedly?  If so, how are they to be addressed because they are creating unease within the system, particularly for patients who need to access the system?</p> <p>  The issue of public hospitals versus private hospitals and the insurance shift was mentioned.  Perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on that issue.  It was mentioned that a public hospital receives a fee of &euro;80 per night up to a maximum of &euro;800 but this can drag on and become a larger amount.  While this can alleviate the burden on the private sector, it means the public sector is effectively subsidising the private wards.  I have no ideological views on this issue but if it is creating a problem in the funding for the public hospitals, then we need to examine it.  Now is as good a time as any to deal with this matter once and for all.</p> <p>  On the winter plan, much of what has been said today has been said before.  Every winter will test our resources.  I agree with the Minister of State's remark that the trolley count is becoming misleading and that the length of time one spends on a trolley is the critical issue.  It is better if everybody gets a trolley when they enter the accident and emergency department rather than being left in ambulances or at the doors of the hospitals.  The critical issue is the speed at which the patient is dealt with thereafter.  This is what we should be seeking to identify in future counts.  In the past, elderly people were left on trolleys for lengthy periods, which can cause considerable distress.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State will give us some idea of the extent to which we are keeping a tab on developments in that situation.</p><p> I may ask a further question in a minute.  I must get my functions together first.</p></speech>

He is aware of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  There is a wider issue of the use of public and private facilities.  On the question of health insurance, though, and as the Deputy will be aware, when people are admitted through an accident and emergency department, they can be admitted into either the public or private system.  They have been advised by their private health insurance companies to go through the public door.  That is perfectly legal under the Health Act 1970 and they are entitled to do that.  It is then an &euro;80 per night charge up to a maximum of &euro;800 for ten nights.</p> <p>  What were the Deputy's other questions?</p></speech>

He accepts that we should be more focused on the real challenge, that being, what is affecting capacity in our hospital groups and preventing the free movement of people in and out of hospital.  The Deputy was articulate in putting his point about the length of time spent on trolleys and that all of us should be damn glad to get onto a trolley straight away provided we are not left waiting, which is too often the case.</p> <p>  The Deputy made particular reference to older people.  That is a major challenge for us, as there are 1.4 million presentations to accident and emergency departments in a given year and people aged over 65 years amount to approximately 50% of that figure.  I hope I am right about that.  I met a group of consultant geriatricians in Cork recently and that was the figure they gave me.  Ensuring that older people in particular are not waiting unnecessary lengths of time to access acute healthcare is a challenge for us.</p> <p>  Was there another question?</p></speech>

The State Claims Agency seems to be increasing its demand as a percentage of the budget.  Will the Minister of State shed some light on the various issues covered?  Some of them come to mind readily, but to what extent has the Department examined where this is heading?  It looks to be heading in a burgeoning direction, for want of a better description, in the sense that it keeps popping up.</p></speech>

Under one, there are periodic payments so that settlements, especially large ones and compensation awarded in the courts, can be paid out over a period while keeping in mind the wishes of and best outcome for the plaintiffs.  It is hoped that that Act will steady the sharp increases.</p> <p>  It is worth noting that the number of claims is not a massive increase.  This is as much about the size of the awards made by courts in catastrophic injury cases.  There is a separation of powers between the Deputy and me as public representatives and the Judiciary, so we must be careful in discussing this, but it is a matter of fact that the size of the payments is causing the increase as opposed to their volume.  Focusing on just their volume would be too narrow a definition.</p> <p>  I have read the briefing notes and am trying to remember.  The second Act was the Mediation Act 2017, which was enacted in October 2017.  It was an effort to bring about mediation as an alternative to the costly expense and personal trauma of going through court.</p></speech>

I will ask him a few questions one at a time to give him an opportunity to answer.  What was done differently in 2018 than in 2017 to mitigate the overrun?  The 2017 overrun was &euro;200 million.  This year, it is &euro;700 million.  What was failed to be achieved in 2018?  Has there been a change in how the health service plan, which is yet to be published this year, is developed so that the overrun does not continue year on year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#G01200"><p>That is a good question and probably gets to the heart of the issue we are discussing today, namely, the difference in planning and implementation between the two years.  Separate issues can arise, but demand was the main issue.  There was an increase in demand.  Our ageing demographic increased pressure on our health services, which has shifted the overrun's dynamic.  Demand is increasing at a faster rate than we projected.  That is the first difference.</p> <p>  Individual issues arise.  For example, we must guesstimate how much our complex appropriations-in-aid payment arrangement with Britain regarding pensioners in Ireland will cost and then negotiate it down.  Incidentals arise every year.  Storm Emma and so on were of a smaller scale, but other incidentals can be much larger.  I referred to a number of headline issues, for example, primary care and high-tech drugs.  The largest increase in demand in 2017 was down to pay awards.  That arose as the economy recovered and do not arise every year.  They came off the back of a recession.  Our appropriations-in-aid were small.</p> <p>  As the Chairman will know, we are currently agreeing the service plan with the HSE.  There is a keen focus on every aspect of that plan so that we do not perpetuate this cycle of overruns year after year.  Even at this preparatory stage, we are trying to monitor expenditure with the HSE stringently so that the service plan can be on target and realistic, but there will always be "Events, dear boy, events" that are unforeseen and detract from the plan.  For example, this year saw the CervicalCheck issue.  Its cost would not have been that major, but there were cost runs in that of, I believe, &euro;4.6 million for general practitioners.  Small payments like that are not massive in the bigger scheme of things, but they take up a lot of attention and many staff are moved onto such issues.  We want to try to be readier for such developments next year so that there can be a more consistent and constant focus on the implementation of the service plan month after month and that we are coming in on budget.</p></speech>

At the end of the year, there is an expectation that, if the health service runs over budget by &euro;700 million, it will be met and carried over into the following year in the hope that, in the following year, the budget will come in on target, but it never happens.  That is down to weak planning.  What can be done to strengthen planning so that we can have an accurate estimate of the cost of the health service?</p></speech>

I am not a forensic accountant, which the Chairman appreciates, so I will not be able to answer as definitively as I would like.  In 2017, the overrun was much higher than the figure cited.  We are taking the &euro;139 million deficit from 2017 this year, but there was a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;200 million on top of that in 2017.</p> <p>  We could decide to provide &euro;300 million for unforeseen developments, but that would be absorbed by and used up in the day-to-day running of the HSE and none of it would be left by the end of the year.  It would be a blank cheque and could loosen the checks and balances on value for money.  Alternatively, more political decisions could be taken to do this or that or to make pay awards with the &euro;300 million.  Providing it in advance is difficult.  I am focusing on the macro, headline stuff instead of getting into the details with the Chairman.</p><p>That is one step that could be taken.  Then we just learn from the previous year and the anomalies that arose and try to use that in projecting as best we can for the year ahead.  There is an ebb and flow that will always have to be there and that tension between allowing an envelope, a little headroom, in the fiscal space and at the same time it being gobbled up by some demand-led service.</p></speech>

For instance, there was a shortfall of &euro;85 million in income from private insurance companies because they ran a campaign advising patients that they should not be admitted as private patients unless they felt there would be a benefit to them in a public hospital.  That is a substantial hole in a budget of &euro;85 million.  The Minister of State might speak about that first.  How can this hole be filled?  Sl&aacute;intecare speaks of removing private care from public hospitals.  There will be a hole of &euro;625 million or &euro;635 million if that were to happen over a period.  It is happening at present, however, because insurance companies are adopting a different policy in respect of their policyholders, advising them not to sign that they are private patients when going into public hospitals because they will probably get exactly the same treatment as a public patient.  Obviously, this will happen year on year, so how will it be addressed in this year's service plan?</p></speech>

It is certainly imminent.  It will address a number of issues on both sides.  There will be positives and negatives to it.  It would have been agreed or recognised by Sl&aacute;intecare as well.  There will be a financial implication.  How does one adjust for this?  First, one must not only project for it, but also try to balance that on the other side of the house.  This is why we introduced value improvement processes, VIPs, last year.  The Deputy was trying to get to the heart of our identification of that figure.  One can try to meet somewhere along the way there, and that will address some of it, but not all of it.  Increased funding is probably the main answer to the question of how will we address that shortfall of &euro;635 million as a result, if that is what it comes to be.  We will try to mitigate it.  I was recently in UCD for an event related to Lean Six Sigma, which is a very impressive initiative taking place in healthcare in association with academia whereby they are trying to identify cost savings.  This is an annual and ongoing challenge that we must embrace more and more, to try to do more with less, to lower the level of care.  Sending people into accident and emergency departments for everything under the sun is not the answer.  We need to try to change our processes and reduce costs by getting people treated at a lower level and so on.</p></speech>

How will this year's service plan start to reorient the service away from the expensive hospital system and towards the less expensive community care system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#H01100"><p>There are a number of points to make.  First, there is an increased focus on transitional care beds, that is, lower level step-down care.  We all know that the cost of keeping someone in an acute setting is anecdotally said to be in the region of &euro;7,000 a week, and in a community setting, a community hospital, about &euro;1,000 a week.  This is a matter of opening more transitional care beds.  Obviously, we are increasing capacity within the acute system simultaneously.  We are renegotiating the contract with the GPs.  We hope to have that completed by Christmas.  This is ambitious and there is no guarantee it will happen, but we are very confident.  A number of different measures will be involved in that which will move towards that Sl&aacute;intecare ideal of bringing more and more.</p> <p>  One of my hobby horses is telehealth, which I think offers enormous potential for bringing healthcare closer to the person using primary care in that the GP can access consultant guidance and advice and cover there and then from the primary care centre.  I am concentrating more on mental health on my side of things with telepsychiatry, whereby we do not have to have a consultant psychiatrist on site at every emergency department, ED, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  We can have provided by telehealth one person in a hub providing consultant psychiatry to six or seven sites in a 24-hour period.</p> <p>  There are many different strands to this that will be dealt with, and this will be led out by Laura Magahy.  There is about &euro;20 million, I think, to drive this forward.  I see the argument made on Twitter and such places that we only allocated &euro;20 million for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare this year, but Sl&aacute;intecare is a policy implementation, a shift in practice and so on.  It does not require that kind of massive &euro;2 billion funding straight up.  As one lessens the level of complexity and lowers the level of access for people and brings care to them closest to their homes, one can avoid an awful lot of the very expensive, reactive, acute-led medical care that has evolved in the country.  Everyone recognises the current system's dysfunctionality.  I think everyone understands and accepts the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare and agrees that it is the way forward.  However, there will be many steps along the way to reorienting a ship the size of the HSE, and a number of those will begin in the year ahead.</p></speech>

I may ask a couple of questions that were asked before.  Before I go into the budgetary allocations, the Minister of State raised the issue of telehealth.  What regulations is the Department preparing to oversee the roll-out of telehealthcare?  We had the Minister for Health before us in recent weeks and, as we know, in an Irish context, there are no such regulations.  There have been criticisms from the Care Quality Commission in the UK about some of the dangers of telemedicine such as the development of inappropriate prescribing and the lack of part of the clinical examination that occurs.  What regulations are being developed to match the Department's ambition with telemedicine?</p></speech>

Telehealth is a very interesting debate.  In essence, telehealth does not require a whole lot of additional regulation.  Telehealth is just a platform.  It is not a new way of doing medicine.  It is a screen-to-screen communication tool.  At the other end of the screen is a fully regulated doctor or consultant.  I refer to the example in my area of consultant psychiatry.  I want to deliver consultant psychiatry from a hub in Dublin, or it could be Cork, Limerick or anywhere else, whereby there would be one room with a consultant psychiatrist inside, and instead of having to be physically present in the Limerick, Cork, Tralee or Clonmel ED or any other hospital ED, whether in Naas General Hospital or wherever else, he could cover five or six of these sites from the one hub.  What one needs is technology at both ends in order that when my 14 year old son presents at an accident and emergency unit in a state of psychosis at 2 a.m., instead of telling us no consultant psychiatrist is available until 9 a.m., they will turn on a screen in front of him and there will be a consultant psychiatrist who will speak to my son and can assess him, diagnose him, prescribe medication and, if necessary, admit him to an adolescent unit.</p></speech>

I have had numerous engagements with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and it is very enthusiastic about and supportive of this development.  I held a national conference in the National Convention Centre Dublin and brought over clinicians who are doing this in the United States, Australia and so on to speak to the Irish clinicians.  The day was deemed to be an unqualified success from the clinicians' point of view because they learned about this new way of doing things and we challenged all the challenges and asked all the questions of the clinicians, the practitioners and the managers of the health service.  There were 200 or 300 people there.  They questioned all these people and got to the bottom of the matter.  There is no need for us to reinvent a wheel that is already moving.  I was doing this 20 years ago in education when I was a schoolteacher in Leap in west Cork.  We were giving special needs teaching out to islands through technology rather than the special needs teacher having to leave the Leap school, go out to Baltimore and get on a boat or whatever.  This is bringing healthcare 20 years on.  It is a platform, and I know Deputy Chambers' concern is videoDoc and the prescription-----</p></speech>

As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Daly's priority should be ensuring the Department fills the recruitment gaps in our hospital system and that we do not replace or dilute proper care provision in our acute hospital system.  He mentions not having to have a consultant on site 24-7.  They are not there anyway, but we should not dilute proper care provision and proper appointments for something that is not the same.  No matter what, face-to-face will beat telemedicine.</p><p>We should not have a policy of diluting the quality of care.  If one were to ask any 14 year old, he or she would prefer for there to be a team to assess him or her when he or she presents on an acute basis than to be handed a video screen or something like that.  While it is fine to develop a process of telemedicine, it is important we do not replace a proper recruitment provision in our acute hospital system.  Currently, many children who present at hospitals at, say, 2 a.m. must be admitted to adult beds and they are not seen by paediatric psychiatrists.  We should not encourage child and adolescent psychiatrists to work for six hospitals.  Rather, we should fill the recruitment gab.  It is a failure of Government policy on recruitment, retention and pay.  I would not like to see dilution and gaps in recruitment.  While it is fine to develop something different, it should not replace proper, direct care, that is, seeing the doctor at the hospital interface.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#J00200"><p>That was a lengthy and substantial contribution and, therefore, I must respond.  I could not disagree more with the Deputy.</p> <p>  It is a fact that there is a worldwide shortage of consultant psychiatrists.  We are short 60 of them in Ireland.  I cannot make two out of any one consultant, no matter how hard I try.  I can try breeding them or cloning them but I cannot make two out of one.  All the Government policy, pay and everything else will not make two out of one when there is a worldwide shortage experienced by the United States, Australia and elsewhere.  In those places and the rest of the modern world, they have caught up with technology to use it effectively.  There are now so many consultant specialties.  Time was when there was just a consultant psychiatrist, but now there are consultant psychiatrists for adults and for children, as well as consultant psychiatrists with a specialty in anxiety or in eating disorders for children and for adults, but there are not enough of them because people are presenting in their droves.  </p> <p>  Technology is merely a platform.  If there is a consultant on that screen, and if that consultant is fully trained, qualified and accredited and so on, the level of service to the child is not being diluted.  As a parent, if I went to Cork University Hospital at 2 a.m. tomorrow and was told there was no consultant psychiatrist available until 9 a.m., but if there was a remote consultant psychiatrist who was immediately available, qualified, could speak to the child, assess, diagnose, prescribe and admit if necessary, which would I prefer?  Would I prefer my child to be in a state of psychosis in accident and emergency services, with the craziness of it from 2 a.m. until 9 a.m.?  I would happily accept the screen psychiatrist.  </p> <p>  It has been proven that children with autism are more comfortable using a screen, although I am not suggesting that a screen is superior to face to face.  Rather, in a situation where there is a vacuum of 60 consultant psychiatrists in Ireland, I have two options.  I can continue to do what I always did but, as the Chairman noted, if we always do what we always did, we will always get what we always got.  I can answer parliamentary question after parliamentary question to say we have recruitment and retention challenges.  On the other hand, as Minister of State, I can accept my responsibility, step up to the plate and consider a new and alternative way of operating.  It does not make sense to have a consultant psychiatrist sitting for 24 hours a day in the accident and emergency department if there are only two presentations for him or her in that period.  We have to be real about what we do.  This is not to replace human beings.  </p> <p>  There is a vacancy in Wexford, where a consultant psychiatrist left his post in a high-profile manner.  A consultant from Galway visits Wexford every weekend to deliver clinics for children and adolescents, for which she travels a seven-hour journey in total.  I could remove those seven hours in the morning by providing a screen and she would not have to leave Galway because she could assess her patients there with a team which is not remote.  When one presents at accident and emergency services, there are doctors, registered general nurses and a whole team of medics.  The consultant psychiatrist will be part of that team but will not be physically present, and the input will be via a screen to make more available this precious resource that is not as widely accessible as we would like.  </p> <p>  It is the same with the consultant in Galway who requires a full child and adolescent mental health services team.  As the Deputy will know, it is a multi-disciplinary team with eight or nine professionals, but they are led by a consultant psychiatrist.  When a consultant psychiatrist leaves, we do not want that team to be paralysed.  A consultant psychiatrist from another area will be able to use technology, discuss the cases and the caseload, and give advice to the psychologist, the occupational therapist and so on.</p></speech>

I still believe that face-to-face assessment is better for a 14 year old in the circumstances the Minister of State outlined.  I am not sure how the full criteria can be met according to international guidelines, in the light of the information and communication technology guidelines, the mini-mental State examination and the whole process of examination.  While there might be advances in this regard, and while a platform can be built and it is fine to have a vision, if we are to reflect the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of healthcare in Ireland, the focus should be on replacing the posts rather than on what the Government is doing, namely, replacing proper recruitment with telepsychiatry.</p> <p>  In his statement, the Minister of State did not mention the elephant in the room, which is the 80% rise in management spending in the HSE in the past five years.  In 2012, there were 744 employees at grade VIII but there are now nearly 1,400.  What are the Minister of State and the Department doing to address the continuous growth?  Every year it seems the first task of the HSE and the Department is to fill the management positions for people at middle and senior levels and there is a merry-go-round of filling the vacant positions.  The reality of healthcare in Ireland is one of constant spending and bloating.  The front-line workers, whether they be doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals or even secretarial and clerical staff, are the ones at the coalface who are told they must manage and continue as they are if someone leaves.  The bloated top, however, continues to grow.  </p> <p>  I recognise that Deputy Jim Daly has had responsibility in the Department for only two years but, as a Minister of State, he has a duty of oversight to say "Stop."  What is he doing as part of the budgetary allocations to stop the continuous bloating in healthcare organisations, which frustrates everyone on the front line, and the growth in figures?  Even at the peak of the recession, people continued to be promoted to more senior positions and their own positions were filled.  It continues to become more top heavy.  If we are to grapple with difficult budgetary allocations, it needs to happen at all layers and levels, and management is an important issue.  </p> <p>  We know from representatives from the HSE appearing before the committee that nobody takes responsibility.  There are many managers in many different areas but the buck stops with nobody and they do not meet any of their targets or outcomes every year.  For the acute hospital budget, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that hundreds of millions of euro was allocated but there was no indication of the output or the service-level improvement, and there are more managers managing that budget every year.</p> <p>  What is the Department planning with the HSE to address the continued bloating?</p></speech>

I am not a spokesperson for the HSE.  I have a responsibility within the Department that oversees the work of the HSE, but the HSE is better able to answer these questions itself.  I intend, therefore, to give a broader context.</p> <p>  Politicians like to make the popular point that there are many managers in the HSE, that they are all fat cats with massive salaries who promote themselves and so on.  As politicians, we have accountability and responsibility.  We demand accountability, and we want answers for tens of thousands of parliamentary questions that are tabled every day.  The last Deputy that raised this issue with me on the floor of the D&aacute;il is probably one of the Deputies who table the most parliamentary questions on the HSE.  We cannot, however, have it both ways.  We cannot expect such accountability, demand we get all the answers and expect a team of those responsible to appear before us on every issue that arises on the 9 o'clock news that night.  We submit thousands of parliamentary questions and we make representations in their tens of thousands.  Somebody somewhere must deal with them but they are not dealt with by nurses, doctors or front-line staff.</p><p>Those issues are the responsibility of HSE management.  There was a pause on recruitment to managerial positions within the HSE during the recession unless absolutely necessary.</p></speech>

During the very difficult years of the recession, the Government of the time did everything it could to continue the recruitment of front-line staff but there was a pause in recruitment to management positions.  We are now catching up in that regard.  The figures indicate an increase in recruitment.  As I stated, the percentage of managers in the HSE is comparable to that in similar organisations internationally and those data are available for anyone who is interested.  One should consider the hard data and the broader picture rather than taking populist and opportunistic political cheap shots.  I am not unduly concerned on this issue.  I am entitled to my opinion.  As a Minister of State at the Department, I have no vested interest in protecting the HSE which is well able to answer for itself.  However, I am not concerned on this issue.</p></speech>

In fact, the bureaucracy inhibits their delivery of services because the amount of work which they must do to comply with the increasing bureaucracy required takes them away from their patients.  There is evidence from front-line staff that the managerial system is overburdensome and is interfering with the delivery of service.  It may be a political point but it is also a very practical point being made by front-line staff that there is a profusion of management which is interfering with rather than enhancing the delivery of service.</p></speech>

I am trying to broaden how we view and narrate this issue.  The political side of the issue regards how it is narrated in terms of the organisation being bloated and mangers being overpaid and so on.  I accept that HSE management is overly bureaucratic but that is being driven by politicians and the courts.  Reference was made to the level of awards.  The layers of bureaucracy also result from the demand for accountability, as well as European directives and so on.  There is not a culture within the HSE of seeking to create layers of bureaucracy to make life difficult for everybody.  Court cases and demands for accountability by the Committee of Public Accounts or through parliamentary questions result in further layers of bureaucracy.  We cannot have it both ways.  We must accept that those factors are driving the bureaucracy.  The parliamentary affairs division of the HSE is responsible for a significant volume of work, while a large number of staff in the Department are dedicated to dealing with queries from Members of the Oireachtas.  Do we want that level of accountability or not?  These are factors in the debate.  I am not putting forward a blanket defence of HSE management but we must accept there is another side to the issue.</p></speech>

As I have stated on many occasions, the HSE is not the appropriate structure to deliver health services in this country.  The sooner we return to regionalisation, as proposed in part under Sl&aacute;intecare, the better.  However, there are issues to be addressed.</p> <p>  I do not accept the notion implicit in the comments of the Minister of State that politicians asking too many questions is slowing down the system and costing a lot of money.  That is rubbish.  It costs no more to answer a question quickly than it does to answer it slowly.  In fact, the reverse is the case.  To answer it slowly could cost up to ten times as much.  People afraid of certain questions being asked are hiding behind claims that the questions cannot be answered.</p> <p>  How does the system work?  Is it working?  I do not think it is.  It should be simple to transfer a seriously ill patient from one hospital to another, but there are major difficulties in that regard.  Last summer I became involved in the case of a patient with private health insurance of whom a transfer was sought.  I thought the public sector would be delighted to take a patient with private heath insurance and so on, but that was not the case.  There was a shortage of beds.  The hospital had only a couple of vacant beds and they were reserved for emergencies.  The man was in a coma.  The hospital staff were asked whether his case would be considered an emergency.  We should find out what is slowing down the system and why it is not functioning as it ought.  Henry Ford devised a system that was far more efficient than others in operation at the time and produced better goods more quickly, cheaply, and effectively.  I do not suggest that we do things on the cheap, but we can do them far better and more quickly, effectively and efficiently than is currently the case.</p> <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is a means of removing patients from the most sensitive areas of our waiting lists.  The treatments must be paid for one way or another.  If it cannot be done in one system, let us do it in another system, whether that be inside or outside the system or country.  There should be an inevitability about treatment being provided.  If it cannot be provided within the public system, we should get somebody else to provide it.  The waiting lists are not a reflection on the present or previous Government.  Lengthy waiting lists have been common for many years.   Patients may unnecessarily wait up to ten years in excruciating pain for a hip replacement.  They are told to go to their GP and get more painkillers.  That is wasting money.  The way to use the time effectively is to go to the centre of the issue and deal with it.</p> <p>  I am a little concerned by the issue of the State Claims Agency and the increase in costs to which reference was made.  What is the reason for the increasing demand in that regard?  Is it a change in culture or is the State exposed to a greater number of claims arising from the delivery or non-delivery of services?  I will not go into the issue of unqualified medical personnel who infiltrated the system as that was addressed at a previous meeting.  The existence of such issues causes me considerable concern.</p></speech>

I am merely contributing another angle in the interests of the debate.  Of course, I have no difficulty with people holding the HSE to account and questioning it, but we must be aware of the other sides of the issue.  I want the accountability and transparency to continue.  The HSE should not be given a blank cheque to employ as many managers as it wishes.  I agree with many of the points made by Deputy Durkan but I must put the issue in context and broaden the debate somewhat.</p><p>It is not in the interests of winning or losing, or scoring points, or politics, or having to be defensive as a Minister of State.  I have no issue with taking challenges head on.</p><p> Deputy Durkan talks about the style of management within the HSE and if one considers how the private hospitals are run, some of them are run without the layers of management.  I think the Chair wants to make the same point.  There is no question that the private hospitals do not have the levels of management that are present in the public hospitals.  The efficiency of the private hospitals is probably much more impressive, in many cases, than in the public hospitals.  The private hospitals do not face the kind of issues that public hospitals face.  They probably do not have the same level of union issues.  They do not have issues of public accountability and do not have to come before the Department, or other organisations, or prepare parliamentary questions.  They do not have to deal with freedom of information requests and media queries to the same extent that the public hospitals do.  There is an element of that.  I am just saying that by way of contribution to the debate rather than defending what is happening. </p><p> Many people in the Chamber would be vehemently opposed to any further privatisation of health services and their ideological position would be that that is not the way to go.  There is a debate all around as to whether public or private is better.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the purchasing power the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has been given and its increasing power to purchase.  As we are aware, much of that is within the system itself.  It is identifying where there is capacity and moving funds around a bit.</p><p> What was Deputy Durkan's last point?</p></speech>

There was a reference made following an investigation recently about the chain of command.  How is the chain of command operating?  I do not think it is operating at all and I do not think it has for many years, certainly since the health boards and regionalisation disappeared.  There appears to be an amorphous mass somewhere in the centre, a hazy, foggy, no-go area full of pitfalls and traps and all sorts of things where nobody seems to go.  The Minister of State is hinting that everybody is afraid of something.  What are they afraid of?  There would be nothing to be afraid of if the system was working properly.  If everything is done in accordance with the rules, fine, although accidents will still happen.</p> <p>  I mentioned the various causes of claims.  The size and severity of the claims is one thing, but the reason for the claims is another.  I have dealt with a couple of cases recently where there was a clear indication to me that some things that should have been done were not done and patients suffered as a result.  There was a reluctance to admit it, even though full disclosure is supposed to be in operation.  What does one do?  I would have thought that, in such a situation, management would make a tentative offer without prejudice, or whatever the case may be.  None of those things happened.  Cases go to court and eventually, on the steps of the court, somebody decides to settle.  That is not the way to do business.</p></speech>

I remember, as a backbench Deputy in the last D&aacute;il, tabling parliamentary questions on the issue of the number of claims.  I thought, from looking at headlines in the newspapers in 2014 and 2015, that there had been a massive increase in the number but there has not been such an increase.  I do not have the latest figures for 2017 and 2018 but, back in 2015 and 2016, there was no massive increase in the amount of claims.  There has been a cultural shift towards open disclosure and we are trying to get people in and deal with that legislatively in order that people will admit and own up to their mistakes and acknowledge and inform the victims.  The aim of the Mediation Act is to avoid the courts.  There are also periodic payments to try to stagger large payments so they are not all done at the same time.</p><p>While we need to reduce the amount of claims, there is an increase in the number of procedures taking place in our hospitals.  I do not know the quantity of the <i>pro rata</i>increase because I have not seen the figures for 2017 and 2018.  I suspect there was a <i>pro rata</i>increase in the amount of claims.  I hope not but is it potentially the case.</p><p>The establishment of the HSE board will be a positive step towards the oversight of management, holding it to account and ensuring it is not overly bloated.  A good, effective board that will challenge the top layer of management of the HSE will be a positive step that will be established in the new year.  The four of us here all agree that the levels of management within the HSE need to be challenged, held to account and open to scrutiny.</p></speech>

The overrun in the various regions ranges from &euro;86 million to &euro;118 million.  The Minister of State has spoken about the causes of these overruns.  It is a demand-led service and there is an unpredictability about various flu epidemics, storms and snowstorms etc.  I put it to the Minister of State that there is a predictability to health.  For instance, 3,500 people will fall and break a hip every year.  It might be 3,400 one year and 3,600 the following year, but there is a predictability about it.  There is a predictability about how patients suffering from many chronic illnesses will present to hospital.  There is also a predictability about the aging process.  We know that 20,000 people per year go over the age of 65.  The aging population is increasing.  The population over 85 will double in the next number of years.  These are all predictable, actuarial events.</p></speech>

That is the issue.  Each year, the prediction of that variability is off by &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million.  We are spending as much money as the average country in the OECD on health but we are getting substantially poorer outcomes.  Continuing to do what we are doing, as I said before, is not giving better results.  The change that I am trying to get out of the Minister of State, or the idea I am trying to feed him, is that there are efficiencies to be gained by integrating our services.  Our services are not integrated and, because of that, there is a lack of efficiency and value for money.  Sl&aacute;intecare is proposing a huge level of integration.  The first part is integrating hospital groups and community healthcare organisations into a single budget.  That would drive efficiencies in hospital admissions and discharges in transferring care to the community.  Can the Minister of State state that this move will take place in the coming year to bring about that change in efficiency?  We can keep throwing money at the health system but, if it is inefficient, it will not deliver value for money.  The only way to deliver value for money is to have integrated services which, by definition, will bring efficiency.  Perhaps the Minister of State might comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018120500002#L00900"><p>I cannot definitively say that those efficiencies will be brought about in the year ahead.  I can definitively say there will be a relentless focus on bringing those efficiencies about.  We have a very dysfunctional architecture underpinning our health system and the committee is aware of many of those issues.  Integration is key to achieving a more cohesive and coherent health service delivery that works for people.</p> <p>  Someone came to my constituency office a number of weeks ago.  They had been in Germany and showed me the new card used there, the equivalent of a driving licence, with a little gold thing in the middle that is the health record for patients.  Every interaction a patient has had with the health service since the day he or she was born is recorded on that one little card.  We have nothing like that in Ireland.  If I go into SouthDoc, then to an accident and emergency department, into acute treatment and back to transitional care, there is shifting of files and paperwork generated and there is a lack of joined-up awareness for prescribing.  I can be prescribed the same thing twice or three times.  Anomalies arise in the system because of the infrastructure and that is the biggest challenge that I see and I have no monopoly on wisdom on this issue.</p><p>My perspective, as the Minister of State at the Department of Health, is to get the IT infrastructure up to scratch and if we can do that, then we can have the integration.  It is very difficult to achieve the level of integration desired.  Each person has a unique perspective and we want an IT system that will facilitate that.  I see that as the single greatest challenge and we must have a relentless focus on trying to get that together.  One can achieve so much more with data and information sharing and when everyone can speak to each other from a clinical, medical and management point of view.  The information we as parliamentarians seek in order to hold the service to account will be so much more seamless if the IT infrastructure is put in place.  That is the single biggest challenge.  While I cannot state we will achieve that in the year ahead, there will be a relentless focus on it.  We have received &euro;250 million from the European Investment Bank with a view to providing the infrastructure to establish the European electronic health record.  That will assist us in taking a significant step towards achieving that but there are many IT challenges in the system.</p><p> Currently, integration is ongoing to align the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and the hospital networks.  That will make for improved information gathering, sharing and the provision of health service delivery.  Such interaction between CHOs and acute hospitals is crucial to deal with an issue I am very animated about, namely, late discharges.  The required level of interaction does not exist currently and never the twain shall meet.  They are two separate domains and it is very difficult to try to get them to join up.  Thanks to Sl&aacute;intecare we are very good at recognising and distilling down the key challenges, as well as the optimum ones from which we will get the best results.  We must now move Sl&aacute;intecare along its journey.</p></speech>

Has that capital allocation for that changed in the Estimates?</p> <p>  On one level of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, the Minister of State has said there will be a complete split between public and private care, but on another level he has said there will be a problem in terms of a shortfall.  There seems to be a perverse incentive whereby public hospitals are reliant on the private income which they are due to lose, but the Government's policy is to remove the private income.  What is the weaning phase and the plan for private care in public hospitals under the Sl&aacute;intecare plan?  The Department's position is that there is reliance on private income for public hospitals but then the ambitions for Sl&aacute;intecare will not be achieved.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the Minister of State in that regard.</p> <p>  I respect the fact the Minister of State wants to give a position in terms of management, but instead of saying it is an old political chestnut and an opportunistic comment he should acknowledge there is a problem.  The Chairman mentioned it.  Everyone working in healthcare gives feedback to us, and I am sure to the Minister of State, that there is an issue.  In OECD terms we have one of the highest spends but our level of front-line output is probably below average.  We have a mismatch and it is not due to a lack of investment or will on behalf of the Minister of State.  We have a lot of people in management that are not managing the budgetary allocation.  As Deputy Durkan mentioned, while the Minister of State talks about accountability and transparency, we are not getting accountability from anyone.  We cannot even identify who the managers are and how they are matching their targets because there are so many of them.  If eight people are responsible for a particular segment of a care pathway or delivery in a particular hospital, they are not accountable.  What tends to happen is that people get promoted out of their positions and they are rewarded for not necessarily delivering on their own service plans within the healthcare system.  Anyone in the Department, including the Minister of State, needs to build that into the promotion system for managers.  I am trying to be constructive.  I am not trying to raise an old political chestnut.  This is a significant issue and we will never have any progress in Sl&aacute;intecare if we continue to allow the layers of management to grow.  It is not the fault of the Government.  The system has been in place for 20 years.  All parties have had an input into the Department in those years.  I do not lay the blame at the door of the Minister of State but, politically, we need to grapple with it.  Hospital groups were created in recent years and there was a change in Government policy to get rid of them and to replace them with a Sl&aacute;intecare structure.  We have spent a number of years layering up hospital groups and now we are transitioning into another structure.  I am concerned that we are going to add additional layers because that is always a risk when an organisation transitions.  That is the lesson from the HSE.  The layers grew when we went from having health boards to the HSE.  I hope that we have learnt the lessons from that.</p></speech>

He asked about the children's hospital.  As the capital plan has not been agreed yet for this year, I do not have the updated figure or whether there is a projected overrun on the cost of the children's hospital.  I will get the information for the Deputy.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the complete split between public and private health care.  That is the subject of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, which is expected to be provided to the Minister imminently.  I cannot answer the question definitively as to what we will do to separate public healthcare from private healthcare until we get the report.  The details in the report will be used as a roadmap to achieve that end.  There will be cost implications that we will have to handle in that regard.  I cannot say any more until we get the report.</p> <p>  I am not trying to be provocative.  Anybody who knows me knows I am one of the least partisan.  When I talk about politics being opportunistic, I talk about myself and my party as much as anybody else.  I was not trying to be provocative and I apologise if that is the way it came across.  Sometimes, when people talk about the health service, whether it is at the pub counter or outside the church at mass, the blame tends to be laid at the door of the managers.  It is a simplistic solution to suggest that if management was addressed that we would have a great health service.  The point I was trying to make is that balance is required in the debate, but that does not take from what Deputy Chambers said.  My point is halving the number of managers in the morning would not be a silver bullet.  I am not sure that we would be much further advanced if that were to happen.</p> <p>  To clarify, we do not intend to change the hospital groups as part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Chairman can confirm if I am correct in that regard.</p></speech>

There has been a substantial increase in the cost of the treatment abroad scheme.  Many people are going to Belfast and people are also going to England and other places.  Could the Minister of State talk us through that?  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is providing services outside the public system for public patients and the treatment abroad scheme is providing services for public patients outside of the jurisdiction.  What is the overall cost of the combined schemes for the year 2018?</p></speech>

It is a question of awareness.</p><p>They were not aware for a long time that they could travel to another EU state, not just Belfast.  They could go to Spain in the morning to have their hips done and perhaps avail of better sunshine during their recovery.  That is a prospect for people.  </p><p> People can come to Ireland as well to avail of healthcare.  There are different specialties and waiting lists.  Some countries have more capacity in their systems for some procedures and limited capacity for others.  We have capacity in some areas and lack it in others.  We are all aware of the areas where there is a lack of capacity.  They are well highlighted.</p><p> Irish healthcare is much sought after.  I spoke to the head of the police force in Dubai 12 months ago and he wants to do a deal with private healthcare in Ireland for coronary care because the Dubai police force believes the best cardiac care in the world is available in Ireland.  </p><p> The Belfast issue is primarily the increase because people are availing of it.  The Government is still paying for it.  It is a capacity issue. </p></speech>

The Government and the taxpayer are still paying for these procedures to be carried out, whether in Belfast or in Dublin.  It is a question of capacity.

It is substantially cheaper to do it in the GP setting but that never happens.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly mentioned that the &euro;700 million supplementary budget this year for the HSE was undoubtedly made possible by the windfall in corporation tax.  If we are to depend on a windfall in corporation tax every year to bail out the health service, sooner or later that windfall will not happen.  It is almost like depending on stamp duty, as we did in the boom times, to supply services.  We are now depending on corporation tax, which is based on a few American companies operating in Ireland, and if Donald Trump were to change his policy in the morning, that could substantially change our income from corporation tax.  While it goes into the general taxation pool, it almost mirrored the amount required to bail out the health service this year.</p></speech>

The more substantive issue is that we have an overrun in the health service this year of &euro;700 million.  Whether it is being funded by a windfall in that regard or is the result of an increase in another tax, it is probably more important that it is there.  My fear is that our focus will shift to the source of it when we should have a relentless focus on why there is an overrun of &euro;700 million.</p></speech>

In other countries, that is done in the community.  Generally the people on Warfarin are older and are more susceptible to illness.  According to the latest figures, people aged over 70 were the main unscheduled presentations in emergency departments.  If older people who are susceptible to illness are constantly exposed to the hazards of an acute hospital, it is only natural that they are they will be sicker.  There can be efficiencies built in with Warfarin as for haemochromotosis.  Giving the flu vaccine in pharmacies worked well.  I was among the first tranche of pharmacists doing that eight or nine years ago.  The morning after pill has worked and any interventions the Chairman and the Minister of State have made to make it available at the weekend have worked.  We have evidence that when initiatives are moved into the community, they can be more efficient in themselves but also reduce burden of disease as well.</p> <p>  A major reason for admissions to nursing homes and hospitals is polypharmacy, incorrect prescriptions and errors.  There is an incentive for pharmacists in the UK whereby if they make an intervention in a prescription, for example, bringing 12 meds down to six without interfering with doctor's orders, they get something like &pound;5.</p><p>It is not very much, but there is an amount available to make it worth one's while to do the paperwork.  That kind of approach has to be considered.  Sl&aacute;intecare is all about moving from acute care to primary care.  However, looking at the big picture, what is being done?  The money will run out and services will be cut in the future if they are not bedded down into the community with other people taking responsibility for them.  </p><p> I am particularly concerned about those aged over 70 in the winter months.  I do not see any major interventions to try and prevent them from requiring accident and emergency services.  There have been proposals, but perhaps the Minister of State could outline the interventions that have been taken.  Accident and emergency services are not necessarily the right services for those elderly people.</p></speech>

Whether seeking efficiencies, better outcomes or an increase in the number of people being treated, the answer lies in community-led services.  Interesting initiatives, such as that for pharmacies, provide normal rather than distorted incentives for good, common efficiencies in the prescribing and administration of drugs.  There is a significant issue of older people taking too many drugs or taking the wrong drugs.  There have been problems with poly-prescribing, where different sources prescribe different drugs for the same issue.  We should streamline that, which would lead to better outcomes for older people.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about initiatives for older people this winter.  The winter initiative has older people at its heart.  We are trying to provide local clinics and extending GP hours.  The Minister has spoken about this regularly in the past couple of weeks.  The measures are being taken with a view to helping older and more vulnerable people.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the flu vaccine.  I also spoke about it earlier in the debate.  We have to make sure more health workers are taking the vaccine to prevent outbreaks.  I referenced the fact that in some hospitals in New York, healthcare workers at any level who have not had the flu vaccine have to wear a mask when coming into contact with older people in an acute hospital setting.  We are also increasing home care packages.  The Deputy will be aware of the announcement that we have added a further 550 intensive care packages.  We are also examining the problem of late discharges and will take initiatives in that area, including a public communications policy which will advise people, in particular, older people, that the least safe place to be when one does not have to be there is an acute hospital setting.  That is a challenge to normal thinking and is a culture shock to some people, but we must raise awareness of the fact.  There are many hospital-acquired infections with which one might come into contact to which older and more vulnerable people can be susceptible.  Most of us think that the best and safest place for our loved ones aged over 70 is in a hospital.  We are about to start a communications policy advising that it is not; if one does not need to be there, it is the least safe place.  We are also taking other initiatives which seek to prevent people from having to go to accident and emergency services.  We are working with Nursing Homes Ireland to try to build awareness about nursing homes.  Admissions to accident and emergency services should be a last resort and should not be the first option people take, given that it is not the safest place to be unless one absolutely has to be there.  </p></speech>

I have repeatedly made the point that the current allocation model of home help hours is unsustainable.  The Chairman, as a politician and a practising doctor, will be aware that we face a number of challenges in the area.  We do not have the people to deliver the scheme.  We have undertaken to prepare a scheme, which will be underpinned by statute and which will be delivered like the fair deal scheme, where everyone looking for access to it will get it and will be fully funded.  However, we also need staff.  There is a lot of work going on in the background to ensure we meet the terms and conditions necessary for such a scheme.  We also need to reduce reliance on home help as it is in its current form, where it is being delivered eight miles north and south, and provide more options for people so that they can age in a better and more suitable environment, such as supported retirement villages.  This would reduce the drain on home help hours massively and provide a much more enhanced level of care for people.  The Chairman will be aware that the success of Kilmaley retirment village is one of the motivating drivers.</p></speech>

It is denied by some people within the health services that we pay on par with the highest paying countries in the OECD but we do not receive equivalent service.  Is there any way we can identify why that is?  We have spoken about inefficiencies and duplications; I believe that is part of our problem.</p></speech>

The Deputy could read the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which goes a long way towards answering the question.  It identifies the steps towards addressing the problem, and shows how we can spend the same amount but achieve much better outcomes.  Essentially we are dealing with an infrastructure which was designed long ago and which is not fit for purpose any more, as I referred to earlier.  That is true in respect of the design of the administrative aspect of the HSE and how it was set up initially, and the lack of IT and lack of investment in infrastructure over the years.  Capacity is an issue that countries with a similar population do not have.  We face severe capacity issues in our acute and community settings, and are trying to reorient services back towards the community from the acute setting in that respect.  Sl&aacute;intecare is probably the best answer to the question the Deputy asked.  The reorientation would be provide much better value for our money, and Sl&aacute;intecare is the ten-year plan we have identified which will make that happen.</p> <p>  I often ask people to consider how far mental health services have come under A Vision for Change, which was also a ten-year plan.  In the 1960s, there were 20,000 people in long-stay, inpatient, acute psychiatric beds.  Today there are less than 1,000.  We have made significant reforms towards community-led service in mental health, and I have no doubt that we can do the same with physical health if we apply the same vigour to it over that ten-year period and embrace Sl&aacute;intecare, regardless of which politician is occupying a particular chair of office over those ten years.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to just put a phone in silent mode as it still causes interference with the broadcasting system.  The next item is a discussion on the role and remuneration of elected local authority members.  Today's meeting will involve an engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, on the topic.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the meeting.</p><p>Before beginning I draw the attention of members and witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence given to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before beginning, I am letting members know that if a vote is called in the Chamber, Senator Martin Conway has agreed to take the Chair to allow the meeting to continue.  As is normal practice, I will take comments from committee members first in their engagement with the Minister of State.  I will take others as they indicate.  There are many people here today and we do not have much time so I will limit each contribution to two minutes in the hope we can get around for a second time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I will not go through the speech delivered earlier and I will take it largely as read, although I will refer to a few points in it.  I acknowledge the presence of the representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, in the Gallery.  I also acknowledge the efforts that Members of the Oireachtas have made in both highlighting the matter of councillor pay and remuneration and the interest in this interim report.  I thank Ms Sara Moorhead, senior counsel, for the work she has done so far and the work she will do over the next number of months in producing the full report.  I should also acknowledge the efforts of officials in the section of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government dealing with local government.  I acknowledge that from the start, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has, with his Department, been a key stakeholder in this process in ensuring Ms Moorhead was appointed and the terms of reference were agreed.  They also ensured the review process got under way.</p> <p>  The interim report is short and it deals primarily with aspects of remuneration.  As Ms Moorhead outlines, much of her work over the coming months will reference the role and function of elected members.</p><p>In her interim report, she also outlined the fact that, in order to put a precise figure on the remuneration package for councillors in the future, she will have to do the core work in respect of the role and function of elected members.  Notwithstanding this, she gives a pretty clear indication of her train of thought on the issue.  She accepts that the current system of councillor pay and remuneration in its fullest extent, including allowances and expenses, is in serious need of modernisation and streamlining.  She indicates a number of matters Senators, Deputies and councillors would have raised with me in recent years in terms of looking at the full role that local authority members play and how that should be connected in the future with the broader public sector, including consideration of the PRSI entitlements of councillors with reference to pensions and so on.  I look forward to her full report in the spring of 2019.  I reiterate my intention that Ms Moorhead's report be acted upon.  Members here will probably highlight again a fact of which I am acutely aware, namely that many of those elected to local authorities and particularly younger people, are considering leaving because of the demands on them, the time pressures they experience and the fact that they feel that they are not being remunerated appropriately for the valuable role they perform.</p><p> I will endeavour to answer as many questions as possible in the time available.</p></speech>

I also welcome the councillors, the representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, who are in the Public Gallery and those who have tuned in to watch proceedings.  I assure the Minister of State that many people are tuning in to this meeting today because they had a broad expectation that this interim report would contain some robust and strong recommendations.  Clearly, on the basis of the Minister's opening statement and the contents of the report that was circulated at approximately 3 p.m., that is not the case.  Within minutes of the report being circulated, I received emails and text messages from councillors from all parties and none who are bitterly disappointed.  They are not bitterly disappointed with the Minister of State but rather with the fact that after all of the talk and the widespread expectation, they will not be getting proper remuneration.  We must put the facts on the record of the House.  Councillors are in receipt of &euro;17,000 per year after tax.  As the Minister of State has indicated, young men and women, as well as older men and women from different backgrounds and traditions and from all parties and none are saying that they cannot go on any longer.  They cannot wait for another six months for the Government to decide on their future.  They cannot afford to pay out any more.  The role of councillor is costing them money.  Councillors are telling us that they are dipping into their housekeeping money.  They work very long hours but do not feel valued for the work they do.</p> <p>  In terms of the submissions made to Ms Moorhead, I would single out the one from the AILG which was excellent and which made very clear recommendations.  Now we are hearing that there will be online surveys of councillors.  There are 949 councillors and we are going to have further desktop studies and requests for formal submissions.  The Minister of State indicated that his Department's response to the interim report has almost been finalised.  The Department has not even finalised its response but there are plans for further in-depth online surveys of elected members as well as surveys of local authorities and management with regard to the structures of remuneration.  There will be desktop studies and technical consultants will discuss them.  The Minister of State's script goes on and on about what will be done in the future and that is a real disappointment.  I reiterate that I am not disappointed with the Minister of State because I do not doubt for one moment his personal commitment to councillors and to local government.  Like me, he was first elected to a council in 1999.  I have travelled many a road with him in the context of his membership of the AILG and the General Council of County Councils before that.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's intentions but he must provide a commitment that the final report will be published in the spring and implemented.  This has gone on for far too long.  We do not need to have another round of online surveys and consultations.  We have had all of that already.  We need to just get on with the work and deliver.  As stated previously, councillors should be earning between &euro;30,000 and &euro;35,000 per year.  That is reasonable and it is half of what Senators are paid.  We need to recognise the value of councillors, pay them properly and acknowledge that they are on the front line in terms of the delivery of local government services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.486" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018120500002#D00400"><p>I will make some brief introductory remarks and then make an appeal to the Minister of State.  I am strongly of the view that most of us in this room are overpaid, certainly those of us who are Deputies and Senators.  I have long held this view.  I am also a little concerned that people watching this might get the wrong impression because this is the largest attendance at a meeting of this committee for a very long time.  There are four times more people here than would normally be here.  I do not want people to get the impression that the subject we are discussing today is more important than all of the other issues this committee discusses because that is certainly not the case.</p> <p>  We have a real problem and the Minister of State knows it.  Councillors who are working full time, many for between 40 and 60 hours per week, are paid approximately &euro;23,000 gross.  If we want to keep the good councillors that are in the system and to attract new councillors into the system, particularly if we want more women, we must try to tackle that bit of the overall pay issue in advance of the next local elections.  Having read the interim report however, it does not look like that is going to be possible.  I ask the Minister of State to consider breaking this issue into two parts and dealing with the more complex issues and subsidiary payments after the local elections.  I ask him to send a very clear signal to people who are currently considering getting involved in local government, people who want to make a really good contribution to their local community and who have to make decisions about child care, paying for children at school and so forth.  If we are only offering them, at the top end, &euro;23,000 in gross pay per year, they are not going to get involved or do the work.  If we could fix that bit and then come to the rest at a later stage, that would deal with the substantive problem.  I make that appeal to the Minister of State.</p> <p>  For the benefit of those watching who do not know the background to this, the remuneration for full-time councillors is at a level that I would not ask anyone to accept for a full-time job.  This is not about us asking for significant pay increases for people who are already well paid.  This is about trying to address the fact that if we want the right people for the job, we must give them a basic rate of pay that is appropriate for the hours that they work.</p></speech>

In 1974, councillors did not get paid at all.  There was no money and that is the truth.  One did not get paid for attending meetings of sub-committees either.  Meetings then were very active and vibrant.  That is still the case.  People do not get involved in local government for money.  Most people want to be councillors because they believe in improving their communities.  The problem is that as time has gone on, the demands on councillors have increased enormously.  There are issues with family-friendly hours, particularly for those councillors who already other jobs.  Councillors are out at night a great deal, attending public meetings and so on.  They do an awful lot of work.  I would not measure the work of a councillor in terms of a sum of &euro;35,000 because I do not believe that is adequate.  In my view, there should be fewer councillors but they should be better paid.  I do not know if that is an option but it could be looked at in the studies that will be undertaken.  I do not know what happens in other countries because I am not involved in local government on the ground anymore.  Being a councillor is a full time job, particularly if one wants to do the work properly and to address the widespread and significant community issues involved.  I would set the pay at a higher level than the sums that have been mentioned here but would reduce the number of councillors elected.  The public would get a better deal in that way.</p> <p>  Reference was also made to the reform of local government structures and the idea of directly elected chairpersons is a good one.  We also need to see more power devolved to elected members but, in return, they must be more accountable.</p><p>That is the road to take.  The sense of powerlessness is incredible.  When one is on a council one does not have any real power at all.  The council is an echo chamber and there is no real grasp of issues.  Sometimes councillors do not wish to take that responsibility.  Sometimes they are delighted that the manager makes the awkward or unpopular decision.  Councillors must make unpopular decisions and be paid for their work.  I agree that further study should be undertaken and the time can be abridged until next spring or whatever.  The problem is that one cannot get people to stand for election.  People just will not join a council because the work does not pay, the hours are not family friendly and councillors have no power.  This is an important discussion to commence and it has gone on for a long time.  My party has found it difficult to get candidates, particularly female candidates, to stand for local elections as they have families.  I acknowledge that men have children too and am not trying to be sexist in my comments.  I am trying to be honest and truthful at the same time.  To get the proper balance, I have outlined what one needs.  We are starting on the road, which is welcome.  Truthfully and honestly, I do not know what happened in other countries.  Having to travel to so many meetings on the one day is a joke and is wrong.  </p></speech>

I value local democracy and people should do so.  No one should take any inferences from the large attendance and I find it strange that someone would draw people's attention to the attendance in a roundabout way.</p> <p>  This issue has been going on for quite some time.  Most parties do not have the financial wherewithal to subvent councillors to allow them to be full-time councillors.  My party is one of those parties that do not subvent their councillors or give them extra pay or free offices in which to work.  Independent councillors do not have those resources either.  In the context of councillors' pay, we must consider the majority of the 949 councillors but not all of them.</p> <p>  It is a pity we are not discussing the report.  I am not being disrespectful by stating there is nothing really to discuss, as the final report will be published at the end of the first quarter.  I was a councillor for three short years.  From the work that I do in Dublin and across the country, I can tell the committee that councillors and local government perform an important role in the workings of this country.  The Minister of State will know this to be true.  People have the perception that councillors are full-time and the demands placed on them are full-time.  Such work costs their careers and councillors make great sacrifices in terms of their family life.  </p> <p>  Does the Department track the number of retirements or early retirements by councillors?  I am aware of a number of councillors who have chosen not to stand in the next election because of the pressures caused by their work.</p> <p>  I saw the interview by the Minister of State last week.  I thought what he said about more women being involved in local politics and at a county council level, as well as new Irish communities and people from other ethnic backgrounds, was good.  People do not become councillors for the pay.  The salary is &euro;17,000 a year or a gross payment of &euro;23,000.  We should consider removing the allowances and paying a proper salary.  The salary is an issue.  I am not being ageist but if one wants younger people and a more diverse group of people to represent communities at a local level, then the current structures simply will not work and an ever increasing number of councillors will leave. </p> <p>  The written statement provided by the Minister of State states "This work is however proceeding and the intention is that a final report will be ready for submission by the end of quarter 1, 2019."  Will he insist that the report is ready by the end of quarter 1?  Will there be specific recommendations about remuneration, working conditions and so on?  </p> <p>  He continued by stating the "final report will then be the subject of a discussion between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform".  I agree with that.  How long will the discussion take?  Will he set a timeframe or leave it open-ended?  We should be ambitious and seek the process to be concluded by the time the next group of councillors take office, after 24 May 2019. </p></speech>

It is very much my intention that the report will be produced by the end of quarter 1, which is the end of March.  I understand there will be recommendations but I do not know whether it will be a series of options or direct recommendations.  My absolute intention is that the new system will kick in with the new local authorities.  That will require extensive discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in particular.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked an earlier set of questions.  We must be conscious when we have this discussion that there is a broader context of public sector pay.  Part of the job that Ms Moorhead is doing, and will do over the next few months, is making the most robust case possible as to why councillors, as a group, should be paid more and better than, and differently from, how they are paid now.  In order for us to have a successful conclusion to negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we need to make the strongest case possible.  That is the job that she has set herself to do.</p></speech>

There is political acceptance that the <i>ad hoc</i>situation that exists at present, namely, the basic payment plus a series of allowances and expenses, needs reform.  That is why Sara Moorhead was given the task to consider this matter.  The discussion will take place in the broader context of public sector pay.  If we are to make the argument, and I want to make this argument in the spring of next year, that councillors should be paid using a more streamlined, clear-cut and better system than at present, and more than they are at present, then we need to jump the hurdle of public sector pay discussions in which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is heavily involved almost all of the time.</p><p>Deputy Darragh O'Brien said it was a pity that we are not discussing the report.  I remind him that this report was always going to be an interim report.  I understand from discussions that took place before I came in, and my own email, as well as comments by contributors here, that people expected a figure would be stated in the report.  The clear indication, as I read it, and I have had no contact with Ms Moorhead since she was appointed to her position, is that she feels that in order to put that figure, she must first do the background work.  That situation is deeply frustrating for councillors in all parties and Independent councillors.  All sorts of groups are now thinking and considering standing in local elections, which is why it was important to get an interim report and give an indication.  This report is only an indication of the way that she is thinking and where the ultimate report will end up.  I ask people here, never mind councillors, who may be watching or elsewhere, not to despair.  It is absolutely the intention of the Government that what she produces will be implemented and we need the strongest report possible to do so. </p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin specifically spoke about public sector pay and councillors working full-time.  We must be conscious of the fact, and this was mentioned in the interim report, that quite a lot of people in local government have other jobs.  However, the jobs may not be full-time but part-time.</p><p>It is a difficult proposition to try to see how we will marry meetings, times and so on.  This is Deputy O'Dowd's point.  Ms Moorhead has spoken in her report about other, softer supports for councillors, but one matter that will be examined is the supports that will be available to people working in private business to get the time necessary to attend meetings and do the work of a councillor.</p><p> Council chambers should be representative.  This means more women.  In the last local elections only three people born outside the State were elected as councillors, despite the fact that 12% of the people who live in the State were born outside it.  We have open voting regulations for local elections.  Basically, everyone who is resident in the State and over the age of 18 has a vote in local elections.  This is not the case in many other countries.  Part of making councils more representative is not excluding people who have another job.  Marrying these two elements is a difficult task but, again, that is part of the task Ms Moorhead faces over the next few months.</p><p> Deputy O'Dowd spoke about family friendly hours and reducing the number of councillors.  We are at the lower end internationally regarding the number of councillors per population.  There was a substantial change in this regard in advance of the last local elections.  A further reduction in local representation would enable local authorities to be in a stronger position to pay councillors more but there is not much merit in a high ratio of population to councillors.  The role of a councillor is to be as close to his or her community as he or she can.  This should not be a reason to fail to pay them correctly, and I am not using that as an excuse but I do not favour reducing the number of councillors we have.</p></speech>

It is important that we represent the councillors.  Most of us have served as councillors.  I was a councillor for 20 years so I know exactly a councillor's role.  I was a little disappointed by some of the Minister of State's remarks about councillors because he was once a councillor.  By the way, he is in my constituency, which I welcome.  The greatest issue is a councillor's role.  Until this is got right and the councillor's role and the way in which councillors play a significant part in communities are addressed, it does not matter how many surveys are done.  Ten or 20 surveys could be done but this will work.  Councillors' roles are undermined.  We should allow for their role and give them more money.  What the Minister of State said is true: most councillors have two jobs.  The reason for this is that they cannot afford to live on a councillor's pay.  The Minister of State should not even have to look at this.  We should give back more power to councillors.  Most of the powers local authorities had were taken from them following the loss of our town councils, which was a nightmare because all our funding was cut and we ended up with councillors going to municipal meetings with no funding for town councils, which had a detrimental effect on towns throughout the country.  The Minister of State should go back, look at this and ask how we might address it.  We should give a larger increase in pay to our councillors.  They deserve it for the work they do because it is a 24-7 job.  All 949 councillors are there for the love it.  However, the Minister of State needs to look at giving them back the powers that were taken from them.  Until he addresses this, it does not matter how many reports or surveys are carried out - it will not work.</p> <p>  I was looking back on the time when the abolition-----</p></speech>

As I said, the Minister of State needs to look at this.  It boils down to funding.  No matter what anyone says, I firmly believe that the reason the town councils were abolished was funding.  Regarding the &euro;5 million that has been saved through the abolition of town councils and the 40% reduction in the number of councillors, whose workloads have trebled, can we not look at giving them back the proper money for the work they do and give them back their powers, if only in appreciation of their workload?  This is where we are falling down.</p></speech>

This boils down to pounds, shillings and pence.  The way one respects people is by paying them well.  The old quintessential saying in my part of the world is, "You pay peanuts, you end up getting monkeys."  This is what will happen eventually if we do not deal with this problem.  While I have the utmost respect for Ms Moorehead, whom I do not know and whom I have never met, this problem is simple and can be dealt with simply.  It is about more money for people doing an incredibly hard job.  The municipal districts structure which came into existence in 2014 after the local elections thwarted like an elephant the work that was done by county councillors.  Unfortunately, the Minister of State's fellow countyman, Phil Hogan, substantially reduced the remuneration councillors received.  I would like to see the report published with recommendations for a substantial increase in salary.  If people are working full time at this, they will pay the standard rate of tax on their salaries.  If it is a part-time job for some people working in the private sector, they will ultimately pay a higher rate of tax, so eventually an equilibrium is achieved anyway.</p> <p>  This has gone on so long that the least councillors deserve is that, whatever recommendations are made, this be backdated to when these discussions started, which is probably two years ago at this stage.  When Noel Dempsey introduced the changes in 2002, they were backdated to the day after the 1999 local elections.  The Minister of State knows this himself because he was a councillor at the time.  I am not looking for such a backdating; I am just looking for whatever is decided to be backdated to the beginning of this discussion process, when it became an issue and when Government accepted it was an issue that needed to be dealt with.  There is precedent for backdating it going back to 2002.  I thank the Chairman for her indulgence.</p></speech>

I will first make an observation about the attendance at the meeting.  I came in here a couple of weeks ago for a discussion on Traveller accommodation.  Four members of the committee were present.  We are having a discussion this evening on increasing pay for councillors, and there were 12 people in attendance when I came in the door.  That says a lot about priorities and there can be no surprise about the cynicism of ordinary people when they see stuff like this.  I have no problem with 12 people being here, but let us have 12 people at all the important discussions that must be held.</p> <p>  I wish to make a point about class S self-employment for councillors.  I refer to a full-time councillor whose partner recently became unemployed.  He applied for jobseeker's allowance.  Because his partner was class S, the full amount of her income was taken into account in the assessment, whereas if she had not been in the S category, half her income would have been taken into account.</p><p>The result was that the partner and the household lost out to the tune of &euro;188 per week.  That is a significant amount over a month or a year,.  I will not give a view as to whether councillors' pay should be increased or kept the same.  We will save that for another day, but councillors should not be discriminated against in that way, and that needs to be examined.</p><p> It is not unknown for employers to cause difficulties for councillors who are working people, who have jobs or who work in the private sector when the councillors need to attend council meetings.  That is not democratic or right, and the blocks that private sector employers put on some councillors from attending meetings needs to be addressed as part of this review.</p></speech>

As always, the committee has an open door policy, and whether one is a member or not, he or she is most welcome at any time.</p></speech>

Councillors are being treated like second-class citizens in respect if their pay.  It is not certainly not the Minister of State's doing, and he has been frank with all elected members.  He has been frank With our Fianna F&aacute;il team regarding what he hopes to achieve, and he has laid it out to us in the Seanad on a number of occasions.  The report, however, lets him down slightly because there were more specifics in some of his contributions in the Seanad than in what has been outlined in the report.  I appreciate Ms Moorhead is not trying to hamstring herself and prove a case for wages, pay and so on, but heretofore we had talked about matching the pay with that of a grade III or grade IV civil servant.  That is on record but it is not specified in the document, where it has been kicked to touch more than ever.</p> <p>  The savings from putting people first that the European Commissioner and former Minister, Phil Hogan, had outlined, which were accumulated from the town councils and county councils, is approximately &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million per annum, which is a significant sum.  If we were to increase the figure of &euro;17,500 for the 950-odd councillors by &euro;10,000, which would bring the figure close to &euro;30,000, in rough figures, it would cost approximately &euro;9.5 million.  If we did that and increased the pay, it would then be up to the councillors in regard to what tax bands or whatever else they fall into.  That is their own kit and kaboodle at that stage.  Councillors would find a way, by cutting back on secretarial work, jumping around in their second jobs or whatever else has to be done.  If the councillors are paid, they will find a way to accommodate everything else.  A fair wage for fair work is all we want, and I appreciate everything the Minister of State is trying to do.</p></speech>

I also thank Ms Sara Moorhead for her interim report and the Minister of State for his work and the attention he has given.  I understand the committee is under time pressure and, therefore, I will condense my remarks.  There is no point rehashing everything that was said.</p> <p>  I turn to the witnesses' concluding remarks because therein lies the meat of the issue.  The final line related to how it will be a difficult task to reconcile positions and to do so without clearly defining a way forward for local government as a whole.  In itself, that shines a light on the issues at play.  Many genuine opinions on the work councillors do have been expressed at the committee, and I made a submission in that regard on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  As I have stated at the committee previously, when I first joined the local authority in 1999 before spending 17 years there, the motivation for everyone doing it was the same: a commitment to one's local community.  </p> <p>  In the time I was a local councillor, the role changed drastically in the context of what one was expected to grasp, namely, the legislation passed by the Houses, its implementation, and reading in-depth analysis of what is expected of a local authority member.  To report back by the end of the first quarter, if one is to adjudicate on what exceptional remuneration is, as the report has done, one will have to delve into the extent of the work being done on research and the role.  One can apply oneself as much or as little as one wants, but one is expected to be at the beck and call of the public.  It must also be borne in mind that local authority members are subject to a higher level of public scrutiny through the advent of social media than they ever were when the Minister of State and I first became councillors.  They are effectively part time and subject to considerable public discourse, which can be hostile.  They are not full-time, professional politicians, as we are.  The concluding remarks made the point that there is a debate about whether they should be full time, but that is not reconciled in any way.  The Minister of State said he will implement the recommendations in full, but will he outline his own impressions of that concluding remark?  I am sure he has thoughts on it and I would like to hear them.</p></speech>

I am here to represent those who are my electorate, as any other politician does, and I make no apology for being here.</p> <p>  The Minister of State needs to make up his mind about whether councillors are employees.  If they are not, we need to talk about the allowances that are paid to them and we need to pay them the correct amount.  The sort of figures that have been thrown around, such as &euro;35,000, seems to be reasonable.  </p> <p>  He said the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform needs a rationale, but let me give the Minister a rationale.  If he wants high-quality people looking after the Government's party interests on the ground, he should pay them the money and he will get them.  The council needs to be accessible to all, that is, single mothers, unemployed people and people of all ages.  If they are not paid, the Government will not get them.</p> <p>  I could go through many matters but I know the committee is under time pressure.  On PRSI, I wrote the first report on class K PRSI and delivered it to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  I took the Minister of State's Department to the High Court on PRSI and class K, and it capitulated immediately in regard to the five councillors I brought to the High Court, giving them a reward.  The previous Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, introduced class S for councillors, which was a good move but it was not good enough because of those who are not in private employment and those who became unemployed after becoming councillors.  I have a case on my table of a county councillor who applied for optical benefit.  He was paying a rate of 4%, which is the same as anyone on class A, he went for optical benefit last week for a miserable pair of glasses and he was told he did not qualify because he had broken his PRSI record.  He was told he must move to retrospectively recognise the 4% that was paid by every county councillor since he or she was elected.  It is unjust to say the least, and it is morally wrong in every way that people are being denied the same social welfare entitlements that anyone else who pays 4% gets.  </p> <p>  The issue of pensions brings me back to the issue of pay.  If councillors are not servants, and if there is no servant-master relationship, we need to decide what they are and ensure they have a pension.  Nobody in the Houses will leave without a pension, however small it may be.  At the end of the day, we must look after those we expect to represent people.  The difference between me and a county councillor is that I can enter a public toilet and leave without anyone stopping me or asking me if I can assist with this or that problem.  I have never been a county councillor and I do not know why so many of them do it, because we do not care about them and if we do not care about them, the public see them as something to be used.  It is time we put them on an equal footing with everyone else in politics and looked after them.</p></speech>

The Senator speaks for himself when he said we do not care about councillors.  As has been outlined, I have been acutely aware that councillors are not adequately remunerated.</p><p>They are probably fed up hearing me say that but in order to change anything, one has to produce a body of evidence for why it should happen.  The need for change might be obvious to Senator Craughwell and to me but citizens, ratepayers and property taxpayers have to be convinced because it is their money not the Senator's or mine.  I am committed to changing the system.</p><p> It is interesting that among the issues identified by Ms Moorhead in her report is the PRSI discrepancy to which many members referred.  I acknowledge what has been done in the past but we must now decide on the way forward.  My position from the commencement of this process has been that politicians should not be deciding the pay of other politicians and that councillors should be linked to the public sector.  I am sure this might be one of the proposals that comes out of this process.  I expect that what we will end up with is different potential solutions.  That is my preference but I have tasked Ms Sara Moorhead with that job.  She is brilliant and her forensic skills are all over this short but succinct report.  I encourage members of the committee, and the non-members who are in attendance, to read the report a few times because sometimes the solutions are not obvious on a first reading.  I get a sense from councillors that they are disappointed that no amount is mentioned in the report but there are a lot of indicators as to how Ms Moorhead believes this issue should be resolved.  Ms Moorhead will take up these trains of thought with the secretariat over the next few months.</p><p> I acknowledge the points made about Ms Moorhead's concluding remarks.  The report also seeks to address the issue of whether the role is part-time or full-time.  Deputy Barry referred to people who are working in the private sector and having difficulty getting time off work.  In the second last line of the report, Ms Moorhead states that it would be fair to say that much of the engagement to date has not just concentrated on remuneration for councillors but on support systems for them and how the executive can support them.  That support system must address issues such as how they can access time off and in a way whereby employers will not be at a loss.  This may involve other measures in other Departments that we have not mentioned in terms of taxation.  I do not know what Ms Moorhead will recommend, but that would be an obvious option that has just come to mind.</p><p> Several members spoke against surveys.  I am not against them.  Some councillors are more involved with the AILG and LAMA than others.  When I was a councillor, I was a member but I do not disrespect anybody who is not.  Surveys should not be an issue.  The submissions that were received from the AILG and LAMA were excellent.  I read them several times.  Surveying councillors directly outside of the representative groups is the right thing to do.</p><p> I agree with Senator Murnane O'Connor that the role of the councillor is central.  This is supported in the interim report.  To come up with a final package, one has to examine powers and functions.  The reality is that town councils do not exist and are unlikely to re-emerge in the short term.  In terms of savings in that regard, Senator Davitt referenced a saving of  &euro;25 million and another member mentioned &euro;5 million.  The unanswered question is why should people in particular towns get two ballot papers while everyone else gets one.  It is a basic question of democracy as far as I am concerned that it should be one person, one vote for local authorities.  The AILG and LAMA broadly support a marrying of the old system with the municipal district structure and the transfer of funding previously given to the town councils to the municipal districts.  I would not be averse to doing that.</p><p> Senator Davitt mentioned that the report lacks specifics.  I have already indicated my position in that regard.  Reading between the lines of what I have to hand - the only communication I have had is the report as well - the indication from the chair is that to give specifics we will have to deeper delve.  I will endeavour to ensure that we get the report in March and that this kicks in for the new councils.</p><p> I thank members for their contributions.  I will be back, I am sure, to discuss this issue further.</p></speech>

Before we begin consideration of the Bill, I propose to deal with some minor housekeeping matters.  To ensure the smooth running of the meeting, any Member acting in substitution for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk now if he or she has not done so.  I propose that after two hours of consideration of the Bill, we take a short break for approximately ten minutes.  At 10 p.m., if the debate is not concluded, I propose that we consider whether to continue with consideration of the Bill.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with special responsibility for local government and electoral reform, Deputy John Paul Phelan, and his officials.  I ask members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on airplane mode for the duration of the meeting, as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, even when on silent mode.

This relates to the new section 13, dealing with staff transfers and plans which is proposed for insertion in the Bill by amendment No. 25.</p><p>Amendment No. 25 proposes to insert a new section 13 about the staff transfer plan into the Bill before the existing section 13 dealing with the transfer of staff.  The new section deals separately with the staff transfer plan that the two local authorities will need to jointly prepare to facilitate the transfer of staff from the county council to the city council.  Section 13(1) requires the two chief executives to jointly prepare a plan referred to as the staff transfer plan in the Bill, which was added as a definition to section 2 by amendment No. 3.  </p>  <p>               It was added as a definition to section 2 by amendment No. 3.  It sets out the numbers and grades who prior to the transfer day were assigned to the performance of functions in the relevant area, whether fully or partly.  The proposal is to transfer staff to meet the staffing requirements for the relevant area.</p> <p> There are different subsections relating to amendment No. 25.  Subsection (3) requires that any disagreements on the preparation of the plan are to be referred to the oversight committee which will make a recommendation to the chief executives.  f Ithe chief executives fail to act in accordance with such a recommendation the Minister may give a direction on the matter under subsection (4), and in doing so, subsection (5) requires the Minister to have regard to the proportion that the population of the transferring area represents of the existing population of Cork County Council.</p> <p> Subsection (6) requires the chief executives to comply with any such direction given by the Minister.  Subsection (7) provides that a staff transfer plan may relate to classes of staff by reference to their grade or the operation of services by the local authority.  Subsection (8) requires the two local authorities to notify the oversight committee of the making of the staff transfer plan.  Subsection (9) provides that the chief executives can make more than one staff transfer plan.</p> <p> Arising from the new section 13 inserted into the Bill by amendments Nos. 25 and 26, which replaces subsections (1), (2) and (3) and the published section 13 dealing with the transfer of staff with a single subsection which provides that the chief executive of the county council shall, after consulting with the city council chief executive, designate for employment by the city council the members of staff required to implement the staff transfer plan prepared under the previous section but for the purpose of meeting the staffing requirements in relation to the relevant area.  Once the staff transfer plan is in place, indicating the numbers and grades required to transfer, the designation of the individuals concerned will be by way of volunteers initially and then on a last-in, first-out basis to make up any shortfall.</p> <p> Amendment No. 27 reduces the notice period in the published section 13 (4) from five months to three months, or any shorter period agreed with the staff member concerned, and this reduction is being proposed at the request of both local authorities.  Amendment No. 28 amends the published section 13 (5) because it is a county council chief executive function to make staff transfer designation.</p></speech>

This is a small change although not a radical one from what was initially outlined, but it inverts the process to some extent in that both local authorities come up with the plan together, whereas in the original Bill there was an expectation that the city council would outline what it required.  That said, the proposed method could work just as well.  I am conscious that amendment No. 26 seems to indicate that once the process is completed, provided there is agreement between them, the obligation rests entirely on the county council to designate the staff who are to transfer.  The potential for the Minister to interfere comes before that.  Could we have a situation where generally it looks as if there is agreement but at the last stage of the process things are slowed down, although probably not permanently?  This mechanism seems to vest more control in the county council for the transfer of staff across to the city council than was previously the case.</p>  <p>  I appreciate both local authorities probably feel the three-month notice period is necessary given that the timeframe is tight but is it absolutely necessary as three months is tight enough for an employee to change his or her responsibilities or, potentially, place of work, which might be the case especially for outdoor staff.</p></speech>

That is a key, sensitive and important part of the changes and it is important that it would be done right.  I could support amendment No. 25 provided that section 13 (7) and (8) in the original document are not replaced or deleted.  I think that is the case but I am seeking confirmation from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

In response to the question from Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, what we are talking about is the transfer of staff from the county council to the city council.  Originally, most of the emphasis was placed on the county council being the authority that was giving up staff and the city council was going to examine its staffing requirements to deal with the transfer of population.  It has become apparent at various stages in this process that if we can get agreement between the local authorities themselves it is probably the best way to approach it.  The purpose of the amendments is to place more emphasis on the fact that we are allowing them to come to their own decisions.  What we have found in this process now that the discussions are getting into the nitty-gritty is that there is a lot more agreement than might have originally been expected given some of the comments that were made when the boundary maps were produced.  We want to place the greatest possible emphasis in the legislation on allowing the Cork authorities to come to their own agreement, but we still retain various measures that I have discussed such that the Minister can ultimately become involved if there is not agreement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#E01500"><p>I move amendment No. 5:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 8, to delete lines 33 and 34, and in page 9, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:  	&ldquo;9. (1) On the transfer day and subject to <i>sections 10</i>and <i>11</i>, all lands situated in the relevant area that, immediately before the transfer day, were vested in the county council and all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with such lands shall, without any conveyance or assignment, stand vested in the city council for all the estate or interest therein that, immediately before the transfer day, was vested in the county council, but subject to all trusts and equities affecting the lands continuing to subsist and being capable of being performed.&rdquo;.  </blockquote>  <p>Amendment No. 5 substitutes section 9(1) with a provision that is to the same effect, but which is subject to two new sections proposed for insertion by amendments Nos. 8 and 9, rather than subject to subsection (5), the content of which will now be in a separate section if amendment No. 9 is accepted.  Amendment No. 7 deletes sections 9(5) and 9(6), the content of which will be in the second new section.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 is a drafting change that amends section 9(4) to provide that the functions connected with the transferring land shall after the transfer day be &quot;performable by or on behalf of the city council only&quot; whereas the published version provides that the functions are &quot;performable by the city council&quot;.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 create two additional sections, the first of which deals with the delayed transfer of land.  Its purpose is to allow the Cork local authorities to agree that the transfer of certain land should not occur on the transfer day, which is the default position under section 9, but instead should happen at a later specified date.  For drafting reasons, it was not possible to include the provision as an additional subsection due to associated performance of functions and vesting of related chose-in-action provisions needing to apply from the deferred dates rather than the transfer day.  Accordingly, the content of the new section is very similar to section 9 as proposed for amendment.  This provision to enable the authorities to agree the deferral of some land transfers is proposed for inclusion in the Bill at the suggestion of the implementation oversight group.  The associated amendment No. 24 inserts into the published section 12(5) an additional reference to the new section 10 that is proposed for insertion into the Bill by amendment No. 8.</p><p>The second new section created by amendment No. 9 deals with other agreements regarding land situated in the relevant area, subsection (1) of which restates the content of the published section 9(5), but also allows for the authorities to agree to share the use of land transferred to the city council under section 9(1).  Subsection (2) restates the content of the published section 9(6).  This material is being moved to a separate section for drafting reasons to facilitate the changes to the references in section 9(1) that will be made by amendment No. 5 if accepted.</p><p>Amendment No. 10 replaces section 10(1)(<i>a</i>) with two new paragraphs, the effect of which is to impose an earlier date than the transfer day of 30 April 2019 by which to make a designation and to require the local authorities to have regard to the implementation plan in so doing.  This and the other changes contained in amendments Nos. 12 and 13 arose from discussions with the implementation group on how section 10 should best operate in practice.</p><p>Amendment No. 11 is a drafting change to the wording of section 10(1)(<i>d</i>) that provides that the functions connected with the transferring property shall, after the transfer day and in relation to such property, be &quot;performable by or on behalf of the city council only&quot; whereas the published version provides that the functions are &quot;performable by the city council&quot;.  </p><p>Amendment No. 12 inserts two new subsections (2) and (3), the first of which provides that the oversight committee may make a recommendation to the two local authorities that they should jointly make a designation on such property or property of such a class as may be specified in the recommendation.  </p>  <p>               The second new subsection requires the two authorities to notify the oversight committee of the making of a designation under section 10.  The non-receipt of a notification will trigger the oversight committee deciding whether to issue a recommendation under subsection (2) and, if a recommendation has issued, will indicate that the recommendation has not resulted in a designation being made.  This is relevant to what would become subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) if amendment No. 13, proposing the insertion of a new subsection, is accepted.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 13 replaces the existing subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) with two new paragraphs.  The first of these empowers the Minister to also make designations of property by order for the purposes of the Act and the second provides that where the local authorities have failed to make a designation within one month of the oversight committee making a recommendation referred to in the preceding amendment, the Minister shall make the designation within the following two months.  Amendment No. 14 is a consequential amendment inserting into the published paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) a reference to the additional new preceding paragraph.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 15 is a drafting change to the wording of subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) to the same effect as amendment No. 11 and also inserts a further subsection clarifying that multiple designations may be made under the section and may be made in respect of different property and different classes of property.<br/><br/>In section 11, amendment No. 18 inserts a new subsection before the current subsection (2) in section 11.  Similarly to the current subsection (2) provision in respect of property, which will become subsection (3) if this amendment is accepted, this subsection is essentially repeating the subsection (1) paragraphs to apply in circumstances where land is transferred on a date or dates specified in an agreement for the delayed transfer of land.  Amendment No. 20 inserts a new subsection to clarify that the transfer of rights and liabilities arising by virtue of contracts or commitments includes those arising from development bonds that arise under the planning and development legislation.</p></speech>

I am seeking clarification as there is a large number of amendments in this group.  My understanding of the position in respect of transfer of assets from the county council to the city council is that, generally speaking, it was not always the case that any associated liabilities transferred across to the city.  For example, I think the county council was of the view that housing rent arrears might not necessarily follow.  It would be useful to clarify this across a number of headings.  Where assets are transferring across, particularly rent arrears, is the liability transferring with the asset to the city council?  There are a few other examples, including housing loans, but I have tabled a specific amendment on that issue so we can deal with it separately.</p></speech>

Generally, provisions are such that if assets are transferring, liabilities are moving too.  I think there is an amendment to that effect, possibly in the Deputy's name, in respect of the housing stock issue and housing loans.  The view is that if the housing loans are transferring and income will accrue to the city from that, the liability should transfer also.  I was looking at the Deputy's amendment before I came in, although I cannot remember which one it is.  If the councils agree between themselves that the liability should not transfer when an asset is moving, we are allowing them to do so.  Generally speaking, when assets are moving, the liabilities will move with them.</p></speech>

Both local authorities, perhaps unsurprisingly, put forward the position at various stages that they should be indemnified against unexpected liabilities.  It is hard to indemnify both of them against that.  Where there are unexpected liabilities, will the issue be addressed by agreement or in what way will they be split?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.566" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#F00500"><p>On indemnification against an unexpected liability, the Department cannot produce a blank cheque for any local authority.  There are provisions that if a claim is submitted after the transfer day by a person who, say, had a fall before the date on land owned by the county council, the claim will be made against the city council.  It also means the city council will substitute for the county council in any contracts or services made by the county council before the transfer day that have not yet expired and relate exclusively to functions in the relevant area.  If such a contract applies to functions performable in both the relevant area and part of the county council remaining within that authority's administrative area, the city council will become another party to the contract and payments arising under the contract will have to be apportioned between the two authorities based on population.  Essentially, in the case of an individual who is making a claim against the county council for a fall that occurred in the area that is transferring, the claim will subsequently arise against the city council because the land is being transferred to the city council.  However, this also means the city council will substitute for the county council in any contracts for services that are made by the council before transfer day but have not been executed before that day.</p></speech>

The exception to this is the provision in section 18 dealing with compliance with the Act, whereby the oversight committee may report to the Minister on measures that it considers should be adopted to achieve compliance with the Act.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 58 is to make the section 18 provision dealing with the making of arrangements by the two local authorities for the performance of functions optional rather than mandatory.  It has been put forward at the request of the implementation group which does does not consider that a mandatory provision is necessary.</p><p>Other amendments I am proposing to section 18 are consequential to this change.  These are the deletion by amendment No. 60 of subsection (6) requiring the Minister to make an arrangement if the local authorities fail to so do; the replacement of subsection (7), dealing with the amendment of arrangements made by the local authorities and made by the Minister, with a new subsection that simply provides that the Cork local authorities, after consulting with the oversight group, may amend or revoke an arrangement made under the section; and the deletion by amendment No. 62 of subsection (10) providing that an agreement may not be revoked without the Minister&rsquo;s consent.  The latter subsection is now superfluous.</p><p>Amendment No. 59 is a technical drafting change to remove superfluous text in subsection (3)(a).  Amendment No. 63 is a drafting change to the order of the wording of subsection (11).</p></speech>

If it is to be deleted, there is not much point in amending it.</p>  <p>  My amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 49 are related and 49 and 48 are quite similar in some respects.  In all of my contributions on the Bill, I have been conscious to ensure that both local authorities are as financially sustainable as possible.  There is a strong belief in Cork County Council that there needs to be a commitment to an ongoing settlement which should not disappear after ten or 15 years.  The position after that period need not be as rigid as was the case up to that point but it is fair that there be an ongoing commitment subject to review and negotiation.  A deadline should not be set in that regard.  </p>  <p>                 There is a view that the base amount - the component of the financial settlement that is outside the transfer of assets, offsetting of liabilities, development contributions and so on - that is being paid from the city to the council should be index linked up and down.  The Bill allows for a level of flexibility in that regard, so not being able to rely on a base amount could make life difficult for the county council.</p> <p> There is also a view that some degree of certainty is required around the frequency of payments, which is the basis for amendment No. 49 and Deputy Michael Collins's amendment No. 48.  The financial settlement should be paid on an advance monthly scheduled basis so that the county council can account for it on a frequent basis.</p> <p> My amendment No. 53 is a compromise proposal.  Currently, the Bill provides for a review "not later than 3 years" after the first making of a financial settlement.  The county council fears that the review might start much earlier than the three-year mark, so I have proposed that it should start exactly three years after the transition and be completed within six months.  There has been some suggestion that the second review should be pushed out beyond ten years, but that is not right, as ten years is a reasonable interval.  Amendment No. 53 is a fair compromise.</p> <p> Amendment No. 56 addresses a similar point to one I have already made.  There should be some level of reliance on revising and renegotiating.</p> <p> The amendments I am tabling in this grouping all relate to section 17.  The Minister of State is proposing to do things differently.  I can probably live with that and return to these matters on Report Stage, but I would like some assurances on the general points that I have made before I consider what position to take.</p> <p> A point has been made about subsection (6) of amendment No. 69.  This provision appears in a few places.  I understand that there may be a concern about two local authorities ending up on opposite sides in court to settle their financial differences.  In many of the amendments, there seems to be an effort to address that concern by way of ministerial intervention, reference to the oversight group and so on.  However, a number of the Bill's provisions, including the end of subsection (6), retain that option.  It reads: "that contribution or that part of the contribution that remains unpaid shall be recoverable by the city council in any court of competent jurisdiction as a simple contract debt."  Ministerial intervention has been provided for, but is it necessary to include a provision that still anticipates both local authorities being against each other in a courtroom?  One would hope that they would not end up in that situation.</p> <p> My apologies, Chairman, but I will only make two further points, the first of which is on the proposed section 20(1) in amendment No. 69.  I am concerned by the fact that the county council will have until April 2020 to make a payment in respect of 2019.  If the city council is thin on finance at the end of 2019 for the areas that are being transitioned, will it have to wait until April 2020 to receive payment in respect of them?  Obviously, we hope that the county council would pay before then, but it is still being given that latitude.  I have a concern in that regard, as I am not sure it is wise.</p> <p> I wish to clarify something regarding amendment No. 72.  The new section 23(4) relates in part to development contributions.  Is it still the case that development contributions that relate to developments in the transition areas will go to the city council?</p></speech>

We are changing the numbering and ordering because we are inserting a new Part 3 dealing with financial arrangements consequential on the boundary alteration.  This involves replacing section 17.  There is a provision - I will try to find the exact reference to it - for indexation, or the time value of money, which is how I learned it.  I will provide it to the Deputy when I find it.</p>  <p>  We have made an effort to remove any potential route for litigation, but the contract debt provision remains as a precaution.  It is a legal thing, as there must be some bottom line.  We have tried to minimise its number of mentions.  It is like a backstop, to use the hackneyed phrase.  There has to be a final means by which that contribution can be recovered.</p>  <p>  The measure on a review after three years has been removed in direct response to contributions on Second Stage, which many of the Deputies present made.  They spoke about the potential impact of a review after three years.  In our current proposal, the city council can effectively communicate with the Minister of the day the reasons it believes that the compensation should either be removed or, after an examination, reduced.  It will be up to the Minister of the day to make that call.  Galway City Council was established as a separate authority in 1985 and is still making payments to Galway County Council on a compensatory basis 33 years later.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, we felt that a mechanism at the ten-year mark whereby an application could be made to vary or drop the compensatory package was probably a fair balance between the original three-year provision and the suggestion of stretching the review period out further.</p>  <p>  The reason Cork City Council is being allowed the flexibility to make the 2019 payments up to April 2020 is because a great deal of change will happen in the council in the next six or eight months and it will need a larger window than the normal calendar year to calculate and make the payments.  It is an attempt by officials in the Custom House to recognise the difficulties that local officials will face in reaching that calculation.</p>  <p>  In terms of indexation-----</p></speech>

It will actually be a payment from the county to the city.</p></speech>

I will be doing that a lot, I expect.</p>  <p>  Regarding indexation, the proposed section 22(12) in amendment No. 71 outlines the definition of "annual contribution".  In connection with amendment No. 40, this allows for an indexation value to be placed on the compensation.</p>  <p>  I believe I have dealt with many of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

He did not explain the 2020 deadline.  He visualised it the other way around but I am not sure the county council needs that flexibility.  I am not sure I agree with getting rid of the three-year deadline so I proposed a reasonable balance.  If the calculation is drastically wrong or disadvantageous to the city council, it is reasonable to wait three years for a first review.  To leave it ten years without reconsidering it is too much if it turns out to be wrong.  I am not sure it is fair.  There should be an ongoing commitment beyond the ten years.  Does the Minister believe that exists within this legislation?  The county council has to have some sense that it will continue beyond that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#J00200"><p>It will be at the discretion of the city council to make the application to change or to vary it, but the Minister and the Department will make the ultimate call as to the extent of any variation and on what they deem to be fair at the ten-year point.  The amendments to this section propose a much more detailed line-by-line description of expenditure heads.  It is believed, and hoped for, by the Department that it will not allow any unforeseen costs or expenses emerging.  The issue relating to the extra window for the county council is the same but in reverse.  There is certainty in that the city council will know that funding is coming and it can go to the courts to get the funding fully paid.  To have it all included in the calendar year could place too much of a restriction but it is not envisaged that it be allowed to drag on indefinitely.  It just places a looser timeline on the payment of that particular contribution.</p></speech>

(2) Subject to paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of section 18 of the Act of 2000, any local area plan in force immediately before the transfer day in respect of an area within the relevant area shall, on and after that day, continue to apply to the first-mentioned area until the next making of a local area plan by the city council in respect of the first- mentioned area in accordance with the said section 18. <br /><br />(3) The Cork County Council Local Economic and Community Plan in force immediately before the transfer day in respect of the functional area of the county council shall, on and after that day, continue to apply in respect of the relevant area until the next making of a local economic and community plan by the city council in respect of the functional area of the city council in accordance with section 66B of the Principal Act. <br /><br />(4) For the avoidance of doubt, the city council may&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) in accordance with section 13 of the Act of 2000, make a variation of the development plan first-mentioned in <i>subsection (1)</i>in so far only as that plan applies to the relevant area, <br /><br />(b) in accordance with <i>subsection (5)</i>of section 18 of the Act of 2000, amend or revoke a local area plan first-mentioned in <i>subsection (2)</i>in so far only as that plan applies to the relevant area, and <br /><br />(c) perform functions under section 66F or 66G in relation to the Cork County Council Local Economic and Community Plan referred to in <i>subsection (3)</i>in so far only as that plan applies to the relevant area.  </blockquote>(5) In this section&mdash;  <blockquote> 	&ldquo;development plan&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2000; <br /><br />&ldquo;local area plan&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2000.&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>The amendments relate to development plans and local area plans.  Amendment No. 77 provides for the replacement of section 24 with a new section, now to be headed &quot;Development plans, etc. relating to the relevant area&quot;, which is a restatement of the published section 24 but expanded to include the local economic community plans, LECPs, as mentioned on Second Stage by a number of speakers.  Subsection (1) provides that the Cork County Council development plan applicable to the relevant area before transfer day will remain in force in that area until Cork City Council makes a new development plan after transfer day.  Subsection (2) provides that any local area plan in force before transfer day, in respect of an area within the relevant area, will continue to apply until Cork City Council next makes a local area plan for that area.  Subsection (3) provides that the Cork County Council LECP enforced before transfer day will continue to apply for the relevant area until Cork City Council next makes its own LECP.  Subsection (4) is an avoidance of doubt provision which clarifies that Cork City Council may vary the development plan or amend or revoke the local area plan that continued to be in operation under the previous subsections but only insofar as the plan applies to the relevant area.  The city council may also perform functions such as monitoring and reviewing economic elements of the Cork county LECP and reporting on that assessment but only insofar as the plan applies to the relevant area.  Subsection (5) defines the development plan and local area plan as having the meanings assigned in the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>Amendment No. 78 will delete the words &quot;permission granted or&quot; from section 25(1) to clarify that the subsection is intended only to provide for a continuing role by the county council in processing planning applications made before transfer day to the point where a decision is made to grant or refuse the application.</p><p>Amendment No. 79 deletes the published subsection (2)(a) and replaces it with a new subsection (2)(a) to clarify that after transfer day, the city council will become the planning authority for planning applications decided or appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la determined before transfer day, apart from cases where enforcement proceedings had been commenced by the county council.</p><p>Amendment No. 81 amends subsection (2)(b) by inserting a requirement for the county council to consult the city council when finishing enforcement proceeding cases that had commenced before transfer day.</p><p>Amendment No. 82 replaces subsection (3) with a new subsection (3) that removes the reference to contributions paid under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 from the provision.  This change is proposed because of information received from the county council to the effect that isolation of contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities benefiting development in the area of the planning authority as a whole which are paid and not yet expended in the case of developments in the relevant area would not be possible.  The provision deals only with section 49 contributions that will vest in the city council, that is, earmarked contributions for specific projects, and that will continue to require to be expended on public infrastructure services and projects in the relevant area.  </p>  <p>               The final amendment to section 25, amendment No. 83, adds "development" to the terms defined as having the meaning assigned by the Planning and Development Act 2000 in subsection (5).</p> <p> Amendment No. 100 proposes to insert a new section, after section 30, dealing with the making and review of development plans by Cork local authorities, the purpose of which is to enable the Minister to extend by order the statutory time limits applicable to the development planning process.  The new section amends sections 9 and 11 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to enable the Minister, by order, to add an additional period of not more than one year to the normal six-year period within which Cork City Council and Cork County Council must make a development plan, and to provide similarly in regard to the four-year period applicable to the giving of notice of an intention to review the development plan.</p> <p> The new section 32 proposed by Opposition amendment No. 103, involving the amendment of section 13 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, is, I imagine, for the same purpose as Government amendment No. 100, which I have just discussed.  If so, I hope Deputies will take that into consideration when considering their amendment No. 103.</p></speech>

I will address those two amendments but, before I do, I have a question that is relevant to the grouping as a whole.  What happens to a Part 8 process that has started before the transition date?  There is every likelihood the county council or city council may not proceed in order to avoid that.  However, what will happen to Part 8 processes that either span the transition or are completed shortly beforehand?  We need to ensure projects initiated by the county council continue to flow to the city council as smoothly as possible.</p>  <p>  On amendment No. 103, the point is made by the city council that the regional spatial and economic strategies are due to be adopted in March 2019.  Under the Planning and Development Acts, the city council is generally required to start the process of a new city plan within 13 weeks, which would be June 2019.  This makes the process a busy one and some flexibility would be reasonable.  If it is covered, that is fair enough, but from the explanation the Minister of State has given, I am not sure it is.</p>  <p>  On amendment No. 102, I have discussed the issue previously with the Minister of State.  As a councillor for one of the largest transition areas, I had the experience of working in a municipal district.  Despite having been sceptical at the outset, and the experience of councillors in different municipal districts was different, we had a very good municipal district and it worked very well.  It kept local issues off the county council agenda and ensured they were dealt with at a local area level.  It is a good model.  I know there are area committees in Dublin and in other places but these do not have the same statutory basis.  While it might not be in order for full local area plans to be made by municipal districts in a city such as Cork, although there may be a value in it, municipal districts can make by-laws.  I believe it makes sense to do this at a more local level.  It makes sense for municipal districts to adopt or comment upon the municipal allocation or the budgetary allocation that is coming from the city council.  If that statutory structure is provided for dealing with very local issues and taking very local budgetary initiatives, it will be a value to those councillors in that ward or municipal district, but it will also ensure the city council as a whole is far more focused on the overall policy direction and strategy of the city and metropolitan area.  I think it is a good model and we should have it, or something like it, in the city.</p></speech>

The Part 8 process will stay with the county council until it has been completed and then move with the relevant area so the city council can continue and take up where the county council has left off, effectively.  It does not disappear.  It will not be finished for the county council until the process is completed.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the Part 8 process can take a while.  Rather than getting the city council to start the ball rolling from scratch again, the county council will complete the formal legal process and it is then part of the transfer for the city council to implement whatever the Part 8 is.  Amendment No. 100 takes account, at least partially, of the point the Deputy makes in amendment No. 103.  We propose to allow the Minister the discretion, if asked by the local authorities, to grant a time period of up to 12 months of an extension to the existing development plan to allow for the drafting of the new development plan.  That is not to say it is necessarily up to 12 months; it is just to provide a window for the planners and the councillors considering it, so they can do the thorough work that is involved in drafting county development plans.</p>  <p>  In regard to the municipal districts, the municipal district structure does not exist in city authorities in Ireland.  I understand the point the Deputy is making in the broader context of municipal districts.  Their impact and effectiveness vary greatly from local authority to local authority.  Some local authorities have very well embedded, supported and funded municipal districts that operate very successfully.  However, in other local authorities the structure is still weak and many of the issues the Deputy noted that should be dealt with at local district level end up going back to the full plenary session of the council.  That is a matter we will have to return to in the future.</p>  <p>  It is open to Cork City Council, as it is to Dublin City Council, to designate area committees, although these do not have the same powers and functions.  All of these sections of the Bill relate to Cork specifically.  A decision was taken that in providing for the planning and development of Cork into the future, we should look at Cork city as one entity rather than continuing the current system, where bits of it are in certain municipal districts in the county, with different local area plans.  There should be one plan for the city of Cork, regardless of whether there will be different constituent parts of the new city in the future.</p>  <p>  There are strong identities in some of the areas the Deputy represents on the south side of Cork city, as there are on the north side.  Effectively, urban villages that were in County Cork up to now will be in Cork city.  There is a particular issue in regard to Ballincollig, which has traditionally been separate.  Through continuous development over the years, Cork city has spread to Ballincollig, and it would be impossible for anyone here to envisage a Cork city in 20 years of which Ballincollig is not an integral part.</p>  <p>  I will have to talk to the Minister of State, Deputy English, about the provisions for separate local area plans for some areas which are a very identifiable component of the new extended Cork city.  I would be willing to talk to him before Report Stage to find if some leeway can be found in the Planning and Development Act that would allow for a more locally based area plan for specific parts of the newly constituted Cork city.  </p>  <p>               If possible, the Deputy might leave it with me until Report Stage.  I will talk to the Minister of State, Deputy English, to see if it can be included, although it may be that it cannot.</p></speech>

There are area committees in Dublin which work pretty well and there are no statutory requirements in respect of them.  We need to look at that.

While it is mainly a drafting change, it also allows the two local authorities to agree an alternative to the default position whereby existing arrears of the main revenue sources remain payable to the county council if such an agreed alternative suits them.  Similarly, amendment No. 88 again allows the two local authorities to agree an alternative to the default position, whereby the main revenue sources remain payable to the county council in respect of all of 2019, if such an alternative suits the two local authorities.  Amendment No. 89 inserts a new paragraph (b) into subsection (3) to include entry year property levy within the provision.</p><p>As I understand amendment No. 91, its purpose is for the mortgage debt of housing loan recipients in the relevant area and associated loan repayments to remain with the county council.  We were discussing this earlier.  I do not propose to accept this amendment because the normal arrangement that applies to a boundary alteration is that the housing loans and all associated management of those files will transfer across to the new local authority, in this case the city council.  It is the city council that will receive the subsequent repayments and will also deal with any consents to resale that might arise in the future.</p><p>The Bill provides that assets and liabilities will transfer to the city council on the transfer day and that repayments are payable to the city council from 1 January of the following year.  The liability owed to the Housing Finance Agency associated with the mortgages for the properties will transfer from the county to the city as will the income stream which will offset the debt owed to the agency.  There is not going to be any change to the term or tenure of the mortgage holders.  It would be unusual to change the position in respect of transferring the liability along with the asset.  For that reason, I will be opposing this amendment.</p></speech>

It is a loan.  There are approximately 150 of these properties in the transition areas, not a huge number.  However, there is concern that the level of administration involved in their transfer from the county to the city would mean proportionately a significant amount of work for the city while it would actually be far easier to just let it rest with the county.  There are numerous questions there.  All the transactional data would have to come across.  The county council would have to provide the city with complete paper files.  There would have to be a risk profile.  The county council may have initiated legal proceedings in respect of some of those borrowers, potentially.  There would be changes to statutory reporting requirements to the central credit register.  Then there is the issue of loan accounts that are in credit.  While I think the general approach that is being taken makes some sense, although I would hope that the Department will consider resources for a lot of these issues, I think the housing loans are a particular category and I am not sure they can properly be categorised as an asset.</p></speech>

I understand the point the Deputy is making.  He is saying that it is not a large number of housing loans.  However, we want to make a clean break and it would be very messy if these remained with the county council even though they are in the area that is being transferred to the city.  I do not dispute that it may take up extra man hours and we are providing additional substantial resources to both local authorities for the changeover period.  I do not think the fact that the process itself might be difficult is sufficient reason to make an exception for housing loans.  It is clearer and cleaner if the transfer includes them.  I do understand the issues the Deputy is raising but I think it should happen.</p></speech>

There is a contractual obligation with the council but there is no obligation in terms of housing maintenance, tenancy or anything like that.  If the Minister of State will take that into account in advance of Report Stage, I might withdraw the amendment.  I ask that he communicate with the city council.</p></speech>

I do not like saying "No"; I suppose I am a real politician.  The main purpose of all of these sections of the Bill is to expand Cork city.  It would not be consistent with that purpose to allow these to remain with the county council even though they will be physically in the city in the future.  It is cleaner that way.  I cannot accept amendment No. 91.  I have enough to be doing to talk about the other couple of amendments and about others in future.  I think this one is just messy.</p></speech>

I come from a little place with a population of 2,000 people on the Wexford-Kilkenny border called Tullogher Rosbercon, and the commission decided to separate Rosbercon from Tullogher.  How it came about I do not know; it has never happened before.  My own neighbours are contacting me continuously.  The Deputy is correct that I am the person who will sign the statutory instruments.  I could decide not to sign them but we must remember that there are local elections in the near future.  People are deciding to run and are making decisions about it.  It would be completely inappropriate for me, as a Minister of State, if I did not implement this change.</p>  <p> I misunderstood what the Deputy was saying at first.  The matter can be raised in the D&aacute;il in Private Members' time, and I suggest, because it is an issue in the Deputy's part of the world, that that might be the place to have the discussion.  </p></speech>

This would result in a population of 6,357 remaining within the County administrative area (based on the census 2016).&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>I will try not to delay progress on this Bill because there are quite a few amendments listed tonight.  I want to revisit amendments Nos. 45, 48, 50 to 52, inclusive, 55 and 57 on Report Stage but for now I will discuss this amendment, which is hugely important for the people of Blarney.  We are talking about 6,357 people.  I have to take feedback from the areas represented by independent councillors, such as Councillor Kevin Conway, who has made it clear to me that the people of that area do not want to be brought within the city boundaries.  The people feel their voices have not been heard.  The people of Blarney certainly feel like that and I know something like 6,000 people signed a petition against this in Ballincollig.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could clarify to the people of Blarney that they will not be brought under the city council area.</p></speech>

The task was given to the implementation group to look at the maps and delineate between the areas which would be in the city in the future and the areas that would remain in the county.  Undoubtedly there was surprise when the maps were produced.  We are all politicians here, and we know that when boundary maps are produced, usually for electoral purposes, surprises often happen.  Some of them can be unhappy surprises.</p>  <p>  This is somewhat connected to the response I gave to the Deputy on the previous issue.  There already has been a designation of the areas that are expected to be in the city council for the next local election.  This also goes to the heart of the whole process of the group looking at where the boundary lines should be drawn.  I, no more than anyone in the Oireachtas, know how difficult issues about boundary lines can become.  Moving the lines goes to the very core of people's identity.  The Deputy would agree that if the proposal was to move Goleen and Ballydehob into south Kerry there would be ructions.  Some people in south Kerry might be happy about that-----</p></speech>

This agreement was subject to the inclusion of the necessary legislative provisions within the Local Government Bill 2018 and the future submission of more detailed proposals on the plebiscites and the questions to be put to the electorate, as well as the specific powers to be given to mayors.  The provisions proposed for inclusion in the Bill by this amendment facilitates the holding of the plebiscites.</p> <p> The proposed new section 32(1), inserted by amendment No. 104, contains definitions applicable to the new part 5 of "directly elected mayor", "local authority", "plebiscite" and "proposal".  "Directly elected mayor" means the cathaoirleach of a local authority elected by the electors of the authority&rsquo;s administrative area on whom is conferred some or all of the functions currently performable by the chief executive and such other functions as are provided for by legislation.  In this part, "local authority" means Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council or Galway City Council and Galway County Council together; "plebiscite" means a plebiscite of the electors of an administrative area that is required to be held under this part; and "proposal" means a proposal to provide by law for a directly elected mayor of the administrative area of a local authority.</p> <p> The new section 32(2) provides that the administrative areas for the purposes of this part are those of the five local authorities referred to.</p> <p> The new section 33, inserted by amendment No. 105, provides: in subsection (1), that the proposal is to be submitted to a plebiscite of the electors of the area to which the proposal relates; in subsection (2), that each plebiscite is to be held on the day and at the times appointed by the Minister by order; and, in subsection (3), that it be conducted in accordance with regulations made by the Minister under the new section 34(3).</p> <p> Subsection (4) states that at least 30 days before the day appointed for the plebiscite, the relevant local authority is to cause information relating to the proposal to be circulated so as to bring it to the attention of its electors.  That information is to contain a summary of the functions and office of directly elected mayors for the local authorities concerned, the likely impact on the relevant local authorities&rsquo; performance of their functions, relationships between the offices of directly elected mayor and those local authorities and with other relevant statutory bodies, the estimated cost and resource implications, the possible advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposal, any impact for the functions of any other statutory body and any other information the Minister considers appropriate, through subsection (5).  Subsection (6) requires the Minister to issue guidelines to the local authorities in relation to the information to be circulated under subsection (5).</p> <p> The new section 34, inserted by amendment No. 106, empowers the Minister, under subsection (1), to make regulations for the purpose of this part.  Subsection (2) lists a number of matters for inclusion in the regulations, including the form and wording of the ballot paper; the arrangements and requirements relating to publication of notices and the provision of information to electors; the appointment, duties and staff of the returning officer; the taking of the poll; voting and counting of votes; the maintenance of the secrecy of the ballot; the procedures to be followed in the case of misconduct, disorder, obstruction or interference; modification of electoral offence provisions applied by the new section 35; and other appropriate matters.  Under subsection (3), the regulations will require to be approved by resolution of the Oireachtas.</p> <p> The new section 35, inserted by amendment No. 107, applies to the plebiscite's relevant electoral offence articles that are contained in the local elections regulations of 1995, subject to any necessary modifications that are specified in the regulations made under the new section 34.</p> <p> The new section 36, inserted by amendment No. 108, specifies the persons entitled to vote in the plebiscites as those entitled to vote at local elections for Cork City Council, including those being transferred under this Bill from the county to the city, Galway City Council, Galway County Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council.</p> <p> Under the new section 37, inserted by amendment No. 109, within two years of the holding of the plebiscites, the Minister must submit a report to the Oireachtas specifying either legislative proposals to establish the office of directly elected mayor for any of the local authority areas concerned or his or her reasons for not submitting such proposals.</p> <p>  The new section 38, inserted by amendment No. 110, provides that the costs incurred in the holding of a plebiscite are to be borne by the local authority.</p></speech>

This is an entirely new section of the Bill and we have not had an opportunity to discuss it, or even to see it, until this evening.  I want to talk about issues that arise from it and expand upon views about which the people who vote for me feel strongly.</p>  <p>  I welcome the principle of what the Minister of State is bringing in.  He is bringing in directly elected mayors of certain local authorities, or combinations of them.  I will just talk about my own area of County Louth.  I have looked at the figures for population growth in the last census and, outside of the areas mentioned in these new sections, plus Dublin, the next largest town in the country is where I live in Drogheda.  That is followed by Swords, Dundalk, Bray, Navan and Kilkenny.  There are new changes in local government and I recognise the Minister of State has support of Members from Cork and other places for what he is doing.  I accept and acknowledge that it will not be possible in this Bill to get the outcome I want, but the Minister of State can start the process by master-planning for areas like Drogheda where there has been significant growth over the past number of years.  People may argue about the size of towns.  If, however, one compares the population of Waterford city, 53,504, with that of Drogheda, approximately 42,000, one discovers that they are relatively close.</p>  <p>  People want to be in control of their own local destiny.  Whatever decisions are made in places like Cork, and I have no issue with that, the people in south Louth, where I live, want to control their future.  Drogheda and Dundalk are major towns.  Drogheda is the sixth largest town in the country and Dundalk is the eighth largest.  These are huge urban areas.  The population of each is greater than the populations of Leitrim and Longford.  I am not arguing for changes in those counties.  They have their county managers or chief executives, the relevant infrastructure, etc., but Drogheda, the populations of which is greater than those counties, does not have that and will not get it under this legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this aspect.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State might consider a master plan that includes Drogheda, the sixth largest town in Ireland, through the urban renewal generation fund, or whatever other mechanism he can find, to fund, control and plan for proper and accountable local government in that area.  The problem that will then arise is with the area contiguous to Drogheda in County Meath.  There are different views on this.  The general population of east Meath, Drogheda and the greater Drogheda area is in excess of 80,000 and yet there is no definitive one-stop shop for administration there.  The Minister of State's second tranche of amendments will probably cover some of this.</p>  <p>  I am asking the Minister of State to come back on Report Stage, or any other appropriate time, to look at the master-planning for areas like Drogheda which need to be in control of their destiny.  They have the population and urban pressure.  They have infrastructural deficits that need to be addressed and which were not addressed in the latest round of funding from the Department.  I am not blaming the Minister of State for that and I will take the matter up with the officials later.  Would the Minister of State consider that as a constructive way of engaging with a significant need?  </p>  <p>               Finally, the spread of the greater Dublin area, GDA, is highlighted by all of those large towns, almost all of which are on the east coast adjacent to Dublin city.  They all face significant pressures that are not being dealt with.  Certainly, the existing local government infrastructure neither meets nor is accountable to the needs of their population.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.896" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#R00200"><p>When we debated a motion in the D&aacute;il to allow these amendments through, one of the concerns a number of us raised was that we only received the amendments the previous evening.  While the Minister of State had signalled his intention to bring them forward, it still gave us little time to properly scrutinise and get our heads round them.  I acknowledge that he made time for us today to go through some of them but given that we were only able to ask for that last night and schedule it today, we did not have a great deal of time.  That is no criticism of those seated on the other side of the room but it begs a question.  I will repeat some of these points when we deal with the next set of amendments because it is even more substantial.  Substantial changes to local government are being proposed by way of amendment with limited scrutiny at almost 9 p.m. in the middle of a bunch of other matters.  I am on the same side as the Minister of State on this in the sense that I am a supporter of directly elected mayors and if the powers and the relationships between those offices and the other structures of local government are correct, I would encourage people to vote for it, but the Government is making it difficult for us.</p>  <p>  The reason I say that is I was part of the mayoral reform in Dublin when the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Hogan, proposed a plebiscite in Dublin for a directly elected mayor.  Councillors from the four Dublin local authorities were asked to debate and vote on this and if all four local authorities voted in favour of the plebiscite, we would have it.  The difficulty was we were having that discussion in a vacuum.  We had no idea what the powers would be.  We had no idea whether powers would be sucked upwards from the local authorities into the office of directly elected mayor and whether powers would be devolved from Government agencies, Departments, etc.  While three of the local authorities, including mine in south Dublin, voted in favour of the plebiscite despite the fact that we did not know, the major problem in Fingal County Council was that in the absence of any certainty, the local authority was not willing to allow the proposal to go forward.  The Minister of State will tell the committee, as he did earlier, that next year we will deal with the more substantive issues of powers and relationships, etc., but that legislation will not be passed before these plebiscites.  The Government might be able to say what it would like to do if the plebiscite passes and if it gets the legislation through.  That involves many ifs and buts.  That is as sure way to lose a plebiscite or, certainly, a way to confuse the public and make it difficult for the public to engage with the issue.  I am on the Minister of State's side on the principle of this but I am genuinely concern about the sequencing of it.</p>  <p>  Given that the Minister of State is telling us that if the legislation goes through and the plebiscites pass and the people in the respective areas support the proposition, it could be up to two years before he publishes a report to set out the legislation, does that mean the timeline for directly elected mayors is subject to the passing of a plebiscite for the local government elections, not next year but subsequently?  If that is the case, why are we rushing what essentially is separate legislation in amendments to this Bill?</p>  <p>  I also have some minor concerns on which I may table amendments on Report Stage.  I would much prefer if the Minister of State would examine them because if he tables amendments in this regard, they are more likely to pass.</p>  <p>  Without opening up the Galway debate because we will have that afterwards, it is presumptuous the way Galway is inserted in this.  I understand there will be a plebiscite in the two local authority areas as they are currently constituted but if, for example, the good people of Galway city and county in their wisdom at a later stage decide to follow the Cork model and instead of a merger opt for a boundary extension, although I do not say the Minister of State would propose that, then the plebiscite in May of next year will not be valid for what the new enlarged Galway local authority.  That is a matter for folks in Galway to go through in detail.  It is none of my business as I do not represent the area but it is a significant problem under section 32.</p>  <p>  Section 33, which I raised at the briefing earlier, relates to the information to be provided.  We are aware of the difficulty we have in referenda.  An independent Referendum Commission has been set up because of the difficulties relating to Government bodies issuing information on referenda.  It is all very well to state that the local authority, following regulations from the Minister, will provide factual information but let us wait to see when we have the plebiscites whether facts become opinions and opinions become differences.  I am concerned that those regulations might not require sufficient independence in the presentation of the information that we are accustomed to in referenda.  That could just be a genuine difficulty.</p>  <p>  I do not understand the timeline in section 37.  Why two years?  Why not six months after the passing of the plebiscite?  If, for example, the good people of Cork or Limerick vote in favour of this, why wait two years?  Why not, within a relatively short period, bring forward at least the Government's outline proposals?</p>  <p>  I have a concern about costs under the new section 38.  We are being asked to impose the costs of these plebiscites on the local authority but we do not know the costs.  I raised this with the officials, who stated that they had some indicative costings.  If they could share these with the committee, that would be good.  For example, a cash-strapped local authority that has passed its estimates might have to take a decision to limit the distribution of material to fit the budget available to it when it comes to the plebiscite next year, and that could impact on the overall turnout whereas if the local authority were to decide to send literature to every house in the city or county and place new advertisements in the newspapers, the costs will become significant.  For some of the smaller local authorities, &euro;20,000 can become &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000, and while I appreciate these plebiscites will be carried out on the day of the local and European elections in order that the count and related costs will  be covered, even the dissemination of information could involve a significant cost.  Does that mean, for example, if we agree the amendment to section 38, that Galway city or Limerick city and county councils must revise their estimates, even to find &euro;20,000, &euro;50,000, &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000, depending on the cost?  If the Minister of State can reassure us on his estimations of the cost, I would be grateful.</p>  <p>  It is unclear to me why Dublin is not included.  I do not seek an amendment to include Dublin because there is a set of complexities in Dublin but many parties, including my own, would support such a proposal if the configuration is correct,.</p>  <p>  My party will not oppose this amendment, although I will, subject to the replies, at least have recorded my opposition to the proposed new section 38.  As somebody who would like to enthusiastically support this, the Minister of State is making it difficult for us.  If he is making it difficult for us, the debate in the public arena will be even more difficult for much of the electorate when it comes to the plebiscite.</p></speech>

I have a concern about the timing of something as fundamental as this being included at a late stage in the Bill.  I recognise that the Minister of State and his officials briefed members earlier.</p>  <p>  I recall the proposal of a previous Minister for a directly elected mayor in Dublin when my local authority was the only one of the four in the region that opposed it.  The reason the councillors in their wisdom did so was there was no detail as to how the directly elected mayor would operate and how the functions of that mayor would integrate with the existing local authority structures, and I agreed with them.  That question still remains.  It is happening now because we have a local election and a European election in May next year and the Department or the Government has taken a view that it would be expeditious and cost effective to have these plebiscites on the same day.  The Minister of State might clarify that.  I would like the cost element in the new section 38 clarified.</p>  <p>  I would like to understand the logic of the inclusion of the four areas the Minister of State has selected.  One could question the Minister of State's native city.  The people of Kilkenny are always at pains to tell us it is a city.  Why is the other city in this country not included?</p>  <p>  I refer to the points Deputy O'Dowd made.  I could mention Swords.  We could mention towns that are larger than cities such as Kilkenny and ask why one would do it.</p>  <p>  I would like to get a handle on the timeframe.  </p>  <p>               In the amendment to section 33 the proposal is that: &quot;For the purposes of a plebiscite, the local authority concerned shall, not later than 30 days before the day appointed under <i>subsection (2)</i>, cause information relating to the proposal to be published&quot;.  How advanced is the work within the Department on the functions of directly elected mayors?  What functions will they take from the chief executive?  What will be the term of a directly elected mayor?  Those are fundamental aspects of how a directly elected mayor would operate.  In section 33 the Department is effectively saying that we would have that information 30 days before the plebiscite but I think we need to do a lot better.  I accept the Minister is setting that as the minimum, but when people are unsure about things they generally vote against them.  As an individual who supports directly elected mayors, as does the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, we want to make sure that we are going to get this right and that it is not rushed.  The measure appears rushed.<br/><br/>The proposed section 37 deals with the reference to two years.  It states: &quot;The Minister shall, in respect of each administrative area in respect of which a plebiscite is held in accordance with this Part and not later than 2 years&quot; lay a report.  The reference is to an &quot;area in respect of which a plebiscite is held&quot;.  I take it that it means where a plebiscite is passed.</p></speech>

We want to make sure that people have the information in good time to make an educated judgment about this.  The functions are the fundamental piece behind this.  Does the Minister of State have a timeframe for bringing those proposals back to the committee and to say here is what we are looking at by way of the functions of the directly elected mayor?

I do not agree with what the Minister of State is proposing on the plebiscites for a directly elected mayor.  I have always supported the system we have in Galway.  I think it works very well.

We passed a mammoth memorandum to do with pre-legislative scrutiny on Government notices, but in the main for Bills that have approximately three sections.  Without any pre-legislative scrutiny the Minister has written a new Bill in an old Bill.  He has doubled the size of the Bill.  I could not believe it when I looked at my computer this morning to check the amendments for this evening's debate.  There are 41 pages of amendments to the Bill and there are 37 lines of text in every page.  When I pick up the Bill itself I find that it is not even 30 pages because the back page is taken up with the Long Title.  There are more pages of amendments than pages in the original Bill.</p>  <p>  I am long enough in the House to know the form.  When one comes back after the summer break or the Easter break the House is looking for something to debate for weeks and weeks.  Those of us who are around here for long enough know that nothing ever changes.  We can have all the reform we want but in those weeks we discuss reports and look for something to do and especially coming up to Christmas we suddenly have to do a year's work in two or three weeks.  This Bill adds insult to injury because not only are we doing a Bill but we are doing a Bill within a Bill.  It is Shakespearian; it is like a play within a play.  We got the amendments after Second Stage and they have significant implications.  As a Minister I once foolishly added something to a Bill after the Bill had gone through the Seanad and it was in the D&aacute;il.  It was not a major issue and although it looked very innocuous at the time it was probably the decision that caused me the most grief as Minister subsequently.  I learned that one should not trick around with the Houses or with the people.  The longer a Minister spends in a committee going through a Bill in a constructive and interactive manner, accepting changes and making amendments, the less grief the Minister will face in the future.  A Minister should never dismiss amendments, no matter who suggests them, as long as they have validity.</p>  <p>  What we are getting at the moment is a different approach.  The approach is that what we have decided we will push through.  I am astounded to find that Galway is included in the plebiscites.  We will come to the more substantive issue when we get to the opposition from my party and from a number of my colleagues to the section on the joint chief executive.  It seems to me that despite the fact that the vast majority of public representatives in Galway believe that the Government should adhere to Eoin O'Sullivan&rsquo;s report, which says money first and all other issues after that, the Government insists on trying to put the cart before the horse.  This is a very serious situation.  Rushed Christmas legislation is seen as the norm.  It is used as a device because people are busy with visitors in the House.  There are so many things going on around the place that one would want to have bilocation to get to all the events this evening.  The view is that people will take their eye off the ball, get tired and that the Bill will be passed.  </p>  <p>               The Government probably will get it passed, but if the Minister of State believes that will be the end of things, I guarantee that it will only be the beginning of the grief the Government will suffer.  It is making a major mistake in its approach.  It would have been better to introduce a separate local government Bill next year that incorporated all of these provisions.  Instead of waiting until the last minute and proceeding without any public discussion or consultation, it would have been wiser to hold off and do what we all promised at the beginning of this D&aacute;il, namely, to be open, transparent, interactive and inclusive.  It was to be new politics, there would be no more ramming things through and we would bring democracy back to Ireland.  Other elements of this Bill smack of not trusting elected representatives.  For some time, there has been a consistent theme of trying to reduce their power over matters.</p> <p> I have learned to be wary of bulky documentation and amendments where there are words and words and words.  I encountered the perfect example of this yesterday.  At a meeting with the National Transport Authority, NTA-----</p></speech>

It is dangerous not to address the issue when it arises in a form such as this.  Obviously, it is difficult early on to engage the public in light of all these dry words, but it will have massive consequences.  At a meeting with the NTA yesterday, I sought an explanation as to why the cost per kilometre of fares to Claregalway or Carraroe is twice the cost of fares to Oranmore or anywhere in Galway city.  According to the chief executive of the NTA, the fundamental reason is the national planning framework in that people would be encouraged to live outside the cities if bus fares were fairer.  When we passed the national spatial strategy, we might not have realised that the effect of doing so would lock us into a double-fare basis for those who live outside the magic circle.  Like that situation, I am convinced that, if we pass this Bill as is and opt for plebiscites in Galway, we will eventually find that there were many hidden agendas because the Government was afraid that, if it was upfront with the people, they would reject them.</p></speech>

The first line of the report on Galway points out that it needs funding.  Some moves are afoot and the Minister of State has had two meetings with us, for which we thank him, but this is not just a question of &euro;500,000 or &euro;1 million, it is a question of many millions of euro.  That has been pointed out to him.</p>  <p>  There is a major concern in rural areas of Galway.  The municipal districts are under pressure.  Unfortunately, populations in particular areas are not what they once were.  We must face the fact that some rural villages will go into decline.  Representation in such places is important.  We must ensure that money is ring-fenced to try to keep them vibrant.  All politicians are trying to ignite small villages in rural areas, including in Galway.</p>  <p>  We are putting the cart before the horse.  It is fine if the changes in Cork are going to go through - the Opposition supports them - but I do not know much about Cork.  We will vote on those changes but we will know damn all about them.  The people from Cork know more about them than any of us.  In terms of Galway, though, the changes need to be well thought out and done right.  The first step is to put the money in place so that Galway is on a level playing field.  It is agreed by nearly everyone that the system of allocations is flawed.  We need to right that for Galway and every other county that has not got its fair share.  Galway borders many counties and has many peripheral areas.  Every Deputy and councillor is working hard to try to pull a few quid to those areas.</p>  <p>  By its nature, Galway city will expand.  It is already nearly out to Barna.  There does not seem to be a plan for Galway.  I would have a Luas or something in it.  The outer bypass is being built but transport infrastructure is needed.  I can get to Dublin as quickly as I can drive to Galway, which is only 40 miles away from my home.  That is not a good situation for people who travel to the city in the mornings.</p>  <p>  Those in Galway's peripheral areas are very worried that they will become the forgotten people.  Regardless of whether we like it, the city will extend out past Oranmore.  That is a fact.  The areas in question will become more prosperous, which is good and no one would disagree with it, but there would then need to be extra city councillors who would look after their own areas.  I do not know much about mayors in different places, but my understanding is that there were many problems in Limerick.  People have referred to Tipperary.  What are the Minister of State's thoughts in that regard?</p>  <p>  We are from Galway and we do not know enough about Cork.  I mean no disrespect, but it would be like someone from Cork talking about Galway in that he or she would not know the ins and outs.  Galway deserves something of its own.  There is no such thing as "we are willing to engage" - we are actually willing to work with the Minister of State.  The first lines of the report say enough.  They basically say, "Show me the money".</p></speech>

It is wrong.  Galway should not be included in the Bill at all.  It is a simple matter.  Galway has been included in the Bill and the reason for that leads to a lack of trust.  We are now discussing plebiscites.  I am not against plebiscites in general but I have an issue with the manner in which this is being done and the extra stuff we are to be given.  I will not repeat what I stated in the D&aacute;il.  However, this is a cynical exercise meant to deflect us from the real problems on the ground in Galway, which I will address when speaking to the amendment.</p></speech>

The budget for Galway was not passed last Monday when it was supposed to have been.  This was because the council does not have the funds to pass the budget and it is not the first year but the third year it has found itself in this position.  None of us is against a plebiscite but the lack of trust among all the sitting councillors in Galway is unbelievable.  The further one goes away from the city and into the rural communities, the more one feels aghast at the disparity between city and county.  The fact that this has found its way in with Cork has increased the distrust.  I attended all the meetings around the merger and the report stated at the outset that funding was required so I am here to say, "Show us the money".  This comes at a price and this is what councillors are looking for.  I am representing them as their voice.</p></speech>

I support Deputies Fitzmaurice, Connolly and Rabbitte on this issue.  There is a major problem with funding and offering a small amount of money to the various municipal districts is not much of a carrot because the deficit is so big.  The city and the county have a total population of roughly 320,000, which is very large, with 275,000 in the rural areas.</p></speech>

I checked the figures yesterday.  It would be no harm to verify them.  Whether it is 250,000 or 300,000, it is a huge number of people and we need real planning and real money.  The local authority does not have any faith in the system.  Outlying areas such as Ballinasloe, which I represent, have felt completely left out for years.  There are 79,000 people in the city.</p></speech>

Numbers often do not add up and perhaps that is at the heart of this discussion.</p>  <p>  In reply to Deputy O'Dowd, the amendments were circulated on Monday evening.  Other Deputies have stated that more time would be desirable but it was firmly indicated on Second Stage that there would be amendments in respect of the plebiscite and on urban area committees.  The plebiscite chunk of amendments concern the actual structure of how a plebiscite would run and the subsequent actions the Minister of the day might take.  It would be inappropriate to spell out what powers the directly elected mayor might have.</p>  <p>  In early 2019, perhaps in February of that year, the Government intends to consider a memo, though it has not been drafted yet.  I suggest we have either a meeting of the joint committee or statements in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I am perfectly prepared to do this for as many hours as necessary because there is not as much to divide parties on the issue of direct election as there is on other issues.  It would be good to have this well in advance of when the memo goes in so that we can feed into it.  Once the memo is adopted it can form the basis of the information to be made available to the public in advance of plebiscites taking place.</p>  <p>  Members asked questions about timelines.  It is stated that it must be done within 30 days but that does not mean it will be done on the 31st day.  It is a statutory minimum.  Another issue concerns reporting within two years.  If the plebiscites are held and rejected, the reports should be short and sweet, and very quick.  The report on actions to be taken if the plebiscite has a positive result would be more lengthy but it puts a backstop to it.  As Deputies &Oacute; Broin and O'Brien stated , this discussion has been taking place for years in Dublin but there has never been an end point.  The plebiscite issue would have an end point of two years but it would not be my intention to make this a minimum period.  In fact, it would be a maximum.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dowd asked about urban area committees.  Part 6, which comprises four sections, speaks to that issue.  It is a big issue in the Deputy's part of the world, with a huge chunk of Drogheda in County Meath.  A huge chunk of Waterford city is in Kilkenny but we will not go into too much detail on that.  I only looked at the headline issues in the applications which were made by the different local authorities and, as I understand it, some local authorities opted out of making any decisions themselves under the urban regeneration fund and put in nine or ten applications.  That is not the basis on which to secure funding for anything.  Some local authorities put in very specific proposals and secured funding but the Drogheda relief road was not, to the lay person, urban regeneration.  A master plan for Drogheda, or for any town, would very much be part of urban regeneration.   The application system will open again next February.  Before Report Stage, I will speak to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for planning issues, Deputy English, regarding the reasonable suggestion that areas which have been designated under the national planning framework as areas for development should get more resources to allow them to pursue that development.</p>  <p>  In answer to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, there will be a memo in January and I have no problem having a debate in committee or elsewhere.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about pre-legislative scrutiny but my understanding is that the committee did not seek prelegislative scrutiny on this.  The Galway proposal was in it when the decision was made so I cannot be accused of not being available.  There have been multiple meetings on this issue and there will be many more but it is factually incorrect to talk about prelegislative scrutiny as the committee made a decision not to do it.  It is not my fault nor the fault of my officials.  I am not saying it is the committee's fault because this is a particularly busy committee.  In fact, there is great merit in the idea of local government having its own full committee because of the amount of stuff that comes before the committee.  </p>  <p>               The Cabinet adopted a report about three months ago.  It was one of the first reports I presented to Cabinet and it was on the issue of directly elected mayors.  It received some publicity in the newspapers and it was submitted to the committee for consideration.  The committee is busy and it was not considered by it.  That is not my fault or the committee's fault because it is grappling primarily with housing.  It is also not a fair criticism to say that the discussion did not happen.</p> <p> There are certain time sensitivities associated with this Bill, not least the fact that people will contest local elections next year.  In Cork, people who are considering running want certainty about boundaries.  There are issues about the establishment of electoral registers, which we mentioned with regard to an earlier section of the Bill.  I know the point that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is making about rushing legislation.  I have been here for 16 years and there is always a pre-Christmas rush.  We have been looking to get on the schedule with the Business Committee for a long time.  I would say to all members who have representatives on the Business Committee that we want their support to get legislation to the committee more quickly.  Now that we are here, we should have the discussion.  It is not any effort on our part to stop it from coming to this point.</p> <p> Deputy Grealish spoke of a merger.  If the merger goes ahead, it should and will be in a separate Bill.  There will be a local government Bill 2019 next year, which will primarily be about Galway, but like all other local government Bills, there will be other sections relating to other aspects of local government.  It is an area in which there is legislation which often refers to different issues.  Galway will have its own Bill next year.  The Deputy does not agree with directly elected mayors and I would suggest that many people in local government do not agree with them.  There is no answer.  People differ and the public will decide ultimately.  Galway was included in this Bill with regard to chief executives because all the mergers that have happened in Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary started with the appointment of a joint chief executive officer.  I will go into some detail on what we propose to do with regard to funding.  When I got this position, about 18 months ago, there was a significant long-running problem in the funding of Galway County Council.  It stems partly from the fact that the city council established in 1985 had an impact on the funding for the county.  It was never dealt with properly.  I will speak about that later.</p> <p> Deputy Eugene Murphy spoke about issues which I will come back to, including finance, as did Deputy Fitzmaurice.  He spoke about the understanding in Limerick.  One can ask our Oireachtas colleagues in Limerick about it.  The city has transformed.  Whether it is transformed by the merger of the local authorities or not-----</p></speech>

There is a geographic issue in Galway.  It is a huge county.  Deputy Connolly mentioned this on Second Stage.  The geographic area will not change much.  The population is obviously changing.  How do we ensure that we create a powerhouse on the west coast?  I would see a united local authority as being a leading part in transforming the fortunes, particularly of County Galway.  Many of those towns and villages have become dormitory towns.  Their centres are gone because people are doing their shopping and business in Galway city.  That is an argument in itself for having a single, unified local authority.  I do not know if Deputy Connolly is necessarily aiming this at me.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  When one looks at the county and city of Galway, where the city is doing okay and the county has, in certain areas, suffered for a long time, it is partly due to funding of the local authority but partly due to planning and the lack of retail, business and infrastructure in those towns and villages in County Galway.  I think a unified local authority will benefit those places that have become dormitory towns which we want to become functioning towns again in the future.  That is the purpose of the Galway change from my point of view.  I do not want to be seen as bullying anything through.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned it and threatened grief on me afterwards.  There is no attempt to bully.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 111 contains definitions applicable to the new part 6, including &quot;urban area&quot;, which is to be construed under the following subsection, and &quot;greater urban area&quot;, which means an urban area and any other part of a local authority area that is designated by an urban area committee under the new section 41. </p><p>Section 39(2) provides that an area aligned with the administrative area of more than one local authority is an urban area if it has a population of between 1,500 and 100,000, dwellings are spaced no more than 100 m apart and the population applicable to each of the component local authorities amounts to at least 15% of the total or 1,500 persons. </p><p>The new section 40 inserted by amendment No. 112 requires the establishment of urban area committees by those local authorities in which the urban area is situated within six months of the commencement of the section.  Members are to be appointed by the local authorities involved in the urban area and are to consist of the cathaoirligh of the local authorities concerned; three other ordinary members of each local authority, who will be selected in respect of the local electoral areas where the urban area is located; and between two and four people who are not councillors and who have experience and expertise in areas of transport provision, housing provision, infrastructure development or business and trade, nominated by the cathaoirligh in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister in subsections (3), (4) and (5).  In accordance with subsection (11), the members who are not councillors are non-voting and cannot be the chair.  The chairperson of the urban area committee is to be appointed from among the members by the members, unless the members fail to do so within two weeks of their appointment to the committee, in which case the Minister will appoint a chairperson.  </p><p>The urban area committees are to hold as many meetings as are necessary for their functions, and their local authorities are to set the date and place of the first meeting of the committees.  Committee meetings are to be chaired by the chairperson, if present, or else by a member chosen by those present.  Questions are to be determined by a majority of the voting members, with the chairperson having a casting vote.  The meeting quorum is four voting members.  </p><p>Subsection (12) provides that the committees may act notwithstanding membership vacancies and subsection (13) provides that they may regulate their procedures, subject to this section.  In accordance with subsection (15), administrative support to the committee is to be provided by members of staff selected by the committee from nominations made by the two local authorities in consultation with each other.  Subsection (16) requires the assignment of support staff to perform functions on behalf of the committee under its direction and control.</p><p>Amendment No. 113 inserts a new section 41.  It relates to the designation of the greater urban area and local area planning.  Subsection (1) provides that an urban area committee may designate any part of a local authority administrative area that adjoins the urban area for the purpose of this section, dealing with its functions.  Subsection (2) provides that if the committee has not made such a designation within three months of its appointment the Minister may make the designation by order.  Subsection (3) provides that the functions of the planning authority under chapter II of part II of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which concerns local area planning, are to be performed by the urban area committee in relation to an urban area, and subsection (4) provides similarly in relation to a greater urban area. </p><p>The main function of the urban area committee will be the production of the local area plan for the cross-boundary urban area and its contiguous areas as designated by the committee, including the appropriate zoning as an explicit function.  In the case of these towns and cities, the current position whereby the local area plan is required to be consistent with the local authority's development plan will be reversed, and the development plan content for both local authorities will have to follow on from, and be consistent with, a local area plan made for the cross-boundary area. </p><p>It will not be possible for either local authority to amend or revoke the local area plan approved by the committee.  Transferring responsibility for local area planning to the urban area committees in this way necessitated a number of provisions to adapt how the local area planning provisions within the Planning and Development Acts are to operate in respect of the committees.Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) in subsection (3) accordingly amend or adapt how sections 18 to 20 of the 2000 Act apply to urban area committees performing local area planning functions for the urban area.  Subsection (4) applies many of the subsection (3) modifications to the performance of local area planning functions for the greater urban area and also adds a number of additional adaptations in that subsection's paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>).  </p>  <p>               Subsection (5) disapplies section 131A(1) of the Local Government Act, 2001, which relates to the performance of reserved functions in respect of municipal district members and part 2 of the associated Schedule 14A includes local area planning functions from the urban area committee functions prescribed in this section.</p> <p> The final section in this part - the new section 42 &ndash; is an amendment of section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 114.  It amends section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to add a new subsection (11) providing that a provision in a development plan that is inconsistent with a local area plan made by an urban area committee under this Act shall not have effect in relation to the urban or greater urban area concerned.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that they are coming so late and I want to put on record that we might need to make amendments to these on Report Stage.  I hope the Minister of State will accept those amendments on Report Stage because we have not had a chance to have a decent discussion on this whole section.</p>  <p>  I assume this urban committee is made up of the two cathaoirligh from each administrative area, six councillors and two to four members of society, based on auditing.  I have a slight concern as to why we need four members of society at this stage on a committee when we trust our local councillors to adopt local area plans, to adopt county plans and to adopt regional plans at assembly level.  Why are we bringing in private people at this stage to a democratic process that has served us well in the past?  I would like to get some of the reasoning behind that.</p>  <p>  It is equally being said that the private sector has no voting rights if I am reading the Bill correctly.  On the election of the chairman of that committee, do they have a say at that point?  I ask  because it states: "The chairperson of an urban area committee shall be appointed from among the members".  It does not say anything about voting rights in that respect.</p>  <p>  What sort of powers are being given to this urban committee?  I am not sure if it has to follow the same rules as the local authority when it comes to local area plans or county development plans.  Is it short-circuiting that process?  At one point it is proposed that "For the purpose of this section, an urban area committee may designate any part or parts adjoining the urban area concerned of an administrative area of a local authority in which part of the urban area is situated."  Is the Minister of State proposing that without any consultation, this committee has the power to expand the boundaries wherever it deems fit?</p>  <p>  When this committee does its own urban area plan, must it follow the same procedure as a local area plan or a county development plan or can it short-circuit that process?</p></speech>

This was designed to fix a particular problem and the difficulty is that the way this is designed may work for some areas and not for others.  Alternatively, it may work for one part of a geographical area that would become one of these urban area committees but we do not have the opportunity to tease that out with those organisations or individuals.  While I can see the logic in introducing the measures on plebiscites, particularly with the deadline for registration, I am still at a loss as to why we are dealing with this significant proposed change to our local government structures in this way.</p>  <p>  If I read it right, there could be an urban area committee that is made up of a very large geographical portion of one county and a very small geographical portion of another county but they will have exactly the same number of representatives.  There is a democracy question around the proportionality of the representation that they have.  As the voter base difference can be very substantial, I ask the Minister of State to clarify that with as much detail as possible in order that we know where the upper and lower limits of all that would be.</p>  <p>  While the only voting members of the committee are elected members, there is no guidance on those elected members being in some way representative of the councils that they come from.  For example, if one party has a simple majority in the council, it could dominate all three elected positions, rather than having something that is proportionate.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify exactly how that would work.</p>  <p>  I refer to the staff in the proposed new section 40(16).  Correct me if I am wrong, because we have only had two days to read this, but it seems to be that the staff requirements can be decided by the committee, irrespective of whether the city or county manager or the chief executives approve.  I do not understand how that works from a HR, staff management and resources point of view.  Who will replace those staff for a period?</p>  <p>  There also does not seem to be any level of consultation with the elected members of the broader electoral authorities.  Again, I ask the Minister of State to correct me if I am reading it wrong.  The super-committee of eight, with two chairs and six ordinary members, will agree the plan, but as an extension of Deputy Casey's question, does it have to go back to its two respective local authorities to get that approved?  Does it approve it itself?  How is that process outlined?</p>  <p>  I refer to the issue of costs.  This committee will make profound decisions.  By the way, it might make really good decisions and decisions that are very popular but the local authorities will have to bear the costs of those decisions.  Is that the most democratic way of doing it and how is all of that determined?  The same issue arises with zonings.  There could be very controversial decisions on zonings, which could raise all sorts of complicated issues and I am not clear around all of that.</p>  <p>  I am very uncomfortable with amendment No.-----</p></speech>

I am genuinely interested in the logic of that and what was the thought process.  I am not convinced that there has been sufficient consultation with the elected representatives and the managers in the affected areas.  Can the Minister of State tell us the areas to which this will apply in the first instance and what engagement there has been with the elected representatives there on this specific proposal?  I am not asking about what consultation happened in terms of the boundary reviews previously but specifically on this point.  I may come back with a supplementary question on that.</p>  <p>  Without wanting to recommence the war, given the difficult week the Minister of State has had in the courts, could he give us a real life example of how this works?  Whether it would controversially be the Minister of State's area or another area, I ask him to talk us through how he sees it because I am thinking of-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.993" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#EE00200"><p>Like previous speakers, I am not a member of the committee but I am concerned about the proposed Part 6 of the Bill and the urban areas being proposed.  It would have been better if it was brought forward as a stand-alone Bill because at least then there would be an opportunity to properly tease out what it all means and the implications of the proposed Part 6 for local authorities.  It would have provided the opportunity to consult with the stakeholders and also to have a consultation process.  I am a bit concerned it has been brought forward as an amendment to a Bill that deals with something else.  It will cause concern for councils across the State that will be affected by it.</p>  <p>  I have a number of questions that flow from the amendments because there are a number of things that are not clear.  It states the urban area committee shall appoint members from local authorities - six in total.  I imagine if there are two local authorities, it would be three from each.  What does it mean by "appoint"?  Are they elected by the members of the local authorities?  How are they appointed?  How does it work?  What is the relationship with the local authority when they are appointed or elected?  It also states the people who are appointed should have experience and expertise in the provision of transport and housing and the development of infrastructure, business and trade.  Who determines that?  Who determines what expertise is and what experience is?  Will it be more defined?  </p>  <p>  I have a concern about the making and amending of local area plans.  Perhaps I am wrong and the Minister of State might clarify it for me.  It seems to suggest that, once established, these urban committees can formulate their own separate local area plans that could supersede local area plans already agreed by local authorities.  It would be very problematic and cause a lot of tension and difficulties for local councils and their CEOs.  How it will work needs to be properly explained.  It also refers to "a local area plan prepared by a planning authority insofar as it applies to the urban area in respect of which that urban area committee was appointed."  It causes me concern.  </p>  <p>  Another area of concern is in the area of development plans.  It seems to suggest the urban committee could amend development plans that are crafted democratically by local councils.  How will that work out?  I am struggling to come up with an example of how it will work.  Waterford-Kilkenny is a good example.  I think the Minister of State would agree the population of the metropolitan area of Waterford city is 45,000.  If this was put in place for the Waterford-Kilkenny area so that it included the part of Kilkenny known as Ferrybank, the urban area committee would then cover an area with a population of 50,000, the vast majority of which would be in Waterford.  If there were three representatives from Waterford and three from Kilkenny it would not be seen as very democratic and would be highly problematic.</p>  <p>  What consultation has there been with the CEOs of any of these councils?  What consultation has there been with the elected members?  I contacted a number of elected members from all parties from Waterford and none of them was aware of the amendments or what it would mean.  What engagement was there with the representative bodies of local councillors?</p>  <p>  For all those reasons, notwithstanding whether or not there is logic to what the Minister of State is proposing, although I have some concerns about it, it should be brought forward as a stand-alone Bill.  My suggestion is to withdraw the amendments, come back with a stand-alone Bill and let us have the full consultation and Second Stage contributions.  If the Minister of State feels there is logic to it, it can be teased out and people can put forward legitimate and proper amendments.  Tabling amendments in this way to a Bill that has already passed Second Stage is not the way to deal with a very complicated and contentious issue.  It will be treated with suspicion for that reason.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendments and come back with a stand-alone Bill.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.994" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120500002#EE00300"><p>I agree with much of what Deputy Cullinane said.  These changes are very significant and in many respects could be very positive.  I see the objective, particularly in areas that cross council boundaries.  It is a question I had.  I thank the Minister of State's officials for the list of the eight urban area committees.  How were they selected?  Is it restricted to those eight?  I could give examples of many others that cross council administrative boundaries in the four Dublin local authorities, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others could.  If I take the Clongriffin area between Fingal and Dublin city, it is a massive area.  An urban area committee such as this would be a very positive thing there.  Fringe committees, such as the northern and southern fringe committees, tend not to work.  They tend to be run by officials.  There are no elected members on them.  There is no buy-in.  There is much to the concept.  </p>  <p>               I have some questions.  I am conscious of the time but something as significant as this deserves more scrutiny than we are able to give it in the time available.  The municipal district councils are not mentioned in this section.  On the appointments to the urban area committees, will the three members from each local authority be from the municipal district councils in the relevant areas or will they be drawn from anywhere in the councils?  That is not specified.  Perhaps I am missing it but I cannot see it.  It is fine if it is there, but it would better if it was stated that members would come from the municipal districts in the relevant areas.  <br/><br/>There is also the matter of the ratio of members.  In circumstances such as the Waterford and Kilkenny case I discussed with Deputy &Oacute; Broin or a case involving the transfer of a small portion of one local authority into another, will a three-and-three split between the two authorities still be allowed or will the split be proportionate?  If it is not proportionate, there will be a much greater weight of numbers from one local authority compared with the other.<br/><br/>There is also the issue of the appointment of the four laypersons, for want of a better phrase, who will be experts in four specified areas.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane on this.  Who decides that someone has experience and expertise in these four areas?  I have no fear of having non-elected people involved and I know these appointees will not have a vote, which was my initial concern.  While it is good that they will provide advice at committee level, given that these laypersons do not have a mandate, it is right they do not have a vote.<br/><br/>On local area plans and development plans, section 48(3)(<i>a</i>) allows for the insertion of a new section 17A on definitions in the Planning and Development Act 2000.  It seems that an urban area committee may at any time prepare a local area plan.  How does that work with the sequencing of development plans and the preparation of local area plans in local authorities?  The former are currently submitted to the Department.  Do the local area plans supersede the development plan in these areas?  From my reading of this, that seems to be the case, although I may be incorrect.  If an urban area committee decides to bring in a local area plan, do changes made in that plan automatically carry over to the development plans of the two local authorities in question?  Will the council members, who now have the reserved function for development plans, have to ratify those changes?<br/><br/>Many questions arise.  While the thinking behind this amendment is very good, it was only produced yesterday.  I would like more time to add to this because I think we can work out something that would be very good.  This could work in other urban areas besides the eight that have been selected.  If we worked on this together as a committee, I do not envisage delaying the Bill until after Christmas.  I do not think we necessarily need separate legislation.  Perhaps we could address this again on Report Stage.  I do not want to be negative about this but I have many unanswered questions.  There is much good in it but perhaps more work is needed before Report Stage.  Some input from the other parties and members of the committee should be allowed to strengthen the Bill.<br/><br/>I promise this is my final point.  Deputy Cullinane wondered if there had been consultation with the members or chief executives of the local authorities in the eight urban areas that have been selected.  It is important to ask their views because this is significant and potentially very positive legislation.  I am not raising any of these questions from a negative standpoint.  </p></speech>

In counties Louth and Meath the two county councils met and decided they needed an area plan which covered both jurisdictions.  When that happened, the plan was produced and published and people on the councils bought into it.  However, the local district committee did not agree with it because it did not like the zoning provided in it.  The legal decision was that the consensus of the officials of Meath County Council and Louth County Council in the area plan was null and void and had no status.  The local area committee then rezoned hundreds of acres.  This is a major scandal in planning in east Meath.  That is what the laughing was about, but that is the problem the Minister of State is trying to address.</p></speech>

The areas I mentioned earlier have experienced some of the problems in the areas the Minister of State has identified.  Drogheda and Bray are on that list but Swords, Dundalk, Navan and Kilkenny are not on it.  Those are the biggest towns.  The point I raised earlier holds water.  The reason for this is the increase in the urban areas, particularly around Dublin.  I do not disagree with the idea but how and by whom will it be initiated?  Must both councils initiate it and must they both agree?  Another issue is that planning is not included along with transport, housing, infrastructure and business and trade as one of the areas for people outside of the elected members with specialist expertise.  It should be included.</p>  <p>  If a group is around a table, will they have equal status in terms of voting on the plan?  There will also be problems between elected and non-elected members.  I am not against the proposal in principle.  However, I know of a case where consensus was achieved among county councils but it did not work.  The difficulty I foresee is where municipal districts in the councils do not buy into this.  In a co-joint area, would the municipal districts in the councils make the recommendations or would it be the whole council?  It is important to clarify that because there could be a difference of opinion.  The municipal district might not want this.  Difficulties could arise in scenarios similar to the one I outlined in the case of counties Meath and Louth.  I, too, welcome the discussion in principle but we need to think this through.  Perhaps it can be fleshed out on Report Stage.</p>  <p>  There are serious dangers with this proposal because the areas can have as many as 99,999 people living in them.  The point is well made about moving outside of a small map.  The area covered could be very large.  In parallel with this, a paper is needed on why those eight towns were selected.  I am not disagreeing with the selection as it reflects my own point of view.  However, this needs to be planned because in some cases an area committee could be set up when what is needed is a complete reform of the whole functional area of the council.  It is late in the day to be discussing this but there are important issues here.  I welcome the Bill in principle but I would like to tease out these issues, if possible. </p></speech>

If I had not noticed two issues in the Bill, one in Galway and another that came up yesterday, I probably would not have engaged in detail.  </p>  <p>               I do not think anybody can argue with the idea, whether it is Carlow, Athlone or wherever, of trying to have some creative planning between the two parts of the town.  That has to be grappled with.  The basic idea of a committee is fine but we all know that the devil is in the detail.  Big, broad policy is very easy.  It is the implementation and the detail that are the difficult parts.  There are a number of serious trends here that I would worry are a precursor for a much wider application of a new process.  If there is a little bit of one county with a massive part of another, for example a little bit of Kilkenny in with Waterford, how are they going to divide up the elected members?  I am not going to repeat what was said.  I do not like corporatism as a form of government.  I really like democracy.  I like its egalitarianism whereby the so-called least in our society in terms of the elites have the same shout as those who have the PhDs and all the other things after their names.  The life I have led has been very interesting.  Having moved from a middle class Dublin upbringing, where most of my family and classmates had access to third level education at a time when not everybody did, to the west of Ireland, I found the ordinary people who had been to that greatest of universities, the universities of life, could buy and sell me thought-wise, in terms of foresight, any day of the week.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1032" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#A00300"><p>I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting and recording equipment, even when left in silent mode.  </p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 32 for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation which was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee on 21 November with an instruction to report back to it not later than 12 December.  I welcome the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and her officials and thank them for the briefing material provided for the committee.  I propose that the Minister make a brief address to the committee and that we then consider the relevant subheads in the Supplementary Estimate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  When contributing I ask members to indicate the subhead to which they wish to refer and the relevant page in the Department's briefing material, if possible.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1033" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to present to the select committee my Department's Supplementary Estimate for 2018.  I convey the apologies of my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Halligan and Breen, who, unfortunately, cannot attend owing to other engagements.  </p> <p>  I understand my officials have provided the committee secretariat with a briefing note which sets out the background to the Supplementary Estimate.  I propose to spend a few moments in bringing committee members through the detail of it.  As they will have seen in the briefing note, the Supplementary Estimate does not involve the provision of additional Exchequer moneys over and above the &euro;870.96 million voted to my Department in the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume; rather, permission is sought to redistribute &euro;26.37 million in savings in the Department's Vote this year to support a number of enterprise and innovation initiatives.  The Supplementary Estimate is technical in nature, as the aforementioned package of &euro;26.37 million was provided for from within the moneys already voted to my Department.  As advised, it is proposed that the &euro;26.37 million package be redistributed to fund a number of focused enterprise and innovation initiatives.  Specifically, the Supplementary Estimate will provide an additional &euro;15.63 million in enterprise supports, including funding of &euro;15 million to roll out the first phase of the future growth loan scheme, as well as additional funding of &euro;160,000 to support the credit guarantee scheme and &euro;470,000 to support the local enterprise offices.  The remaining &euro;10.74 million of the Supplementary Estimate package will be targeted at supporting the Department's innovation programme, including by providing additional capital funding of &euro;8.74 million for Science Foundation Ireland to fund critically needed research projects and a further &euro;2 million for the programme of research in third level institutions to discharge liabilities in cycle 5 of the programme.  </p> <p>  As announced in the budget, my Department has worked with the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and the European Investment Bank group to develop a long-term credit facility for businesses to enable them to invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment.  To that end, the future growth loan scheme will provide funding of &euro;300 million for eligible businesses to meet their long-term credit needs for investment purposes.  The Exchequer contribution to the scheme will involve funding of &euro;37 million from my Department and &euro;25 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which will allow the SBCI to leverage an overall fund of up to &euro;300 million from the European Investment Fund.  Under the scheme, a percentage of the loan portfolio will be guaranteed by the State, thereby increasing the risk appetite of the finance providers.</p><p>The scheme will also leverage a counter guarantee from the EIB thus reducing the overall risk of exposure to the State.  In this regard, 80% of the loan portfolio would be guaranteed by SBCI supported by funding from my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is intended that this will be offset by a 64% guarantee from the EIB group through the European Fund for Strategic Investment reducing the overall cost to the State.  Due to the bespoke nature of the proposed arrangement with the European Investment Fund, I, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, together with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, will need to enter into a mandate agreement with the European Investment Fund.  This represents the first time the Ministers have entered into such an agreement and as such, will require primary legislation.  </p><p> The committee will be aware that necessary legislation permitting Ministers to enter into such agreements has been introduced in the House and I look forward to discussing details of the legislation with members on Committee Stage next week.  With the co-operation of the committee, it is hoped that the legislation will be enacted before the end of the year, which, in turn, will facilitate the introduction of the future growth loan scheme in early 2019.  The scheme will provide low-cost loans for terms of between eight and ten years, which are currently not readily available on the market.  No collateral will be required for loans of &euro;500,000 or less.  The scheme will include the primary agriculture and seafood sectors and will be easy to access, competitively priced and contain more favourable terms than current offerings on the market.  An open call process to select the participating finance providers for the future growth loan scheme is expected to start before year end.  The provision of &euro;15 million through the Supplementary Estimate will ensure that the necessary funding is in place to roll out the first phase of the scheme, which is expected to launch in 2019.  The scheme is expected to run for three years from its launch date.  The new future growth loan scheme represents a significant addition to the suite of existing finance supports that have been developed by my Department to specifically meet the identified needs of businesses, particularly those SMEs and micro-enterprises impacted by Brexit, including the revised credit guarantee scheme, the Microfinance Ireland scheme, the Enterprise Ireland seed and venture capital scheme and the short-term Brexit working capital loan scheme.  </p><p> In terms of existing supports, provision is also being made in the Supplementary Estimates package to provide an additional &euro;160,000 in 2018 to support the revised credit guarantee scheme.  The credit guarantee scheme provides for State risk sharing with the banks thereby supporting SMEs in accessing bank finance.  Over the past five and a half years, the scheme has encouraged banks to sanction 580 facilities and approve over &euro;93 million in loans and thus has helped to create and maintain more than 3,650 jobs.  A detailed review of the scheme was undertaken to make the guarantee more accessible to SMEs and open to other finance providers and products.  The revised scheme was formally launched in July 2018.  The revisions of the scheme focused on encouraging more lending to SMEs and in particular, addressing a number of identified barriers to SMEs accessing mainstream finance, including difficulties in proving adequate collateral, novel business markets and re-financing requirements arising from the exit of an existing SME lender from the Irish market.  </p><p> Some of the key features of the revised scheme include the availability of a facility of between &euro;10,000 up to &euro;1 million, terms of up to seven years and the availability of different types of facilities such as term loans, demand loans and performance bonds.  The figure of &euro;160,000 being provided through the Supplementary Estimate will in part further support the guarantee under which claims from the finance providers are paid in respect of any increase in defaulting loans arising from increased activity under the revised scheme.  The additional funding will also help to cover the once-off set-up costs arising from the launch of the revised scheme.  </p><p> The other enterprise support in the Supplementary Estimate relates to the local enterprise offices, which are being provided with an additional &euro;470,000 in capital moneys to enable them to meet the increasing demand for their services, particularly in the area of mentoring, training and development programmes.  The local enterprise offices are one of the primary regional enterprise supports for entrepreneurs, early stage promoters, start-ups and small businesses looking to expand.  The local enterprise offices are focused on helping people to deliver on their business ideas thereby ensuring the development of local enterprise putting local micro-businesses and small businesses at the heart of job creation in Ireland.  The additional &euro;470,000 will be targeted at specific Brexit-related requests for support from the local enterprise offices.  These include increasing requests for technical assistance from micro-exporters, supporting market diversification in qualifying businesses and developing new export market opportunities.  They also include a greater demand for LEAN for micro support to help businesses to adopt lean business practices and increase competitiveness together with the roll out of additional Brexit seminars and raising businesses' awareness regarding their exposure and to develop robust Brexit plans.  </p><p> As advised, the Supplementary Estimates package includes an additional &euro;10.74 million in innovation supports.  It is intended that this additional funding will be directed at two important innovation programmes, namely, Science Foundation Ireland's research infrastructure programme and cycle five of the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutions.  This will provide much-needed additional capital investment into the research system and in particular into our universities and colleges.  This &euro;10.74 million will be distributed by providing an additional &euro;8.7 million for Science Foundation Ireland's research infrastructure programme and a further &euro;2 million to meet existing commitments under cycle five of the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutions.  Research infrastructure is a vital tool for our research communities in conducting research and fostering innovation in their fields.  Included here is specialist equipment that is essential for high-quality research, particularly in STEM disciplines.  The Science Foundation Ireland research infrastructure call is currently the principal mechanism for funding research equipment needed by our colleges.  We are keen to support as many of the high quality proposals that have been reviewed for quality and impact by Science Foundation Ireland.  The additional &euro;8.7 million will allow Science Foundation Ireland to fund a number of additional projects from its 2018 research infrastructure call over and above those that will be funded through Science Foundation Ireland's existing capital allocation.  The host institutions - NUI Maynooth, Trinity College Dublin, the Tyndall National Institute at University College Cork - will benefit from the increased allocation.  The additional &euro;2 million for cycle five of the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutions will address existing financial commitments under that programme.  The Programme of Research in Third Level Institutions has facilitated Ireland's higher education institutions to produce world-class research in strategic areas such as biomedical sciences, ICT, energy, environment, advanced communications and materials and has been a very important programme for creating the foundation investment upon which investments by Science Foundation Ireland and our other funding agencies now build.  A total of 33 capital building projects were funded under cycle five and are all complete.  A total of 13 structured PhD programmes were also funded providing over 330 PhD student places.  The payment of &euro;2 million from the Supplementary Estimate will further reduce our outstanding commitments under cycle five of the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutions.  The additional &euro;10.74 million being provided to the Department's innovation programmes through this Supplementary Estimate will help us to deliver on our Innovation 2020 targets and commitments and will contribute to job creation and enterprise growth.  This investment can be considered alongside recent increases in the past number of budgets in the funding for the Department's innovation programme not least in budget 2019, which has ensured that the Department is in a position to roll out.  Regarding the commencement of the new &euro;500 million disruptive technologies innovation fund through an allocation of &euro;20 million in 2019, a new programme of investment in PhD research through Science Foundation Ireland centres for research or training takes over from what has been a key element of the previous cycle five of the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutions.  </p><p> Regarding other investment in Science Foundation Ireland research centres and programmes, we have increased investment through international bodies such as the European Space Agency and the European Southern Observatory.  Taking this investment together, I am happy to report that we are making very solid progress in delivering on the Department's commitments under Innovation 2020.  All of this is complementing private sector investment in research and development, which is a point that also needs to be borne in mind.  </p><p> As advised, this Supplementary Estimate is technical in nature and involves the redistribution of &euro;26.37 million in savings from within the Department's 2018 voted allocation of &euro;870.96 million.  To put it in context, the Supplementary Estimates package represents approximately 3% of our overall gross allocation for 2018.  The majority of the savings funding the Supplementary Estimate arise with regard to Enterprise Ireland's enterprise development programmes.  In this regard, Enterprise Ireland is expected to generate savings in the region of &euro;24.4 million on these programmes in 2018.  Enterprise Ireland takes equity shares in the companies it supports.  On an annual basis, this typically yields significant funding called agency own resource income.  In recent years, this has been in excess of &euro;70 million per annum.  Subject to the approval and sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Enterprise Ireland is permitted to retain and use own resource income in support of enterprise development.</p><p>This year, 2018, has been another good year for Enterprise Ireland's own-resource income, with the generation of a significant quantum of own-resource income expected by the year's end.  Under public expenditure rules Enterprise Ireland is required to expend return on investment, ROI, before it draws down Exchequer funds.  Accordingly, this surfeit of ROI generated by EI in 2018 means that it will not need to call on its full Exchequer capital allocation of &euro;63 million under subhead A.7 of the Department's Vote.  Consequentially, there will be a saving on this subhead.  </p><p> Aside from the additional ROI which EI expects to generate in 2018, a number of other factors contribute to the saving on this subhead, including slower than anticipated drawdown of grants by EI clients.  In this regard, it is important to appreciate that the grants to EI client companies are demand-led and are typically multi-annual in nature, usually spread over a three-to-four year period.  Grant expenditure is therefore dependent on the Enterprise Ireland client companies adhering to and delivering on certain terms and conditions associated with the Enterprise Ireland grants, such as delivering a certain number of jobs or export sales etc.  Good corporate governance in regard to the public finances means that Enterprise Ireland cannot and should not pay out grant funding until expenditure claims have been submitted by the client companies and property vetted by Enterprise Ireland.  Furthermore, some client companies will choose to submit their funding request to Enterprise Ireland when it best suits the company's own cashflow needs.  Therefore, Enterprise Ireland is not in full control of all elements relating to expenditure across its grant programmes.  This adds complexity to the management of the public moneys provided for in a single financial Estimates year running from 1 January to 31 December.  As far as grants experience in 2018 is concerned, while grant approvals have been in line with targets, the level of claims received from clients for approved projects has been lower than forecast.  It is expected, however, that these claims will be received in the course of 2019.</p><p> The other savings contributing to the Supplementary Estimates concern the INTERREG enterprise development programme, an EU programme designed to promote cross-Border research and innovation initiatives for the period from 2016 to 2022.  My Department provides matching funding in co-operation with our counterpart Department in the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department for the Economy.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has committed to paying &euro;21 million over the seven years of the programme, 85% of which will eventually be reimbursed by the EU.  Funding of &euro;3 million was allocated to INTERREG for 2018, of which just &euro;1.03 million will be spent by the year's end.  The amounts drawn down in each year can fluctuate due to a range of factors.  The rate of drawdown is usually slower in the earlier years, with more funding being drawn down from the middle to the end of the seven-year period.  However, an underspend in any year will result in an increased spend in subsequent years.  Accurate forecasting for INTERREG can be problematic because it is a multi-annual seven-year programme with the Special EU Programmes Body, which runs the programme, working with three different accounting timeframes.  More specific difficulties have arisen in the 2016-2022 programme due to the political situation in Northern Ireland.  There were significant delays in getting projects up and running due to administrative delays in the Northern Ireland system.  The Brexit decision caused an eight-month delay which had a knock-on effect on the programme up to the latter part of last year.  This made accurate forecasting for the 2018 spend more difficult.  Implementation of the INTERREG programme will catch up with the original schedule over the next few years and all projects will be completed in full by 2023.  This delay, which caused the underspend, merely changes the sequencing of payments.  It will not impact on the successful completion of the programme.  It should be noted also that completion of the programme will not be affected by the UK leaving the EU, as the UK Government has committed to providing funds to replace the EU contribution after 2019.  I will leave it there, a Chathaoirligh.  I am happy to answer any questions that the members of the committee may have.  </p></speech>

I will start.  We will stick with programme A.  The Minister explained subhead A..7 very well.  Enterprise Ireland has made savings of &euro;24.4 million.  The Minister explained where this income has come from, that is, own-resource income.  My question concerns Brexit, which will be upon us very shortly.  Was any consideration given to directing some of that funding into preparing more staff for Brexit?  We heard last year that moneys were allocated to additional staff in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  Does the Minister feel her Department and its agencies are sufficiently staffed for Brexit, or was any consideration given to allocating some of that money to hiring further staff?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1037" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#C00300"><p>We increased the 2018 budget to employ almost 100 extra staff members between the two agencies.  They have got more boots on the ground, mainly abroad because they are looking for new markets.  Enterprise Ireland is seeking out new markets and IDA Ireland is looking for new opportunities.  There are opportunities arising from Brexit, although there are a lot of downsides.  We have more boots on the ground abroad.  An additional &euro;8 million in current moneys was allocated to my Department in budget 2019, of which &euro;3 million is being allocated to Enterprise Ireland to drive its plans for Ireland's global footprint.  We are telling companies that they must get ready for Brexit and urging them to diversify into new markets.  That takes time, so Enterprise Ireland is there to help them to scale up, to export and to get new markets abroad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1038" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#C00400"><p>My next question concerns the future growth loan scheme, which I welcome, offering &euro;15 million for new capital provision.  As the Minister explained, this will provide low-cost loans of between eight and ten years' duration with no collateral necessary.  How long does the Minister expect it will take businesses to be approved for loans under this scheme?  Sometimes businesses have to jump through hoops during the process of applying for loans.  Will it be a reasonable application process?  Does the Minister expect much drawdown?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1039" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#C00500"><p>We now have a working capital facility, which is a &euro;300 million fund.  We are putting the money aside to provide for the &euro;300 million long-term loan, which will be loaned over terms from eight to ten years.  First of all, borrowers must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to see if they are eligible.  They will receive an answer to that in a turnaround time of 24 hours.  Those found eligible can apply for the loans through the pillar banks; AIB, Bank of Ireland or Ulster Bank.  Those banks will make the assessments.  They are allowed to loan up to &euro;500,000 in unsecured funding.  This is a huge amount of money, especially over a longer term.  I imagine there will be fairly keen interest in this loan because it fills a gap in the market.  Businesses are finding it difficult to access finance for terms longer than seven years.  This will extend to eight or ten years, with a maximum loan of &euro;3 million.  That is a considerable amount of money.  As I said, there is a 24-hour turnaround time for approval from the SBCI.  Borrowers can then make their application to the banks, which will make the assessment.  The application has to go thorough the normal lending assessment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1041" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#C00700"><p>We will do.  Members might have heard the radio campaign advertising the &euro;300 million working capital facility.  That has a three-year term, and really acts as an overdraft facility.  It has a 4% interest rate.  We did a good bit of advertising for that, and we will do the same for this long-term scheme.  I will send the Deputies notice of this scheme whenever it is approved.  We have to go through the legislative process first.  I will send committee members a note on the scheme and I would be grateful if they could advertise it as much as they can.  We want to get the money out to people.  There is also a lovely little booklet, which I can have sent to members.  It is titled "Government working with finance providers to support SME financing".  We will provide committee members with copies.  It is a full list of the various supports.</p><p>That is whether it is through equity finance support or direct debt financing support.  There has been a change.  It used to be that an entity would have to go to the bank for a loan but that is no longer the way; when businesses look at loans now they look at them with different ways of financing them in mind.  There are many types of support and I will get that sent out.  This is for everybody to avail of and we want to provide supports.  We would appreciate anything that the committee can do to help us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1043" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#D00200"><p>My next question is on local enterprise offices.  The Minister indicated there is additional capital provision of &euro;470,000 in the Supplementary Estimate.  How will this money be allocated in the various offices throughout the country?  Will it be dependent on how well they are performing or will it be demand-led?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1044" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#D00300"><p>This year it will be based on the commitments that they have.  The offices have indicated where they can spend this money before the end of the year.  Next year I have increased the budget by &euro;5 million, and I will ask them to come forward with proposals at that stage on a competitive basis.  We must ensure the money is spent well.  The local enterprise offices have performed really well as being the first port of call for businesses.  They give significant support to small and indigenous Irish companies and I am very supportive of the great work done by local enterprise offices.  They are the first port of call and they introduce businesses to the supports out there that are made available by the Government.  It might not always be about money and sometimes there could be information on soft supports and helping businesses to upskill their management structures or invest in research and development.  Different supports are given and I have a huge regard for them.  They have bedded in well to the local authority structure and there is a greater focus now in local authorities on enterprise and supporting businesses, which is always good.  In the 2019 allocation of &euro;5 million, we are asking these offices to roll out customs training for small and medium enterprises.  We must step back in time to consider all these procedures we thought we would not need again.</p></speech>

Even when people contact us with an idea, it is fantastic that we can send them to local enterprise offices as it is a one-stop shop that works extremely well.  They will signpost where those people should go.  Sometimes we are quick to the bad words but in fairness to local enterprise offices, they have bedded in very well with local authorities.  The feedback is always very positive.  It is fantastic to see there will be an extra allocation for them this year within the Estimates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1046" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2018120500002#D00500"><p>I agree with the comments on local enterprise offices, which are very important.  I met representatives of them again recently in Limerick and they are the first port of call when people come in, especially those in small and medium enterprises.  I thank the Minister for her presentation and her Department for sending us the notes.  I am particularly pleased to see redistribution of the &euro;26 million benefitting Science Foundation Ireland, which is very important.  I am also pleased to see the new loan scheme that aims to help businesses with the effects of Brexit.</p> <p>  I would like to have seen additional funding for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  As Sinn F&eacute;in has said before, we are not satisfied with the current level of funding or staffing and we would have preferred to see greater emphasis on the tackling of white collar crime in Ireland.  I understand the Minister is bringing forward new legislation in the area but I cannot see any reason for additional staff or personnel not being hired now and transferred to a new agency when it is up and running.  It is a sad state of affairs in the country when people are going to prison almost on a weekly basis for not paying their television licence fee etc. but nobody is being brought to justice with respect to the tracker mortgage scandal, for example, which involves more than &euro;1 billion.  We genuinely need major reform in the way we deal with white collar crime.  That is just a comment on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and I look forward to the legislation being brought forward by the Minister, which we can consider.</p> <p>  My first question on the Supplementary Estimate relates to Enterprise Ireland and its resource income.  I may have asked the question before but I understand Enterprise Ireland can currently take 10% equity in business.  Is that the legal limit or is it a policy decision?  If it is a policy decision, what is the high limit we could go to if we wished to?  I also have a question on the future growth loan scheme, as was mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Is there an estimate for the number of businesses that could avail of the scheme?  Is there a cap on the number of businesses?  For how many years will the scheme be in operation?  Will there be a budget allocation required for the scheme every year?  What are the anticipated interest rates on the scheme?</p></speech>

He referred to Enterprise Ireland's 10% level of equity in businesses and it is a policy decision because we do not want to crowd out other investors.  It is working well and if Enterprise Ireland felt at any stage that it wanted to increase the level, it would be fair enough and its representatives could come talk to us.  We would certainly look at it.</p> <p>  Currently there is no cap on the number of businesses that may apply for the further growth loan scheme.  There is an annual budget of &euro;6 million per annum for the next three years and it is built into the process.  It should be sufficient.  The scheme will have an Exchequer cost of &euro;62 million over four years, with &euro;25 million provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with the remaining &euro;37 million provided by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is a &euro;300 million fund and we are taking the risk to the tune of &euro;62 million.  It will last three years from the date of the launch.  The interest rate is below 5%.</p> <p>  I have increased the budget of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, by &euro;1 million next year.  Its moneys have increased over the past number of years.  The report published yesterday indicates clearly that the office did not have the necessary skill set between 2008 and 2012.  It did not have the people it needed to do this complex type of work or investigation.  Since that time, it has employed eight forensic accountants, a digital forensic specialist, two enforcement portfolio managers, two enforcement lawyers and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will lead in all criminal investigations.  We have increased the resources and on 15 November, the number of Department staff in place in the ODCE was 41.  Seven garda&iacute; have also been assigned to the office.  It is doing a really good job and the office has had a number of successful prosecutions brought through the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There was one very high-profile case that was extremely complex.  The director and staff in the ODCE are really doing good work.  That is just in case the wrong message gets out.  There have been a number of prosecutions over the past while.</p></speech>

It is the account of the failings identified by the judge, who very clearly outlined the issues that needed to be addressed.  We have taken all of those on board and they are in the report, which is available.  We have acted on many of the issues and we will bring new legislation through which will set up the ODCE as an independent statutory body.  It will have autonomy to employ people with the particularly specialised skillset that it needs and the power to go out into the market to get those people.  We will also look at giving it additional investigative powers.  There are a number of areas the legislation will cover, including enhanced powers to improve search and entry and to gather evidence that is electronically held.  There will also be improvements in the supervision of liquidators and a more simplified system when the ODCE has to go to the High Court for access to phone records.  Those are extra powers it needs and we will provide for that in the new legislation.  I assure the committee it will have an extra &euro;1 million next year to help it to transition to become an independent body.  It does very important work in making sure companies operate within the law and it deserves to be supported.</p> <p>  The report is "An account of the shortcomings identified by Judge Aylmer of the Circuit Court concerning an investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement".

While the relevant Minister is not present, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, might be able to facilitate me.  There is an additional capital allocation of &euro;10.74 million for innovation support.  I see &euro;8.74 million has been allocated to four bodies, including Trinity College, NUI Maynooth and the Tyndall National Institute.  The other &euro;2 million in capital funding is being provided to the programme for research in third level institutions.  When I looked all the way down the list, I noticed only one institute of technology was successful, DIT.  I am disappointed.  I am open to correction but that is how I read it.  As the Minister knows, the institutes of technology are sometimes seen as the poor relations because they cannot borrow off balance sheet and they find this very difficult at times.  Is there any reason only one institute of technology was successful and all the other moneys allocated were to universities?</p></speech>

I agree with the Chairman.  The institutes do great work, as do the colleges of further education.  We have been working very closely with the Department of Education and Skills in rolling out apprenticeship schemes, which are mainly rolled out through local college of further education centres.  We are doing more work with the institutes in terms of developing the right skillset and skills mix that is needed for industry.  I see a bigger role for them in terms of working with industry to train people and give them the right skills.</p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills announced an additional investment for the institutes of technology.  This included a budget 2018 announcement of &euro;200 million for public-private partnerships in the institute of technology sector and &euro;257 million for investment in the higher education sector, including for research.  Budget 2019 saw announcements of &euro;57 million to be invested in higher education initiatives in 2019, along with capital investment of &euro;150 million allocated to the higher education, further education and training and research sectors.  I take the Chairman's point.</p></speech>

For information purposes, the committee is looking at the whole issue of apprenticeships and the very low number of female apprentices.  We had SOLAS before us last week, as well as two apprentices, one a 23-year old woman from Dublin who was a qualified electrician with the ESB.  She told us her story and how she decided to go down that route.  She studied engineering for six months and did not like it, and then became an apprentice.  Seventy-five apprentices were taken on by the ESB four years ago, three of whom were women.  We also had a man from Wexford.  He was a career changer at 30 years of age and he has just completed a level 8 qualification in insurance.  It was fantastic to hear.  He started work at 16 in the tourism industry, where he was a bar manager before he decided to change career.</p> <p>  The committee is looking at the promotion of this area.  A third level college does not have to be the only way forward and is not for everyone.  We believe we have to put a special focus on the trades.  We will send on the report when it is competed.  There are some who are tradespeople all their working lives but, when they come to their early 50s, especially if they have been working in the building trade, in particular the wet trades, it no longer suits them and they might have to change their careers, upskill or move to a different area.  It has been very obvious to the committee that this situation exists and I wanted to let the Minister know the work we have been doing.  We always try to be as constructive as possible.</p> <p>  There is a crossover with the Department of Education and Skills in regard to skills and we want to focus that from the point of view of the apprentices.  It was good to have those people come to the committee and they had two very positive stories.  It is an important message for the Department to get out that there are options for career changers in their 30s or at any age.  We will certainly be looking at the issue of workers who have worked in the building trade for 35 years and then find, at age 50, it is no longer suitable for them because of the stresses and strains on their body.</p></speech>

Like her, I am a great supporter of apprenticeships.  In fact, in January I am attending the launch of a new apprenticeship scheme.  It takes a while to get such a scheme together because it involves the whole of industry.  The launch, which is in my county, is exciting and will be attended also by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Only two weeks ago I was at an awards ceremony for apprentices who had completed four years of craft apprenticeships.  The Chairman is right that there were very few women and it was all men, but it was a great occasion.  Some of them got up to tell their story in the same way the two apprentices told their story to the committee.  It is a win-win for everybody and means young people can continue their education and stay at home.  They do not all have to come to the city or to the universities, and that sometimes works out better for their family circumstances, given some do part-time work in the country.</p></speech>

A briefing document has been circulated.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, who is a former Chairman of the joint committee and his officials.</p> <p>  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1069" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018120500002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for making time available to discuss this proposal.  The purpose of the motion is to seek Oireachtas approval to exercise Ireland's option under Protocol No. 21, annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that is, the Lisbon treaty, in respect of a proposed amendment to EU Regulation No. 516/2014.  As committee members will be aware, Ireland and the United Kingdom negotiated a protocol, known as Protocol No. 21, which provided that they would not take part in measures in the area of asylum and integration and other policies related to free movement, unless either member state chose to opt in to an individual measure.  The effect of the protocol is that Ireland is not automatically bound by EU measures in these areas, unless it notifies the Council that it wishes to participate or opt in.  Ireland may opt in by notifying the President of the Council in writing within three months of the publication of a proposal in order to vote on and participate in the measure.</p> <p>  Following recent conversations with the European Parliament and the European Council, the European Commission proposed an amendment to the regulation regarding the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, AMIF.  In this case Ireland would have expected the notification period to expire on 15 January 2019.  However, it was notified that, in order to allow for the adoption of the amendment before the end of the year, the Council secretariat wished to move the vote in the European Parliament to 10 December.  The effect is that if Ireland wishes to opt in to the proposal, the President of the Council of the European Union must be notified of our intention to do so before 10 December.  That allows just two months in which to complete the opt-in process which involves a heavy administrative process.</p> <p>  The proposal relates to the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and is essentially procedural in nature.  It will allow unclaimed funds, that is, the asylum, migration and integration funds, which would otherwise be lost by the end of the year to be available for future spending.  It will do this by allowing an extension of the period in which the funds may be used and member states to make revisions to their national programmes to use their funds for other actions as defined by the regulation.  Ireland has &euro;4.14 million in unclaimed AMIF funds allocated in its national programme for the relocation of asylum seekers which will be lost by the end of 2018, unless the regulation is amended.  By opting in to the proposed amendment, if the European Parliament votes it in, Ireland is guaranteed that the money can be allocated by way of a revision to our national programme for the AMIF.  It will also have two more years to use the remaining funds.</p> <p>  To outline the background to the proposal, by way of a summary of the funds and the Council's decision in question, the European Commission wanted to establish a policy on asylum and immigration based on solidarity between member states which would be fair towards third countries and their nationals.  EU Regulation No. 516/2014 established the fund to provide financial resources to support policy developments in the area of asylum and migration.  The fund allows member states to carry out actions in the areas of asylum, immigration, the management of migration flows, the fair treatment of third country nationals residing in member states and combating illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings.</p><p>Ireland opted into the regulation and the EU approved its national programme in this area in 2016.  The programme identified the specific objectives for which Ireland would use AMIF funding.  Ireland's current AMIF allocation is &euro;52.6 million for the period from 2014 to 2020, which represents the lifetime of the programme.  In 2015, in response to the migration crisis in Europe, two Council decisions, namely, EU 2015/1523 and EU 2015/1601 were made, which committed an additional &euro;843 million to member states under AMIF to be used by the end of 2018.  This additional funding was aimed at enabling the relocation of applicants for international protection from Greece and Italy and the legal admission of persons in need of international protection from Turkey.  These additional AMIF funds facilitated the effective relocation across the EU of 34,705 applicants in need of international protection from Greece and Italy and the legal admission of 5,345 people in need of international protection from Turkey.</p><p> The timeframe and the applicability of these decisions are now coming to an end.  Of the &euro;843 million originally committed throughout the European Union to deal with the crisis, approximately &euro;567 million remains unspent.  Unless the proposed amendment to the regulation is passed before the end of this year, the &euro;567 million will be lost from the fund.  Under the two Council decisions of 2015, Ireland committed to accepting 2,622 persons into the State, comprising 1,089 from Greece, 623 from Italy and 910 unallocated.  To date, 1,022 persons have safely been relocated to Ireland from Greece.  In addition, Ireland has also been operating a programme for resettlement, under which 925 persons have been resettled.  Many member states, including Ireland, were unable to keep their commitments to relocate asylum seekers from Italy as no agreement could be reached on security assessments to be undertaken by Ireland on Italian soil.  As a result, &euro;4.14 million of Ireland's committed funding remains unused.</p><p> The proposed amendment to the regulation has a number of provisions.  As I explained, the first objective of the proposal is to enable the use of the remaining unspent amounts committed under AMIF to support EU priorities in the area of migration and asylum, including relocation.  Failing to opt in will mean that Ireland will lose out on &euro;4.14 million of our AMIF funding.  By amending Article 18 of the regulation, the proposal recommits the amounts in question for relocation.  It will also give Ireland the option to transfer these funds to other areas defined in the asylum, migration and integration regulation that are based on Ireland's specific needs in these areas.  Therefore, Ireland will have a say in how the funds can be used and will have the option to have them channelled to specific objectives as required.  The proposal also inserts a provision into Article 18 to revise the decommitment rule set out in Article 50 of Regulation EU 514/2014, which lays down the general provisions, in order that the remaining amounts can be used for an additional period of two years.  As a result, by opting in Ireland will have two more years in which to spend the funds.  The proposal also extends the deadline for an automatic decommitment of amounts by a period of six months.  This will give the Commission time to complete the necessary procedures and allow member states to identify revisions to their national programmes and include new areas where the funds could be allocated.</p><p> This is money that has already been budgeted by the European Union.  No additional funding from the budget is necessary for the implementation of the proposed amendments to Regulation 516/2014.  Therefore, there will be no additional cost to the Exchequer and the decision to opt in will not have implications for Ireland's contribution to the EU budget.</p><p> Concerns were raised with regard to setting a precedent.  Italy and Finland have raised concerns about the proposal and have indicated they will not support the negotiating mandate to the Presidency.  Their concern relates to their view that a number of member states did not abide, or only partially abided, by their obligations to relocate persons in need of protection to their territories.  Italy has also expressed the view that the proposal broadens the scope of the initial provisions by encompassing actions that cannot be considered an expression of solidarity, in contrast with the objects as pursued in 2015.</p><p> Concerns have also been expressed by member states with regard to the precedent the proposed amendment may set regarding recommitment of funds due to be decommitted, in other words, handed back.  The Minister for Finance has also raised this issue.  The matter is addressed by a proposal in the amendment stating this only applies on a once-off basis to the AMIF fund.</p><p> The proposal is to be welcomed as it ensures money committed to Ireland will not be lost and that additional funds may be claimed for the Exchequer for the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund that would otherwise not be possible.  The proposal does not present fundamental policy difficulties for Ireland.  I am of the view that Ireland should exercise its opt-in in respect of the proposed regulation.  There are clear benefits to opting in and I see no detrimental effects to doing so.  We must also bear in mind the declaration by the European Commission that the proposal will not set a precedent for future AMIF funds.  I hope the committee will support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of the proposed regulation.  I look forward to any comments members may have and I will do the best I can to answer any questions people might want to put in respect of this particular proposal.</p></speech>

I read the briefing document that was circulated to members.  This fund is great in the way it is used to support a number of positive integrative initiatives and I strongly welcome it.  There is one piece in the briefing document I want to ask about. It mentions "the efficient management of migration flows".  I find this wording a little concerning given the context of the EU-backed agreement between Italy and Libya.  On paper, the deal between Italy and Libya is in place to manage migration flows but Sally Hayden, a young Irish journalist, recently won an Irish journalism award for her coverage of what it means in practice.  She states it is to stop people arriving in Europe.  EU money has funded the Libyan coastguard to return thousands of desperate people to war zones and detention centres in contravention of the principle of non-refoulement.  One of the four key pillars of the fund up for discussion today is return.  In 2017, we spent &euro;3.2 million, approximately &euro;450,000 of which went to a delegated authority in the repatriation unit of INIS.  Will the Minister of State provide information on what this money covers?  Will he confirm that none will go towards returns to conflict zones that are clearly unsafe, such as Libya?</p> <p>  Based on figures given in response to a parliamentary question in October with regard to the underspend, the fund has been in operation since 2015 and in that period we have spent approximately &euro;6 million.  Today we are being asked to roll over a portion of underspent money for another two years, which comes to approximately &euro;4 million.  Will the Minister of State expand on why the money was not spent?  I know money can still be allocated until 2019 and 2020 but it seems we will still come in under budget.  I have worked with fantastic projects on the list of applicants, from football clubs to refugee organisations.  Is it the case that not enough organisations are applying?  Similarly, if there is an underspend, is there not a case to be made that we could use this extra money to welcome more refugees than the small number already accepted?</p></speech>

It allows an extension of time and allows us to make revisions to our national programmes to use the funds for relocation as well as other actions.  We are very anxious to do this now because if we do not we will lose the money.</p> <p>  I am certainly concerned about the situation between Libya and the European Union.  Anybody who we return is not returned to a conflict zone.  We are anxious to facilitate people coming to Ireland who find they want to go back home and this is paid for.  They can be returned to their own home countries if they wish and a number of people do this each year.  I can supply the committee with these figures if members wish.  People who come here do want to go back.</p> <p>  As I said, there is no cost to the Exchequer but we will have additional funding available because of it.  The other questions were-----</p></speech>

We had quite a lot of discussion with the previous Minister and T&aacute;naiste, and myself and others at official level had discussions with Italian representatives at all levels, including at ministerial level.  We gave a commitment here that we would carry out security checks on people before they came into the country.  We did so because we did not want to be in a position whereby if somebody arrived here but something happened and then I would be asked what checks were carried out before they came here.  The Italians would not allow us to deploy members of the Garda to their territory to interview people who might come here.  We were of the view that we could not bring people from Italy unless we did so.  We tried everything to break the impasse but nothing worked.  Therefore, we did not spend the money that was allocated to relocate people from Italy to Ireland.  That money is unspent.  We are trying to use the money for other purposes otherwise we will lose it.  This fund is dedicated to relocation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1080" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018120500002#E00300"><p>We are talking about funding that was allocated for a failed plan that took place against the backdrop of desperate need.  I shall make a few points and ask questions about the bigger picture in respect of Europe and then I will ask a few questions about Ireland.  Perhaps I will split my comments into two segments.</p> <p>  As the Minister of State has said, the fund was adopted in 2014 and added to in 2015 due to the growing crisis.  As a result of an increased number of refugees there was a specific goal and commitment given to relocate 160,000 refugees.  To date, only a quarter of the relocation has happened across Europe, which is frightening when one considers how people are living.  For example, Camp Moria in Greece was originally built to house 2,000 people but housed 8,000 people during the summer.  We know that children as young as ten years of age committed suicide and people had to stand in line for 12 hours a day to queue for food.  Also, people have been stabbed while queuing for food, and as many as 80 people use the same shower and 70 people share the same toilet.  The camp is an absolute hellhole from which people desperately want to escape.  Against that backdrop, an underspend is appalling.  As the Minister of State has said, &euro;4 million of the fund is due to be given to Ireland.</p> <p>  In terms of Ireland's portion of the funding, we agreed to accept 2,622 people.  Unfortunately, we accepted just half of that number.  We did not accept anyone from Italy, as the Minister of State has said.  Ireland is not the worst in Europe but we are near the bottom of the pile.  Hungary and Poland took nobody and Austria took about 15 people.</p> <p>  Given that there are about 60,000 refugees in mainland Greece and 14,000 refugees on the Greek islands, what is Europe's plan to deal with these people?  Can the Minister of State give a commitment that we will push, at a European level, to ensure that the refugees who want to get out of Greece will be relocated?  Will Ireland continue to relocate refugees from Greece?  Ireland's relocation scheme ended in March 2018.  Why did that happen?  </p> <p>  I note that the European Parliament's amendments to the proposal extended the range of nationalities eligible for relocation.  This was a huge issue for the many thousands of people from Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan, who did not qualify under the scheme.  I presume that the Irish Government supports extending the range of nationalities.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that Ireland will fight to support the extension of the number of nationalities covered by the relocation scheme?  Can he express his thoughts on the quota system?  Recently Donald Tusk talked about quotas being divisive and ineffective.  Can we take it from the current fund and the fact that one can spend the money on anything else other than relocation that the EU is moving away from relocating people?  Are we leaving people in these Greek hellholes?  What is the story?  About 23,000 refugees arrived in Greece this year, which is a lot less than the 850,000 refugees in 2015.  The decrease is not due to the need diminishing.  The decrease is due to the fact that money has been spent on erecting border walls and fences, and the EU-Turkey deal.  Is that the EU's policy for dealing with the problem?  Does the EU just want to detain refugees in Greece and not let them come in?  I would like the Minister of State to comment on the matter.  Would the Chairman prefer if I asked my questions on Ireland after the Minister of State responds?</p></speech>

Certainly, what happened in Syria is shocking and appalling.  We know that and have followed what has gone on.</p> <p>  As I said at the start, under the protocol Ireland voluntarily opted into this programme.  We were asked to take 2,622 persons into the State, comprising 1,089 from Greece and 623 from Italy and 910 were unallocated by the European Union.  To date, 1,022 persons have safely been relocated to Ireland from Greece and another 600 persons will arrive next year as part of the resettlement programme.  As part of the programme for resettlement, 925 people from camps in Lebanon have been resettled here and another 200 persons will come here before Christmas.  Ireland is a very small country but we are doing our best to bring people here from the camps in Greece and Lebanon.  We were unable to bring people in from Italy.  We tried very hard to do so and are still working on doing so.  As much as 20% of the funding will be for relocation.  We also support non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and others with some of this funding.</p></speech>

What percentage of those people who came here as part of the relocation programme have been housed?  A percentage close to 85% would be incredible given that &euro;4.14 million remains.  Also, given that an amendment to the proposal that we are discussing was made by the European Parliament last week to the effect that member states should be allowed to reuse their recommitted funds on things like developing family reunification and promoting effective integration of third country nationals, as well as for relocation programmes, is it intended that the Government will do this work?  I would like to hear more about what the Government plans to do.  Will the Government use the funding for purposes broader than relocation?  It is great that 85% of the refugees, who are mostly Syrian, who came here as part of these programmes have been housed.  However, there are loads of people living in direct provision who have been given their status but cannot leave because they cannot secure housing.  Can the money be provided for such work rather than enriching the private owners of direct provision accommodation in our efforts to open more facilities for direct provision?  There is a sum of over &euro;4 million available yet loads of people with status cannot get housing.  I want to know more about the housing element.</p> <p>  Tomorrow, in the D&aacute;il, we will discuss the International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill 2017 that has passed through the Seanad.  I believe that the Government does not support the Bill.  Given that family reunification was mentioned a number of times in the European Parliament's amendments to the proposal, would it not be an idea for the Irish Government to change its stance on the funding and use some of the &euro;4 million to allow people to be reunited with their family members?</p><p>It is cruel to allow people to stay here but not allow their families to join them.  They could be leaving a grandparent stuck in the type of hellhole I described in Greece, or a 19 year old who is too old.  There is ministerial discretion and there is money.  It is appalling that they are not being used.</p><p> The Minister mentioned the resettlement of a further 945 people from the Lebanon.  Last year, the European Commission recommended that member states offer at least 50,000 resettlement places by 31 October 2019.  How many places have been pledged at European level by member states under this recommendation?  Is it anywhere near 50,000?  Given the scale of the crisis, can more than 335 this year and 600 next year not be pledged?  Has there been any discussion about that?</p></speech>

People in direct provision are, in the main, asylum seekers and are a different group of people from the ones we bring in from Lebanon, Greece or Italy, who are refugees when they arrive here or become refugees shortly after they arrive.  Resettlement takes place of people we bring in from Lebanon while it is relocation when they come from Greece.  I can go through the pledges so far.  Various Government decisions have been made and the total resettlement pledge is 1,985 up to 2019.  There may be a further request during the year, which we will examine at that time.</p> <p>  The number I gave in reply to the parliamentary question on housing was correct.  I visited some Syrians in Donegal two weeks ago who were being rehoused and they are happy with how they are being rehoused.  They also have a settlement worker who stays with them for 18 months and assists then with the reintegration process.  Learning English is a major issue and, while children learn English quickly, adults, especially men, find it more difficult and challenging.  The resettlement workers help them and there are classes in the ETBs in 19 counties.  The housing programme is going well in respect of the programme refugees and the people we bring in from Greece.  It is great to see people in homes settling down and getting involved in the community.  The community put on a welcome celebration for Syrians housed in Drumshanbo and it was great to see this welcome and the support they gave to them.</p> <p>  We are commencing another programme which has been active in Canada and the UK for a number of years and involves private community sponsorship.  The community decides to take a family and comes together under faith groups or community organisations.  They locate a house, equip it and do it up and they support the family when they arrive.  I went to Manchester and London to see this in action and I met the people involved who said they had never in their lives been involved in something that gave them more satisfaction.  When the families came in it was great to see the children running up onto the laps of their new grannies and to see the bonds that had been created.  I am anxious to pursue that here as another method of welcoming and integrating refugees in Ireland.  When they get off the plane, they go directly to the community without any reception in between.  If Deputies and Senators wanted to promote this in their own communities, I would be interested in working with them and supporting this. </p></speech>

When Syrians arrived in Monasterevin, the attention given to issues such as integration, English lessons and acclimatising to a new culture worked, and it prepared the people to feel part of the community, in contrast to direct provision where people are isolated.  Many of the people in direct provision now have their status and they are stuck there.  They cannot get out and they still cannot access the labour market.  This is a lesson in how not to do it and now that the Government has additional money, it has to spend it.  The people in direct provision should get some of the money to enable them to get out, though that may be a separate argument.  Tomorrow, we will take up the argument that the Minister has loads of money to implement the International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill and that is great.</p></speech>

Can the Minister give a breakdown as to whether it relates to this year or is accrued from previous years?  Has it any effect on the allocations for future years?  When money continues to roll over, it can affect future budgetary projections.  Can the Minister clarify that?</p> <p>  All parties and politicians have been responsible for migration but there has been an underbelly of commentary, which is worrying, in recent months.  What is the Department doing to address that?  The Canadian model is decentralised and there is a buddy system for families, which has worked well there and has helped integrate a lot of families.  How can we use some of the &euro;4 million to ensure the pattern in other countries does not develop in Ireland?  I am glad the body politic has been responsible in this area and has been above some of the negative stuff we have seen.</p></speech>

It is a living document and if members have suggestions as to how we can add to it or improve it, I would welcome those.  The strategy is about integration and addresses anti-racism and a range of actions aimed at precisely what the Deputy is referring to.  I chair a working group that oversees work in this area.  It includes most Departments along with NGOs, with whom we also work closely.  The NGOs are at the coalface dealing with the issues and I have told them that, if they have issues, my door is open to them and I want to know about them first.  I invite them to bring any issues they have relating to migration to my attention immediately in order that we can deal with them and sort them out as best and as soon as we can.  The strategy takes into account all the issues the Deputy mentioned.</p> <p>  The &euro;4 million is accrued from previous years and the &euro;52.6 million is allocated for the lifetime of the programme, 2014 to 2020.  We will lose this funding if we do not go through the process and it is important not to lose it.</p><p>The timeframe is tight.  We usually have three months but as we are coming close to the end of the year, we have much less time to get it done.</p></speech>

I share Deputy Daly's view, which she articulately outlined, of the deep flaws in EU policy as a whole on migration and integration.  Likewise, while efforts have been made in this area, much more can be done to provide a home here for refugees and asylum seekers.</p> <p>  I do not have many questions as such.  Whatever about the wider policy, I appreciate the value of the fund, in particular.  Ireland should try to draw as much from that as possible.</p> <p>  Regarding integration, I want to make two particular points in general and then ask a question.  They might not be appropriate necessarily to this fund but they are aspects that should be considered.  Local authorities have a more significant role to play in the area of integration than they currently play.  Some local authorities are probably more proactive than others but given that they are responsible for the location of schools, facilities and so on, they have a more significant role to play.</p> <p>  I tabled a question recently on the forthcoming local elections, which I hope will be taken as an oral question but so far it has not.  The Department has done work regarding new Irish communities and, more generally, immigrant communities.  I attended one of those events, which was good.  By and large, that work is focused on those who have status.  Those in direct provision who are seeking asylum in Ireland are entitled to vote in local elections.  The Department should be more proactive in informing those in direct provision of their entitlement to vote and facilitating engagement with candidates and councillors.  Such measures are invaluable to ensuring integration in our democracy.  I would encourage that, not just focusing on those who have status but providing information to those in direct provision who do not have such status.</p> <p>  This fund runs up to 2020.  I presume, like most European programmes, the process of beginning a new fund to succeed it has started.  Is a proposal for a new fund likely to come before us in the next year or so?</p></speech>

It is greatly appreciated.  It is appreciated by the migrants as well, and other colleagues.</p> <p>  With respect to local authorities, in the past two weeks, we invited all local authorities to come to a seminar in Athlone where we addressed many issues such as how they can get involved and support migrants even more than they currently do.  I addressed the seminar, which was good.  We are working with the local authorities.  The Deputy is correct that they have a major role to play in this regard.  They do a good deal of work in this area and we will work with them to increase and improve that over time.  The Deputy's question is very timely in terms of the recent seminar on these matters with all the local authorities in attendance.</p> <p>  The Deputy is also correct regarding the local elections.  We had a number of meetings throughout the country at which we tried to encourage, support and inform migrants of their right to vote in local elections.  We also have documentation in the various accommodation centres.  We encourage migrants to get involved in politics, either by supporting candidates or standing as candidates themselves, and to be aware of, and learn about, what is happening in the political process.  We are doing the best we can in that regard.</p> <p>  I recall the Deputy's parliamentary question.  There is no problem with engagement between candidates in local elections, or any election, and people in various accommodation centres.  We would encourage that, but we must be aware that these accommodation centres are people's homes and that there are children living in them. There are safety aspects in that regard but in the communal areas, there is no difficulty in people leaving literature and so on in them or meeting with asylum seekers or refugees.  We would encourage that and we support it as best we can.</p> <p>  A new long-term integration social fund to 2027 is being prepared.  The debate is ongoing in that regard.</p></speech>

When one goes there, the story is very different from what one reads in the media or hears on RT&Eacute;.  In the past two years, since the government defeated the jihadists in many areas of the country, more than 1.5 million Syrians have returned.  I do not want to go into the politics of it but it was  disappointing that European governments and the EU played a part in funding the jihadists who caused so much of the trouble in the first place.  I do not understand the rationale behind the Department's position.  For example, when we were in Calais, we saw that the most unfortunate and poorest refugees in Calais were Afghan and Kurdish but it looks to us that they need more help than anyone else.  Is there a reason the Department has chosen the Syrians and Eritreans for the most needed attention rather than other nationalities?  It is only a matter of time before serious numbers of people move from Yemen, where the worst humanitarian disaster on the planet is currently taking place, and we are still supping tea with the Saudis.  What is the rationale behind not being more facilitating to those other nationalities?</p></speech>

That is what the European Union asked us to do.  We expect the Commission will come to us in the near future, and to other countries as well, seeking pledges regarding some of the countries the Deputy mentioned.  That may well happen in the future but at the time the Syrian people who were fleeing in large numbers were in most need.  There was a war in Eritrea as well.  That was the largest cohort of people in need at the time.  Events change, however, and we expect another request from the Commission in the next while to look at other areas.</p></speech>

We have been very proactive in working to find accommodation.  There are certain times of the year when families find it better to move, such as at the end of a school term.  We have provided funding to the Jesuit Refugee Service and the Peter McVerry Trust under the fund that we are discussing today.  The PATHS Project also provides asylum seekers in transition with housing and support.  The South Dublin County Partnership has a two-year housing integration programme, a key part of which is to assist residents with status to access housing supports, and it is also working with the Clondalkin Towers centre.  We have also provided funds and work with Depaul Ireland which provides supports to residents with permission to remain in the Hatch Hall and Mosney centres to assist them to secure permanent housing outside the Department's accommodation portfolio.  We are providing housing to a number of different NGOs which have considerable experience in providing accommodation for the people identified by the Deputy.  The Red Cross has also been working, mainly with single people, to provide accommodation and has been quite successful.  Deputy Wallace is correct that it is a challenge.  There is no doubt about that, but we have provided funding to the agencies on the ground to do what they can to locate housing.  We all want these people to move on as quickly as possible.  They have status with a right to stay in the country, and the same rights as everyone else in this room, except that they are not yet citizens, although they probably will be in time.  We want them to find accommodation and we are doing our best for them to find homes.</p></speech>

That sounds great and it is good if it happens.  However, is it not the case that we will have a need for some sort of entity like direct provision for a long time yet?  The direct provision that we have was never meant to be as permanent as it has become.  Has there been consideration at Government level to doing things differently given the level of negative publicity around direct provision which has been found to be lacking in many ways?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018120500002#H00400"><p>The direct provision system has changed a great deal in recent years.  I invite colleagues to look at the changes that have been made.  We continue to change, improve and upgrade the area.  There is a fair bit of pressure due to the increase in people looking for international protection, and therefore we have to find accommodation for them.  When someone comes into Dublin Airport tonight seeking asylum, we are obliged to process that claim and to ask the person if he or she needs accommodation and, if he or she does not have accommodation, we are obliged to provide it.  A small number of people can stay with friends and relations already in Ireland, and a small number do, but the vast majority cannot.  They are guaranteed a bed that night along with a shower, food, security, medical care and whatever else they need.  That is what they are provided with immediately.  We have streamlined the application process.</p> <p>  Part of the criticism of the system was that people were too long in the process.  As the Deputy knows, there were three different ways by which people could apply.  We have now made a single application procedure to try to speed that up and for people to have a final decision sooner.  The Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children now go to the centres freely at any time they wish.  They can listen to people, take complaints and engage with them so they know how to make complaints.  Both of those independent agencies can and do make recommendations based on the complaints they receive.  We work very closely with them, encourage and welcome their work and are anxious to hear from them.  We are also developing a new set of standards for the centres which we are undertaking with NGOs which are having a big input.  We have also put additional staffing resources into the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, to try to speed up the application process as best we can.  Much has been done.  Many of the centres have teenage rooms and many centres have self-catering facilities, so they have changed.</p> <p>  I will return briefly to the private community sponsorship model with which I am keen for communities throughout the country to engage.  If colleagues can activate a community to support a family in that way, we will work with them.  The idea is that someone could come from the airport and go directly to the community.  That is what I saw in operation in Canada and in the UK.</p> <p>  Direct provision has been criticised over the years and it has been likened to open prisons and so on, which is most unfair.  People can come and go as they wish.  No one is incarcerated at all and there is no signing in or out, for instance.  Staff in the centres are trained.  If colleagues are aware of another model elsewhere that works better, they should tell me what it is.  They should see me or send me details in writing of the better system and how it would work, bearing in mind the current constraints and that everyone who arrives in Ireland seeking asylum is guaranteed accommodation that night.</p></speech>

I know a refugee who was in Waterford who was studying in Dublin.  He was thrown out of the place in Waterford because he was not at the centre for enough nights during the week.

I think that we are generally well aware that there has been a clampdown in Europe and that, rather than facilitating refugees, more fences at borders are being erected to prevent them from getting in.  I do not know if the Minister of State is aware of the questions two weeks ago to the Department of Defence when the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, admitted that in recent months the Irish mission in the Mediterranean has been a military one rather than a rescue one.  We did some wonderful work there in the early years but the last boat came home without saving anyone's life.  The Minister of State admitted two weeks ago, having denied it earlier in the year, as did the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that this was a military mission.  What in God's name are we doing involved in a military mission preventing refugees crossing the Mediterranean and sending them back to absolute misery in Libya?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe might discuss that with the committee.  I know that the navy has done an enormous amount work in the Mediterranean and has saved many lives.  Thousands of people have been rescued by our naval service and I have met some of the personnel involved.  Some of what they have gone through has also been life changing for them.</p> <p>  I am also aware that people are being exploited by traffickers in the Mediterranean and so on and there is a role to be played in dealing with that.  However, that is outside of what we are discussing today which is what we do with this funding when we have it and the important issue of drawing it down and looking after the people who come here, working towards the various integration models and the migrant integration strategy.</p></speech>

They had a problem with garda&iacute; on Italian soil vetting migrants.  Was there an element of the Italians not wanting states coming along and cherry-picking those in the camps in the south of Italy who had just been rescued from the Mediterranean leaving them with people who might be considered more troublesome or difficult?  What was their rationale?</p></speech>

My understanding is that they did not want to have what they would call extraterritorial security services operating on their territory.  We wanted to do this in a quiet way - the garda&iacute; would not be in uniform.  It would have allowed us to carry out security checks as we did in Greece and Lebanon where it works well.  That would allow me to come in here and confirm that garda&iacute; were involved in security checks that were not very intrusive.  It was just to see if there were some there who should not come here because of being involved in terrorism or something else.  That is what goes on.  The garda&iacute; do that and there is no issue of cherry-picking in any way.  We work with the people on the ground there as happened in Greece and Lebanon.  That did not arise.  It would be the same process as in Greece and Lebanon which worked pretty well.</p></speech>

He may recall that when he was Chairman of this committee, we visited Portugal to see how it dealt with reception centres.  Back then in 2013 or 2014, direct provision in this country was different from today.  Today some of our reception centres compare favourably with what we witnessed in Portugal.  Engagement with NGOs has borne fruit.  There is probably little any NGO could suggest to be done that is not being done.</p> <p>  There will always be challenges.  There was an issue in a direct provision centre in Meelick just outside Limerick where somebody could not get a cup of tea or something.  As soon as it was brought to the attention of the RIA, it was dealt with quickly.  There will be incidents where incidents happen in reception centres that are dealing with people.  It is commendable that when something is raised, it is dealt with.  I encourage everybody who is aware of matters that should not be happening to bring them to the Minister of State's attention.</p> <p>  Do any recommendations of the McMahon report remain to be implemented or is he satisfied that at this stage all the recommendations to be implemented have been implemented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018120500002#J00400"><p>I agree that the accommodation centres have improved quite a bit.  We continually strive to find new ways to improve the centres by, for example, opening cr&egrave;ches that children in the locality and children in the centres can use.  That also facilitates integration.  Another approach is through funding various sporting bodies that include asylum seekers from the centres in sport.  Last year, Ballaghaderreen GAA club won an award for its work and other clubs and sporting organisations throughout the country do much of that.</p> <p>  More than 3,000 people in accommodation centres now prepare and cook their own meals in either their own accommodation or communal kitchens.  The implementation of this recommendation of the McMahon report will continue until it is complete.  We are rolling that out.  It is a prerequisite of all new contracts to be awarded under the process.</p> <p>  We are developing a new set of standards.  A draft has been prepared and a public consultation is under way.  The standards will apply to all centres under contract to the Minister.  Diageo has its learning-for-life programme and open-doors project to encourage and support asylum seekers and refugees to get jobs.  We are working to see how we can link employers with asylum seekers who now have a right to work.</p> <p>  There is a lot going on.  We have not finalised the implementation of all the McMahon report recommendations, but we are 95% of the way there.  We continue to explore and look for new ways to improve matters.  The two main issues are shortening the time to reach a final decision and, as either Deputy Clare Daly or Deputy Wallace said earlier, trying to facilitate and support people once they have status to move into the community and carry on with their lives.</p></speech>

Should the State be running these reception centres directly as opposed to contracting private companies?  While it might be something for the longer term, should the State build purpose-built reception centres and run them or at least own them or enter a service level agreement with an organisation to run them?  It would give us more control and certainty.  It would not just be a yearly contract where at the end of a year the owner of the facility could just decide not to renew it possibly leaving a couple of hundred people on the street.  It would bring certainty if we owned the facilities and had more control over the standards and what happens.</p></speech>

We do not want to have centres that are closed and not needed.  There is flexibility in what we are doing at the moment.  I take the Senator's point.  We are exploring how we might use State-owned facilities and augment those to provide more and better accommodation for asylum seekers.  At the moment it is done by way of competitive tender.  We are anxious to ensure that there is value for the State and that it does not cost too much while, at the same time, ensuring the standards are high.  That is the challenge.</p> <p>  We watch standards closely to ensure the standards in the centres are as high as we can get them.  We need to ensure that somebody looking for international protection has accommodation and will not end up on the streets as happened with people who came to Ireland seeking asylum in the 1990s.  That is not happening at the moment.</p></speech>

I welcome the insistence on the availability of self-catering.  That type of autonomy for people in centres is important for their mental well-being as well as everything else.

The Minister of State referred to tendering.  Is another methodology being employed whereby individual businesspeople are block booking accommodation in hotels that are not functioning to capacity and directly involved in accommodating large numbers of people through a network of small to medium-sized hotels in different locations?  Has the Minister of State anything to add to what the Minister said?  The Minister had nothing to tell us but given that the Minister of State is the line Minister concerning this matter, he might be in a position to shed some light on it.</p></speech>

I will get the information relating to that parliamentary question for the Chairman.  He is correct.  Our major concern is that people seeking international protection do not end up on the street.  There is a great deal of pressure on the accommodation centres that are under contract.  There have been times when they have been full.  At that time, rather than somebody having no place to go, people could be offered accommodation in hotels on a bed-and-breakfast basis so they would not be on the street and that has happened.

As Chairman of the committee, I will circulate the information to members.  I know most of them were not aware of what I was focusing on last week.  We are not talking about small numbers.  In the case of one hotel, we are talking about up to 80 people.  I visited this hotel and I am deeply concerned.  Senator Conway said that matters are improving but I do not see it when we are moving to this methodology to address the issue.  People are seeing business opportunities here and the motivation is questionable.  The suitability factor is questionable.</p> <p>  Hotels may offer a bed for the night that is comfortable but the location might be wholly inappropriate and unsuitable because it is remote or because in tandem with that, there is no public transport, it is isolated and there are no outlets or opportunities to develop oneself and follow up on natural exercise and pastimes, etc.  I am deeply concerned about it.  In replying to us, will the Minister of State incorporate the expected or mean timeframe for the utilisation of these facilities and identify their location?  He spoke earlier about inviting communities to come forward through elected representatives or on their own initiative but, in these instances, there is no community consultation whatsoever so there is no community involvement and no invitation to extend the hand of welcome and friendship, which is important.  Nothing will be more likely to secure the wrong reaction than ignoring a community.  It is guaranteed to elicit a negative reaction whereas properly moulded consultation that lays out exactly what is proposed and seeks community involvement will deliver a much better response.  Does the Minister of State wish to add anything?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018120500002#K00400"><p>I have the figures for the Chairman so I can give them to him now.  As of 2 December 2018, there were 184 people seeking international protection in emergency accommodation beds.  The intention is that these beds will be used for a short period, perhaps one or two nights, before we can relocate them and offer them accommodation in one of the other permanent centres.  Rather than having people on the street when all the other centres are full, we guarantee that they will not be without accommodation and food.</p> <p>  In respect of location, going back to what the Chairman mentioned about community consultation, RIA does not ear mark or pick a hotel or centre.  RIA and the Department put out a call for expressions of interest.  These can come from anywhere.  When that happens, the staff inspect the facility to ensure it is up to standard.  If the Chairman had an accommodation centre somewhere, was interested in making it available and contacted the Department, the suggestion is that at that stage, the Department should tell everybody else that this particular businessperson had contacted the Department to make the premises available.  The Department then inspects the premises.  Sometimes it may not be suitable and the owner will be told this and that the Department will not take it on.  Alternatively, it may be deemed to have all the features required and to be up to standard.</p> <p>  The question then is whether the community should be involved at that stage.  The businessperson or owner of the facility will then work out a contract and terms.  Sometimes they will come to an agreement and sometimes they will not.  If they come to an agreement, shake hands and say they can do business on these terms, that is when it is made public.  I would contend that prior to that, no agreement might be reached.  I cannot see how we could involve the public in consultation until we know that we are going to make an agreement.  The minute that agreement is made, people are involved.  The experience around the country is that the local people are concerned and have questions and we do our best to answer and address them.  The experience in all the 37 accommodation centres that are up and running is good.</p> <p>  Under the McMahon report, it was recommended that "friends of the centre" be established.  This was done immediately and funded and supported by the Department and RIA.  We find that when local people get to know and work with the people in the accommodation centres, the support is overwhelming.  The consultation should be done at the earliest time, which is when the agreement is reached or on the verge of being reached with the owner.  Prior to that, the owner or Department could easily walk away and say they will not do business.  It would not be fair on any owner of a property or the community to say we are having a discussion at an early stage before we make an agreement.  It is tricky.  We have had these discussions previously and I am sure the Chairman will understand how difficult it is.  If the owner of a property contacts the Department, is that when we should say that we have been contacted by "X" who wants to talk to us?  There are also commercial and privacy considerations for people.  As I said, on 2 December 2018,  there were 184 people seeking international protection in emergency accommodation beds.</p><p>At the same time, there were 5,607 in contracted capacity.</p></speech>

The suitability of the accommodation or the conditions - the acceptance of the circumstances -  is one matter and the question in relation to the suitability of the location is another.  The Minister of State must examine the needs of these people in the round.  It is not only that there may be a comfortable bed in a relatively acceptable standard of accommodation.  There are a whole lot of other issues.  There are language issues.  There are all sorts of real problems.  One must remember that these people did not come here in a single tranche.  They are coming from a variety of different backgrounds with an inability to communicate, even among themselves.  Among them, there are families with children.  The situation, I believe, is not appropriate.</p> <p>  I add this further shocking fact.  I am told that, because it is not direct provision accommodation, where an issue arises it is the business person who has block-booked and acquired the hotel accommodation to allow for these 184 unfortunate people who is the go-to person.</p> <p>  I ask for a full and detailed response.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question on a specific case that I put to the Minister of State.  I expect that the Minister of State and his colleague are the authors of it because the Minister last week knew Fanny Adams about it - that is just a fact.  The Minister undertook to come back to me but a week later I have nothing.  What I am asking for from the Minister of State, as he indicated at the start, is a detailed reply considering all the points that I have made identifying the locations and what other salient information that the Minister of State can furnish to myself, as chair of this committee, to furnish to my colleagues in turn.  I would appreciate that that would be done post haste.</p></speech>

I would love, as I am sure we all would, to have asylum seekers and those looking for international protection to be accommodated near city centres and near the centres of large towns.  That would be ideal.  Unfortunately, when we look for accommodation, we do not get people from the centre of Dublin, Cork or other places offering accommodation.  We cannot magic up accommodation centres in the centre of Dublin or anywhere else.</p> <p>  I can go through all the accommodation centres that we have.  Many of them are in large towns.  I can go through the list stating how many were in each one on 2 December, if the Chairman wishes.</p></speech>

There are different things going on here.  It is not only the issue of the accommodation centres.  It is the sinister development the Chairman has highlighted two weeks in a row of effective subcontracting and profiteering upon profiteering.  It is worrying but I am not shocked.  I would expect the Chairman would not get a response from last week and this week,  It is disgraceful.  I support the Chairman, who speaks for all of us.

The cheapest single room on Gardiner Street on Thursday night and Friday night this week is &euro;250.  Does that not put it up in lights?  The State owns land in the middle of every city and town in this country.  It will not appear overnight, but should there not be direct Government involvement in building places?  These could be multi-use.  They could be used for purposes other than direct provision.  They would not be wasted.  It makes sense.  I accept it would take time to deliver.

From Trinity College Dublin, we are joined by Dr. Mary Rogan, associate professor in law.  All of the witnesses are very welcome.  Ms Deane was to have been joined by Mr. Conor Nolan but, unfortunately, he is not able to be here.  We thank him for his initial indication of intent.  I welcome our guests and will shortly invite them to make their opening statements in the order in which I have announced them.  I hope that is okay.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

We appreciate the assistance that the representatives provide to the committee in respect of the job we have to do.</p> <p>  I will give a brief overview of the process of this legislation, which is the same as for every other item of legislation.  The Bill was introduced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann one year ago, on 14 December 2017.  There is no real debate when the Bill is being introduced, it was just five minutes allocated to introduce it.  The Bill then proceeded to Second Stage, the substantive debate on which happened on 28 June 2018.  Members do not have to be fully supportive of a Bill to vote for it.  The Bill before us passed Second Stage.  A number of individuals expressed some concerns about the Bill.  These can be dealt with on Committee Stage and addressed now as part of this detailed scrutiny process.  It is very important for me and for the committee that our guests are here and engaging in this process.  It is important to state that just because it is my Bill, our guests should not feel that they cannot trash it or indicate that they do not agree with it.  There is lots of legislation which comes from those on my left and which might attract similar reactions.</p> <p>  We want to try to get some form of agreement on the basis that there is a problem in the context of offences being committed by people who are out on bail.  The committee and I are of the view that legislation should only be introduced if it is evidence-based, if it is necessary and if it is going to work.  Although we are all politicians, we do not believe in introducing legislation just because it looks good.  Legislation has to be based on evidence.  When we consider the evidence basis and the legal basis for this Bill, we probably have to look back 22 years to a referendum held in December 1996 when the people overwhelmingly voted to change the Constitution.  They changed it by putting a provision into Article 40 to the effect that "Provision may be made by law for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person."  The public changed the law and that is the fundamental document we have.</p> <p>  We also need to see if there has been a continuing problem in respect of offences being committed by people who are on bail.  Regrettably, there is a continuing problem.  I have circulated to my fellow committee members - I apologise if there are not enough copies - the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 445, which I tabled to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, on 6 November last.  The Minister set out, very concisely in tabular form, 15 different types of offences by year from 2013 to 2017, inclusive.  In respect of each of the offences, we can see there are recorded crime incidents with at least one suspected offender on bail when the crimes were committed.  I could go down through these figures, but I do not intend to do so.  I ask the members to look at 07 on the table, which relates to burglary and related offences.  In 2013, there were 1,241 incidents of burglary or relates offences; in 2014, there were 1,674; and, in 2017, there were 1,342.  The committee should have no difficulty accepting that, unfortunately, we have a problem with crimes being committed by people who are out on bail.  There may be reasons for that and it does not mean that there should not be further research.  Part of the reason may be that people think there is no deterrent against committing other offences when they are out on bail because any sentences for such offences will be served concurrently with sentences for the original offences.  This may be one of the factors but I will start by stating that we do a problem and there is a responsibility on us, as legislators, to try to deal with it.</p> <p>  I have an opening statement, which I will read into the record.  The principal purpose of the Bill is to amend the Bail Act 1997.  That legislation was introduced in the aftermath of the constitutional amendment.  I have to repeat that, unfortunately, there is evidence of a high rate of offending among people who are out on bail.  In 2017, 12% of all crimes committed were by persons who were out on bail for other offences.  This Bill attempts to make it mandatory for a court to refuse bail if the court is satisfied that such a refusal is "reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person."  At present, it is optional for a court to refuse bail if it is of the view that such a refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  The constitutional amendment is clear and the obligation should be that if one thinks it is going to be reasonably considered necessary, then bail should be refused.  The legislation also concentrates specifically on the crimes of burglary and aggravated burglary because these are offences in respect of which there is a high rate of recidivism, as the figures in the reply to my parliamentary question highlight.</p><p>According to the 2013 Irish Prison Service recidivism study the recidivism rate is approximately 80% among persons imprisoned for burglary and related offences.  This is the highest rate for any offence and is considerably above the overall recidivism rate, which is 62%.  Statistics from the CSO which are published under reservation, indicate there is a problem.</p><p> I read the submissions, including that by AdVIC.  AdVIC's concern in part is that the substantive part of this legislation applies only to burglary and aggravated burglary.  It is Ms Deane's desire to see the provision applied more broadly to other serious offences.  That is an argument with which I have considerable sympathy.  On the basis of an evidence-based analysis and the statistics, however, it is clearly the case that burglary and aggravated burglary are associated with a particularly high rate of recidivism.</p><p> The Bill also seeks to introduce a provision in respect of electronic monitoring.  Electronic monitoring seems to be presented such that if one is in favour of it, one is regarded as draconian, whereas if one is opposed to it, one is regarded as liberal.  Unfortunately, these simple analyses of views on issues pertaining to bail and alternatives to losing one's liberty are not helpful.  Electronic monitoring applies throughout Europe, including Northern Ireland.  It applies in many countries that have fewer prisoners than Ireland.  It exists as an option and an alternative to incarcertation.  Assistant Chief Constable Todd and others from Northern Ireland appeared before this committee a couple of weeks ago.  Electronic monitoring is used in the North for bail applications.  The alternative is that if one does not opt for electronic monitoring, one might be denied bail.  I would have believed any person trying to avoid being subjected to pre-trial detention should recognise that electronic monitoring is an option.  The Irish Prison Service uses electronic monitoring to monitor some prisoners and that there are pilot programmes in this regard.  </p><p> Section 1 is a standard provision.  </p><p> Section 2(a) deals with what I referred to, namely making it mandatory for a court to refuse bail if it believes it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.</p><p> Section 2(b) substitutes a new provision for subsection (2A), which was inserted into the Act of 1997 by the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015.  The new subsection (2A) requires the court to refuse an application for bail where an application for bail is made by a person charged with a relevant offence, where the relevant offence is alleged to have been committed in a dwelling and the circumstances specified in subsection (2B) are complied with.  A relevant offence in the legislation is aggravated burglary or burglary. </p><p> Sections 2(c) and 2(d) amend subsection (2B) by providing for a broader range of circumstances that will warrant the refusal of bail by the court.  Under the provisions of the Bill, a person charged with burglary or aggravated burglary will be refused bail if the applicant has a conviction for burglary or aggravated burglary in a dwelling in the previous five years; the applicant has been charged with and awaiting trial for at least two offences of burglary or aggravated burglary in a dwelling within a period commencing six months before and ending six months after the offence in respect of which the bail application is being made; or the applicant has a conviction for burglary or aggravated burglary in a dwelling and is awaiting trial for another such offence that is alleged to have occurred within a period commencing six months before and ending six months after the offence in respect of which the bail application is being made.</p><p> Section 3 deals with the use and provision of electronic monitoring of persons as a condition of bail in certain circumstances.  The section provides that where a person is charged with an offence, as provided for in section 2(2B) of the Act of 1997, the court shall make recognisance subject to the use of an electronic monitoring device.</p><p> That is the overview of the Bill.  Sometimes people criticise politicians.  Politicians have one great ability: they are very much aware of what the public is considering regarding the issues that affect them.  In this regard, they are much more aware than journalists, academics, lawyers, builders or those with other occupations.  It must be emphasised that the public is legitimately concerned, that there is a high risk that the offence of burglary or aggravated burglary will be recommitted by those out on bail, especially those on bail after having committed those offences.  I know fully as a lawyer that persons who are arrested for offences may not be guilty of those offences but they have to go through a trial process.  I am aware of the academic arguments about constitutional rights relating liberty and the presumption of innocence, which are owned and are precious to individuals, and I am conscious of the rights under the European Convention on Human Rights but I am also conscious that there is a reality that needs to be addressed by legislators.  I fully respect that each delegate comes from a different advocacy group or organisation seeking to advocate for a certain cause.  I commend them all for doing so because it is important that we have groups advocating on behalf of certain groups of individuals, be they prisoners or victims.  When there is a problem, politicians can ignore it or seek to deal with it.  We need to deal with this problem because statistically it is clearly a problem.</p></speech>

We must not forget the family of the victim of homicide when it comes to bail.  In every case of homicide, a grieving family is left behind to try to come to terms with an immense tragedy while, at the same time, having to navigate its way through a legal system that is dense and often alien to them.  The criminal justice system, as it stands, does not serve the needs of such families at all.  </p> <p>  Bail is a complex issue and for a bereaved family it can present issues and concerns.  A person accused of homicide out on bail can, and often does, present a real danger to the family of his or her victim, which can increase stress, worry and anxiety for a family.  The accused may live in close proximity to the family.  Very often, the accused can even be a family member.  In all cases, the levels of stress are increased to such an extent that it becomes a great burden on a family.  Very often, there is a real danger to such a family.  AdVIC has worked with families bereaved by homicide since 2005 and the issues and concerns raised with it over the years have included intimidation by an accused, or by his or her family.  This can take many forms.  There can be openly aggressive behaviour or often more subtle but nonetheless real intimidation, and this can result in re-victimisation.  There are occasions where an entire community might be affected by the behaviour of a person accused of homicide while out on bail, and the safety of individuals and the wider community must be considered before bail is granted.</p> <p>  AdVIC understands that the constitutional right to bail and the presumption of innocence must be upheld.  AdVIC in no way wishes to take away the rights of an accused person, but we strongly feel that the right to protection of the victim, or the victim's family in the case of homicide, must be given equal consideration at the very least.  This Bill does not sufficiently address the practical issues that affect families of homicide.  It is vital that any change to our existing bail laws be enforceable and resourced if it is to be effective.  </p> <p>  AdVIC proposes that where an accused breaches his or her bail conditions, having been charged with an unlawful killing, this in itself must be considered a serious offence regardless of the nature of the breach.  This new offence should not be punished concurrently but should be treated consecutively.  AdVIC also proposes that a person convicted of, or pleading guilty to, any unlawful killing should not be released on bail while awaiting sentence.  </p> <p>  It must also be remembered that the time it takes to bring a case to trial creates stress and anxiety for families, and any changes to the bail law should take this into account.  It can increase the time during which a family is under threat.</p><p> Electronic monitoring is a good idea, particularly for the most serious crime of all, but we wonder how it would work, how it would be resourced and how long it would take to implement.  Meanwhile, there are some practical and enforceable ways to afford protection to victims' families following a homicide such as applying strict bail conditions.  Perhaps regular blood testing should be a condition of bail where drugs or alcohol are an issue.  Revoking a driving licence in some cases may afford protection.  We strongly believe that when a senior garda objects to bail, this is never done lightly and should be given careful consideration by a judge.  The views and fears of the family of the victim should also be taken into account.</p><p> I stress that AdVIC has no wish to interfere with the rights of an accused person to bail.  However, we believe the family of a homicide victim is entitled to protection, as is society in general.  It is essential that any objection to bail by a senior member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is given serious consideration, at the very least, before bail is granted.  It is also important that the views of the family of the victim are taken into account and that their fears and concerns are heard.  If we have this opportunity to change, we should ensure that any such change will significantly and effectively address the needs of families of homicide victims.</p></speech>

The commission of offences on bail is rightly a matter of serious concern for the committee and for victims' advocates, who will have the safety of the community at the forefront of their minds.  Our position is that the solution does not lie with the introduction of further legislation which is, in our view, unconstitutional.  Pretrial detention has an important part to play in some criminal proceedings, but it is important to examine what is in place.  We believe there is a robust bail system in place which deals with many of the concerns Deputy O'Callaghan raised.<br/><br/>With regard to the constitutional issues, the court has the power to refuse an application for bail under 1997 Act, as amended, where the court is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  Deputy O'Callaghan correctly said that this was introduced in response to the referendum put to the people.  However, the Bill makes that decision mandatory.  Effectively, it removes any course of reflection from the Judiciary and makes the decision mandatory.  The Deputy said it is important that legislation be evidence-based and necessary.  We welcome that assertion.  It is also important that legislation should be constitutional and proportionate and that it will work.  That is where we raise questions about the introduction of this measure.<br/><br/>The provisions oblige the court to refuse bail in the circumstances set out.  That precludes the court from considering other relevant factors, for example, the seriousness of the immediate charge before the court, the strength of the evidence in the case, any previous convictions, the personal circumstances of the accused and, crucially, the time it will take for the charge to go to trial, which in this jurisdiction can be lengthy.  We support the position of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, which observed that the refusal of a bail application is a responsibility that rests under law with the Judiciary alone.  For that reason and the further reasons set out in our submission, it is our view that this provision, because of its mandatory nature, is unconstitutional in all the circumstances.<br/><br/>Regarding electronic monitoring, it is important to clarify that there is legislative provision for electronic monitoring as a condition of bail.  This Bill makes it mandatory to impose electronic monitoring where a person applies and satisfies the relevant criteria set out in the legislation.  There are two issues with that.  First, it does not meet the proportionality test and as such it is in breach of Article 5.  Second, it misunderstands the way electronic monitoring operates and what it can deliver in practice.  All of us have a concern about delivering a safer community for members' constituents and colleagues but there is a misunderstanding of what electronic monitoring can deliver.  The court is obliged under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights to restrict the right to liberty to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the legitimate aim.  That does not mean electronic monitoring should not be imposed by the court in some cases.  The court has the power to do that.  However, if the court is precluded from considering any other alternative in all circumstances, that falls foul of the proportionality test and is in breach of Article 5.<br/><br/>The other issue is what electronic monitoring can deliver.  Research from the UK, on which Dr. Rogan will elaborate, highlights difficulties with electronic monitoring in terms of inaccuracies in the data returned.  It also does not prevent a crime being committed by the person.  It tells one where a person might be at a particular time.  It requires significant Garda resources to make it effective in any way in terms of geographical location.  We would all like a simple legislative provision that would reduce offending on bail.  There is no debate that everybody would like to see offending on bail reduced, but it is a misunderstanding to suggest that electronic monitoring imposed as a mandatory condition can deliver that.  We have also set out how the provision does not consider the recommendations of the Council of Europe that were made in 2014.<br/><br/>In saying all of that, I do not wish to suggest that the IPRT is minimising or trivialising the number of offences on bail.  They are high numbers and must be examined carefully, but the solutions might lie in places not being considered by this committee or in legislation in respect of Garda resourcing, the capacity available to the Garda, bail supports and services which are not touched on in any of these debates, ensuring that <i>pro forma</i>bail conditions are not being handed out and diluting the effect of bail conditions when they are being imposed.  The right to liberty and privacy is  important and it is important that the court has the option of refusing bail where that is constitutionally appropriate.  It is also important that the court has the option to impose electronic monitoring where that is seen as appropriate.  However, introducing mandatory provisions in this way is not constitutional and will not deliver what the Deputy and all of us would like to deliver which is a safer community.</p></speech>

The project is called "DETOUR - Towards Pre-trial Detention as Ultimo Ratio" and it was funded by the European Commission.  I will share with the members the outcomes of our research that are most relevant to the committee's deliberations under three headings: first, the use of pretrial detention in Ireland generally and the European context; second, observations on the risk of offending as a ground for pretrial detention; and third, some reflections on the use of electronic monitoring.</p> <p>  The rate of pretrial detention in Ireland stands at approximately 14 detainees per 100,000 of the population.  Ireland's rates of pretrial detention are lower than in the other six countries which formed part of our study.  The most recent figures which can be compared indicate, for example, that our rate of pretrial detention to the number of pretrial detainees per 100,000 of the population is about half that of the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria.  The Irish rate is comparable to the rate found in Germany.  However, the number of people in pretrial detention in Ireland has shown a marked increase over the past two years.</p><p>For example, in January 2015, the average number of people in pretrial detention was just under 500.  In October of this year, it is was 725.  This increase is especially notable, though the overall numbers are smaller among women where the number went from 14 to 39.  It is not possible to point to the precise reasons for this increase but the committee will be aware that there have been recent changes to legislation affecting pretrial detention, which sought to limit the possibility of a person taking up bail in circumstances where a risk of offending while on bail is an issue.  It is notable and regrettable that we cannot say more about the reasons behind these changes.  The information we have from the Courts Service is not adequate for public policymaking or research purposes.<br/><br/>Pre-assessment of the effects of legislation on the numbers in prison and on other sanctions has been recommended by the penal policy review group.  No such formal assessments have been completed since this recommendation was  made in 2014.  On this point, the committee might also note that where the upward trend in the numbers of people in pretrial detention to continue to increase Ireland would be going against the trend at European Union level, which seeks to reduce the numbers of people in pretrial detention and to use alternatives wherever possible.  It is also important to recall that debates on pretrial detention tend to revolve around the binary distinction between liberty and detention.  We must not forget that bail is not liberty <i>simpliciter</i>.  The decision before a court is, in the vast majority of cases, between pretrial detention and gradations or levels of liberty.  A wide variety of conditions can be imposed on a person as an alternative to pretrial detention.  The question of the monitoring of them and the supports in place to ensure compliance needs to be considered.  <br/><br/>The emphasis in the Bill on the risk of offending as a ground for pretrial detention raises some interesting issues which our research findings address.  Our participants reported that the O'Callaghan grounds, the risks of flight and of interference with witnesses, remain the dominant consideration in bail applications in Ireland.  It was a notable conclusion of the authors of the comparative report we produced that countries focusing on preventive aspects in the pretrial detention practice seem to have rather high rates of pretrial detention.  This raises a strong concern that increasing use of the risk of offending ground is likely to lead to higher rates of pretrial detention.  Careful consideration must be given to what the purposes of electronic monitoring in the Irish context are to be.  The experience of other jurisdictions is instructive and I respectfully recommend that advice be sought on that experience.  For example, European colleagues in this study found that of the seven countries involved, Belgium and the Netherlands use electronic monitoring most frequently.  These are also countries with rates of pretrial detention almost double that of Ireland.  Many technical matters also need to be considered.  An impact assessment should again be carried out.<br/><br/>There were mixed feelings among the Irish participants as to whether the availability of electronic tagging would be a useful development.  Some felt that it might give judges more confidence to impose restrictions on movement and they would, therefore, be more likely to grant bail.  Other participants said there should be an emphasis on the reasons people do not turn up for trial or offend on bail, such as addiction problems, rather than investing in an electronic tag.  As one probation practitioner said, it is about what is going on in people's heads.  A particularly interesting perspective that emerged concerned the idea that defendants might seek electronic monitoring as an alternative to pretrial detention and review or appeal an outcome where pretrial detention was ordered and electronic monitoring was not used.  A common view expressed by participants in Ireland was that electronic tagging would be similar to the curfew and mobile phone conditions which are currently frequently imposed as conditions of bail by the Irish courts.  It is respectfully recommended that the Courts Service be asked to provide data on the number of bail applications made, granted and refused at District Court and High Court levels on a consistent basis, and broken down by offence type; that analysis be undertaken of the trends developing in the use of pretrial detention in Ireland; that an assessment be made of the implications of this Bill in terms of prison numbers of the overall cost; that an assessment be made of the logistical requirements for electronic monitoring and methods use along with likely costs; and that evidence be sought from those administering systems of electronic monitoring in other jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss these matters and I look forward to questions from members.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I also thank Deputy O'Callaghan for the opportunity to address this issue.  We previously discussed it during the summer in the week the quarterly crime statistics were published, which indicated a significant increase in burglaries, thefts and so on.  Much of the discussion at that time related to the levels of crime that happen while people are out on bail.  There is a significant issue in this regard which needs to be addressed.  Whether this Bill is the means of doing so is another issue.  As legislators, we should strive to find a resolution to the number of crimes that are committed by people who are on bail.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions on electronic tagging and bail more generally.  Ms Deane mentioned that there are not enough practical supports for those bereaved by homicide.  Perhaps she would elaborate on that point and set out what other issues she believes the committee should examine.</p></speech>

We would prefer if judicial discretion were retained by a judge, rather than a mandatory imposition of conditions.  A judge hears the evidence of Garda in court.  A senior Garda is unlikely to object to bail for no good reason.  The Garda would have all of the information and the facts relating to the case having investigated it up to that point.  The fears of a family are real.  The courts can be stressful places for families.  They need to be listened to and taken into account.</p></speech>

On the legislation and section 2, on Committee Stage, I expressed the view that paragraphs (c) and (d), on their own, would expand the circumstances in which a judge could refuse bail.  This may be worthy of consideration.  Section 1(a) and 1(b) would make that an imperative.  I also urge caution regarding section (2B)(a).  If my understanding of this is correct - I did not raise this on Second Stage - it is possible that if somebody is charged with two relevant offences and facing another relevant offence, he or she could be refused bail without being convicted of an offence.  It would be far beyond existing practice if people could be refused bail without ever having been convicted.  I ask Deputy O'Callaghan to clarify if I am correct that if a person has been charged with two relevant offences and is facing a further charge, he or she can be refused bail.</p> <p>  There is a difficulty in regard to the mandatory imposition of conditions.  The general intent of this is that it makes it as good as automatic.  The solution to bail issues lies in supervision and in pursuit of breach of bail.  There are countless incidences, detailed in "Prime Time Investigates", of the frequency with which people have breached their conditions of bail and committed crimes.</p><p>Very often the conditions of their bail have been breached and bail can be suspended on account of that.  We need much stronger structures and resourcing to ensure that breaches of bail are pursued.  I discovered an answer to a parliamentary question revealing that there were 9,000 examples of bench warrants executed for breaches of bail in 2017.  Can any of the speakers offer a comment on that?  What more can be done by the Garda or any other statutory body to ensure that where bail is breached, that breach is pursued? </p></speech>

That needs to be recorded and shared.  There are instances where data are not shared between different regions.  Somebody might commit an offence here and go to another county and reoffend.  Authorities there are not aware of the breach of bail.  Recording and sharing data will be vitally important.</p></speech>

There are two ways that could be addressed.  First, we did some research in 2016 in which a researcher sat in court and listened.  We found that bail conditions were attached in every single case observed.  There were around 90 cases.  One approach is to ensure that where conditions are imposed, they are actually necessary and tailored to the particular case.  In the exercise of its function the Judiciary should be looking at what specific risk, if any, has been identified, and what the sensible response to that risk is.  The Criminal Justice Act 2017 specifically makes provision for a condition prohibiting contact with the alleged victim or his or her family.  It also allows for the imposition of curfews and prohibition of driving if charges are for a serious road traffic offence.  It is important to ensure that the conditions are tailored and are not <i>pro forma</i>conditions thrown out in every single case.  Conditions are impossible for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with and monitor if they are being handed out on a blanket basis.<br/><br/>Second, there are very good international examples of bail support and supervision schemes, such as providing bail hostels so that people can have a residence they can name.  Basically, these involve using very practical measures to ensure that people turn up for court, the court's time is not wasted and the right people are turning up at the right time.  Moreover, in instances where clearly the test is met, for example where there is a clear flight risk or a clearly evidenced risk of interference with the family, refusal of bail is an option for the court.  It is an option for the court at the moment and can be used.  However, unless these provisions are used and conditions are attached in a tailored way and garda&iacute; are resourced to monitor them, the system will freeze up and will not work.  A tailored approach to these things is needed but there are lots of international and Irish examples of useful approaches.  Extern has a bail support scheme for the under-18s.  It is very successful and has worked very well in ensuring that people turn up at court and answer their charges and those cases are progressed.  Perhaps the committee could look at that and consider how it could be extended to the adult population. </p></speech>

That figure is 85% for women.  We need to look at their access to residential drug treatment programmes in the country, as well as issues around homelessness accommodation, mental health needs and the possibility of bail supports for adults.  As Ms Malone said, there is a pilot bail supervision scheme for young people run by Extern.  It is a wraparound programme based on multi-systemic therapy.  Evidence-based research shows a reduction in rearrest rates in out-of-home placements.  Support is available 24-7.  We must look at the issues of mental health, addiction and disability.  It is important to have a support that encourages people to come to court.  There are bail schemes in Scotland, the UK and Australia.  The basic principle must be to support as well as to supervise.</p></speech>

The first thing to say is that it is a notable feature of our system that we have such a wide range of very flexible conditions which can be imposed on a person and can be tailored to the particular concern which the court has about him or her, be it flight risk, evading justice or reoffending.  That is potentially very extensive and can involve multiple conditions and requirements on behaviour.  In the study that we completed, we observed bail hearings and interviewed practitioners, judges and staff of the Probation Service.  There was also a strong view among our participants that a standard list of conditions is imposed in every case; the signing-on condition, the curfew condition, being contactable by a mobile phone and staying away from certain areas or people.  Some of our participants, notably defence practitioners, criticised what they saw as a tendency to impose a "kitchen-sink" approach to conditions.  It is very important to tailor conditions to target the precise concern.  Our system of conditions is already very extensive and very flexible, notably so in comparison with our European neighbours.</p> <p>  It is absolutely necessary to consider the question of full information before a court.  That implies a very well-functioning IT system and a well-functioning system for sharing data between the various criminal justice agencies and within individual agencies.  That is a very important recommendation.  The monitoring of conditions to make sure that the court has the full information before it is really key.</p> <p>  The second question is about monitoring of conditions generally.  That is definitely a question for Garda resources.  In reference to the third question, the individuals who come before the courts are the same cohort who are within the prison system.  We know from multiple studies that the backgrounds of most of those individuals are characterised by problems with housing, addiction and mental health.  That was very much borne out in the research we completed.  Our participants referred to a lack of housing as a major impediment to a person who is trying to live a better life.  Addiction and mental health were major concerns.  What do we do in that scenario, if those factors are making it more likely that the person is going to either not turn up for their trial or to commit offences while on bail?  That is where we get into the area of bail supervision and support schemes.  The Extern scheme for young people, which has been mentioned, received a great deal of praise among our research participants, who felt it was very effective and it was working.</p> <p>  Finally, it is very tempting and completely understandable in discussions like this to view the bail hearing as an opportunity to intervene.  A person has come to the attention of the authorities.  There is a strong suspicion against him or her and he or she may have a prior record which is very troubling and worrying.  We immediately rush to that moment and wonder what we can do at that point.  Naturally we turn to legislation to ensure that this kind of thing does not happen again.  That fails to see the multiple stages in the process where what is going on with this person has not been identified, and the previous encounters with the judicial system which have not prevented them from coming to the attention of the courts again.</p><p>We often see a sticking plaster with bail where we say we will intervene and do what we can right at that point, which limits our focus on what might really have an effect, which is to address what is going on and the underlying causes.</p><p> We already have an extensive system of conditions.  Full information before court is essential.  Monitoring needs to be looked at.  There are some questions there.  The issue of supervision and support also merits attention.</p></speech>

I will reflect on it again if there is a report to be written.  I have two remaining points which I will make together.  People can address them but I am not looking for a response.  My view is that there needs to be more resourcing, especially for the Garda, to pursue people where there are significant breaches of bail.  Numerous cases have been highlighted.  The case of Shane O'Farrell is well-known but there are other cases where significant breaches of bail happened and nothing was done to address it.  The issue of conditions being laid down but not being pursued is as significant as what we have before us.</p> <p>  Electronic monitoring is already possible.  I believe it has a role.  Deputy O'Callaghan said it can sometimes be defined as liberal, conservative, reactionary or however one wants to describe it.  I believe that with certain safeguards, in certain circumstances, it can have a role.  The safeguards need to exist and we need a sense of how effective it can be in particular circumstances.  We discussed this issue generally last week with a different set of guests.  I am of the view that electronic monitoring is only as effective as those who are charged with monitoring the information it provides.  If the information provided by electronic tagging shows that people are in places where they are not meant to be or are not in the place they are meant to be in, that does not put us in a different situation to the current one where people are breaching conditions of bail regarding location.  Electronic tagging might provide us with additional information but it will not necessarily prevent anybody from doing those things unless the resources exist within the Garda to pursue people about this.</p> <p>  My final question is specifically for the IPRT but if Dr. Rogan or Ms Deane want to address the issue, they may as well.  I think I understand the point about constitutional issues relating to the imperative but want to see it elaborated on if possible.  An imperative is provided in this Bill that the judge shall refuse bail.  Having said that, within the same section, there is something of a safeguard relating to whether such a refusal is "considered necessary to prevent the commission of a relevant offence by that person".  In the witnesses' view, does that save it constitutionally?</p></speech>

That was introduced in response to a referendum which was put to the people and passed, the 16th amendment of the Constitution.  The option is already there.  I reiterate Dr. Rogan's point that having full information before the court is extremely important to ensure that the appropriate decision is made in a particular case.  This amendment moves us well beyond that.  It is not permissive, allowing the court to take that decision if it wishes to, but makes it mandatory.  It removes any judicial space to look at all the relevant factors.  They are well known but will include such matters as the seriousness of a charge that is in front of the court, the strength of the evidence, which varies widely in each case, previous convictions, the likely length of time to trial and issues of whether there is evidence of potential intimidation of the victim's family.  These are all relevant issues.  A judge in a case has that evidence in front of him or her, is faced with two lawyers, usually defence and prosecution, or a presenting garda, weighs up that evidence, which is a difficult balancing act in light of the constitutional framework, and tries to make the best decision in each case.  That is the current system.  This Bill undercuts that and makes it mandatory in every case.  Ideally, we would have a situation where that type of decision could deliver a reduction in pre-trial offending.  It ignores that each of these cases involves different factors.  It ignores what implications there will be for our prisons if a blanket provision is introduced.</p> <p>  We woke up today to headlines that six of our 12 prisons are overcrowded, with prisoners sleeping on the floor.  It is important for resources to be targeted where they are needed so those who are a risk or may intimidate witnesses will be refused pre-trial detention.  Where one introduces a blanket measure such as this, however, and greatly increases the number who are in pre-trial detention, not necessarily those who ought to be but those who happen to fall foul of a provision such as this, it is unconstitutional but also will be ineffective.  When that happens, the resources available in our prisons to deal with people serving a sentence after conviction will be completely diluted.  There will be chaos on the landings.  There are not enough officers to deal with the offending behaviours programmes to get people into education and work to reduce the risk of offending.  That does not deliver a safer community.  It is important that the provisions are used in the right way to ensure the right people are detained where risk is identified and that evidence is before a court.  In my view, however, only a judge can make that decision within the limits of the law.</p></speech>

Other countries which form part of our study introduced electronic monitoring to reduce the number of people in pre-trial detention.  The rates were so high that an alternative was sought to try to bring those numbers down.  That does not seem to be the purpose behind the proposed introduction in this case, which is instead additional monitoring for individuals in certain circumstances.  What is the value of that?  I will share the experiences of the other countries which were part of our study.  Participants from other countries expressed serious doubts about the ability of electronic monitoring to prevent offending.  In all of the countries which had electronic monitoring, there was evidence that practitioners were unclear as to what the purposes and real practical possibilities of electronic monitoring were.  It is not possible to have a scenario where one has eyes on an individual at all times and in all circumstances.  The experience has also been that it imposes many logistical and administrative burdens on a court in trying to set it up and then in monitoring the experience after it has been imposed.</p> <p>  An important question, which has not yet been answered in Ireland, is what the purpose of electronic monitoring is.  Is it to reduce pre-trial detention rates or is it something else?  One might get different answers depending on one's perspective.  I strongly recommend that evidence is taken from those responsible for administering these systems in other countries, for example, Belgium and the Netherlands.</p><p>I would be very happy to support any such requests to the research partners in our study to facilitate that to hear what the exact experience is.  </p><p> The 2015 and 2017 Acts took steps to reduce the likelihood of bail being granted in certain circumstances but maintained the discretion.  As Ms Malone stated, what we have seen in our study through our observations and interviews is there are multiple factors present in any discussion about whether bail is to be granted or not.  Limiting discretion for a person who has the opportunity to hear all that evidence, including the various concerns and possible ways to address those concerns, would be quite a significant step and a big change in our approach to pre-trial detention.  We have very clear evidence from the other European countries in our study that when there is more emphasis on risk of offending as a ground, pre-trial detention rates tend to go up.  That is the information; people may have views on whether it is a good or bad thing but it is the likely outcome.  It is something to be aware of.  It is why I am recommending an impact assessment of the numbers who are likely to be placed on pre-trial detention as a result of the Bill.</p></speech>

It is obvious there is a law to refuse bail.  We do not feel it is being applied well enough because the evidence given by garda&iacute; and families is not being listened to sufficiently.  Where bail is breached, I do not think the information is being recorded sufficiently.  Data are not being shared with other regions.  Therefore, people are free to move around and offend in one area and nothing is done about it.  They go to another area and commit another offence.  We need to join up a few dots to make the system more effective.  With regard to electronic tagging in homicide cases, one can have a tag on one's ankle and still shoot or stab somebody.  It will not stop that.  It may place a person at the scene of a crime after the event but I am not sure it would prevent such an attack if that were to happen.  That is what I have to say about that.</p></speech>

I agree it appears that unless there are sufficient Garda resources to back up the system, the system does not deliver anything one would wish it to deliver.  It was stated earlier that surely electronic tagging would be a good thing if it is used as an alternative to pre-trial detention.  I echo the concerns of Dr. Rogan about electronic tagging.  If it was used as a genuine alternative where custody was very likely, there might be some merit in it but the reality is we are very far from being prepared.  We are operating with very little information when it comes to the potential impact on rates of incarceration, our court system or our ability to deliver it.  I echo Dr. Rogan's view about a full impact assessment.  There are a number of other steps that could be taken such as not having <i>pro forma</i>bail conditions, tailoring those conditions for the right people to meet them and looking into the issue of data sharing among criminal justice agencies, which is not yet at a level where it could inform us and allow us to have an evidence-based policy on all these issues.</p></speech>

Their presence is timely in light of the discussion we had last week.  We had a number of sessions.  One was with a group from Ireland, North and South, during which issues around electronic monitoring were discussed with regard to sex offences, particularly child sexual offences, and how it might be regulated.  We discussed other Bills last week.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan made the point, which I do not really agree with, that politicians know the people and that is our great asset.  I am not so sure about that.  It could be said, and the Deputy is absolutely right, that issues of crime and sentencing are issues of significant public interest in which our tabloid media, in particular, play a very damaging role in informing - that is, misinforming - the public on these issues.  They actually prey on the hurt that has been done to victims and do not help anybody.  Politicians have a responsibility in their responses to the genuine hurt and problems that exist to deal with these things in an evidence-based way.  Sometimes what we put forward actually fuels that media problem and does not address it properly.  We discussed Bills here last week - one in particular - where it was as plain as could be that the Bill would not achieve anything it was supposed to achieve but was being put forward as an emotional response to an horrific crime.  I do not agree with such a method.  Deputy O'Callaghan does not normally do that either but I am not sure if he is doing it on this Bill.  The purpose of this Bill is to make the community safer.  That is what it is about.  It is about making people safer in response to some of the horrible crimes that have happened while people were out on bail.  The problem is it does not do that.  It is as simple as that.  All it does is tie the hands of judges.  That is what it seems to do.  We need to tease that out a bit more.  If we look at some of the decisions that have been made and some of the court judgments, much of the time the judicial decision was not because the judge decided "I want to let this fella out" but because he or she was given inaccurate information by the garda&iacute; or was not given the full picture.  Changing this legislation will not address the deficit in information that is often given to judges.  We should hear a little bit more on that point.  I very much accept Ms Deane's point that the judges should listen to senior garda&iacute; but there have been some awful cases in recent years where senior garda&iacute; have given very bad evidence.  Instinctively judges side with garda&iacute; but there has been much information that indicates they have not always been as good as it says on the tin.  </p> <p>  It has been emphasised by the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights that while previous convictions can be considered in bail applications there are serious constitutional issues such as the right to liberty that have to be considered when making previous convictions a reason for mandatory refusal of bail.  I would like Deputy O'Callaghan to tease it out a bit more, particularly when it is taking away from a judge the possibility of factoring in other issues such as disability or serious illness or other criteria that should be taken into account.</p> <p>  It is timely that the replies to parliamentary questions we received on prison overcrowding were reported in the media today.  What are we saying here?  We are going to incarcerate more people pre-trial and put them into a Prison Service that had 676 people sleeping on mattresses in July.  How will that impact on the safety of staff, the morale of other prisoners and on education and training?</p><p>We know prison numbers have risen to more than 4,000.  What level of research has been done?  I know Dr. Rogan gave some good figures relating to those in pre-trial detention but what level of analysis has been done to show from where the rise in incarceration is coming, and whether it is linked to bail breaches?</p><p> I would also like to hear more about the evidence in much of this, particularly the process of electronic monitoring.  It has been provided for since 2006 but it has not been implemented anywhere in the State except with the Irish Prison Service monitoring people on temporary release.  Last year's criminal justice Bill was enacted but the impact has not been reflected in any statistics.  Would we not be better off analysing this a bit more?  Why has it not been implemented?  Last week everybody was saying it was not a silver bullet, and everybody here agrees, but the process has not been implemented.  Should we not do it first?  There were constitutional issues raised about mandatory monitoring and removing judicial discretion but have further issues been raised?  Does anybody have information on the lack of safeguards detailed in the provision to operate an effective monitoring system, as this must be taken into account as well?</p><p> There is also the matter of cost-effectiveness, as there is a major expense in the monitoring.  If we go along with this we are creating the illusion of making society safer but we are ignoring all the evidence indicating that this does not happen.  Putting legislation on the Statute Book on that basis is a matter of incredible concern when we could be diverting resources.  It is incredibly costly to do electronic monitoring and we would be far better investing in the types of initiatives spoken about by Ms Dean, such as beefing up the Probation Service to give people support while on bail, so they can understand conditions and turn up in court.  It is good stuff.  This is definitely the wrong direction and I emphasise the point made by Ms Malone in that judges have power.  Restrictions are imposed all the time.  Perhaps people may wish to comment on judicial guidelines.  We could improve sentencing guidelines and how people deal with the pretrial process.  It could be a far better basis for this process.  I am just asking for a couple of comments as the points have been incredibly well made by the panel.</p></speech>

The first point is about electronic monitoring and I come back to the question of what is the purpose and possible impact of it.  It is not to say there is not a role for electronic monitoring in some circumstances but we must take on board the evidence of other jurisdictions where it has been in place for some time.  There are many questions to ask.  For example, would electronic monitoring be used as a type of &quot;location ban&quot; or house arrest?  What would be the modality by which electronic monitoring would be used?  We need much more information to be able to make a conclusion on the impact of electronic monitoring or its costs and so on.<br/><br/>The study also mentions other elements, such as the use of radio frequency electronic monitoring or global positioning systems, GPS, and the associated cost implications.  There are several practical logistical questions that deserve much consideration before a significant step is taken and imposed.  If all this has not been worked out in advance, we could run into much difficulty later.  Taking direct evidence from those who run these systems in other countries would be very valuable.<br/><br/>We asked participants in Ireland what they thought of electronic monitoring and the impact it would have.  These are people who work in the area of bail and pretrial detention every day of the week.  There was no consensus at all among the group as to whether it would be good or bad.  We almost equally balanced perspectives on both sides.  Some participants felt it would be likely to lead to more bail being granted while others felt it would give more comfort to judges and the public.  Others felt that defendants would look for it and it would be more likely to be something sought by defendants than the prosecution, which is an interesting perspective.  There was consensus that the existing curfew condition and keeping mobile phones on and with credit to facilitate contact were kind of &quot;low-tech&quot; versions of electronic monitoring.  Many participants felt they were doing the job and perhaps more could be invested in how those processes are implemented.  The idea was that they were, in effect, taking the place of electronic monitoring.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned constitutional implications and we have a much longer paper that addresses some of these matters.  The Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v</i>. Mulvey case notes that bail is not an automatic right and there is no suggestion the existing system means people must get bail.  The case goes on to say it is an important aspect of the individual's constitutional right to liberty, a right that can only be restricted on limited grounds, supported by cogent evidence.  If we move to a scenario where the nature of the offence charged and aspects of the person's pre-existing offending background constitute the tipping point to making the decision that a person goes to pretrial detention, questions are raised about whether we would be in conformity with that existing principle from the Mulvey case.<br/><br/>There was a question about the numbers in pre-trial detention and overall questions about data and what is driving increasing numbers.  Before I address those I might touch on the matter of crime statistics.  It has been very fairly mentioned that crime statistics are being published under reservation.  In itself, it is a really regrettable state of affairs that our nation is not able to say with certainty what are the crime statistics because there are question marks about the quality of the information.  I was a member of an expert group on crime statistics chaired by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, some years ago.  It is critical that we invest and support our Central Statistics Office in gathering this kind of information and ensure that what is put to the public, and which has a real effect in terms of public perception and policymaking, is accurate and beyond reproach.  It is really important that we know the CSO statistics are still under reservation and there are questions about whether improved accuracy in recording data might play a role too.  That is not to minimise in any way the numbers we are seeing, which are worrying.<br/><br/>There was a question about whether the rise in pre-trial detention figures are a factor in the overall rise in the prison population.  As a general point, we need much more analysis in general of what is going on and we need regular assessments of the offence types going in and the backgrounds of people going in.  Is there a change in sentencing practice or is there a factor of increased crime rates or Garda activity?  We just do not know and that vacuum for policymaking is very serious.  I presented graphs to the committee and mentioned numbers and we are seeing rises in the numbers of people in pretrial detention.  If, roughly speaking, this amounts to approximately 200 additional people per day in the prison system, there will be an effect.  Overall numbers are much smaller but those for women have really increased a lot.  Much assessment must be done as to why that is the case.<br/><br/>Deputy Clare Daly spoke about the lens through which we view these matters.  The question is whether to take the road of legislation or other ways to try to do what we all want, which is to achieve safer communities and people feeling safe and that they have received justice.  I return to the penal policy review group, which published in 2014.  I am the chairperson of the implementation oversight group for that report.</p><p>We are not going to get the solutions we want unless we look at a whole-of-government approach to the issue of crime and offending.  We need to make sure that when we bring in changes or reforms in the area of crime, offending, prisons, probation and so on, we make sure we include in those conversations health professionals and experts in health, addiction and social policy.  It comes down to what lens one wants to look at these issues through.  The penal policy review group would very much advocate the need for a whole-of-Government approach.  I refer to the work of Dr. Ruth Barrington's Interagency Group on Co-operation for a Fairer and Safer Ireland, which is trying to examine these issues from a more interdepartmental and interagency perspective.  That work needs much more support.</p></speech>

As she pointed out, given the headlines this morning it is important that we are having this conversation.  I echo everything Dr. Rogan said.  We welcome the data and research strategy of the Department of Justice and Equality and also the active recruitment that is happening at the same time.  Hopefully, in the future we will have more evidence on which to base our responses to public concerns and public safety.</p> <p>  I will just add a few figures to what Dr. Rogan said.  We do not know what the drivers are in the absence of information but we can see certain trends.  I have chosen to use 31 October to give us a snapshot of the past five years, given that is the most up-to-date date.  On 31 October 2018, there were 809 prisoners on remand for trial; on 31 October 2017, it was 745; and on 31 October 2016, it was 648.  This is in line with Dr. Rogan's point about there being an extra 200.  Yesterday, 18% of people in prison were on remand but 23.3% of women in prison were on remand.  We must be mindful that women in prison are more likely to be there for less serious offences, which is an issue that needs to be examined.</p> <p>  To go back to the issue of bail and the most effective use of resources, the bail supervision scheme is being run by Extern at Oberstown.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs awarded Extern just under &euro;490,000 to run the scheme in 2017, for which it engaged and supported 24 young people.  That has to be considered in light of the fact the cost of holding a young person in Oberstown is &euro;350,000 to &euro;400,000 each.  We are looking at the most effective but also the least damaging way of dealing with this.  We have to be mindful that detention has multiple damaging effects, be it of an adult with caring responsibilities or a child, for whom detention must be a sanction of last resort.</p></speech>

While we debate the merits or demerits of electronic monitoring, we have to acknowledge we have a problem.  For instance, in a recent trial where a man was convicted of murder, it turned out he had 78 previous convictions and had been out on bail when that murder occurred.  Only three days prior to that murder, he had attempted a similar street attack on somebody else, which, thankfully, was unsuccessful.  We have those kinds of occurrences where a breach of bail has occurred and somebody is still walking around free to commit further serious crimes.</p> <p>  Why do we have situations where multiple breaches of bail are allowed to happen so people are free to commit other serious crimes?  As I said earlier, if a human life has been taken and somebody receives bail, that is fine, but where that bail is breached for any reason, it has to be considered a further serious offence.  We need to be looking at what is happening on the ground while we debate the merits and demerits of other measures.  It is happening today.  Somebody out on bail will commit a serious offence and will probably get a slap on the wrist.  While I am not a lawyer and cannot go into the details of what may happen, it is happening and we know this.  People are being killed when it is avoidable if the law that exists is applied properly and followed up.  It again may be a question of resources.  If resources are the issue, we cannot consider other solutions that will take even more resources.</p></speech>

We need to look at the reasons people commit crimes, why they breach their bail conditions, who is charged with monitoring that and sharing the information and the interagency lack of co-operation.  If that was introduced properly, we would not be having this conversation about tying the hands of judges, because that is all this does.  It assumes the information the Judiciary is getting is accurate, when there is a big argument to be had about beefing up Garda information, probation officer reports and all of that sort of backup and support.</p> <p>  I do not want to add too much but this is important.  To have 23% of women prisoners on remand is incredibly troubling because of the destabilising impact.  The evidence is there to show the impact that putting a woman into prison has on a family, with children being taken into care and so on, and this is far worse than in the case of a man.  We need to look at that.  Incarceration is always damaging.  Putting people in earlier if they are going to reoffend when they finish their sentence is not dealing with the issue, which is more complex.  Legislation like this does not help.</p></speech>

To go back to a point made by Ms Deane, while there is a qualification on the crime statistics and trends, the trends are going in a worrying direction around the whole bail issue, repeat offences and recidivism.  The witnesses have taken an approach to the legislation and said they think it has constitutional implications, and so on.  Is there any type of legislative change they would welcome that would balance the concerns they are raising with what is a worrying trend, which no one can deny?  There are real human stories where people are the victims of serious offences, whether it is murder, burglaries or otherwise.  Again, we cannot generalise about the people behind those offences, and Deputy Daly mentioned there are difficult life stories behind why people end up doing certain things.  However, there is also a cohort of psychopaths, probably a very small minority of people overall, who are slipping through.  I recognise it is difficult in a legislative piece to balance all of those considerations.  Nonetheless, there are some who continue to reoffend and who are slipping through all the time.</p> <p>  Given the trends and the legislation, as experts on penal reform, can the witnesses suggest how we could move to try to clarify the legislative framework in order to balance the constitutional considerations and also the aspirations we have around penal reform?  I recognise such aspirations are important, in particular those around addiction and the complexity of incarceration.</p><p>However, a whole-of-government approach is important, too.  Something needs to happen.  Communities are faced with increased fear and anger when they see people committing the same offence over and over and they hear from the garda&iacute; investigating the burglary that they know who it was and they are in this cycle.  How would the witnesses see this in terms of policy and legislative changes?  Could there be amendments that might balance their considerations or does it rest completely outside the remit of legislative change?</p></speech>

There is absolutely no denying that at all.  The Deputy's question presupposes that the solution lies in more legislation.  That is where there is a significant point of difference between us.  We all would love if it was as simple as introducing a new provision which made refusal of bail mandatory, which would slash the rates of crime committed on bail.  However, if that was the solution, it would have been discovered and used in other jurisdictions.  It has never delivered what the Deputy is asking for.  The difficult reality about crime and criminality in Ireland and in every other country is that the causes are complex.  The way crime happens over time is complex.  The criminal justice system is complex.  The interrelationship between social justice - or injustice - and the criminal justice system is complex.  The solution to these things is never straightforward and there is never a silver bullet.</p> <p>  There are several proposals, between what Dr. Rogan said, what we have said and indeed what Ms Deane has said, encompassing examining the rights of victims within the criminal justice system in general and ensuring that they are protected; using existing legislation in respect of the imposition of conditions; and having proper consultation with victims' families where there are fears of intimidation.  It is about making sure that the Garda is resourced to do the job properly.  It is about ensuring there is an impact assessment of any criminal justice measure before it is implemented so we know what is likely to happen.  It is about collecting data so we know the measures that are being used and not used and their efficacy.</p> <p>  That is a messy answer because the system is messy, crime is messy and social justice and injustice are messy.  There are no silver bullets.  It is going to require the committee and legislators at large to start to grapple with what penal reformers and academics have been saying for the last 25 years, which is that the roots of these problems lie in failures in services that happen in people's childhood and teenage years.  We are not saying that excuses crime; we are saying the State has many opportunities to intervene and provide services for people.  People are availing of services as we speak in terms of homelessness, mental health provision and addiction services.  As long as we try to address the issue of offending on bail in a vacuum as if it exists without relationship to anything that happens beforehand, we are not going to solve the issue.  It is clearly a significant issue.  I do not think anyone on the panel would attempt to suggest that these numbers are anything but concerning.  The solution does not lie in more legislation but in a whole number of other areas which are difficult but not impossible.</p></speech>

The legislation is there to provide for electronic monitoring, for refusal of bail, and to consider the issue of flight risk.  If the legislation is there already, we have to look at the whole set of other points in the system including Garda resourcing; the use of <i>pro forma</i>conditions; the failure, perhaps, to monitor bail conditions, or the inability to monitor them because they are being handed out on a blanket basis; and, indeed, the support that is required for victims' families as well.  It is already accepted that refusal of bail is appropriate in some instances.  This is more a matter of accepting the reality that the solution does not lie in further legislation because the legislation is already there to allow judges to refuse bail where appropriate.  Dr. Rogan has done work on of assessing the complexity of the issue when it comes to electronic monitoring.  We are aware of failures in the social system that happen years and years before people reach the criminal justice system.  These are complex issues that unfortunately require a whole-of-government approach, which is difficult, and data so that we know what is happening and understand the reasons.  Those are difficult things to deliver and they require resources.  The answer is not a simple solution of proposing two provisions and expecting them to solve this problem, which is of clear concern to everybody.</p></speech>

The question is whether legislation or any amendment can play a role in the complex solution.  To broaden the question, can legislation ever perform any role in solving these complex issues across any area of policy?  I take Ms Malone's point.  Perhaps another witness would like to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Rogan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018120500002#V00600"><p>It is absolutely an honourable intention to seek to reduce offending and offending on bail.  Offending on bail is an insult to the public.  It is a harm to victims and communities.  We all share the same objective, which is to make sure communities are as safe as possible and that people are protected.  It is a matter of differences in our approach to what might be the most effective way of achieving this.  The question of offending while on bail is linked to the broader question of prolific offending generally.  While this is not a suggestion for a legislative amendment, it definitely merits further analysis by the criminal justice agencies in conjunction with research into the extent of prolific offending and re-offending and the factors that can be influential in reducing them.  That may well include more monitoring and supervision - indeed, this is likely.  It may well include recommendations on legislation.  A study and analysis at Department level of prolific offending and reoffending would be very useful.</p> <p>  On the broader question of what legislation can do, I would go back to the penal policy review group from 2014.  We had historic highs in prison numbers, a feeling that the objectives of penal policy were not clear and a feeling that there was a lack of energy or even enthusiasm for what we could achieve to make sure our communities were safer.  The review group sought to take stock of the penal system as a whole and to suggest a blueprint for what might actually work to improve our penal policy and reduce the rates of offending.  The penal policy review group comprised senior members of the Department, senior members of the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service, a judge, a consultant psychiatrist and people from civil society organisations.  I was a member for a period - the members can take that into account in their analysis.  All of these individuals who were very experienced in the criminal justice agencies decided that in the end, the most effective approach was a whole-of-government approach.  Such an approach understands that crime is a multidimensional, multifaceted issue within which legislation absolutely plays a role but where the more likely effective outcomes are to be found outside of legislation.  We have to bear that in mind.  When it comes to possible duties and things to be imposed, it would be really interesting to see what would happen if we placed a duty on all Departments and agencies to co-operate to prevent crime.  That might be around the information sharing side and it might also be about bringing Departments and agencies together to put forward policies across the board seeking to prevent crime and promote safer communities.</p><p> I also want to mention the victims' directive, which is really important.  The penal policy review group emphasised that the directive must be monitored in the context of its full implementation.  If we are to address the concerns of victims properly, we must ensure that this legislation is being fully implemented and monitored at all stages.  Ms Malone mentioned that quite robust legislation is already in place.  In some of the seven countries we studied, there is extensive use of risk of offending as a ground.  We found evidence in our research that 90% of pre-trial decisions in Austria are made on the ground of risk of offending.  The same frustration exists among Austrian practitioners and participants about crime rates, reoffending and all the concerns we share about the effect of crime on people.</p><p> In summary, it is absolutely the case that something needs to happen.  It is a question of finding the best mechanism to make it happen.  While legislation has a role to play, it is not always the most effective mechanism.  I reiterate the need to incorporate the perspectives of health, social policy and mental health into these kinds of discussions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joan Deane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018120500002#W00200"><p>I agree with much of what Dr. Rogan and Ms Malone have said.  It seems that existing legislation could be sufficient to deal with this issue.  I think our application of that legislation leaves a lot to be desired.  We must acknowledge that we have a problem.  Every problem must be measured if it is to be solved.  If we can measure the problem and present the proper information to a court to enable it to tailor the bail conditions, as Ms Malone has suggested, that would be a good step forward.  In the specific case of homicide, I suggest that the psychological report, the Garda evidence and the views of the family should be taken into account before bail is granted.  The granting of bail is not something to which we would object.  We understand that bail happens, but we have an issue when nothing happens about breaches of bail.  It is a very identifiable problem.  It is not hidden.  It is out there.  What can we do to address it?  Is it a Garda resource issue?  Perhaps resources need to be put into this area.</p></speech>

I studied this matter in Trinity College, where Dr. Rogan lectures.  I accept that there is an evidence base for the point that we have to be careful about how we set and interact with penal policy.  Many positive changes have been made in Finland, where issues like recidivism have been addressed.  It is important for us to remember this point when we are discussing issues of penal reform.</p></speech>

This is my first time to get an understanding of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  The work that Ms Deane is doing is absolutely fantastic.  I cannot imagine what it would be like for a family member to lose somebody to homicide.  When we bring it back to the human level of what it is like for family members - the devastation they feel when they lose somebody in this way - we appreciate that it must be one of the worst things that can happen to a family.  I just want to name that.  I hear our guests' frustration regarding the judicial system.  I do not know a huge amount about the latter, but I agree with Ms Malone's point that it can be very messy because it has to deal with trauma, crisis, addiction and mental health, with which I would be very familiar.</p> <p>  I understand why Deputy O'Callaghan would want to introduce a Bill such as this.  It is about protecting the community.  Some of the work I do in the area of addiction and mental health happens within prisons.  Many of the women I work with - I work with women only - experienced childhood traumas of the kind described by Ms Malone.  In many cases, they have been victims of crime and have ended up in addiction because of violence or sexual abuse.  I really understand that there has to be compassion from that perspective.  I hope I am getting it right when I say I am hearing from everybody - including Ms Deane, who has an understanding from a family perspective - that there needs to be more interagency work.  I completely agree with that.  Agencies and organisations must work together.  I was struck by Ms Deane's really important comment that families are not getting heard by the judges.  There must be some way for mental health and addiction organisations to come together as part of an interagency approach to work with people who commit crimes.</p> <p>  I will give an example.  When my mother had a small shop many years ago, a man armed with a knife jumped the counter.  It was absolutely terrifying for her as an old woman.  He robbed her, but she survived.  When he told his story in court - he had young kids, they were homeless, he was not in addiction and he just needed money - she ended up feeling really sorry for him because he was given six months in prison.  I know I am only giving a small example of the reality of people who commit crimes and why they commit them.  There is always a story involved.  I suppose that is from where I am coming.  It does not help when one loses somebody.  I suppose I am just not sure that this is the answer.  When one is dealing with addiction, one often sees that the prisons are in crisis.  Prison officers are in crisis because they are all burnt out and exhausted.  They are all trying to deal with their own mental health issues.  It is just a cycle.  It is a vicious circle.  It would be great if we could look at all of that.  I suppose that is where I would be coming from in this respect.</p> <p>  I thank all of our guests for their presentations, which have given me a really good understanding of what is going on in the context of the judicial system.  We see it all the time.  Last month, a judge let a young man walk free even though there was evidence that he may have committed rape.  By contrast, a woman who broke open a packet of Pringles in a shop got four months in prison.  Something is not right with the judicial system.  That is what I am saying.  That matter really needs to be addressed.  I do not really have any questions, I just want to thank our guests for their clear and precise presentations.</p></speech>

I hope they have put Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill into oblivion.  In fairness to the Deputy, he stated at last week's meeting that "sentencing is an extremely complicated area and politicians sometimes try to simplify it by introducing legislation".  The Deputy's words should be remembered.  He is not all bad.</p><p> I do not really have any questions for our guests because they have addressed all of the issues I wished to raise.  They have given us their take on the matter and what they said makes sense.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking on the part of the Government.  As Ms. Malone pointed out, the State is failing people.  Many of them end up in prison and some commit suicide.  We have legislation that is not being applied.  People think that we do not have good building regulations in Ireland because there has been so much bad construction work uncovered but we actually have world class building regulations in this country.  The problem is that the implementation of those regulations is not supervised so we end up with bad buildings.</p><p> Prison does not work and the fact that the numbers being imprisoned are increasing means that something is wrong.  Rehabilitation does not seem to be a feature, even though it is supposed to be part of the prison regime.  Deputy Clare Daly and I having been visiting prisons regularly for years and have seen that they do not do what they are supposed to do.  Prisons are supposed to educate prisoners so that they will not reoffend and will become fit members of society on release.  If prisoners come out of prison and reoffend, then obviously imprisonment is not working.  We know that prisons do not work and yet we continue to fill them with people, often as a knee-jerk response to different issues.  What should the Government do to address the fact that prison does not work, apart from not failing people in the first instance?  Do our guests agree that we have a very black and white approach to dealing with crime?</p></speech>

We have crime and we have punishment.  I do not know what other punishment there can be for serious crime apart from prison.  I would not be an advocate of the death sentence so I see prison as the only answer and that is certainly black and white.  We need to study this more.  The studies conducted by Dr. Rogan and her team and the work done by Ms Malone are very important.  Advocacy is also important but, ultimately, we must acknowledge that we have a problem.  I agree with Deputy Wallace that Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill will not do anything to address the serious issues regarding homicide and breaches of bail.  We need to be looking seriously at how we apply existing legislation.  Perhaps it is a Garda resource issue; I am not sure.  While we are examining why things are happening in the way that they are, we must also look at the fact that they are happening and deal with that at a very practical level.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the extreme ends of the spectrum and reports of extremely heavy sentences being handed down at one end and of extreme leniency at the other end.  It is a difficulty when we are informing ourselves through media reporting because media values are not the same as criminal justice values.  In that context, it is very important that we all have access to both detailed data and detailed analysis of that data.  We must look at evidence based policy that has been successful elsewhere.  We must consider the effectiveness of interventions like community service orders where appropriate.  Such orders are not appropriate in the context of serious offending but the vast majority of crime is not at the most serious end of the spectrum.  Unfortunately, however, our debates are always framed around the most serious end.  It is important to recognise the gradation of offending that happens.</p> <p>  Intervening at the earliest point and providing resources in the context of social structures and systems can work to prevent offending.  Furthermore, where offending is related to issues such as addiction, mental ill health, homelessness, poverty or domestic violence, the response must deal with those underlying issues and not just with the symptoms.  A whole-of-Government approach is required, as are more data and resources.  We also need more supports and services for victims and their families.  The rights of both do not have to be in opposition.  In many cases, it is about ensuring that everyone who has a role in the system is being supported to take part in that system.</p></speech>

It is about implementation of existing policy.  We have the 2013 Oireachtas committee report on penal reform, the 2018 report on penal reform and sentencing by this committee and also the strategic review of penal policy.  If resources were put into the implementation of recommendations around what will work, arrived at through engaged dialogue, we would already be ahead.</p></speech>

We are looking at the over-representation of children in care in the criminal justice system.  We are also looking at residential care policies, policing and trauma informed approaches to same, as well as at the number of people with severe mental illness in the prison system.  In terms of services in a therapeutic environment, there are not enough spaces in the Central Mental Hospital and even when the new hospital is built, there will not be enough beds.  An holistic approach is needed that takes into account all of the issues that affect the prison population.</p></speech>

Based on our history and the experience of other countries, when the criminal justice policy-making discussion relates to what legislation can do and is focused on what can be achieved through legislative means, we tend to see prison populations rising.  We saw that happening here in the mid 1990s and the mid 2000s.  It is for the Oireachtas to decide if those approaches have been successful to date.  If they had been successful, would we be in this position?</p> <p>  We must change our approach to policy-making.  We must have proper, robust, evidence based discussions on the current position, what is likely to work, what works elsewhere and on the international experience in this area.  It is noteworthy that this committee's report advocated an approach to policy-making that is more informed.  Also noteworthy is the penal policy review group's recommendation that we put a consultative council in place to determine where changes are needed, assess the information we have on what is going on, look at what is going on elsewhere and make proposals for reform.  It would have been very valuable to put this Bill before a group such as that.  This process has been very valuable and if we see more of that kind of approach to policy-making, we might get closer to being able to provide real and effective answers to the problems that we all want to address.</p></speech>

He deserves great credit for that work.  We are all very conscious of the fact that countless people have been let down by the failures of either some in the system or by a failure of and by the system.  All of that has been reflected very well during today's meeting.  I thank our guests for referencing our report on penal reform and sentencing, in which we invested quite a lot of time.  The critical element, as pointed out by Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide, is implementation.</p><p>I am sure each of us would react to that by stating, "Would that we had the opportunity."  Unfortunately, we only have the power of recommendation and cannot direct.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018120500002#Y00200"><p>I thank our guests for attending, for their submissions and for the efforts they have made in this area.  I listened very carefully and, while I disagree with some parts of what was said, I will take them on board, as I will the comments of my colleagues.</p> <p>  I am slightly concerned that we got into a broader discussion about penal policy, rather than the specifics of the Bill, and this is something that tends to happen when a group of politicians comes together.  The specifics of the Bill are designed to deal with an issue that everyone recognises is a problem, namely, that people out on bail are committing serious offences.  We need to determine what can be done in respect of that.  I am absolutely certain that there is no single solution to it and I do not suggest that this legislation is the solution at all.  I am also concerned that the Bill was reflected on as being the solution to other problems.  It is not.  It seeks to deal with the significant, specific issue in our society in which people on bail commit serious offences.</p> <p>  I identified politicians as being different from other people because we have been in rooms with families whose sons or daughters have been subjected to very serious crimes, including murder or rape, were committed by people out on bail.  They ask what we, as legislators, are doing about this and I reply to the effect that we changed the law after a constitutional referendum in 1996, when 75% of the population voted in favour.  We can see from the statistics, however, that the legislation in question is not working.  Legislation is not the only solution but it is part of it.  We are only legislators and we can only make law so we need to look at where we can make the law better.</p> <p>  I value the work done by the IPRT and I was at the recent launch of the report on the prison system, though I did not see Deputy Wallace there.  It is a fantastic report and I commend the organisation on the work it does in respect of prisoners' rights.  As Ms Malone said, however, these are not incompatible things.  We should reduce the numbers in our prisons and we should promote and protect prisoners' rights but there are extremely violent men in our society who attack women, commit assaults on other men and have murdered people.  We cannot say we just need to broaden resources or that legislation is not the answer.  Legislation is the only answer we have in our toolbox.  We need to recognise that there is an issue and I do not believe the legislation is unconstitutional.  We put a provision into the Constitution to allow a court to refuse bail where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by the person involved.  If a court believes that a person before it who is applying for bail is reasonably likely to commit a serious offence, the court should refuse bail.  We should state that.  I used the term "mandatory" but this does not remove judicial discretion as the judge has to assess whether there is a likelihood of a person committing an offence.  If a judge believes that an individual before him or her is going to commit a serious offence, he or she should refuse bail.  I do not think it will have the effect of creating chaos on prison landings.  We need to recognise that a small number of men are involved in serious repeated offences, something we have seen recently in some court decisions, and we, as legislators, we, as legislators, need to take steps to deal with it.</p> <p>  It is right to say that electronic monitoring is on the Statute Book since 2007.  However, the relevant legislative provision has not yet been commenced in respect of bail.  We do not want to put people in prison unnecessarily but this is a means of keeping people out of prison.  It is a means of monitoring people for the purposes of bail by identifying where they are.  It will not stop the commission of an offence but it will assist the court and garda&iacute; in detecting whether or not the individual was involved in the commission of an offence, and it will act as a serious deterrent.  Carrying on the way we are doing is not a solution.</p></speech>

We will then consider the Estimate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I remind members that, in accordance with Standing Orders, the discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate.  I call the Minister.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018120500002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and I apologise for being late.  I hit an unavoidable problem on the way in which was none of my own making.  I thank the Chairman and committee for the opportunity to present details of this Supplementary Estimate for my Department.  As the members will be aware from the advance brief circulated, there are two elements to the Supplementary Estimate.  I refer to a sum of &euro;6 million from the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, dividend and &euro;37.5 million, which has been agreed with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to boost investment in the transport, tourism and sport sectors.</p> <p>  Given the IAA&rsquo;s strong financial performance and significant surplus cash reserve, it was agreed it was sufficiently well funded to pay at least one special dividend.  This is in addition to the agreed annual dividend policy of 30% of profits after tax.  As part of that agreement, the IAA committed to further special dividends in 2019 and 2020, subject to prevailing conditions.  As was the case this year, I will consult the Minister for Finance with a view to retaining a portion of the special dividends, to again be reinvested in the work of my Department.  The second part of the Supplementary Estimate, &euro;37.5 million, is being allocated for a range of projects.</p> <p>  The Estimates for 2018 provide an overall gross allocation to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of &euro;2.03 billion.  This additional money will now bring the total allocation to &euro;2.07 billion.  The total allocation is used to provide investment in critical infrastructure and to ensure that vital services are available to the public during 2018.  I will briefly go through the areas that are recipients of this additional money.  Funding of &euro;1.5 million for aviation will assist with operational grant applications from the regional airports.  The majority of this funding focuses on supporting the wage costs for the provision of essential safety and security services.  In the public transport area, &euro;5 million has been allocated for bus and Luas investment.  This will partly fund bus fleet purchases and partly fund a stage payment for the eight additional Luas trams being purchased under the green line capacity enhancement project.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;200,000 will go towards an Irish Rail accessibility app which will assist rail users with sensory or mobility impairments and &euro;400,000 will be invested to improve the safety of cyclists by installing cyclist detection systems at junctions.  There will also be &euro;3 million for working capital relating to the bus market opening, BMO, programme, which commenced on 9 September.  The working capital requirement for BMO arises from the gross cost contract arrangement with Go Ahead and Bus &Eacute;ireann for routes that have been opened to competition.  In this case, the National Transport Authority, NTA, will collect all fare revenues and carry the associated revenue risk.</p> <p>  In the roads area, the main allocation will be to regional and local roads, with an additional allocation of &euro;15.03 million towards roads maintenance.  As the committee will be aware, in recent years the impact of severe weather has intensified the vulnerability of a weak network in need of maintenance and repair.  This amount will be allocated to local authorities affected by such events this year under a new special maintenance grant.  In addition, &euro;700,000 will also be allocated to the purchase of salt for use on regional and local roads.  The severe winter just gone resulted in exceptionally high salt usage and, therefore, this additional money will ensure adequate stocks are again in place.  Funding for national roads will be increased by &euro;3 million to cover winter operations, public lighting and other outstanding maintenance.  A sum of &euro;7 million will be used for a payment to FBD in respect of the compensation, legal costs and court interest payable on a case from 2009 where a court of appeal found the State had liability.</p> <p>  Under the maritime heading, search and rescue helicopters have been adapted for the night vision imaging system, NVIS, and the necessary night vision goggles have been purchased.  This system is necessary to improve search and rescue capability.  The allocation in the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1.7 million will go towards the provision of training on the use of the NVIS.  This will complete the project adapting search and rescue helicopters and crews to night vision imaging systems.</p> <p>  In sport, &euro;1.5 million is being allocated to Sport Ireland for high performance sport.  This funding will be used to assist athletes' preparations for major competitions, including the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo and key world and European championship events.  A sum of &euro;1.12 million is being provided to Sport Ireland to meet the following costs.  A sum of &euro;750,000 has been allocated to the Irish Open golf event, &euro;100,000 to Paralympics Ireland, &euro;120,000 to anti-doping and &euro;150,000 to the women in sport programme.</p> <p>  In regard to tourism, &euro;500,000 will be spent by F&aacute;ilte Ireland targeting short breaks over the winter specifically to visitors from Northern Ireland and it will also spend &euro;100,000 supporting more international publicity.  A sum of &euro;250,000 will be spent to enhance the programme for the New Year&rsquo;s Festival Dublin to deliver an even better festival and to attract and grow additional tourist traffic at a time of year we have spare airline and accommodation capacity.  Tourism Ireland will spend &euro;2.5 million on a range of tourism marketing initiatives.  My Department has a vital role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic prosperity and I am pleased that this additional allocation, together with the funding committed over the lifetime of the national development plan, should enable us build a better Ireland.  I am happy to address any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

There was not a gap.  This is additional money, which came through mid-year.  The figure is approximately &euro;1.5 million for aviation.  It came from the IAA dividend.  In a sense, it was a windfall.  We decided to distribute it accordingly.  Committee members received a list with details of how the &euro;6 million was distributed.  Where there was need that had not been provided for, we provided for it.  The allocations are mostly for security and safety in the regional airports and for where there are needs that might not have been fulfilled.  It is something of a bonus rather than to cover a deficit.</p></speech>

I will explain the dividend in case anyone does not understand it.  The issue arose when I was speaking to the Minister for Finance during budget negotiations.  He and I agreed that if I could negotiate a special divided from the IAA, it would be welcome because it would be additional money and the authority was getting a dividend.  When we agreed on that, I went to the IAA.  The IAA had a vast cash pile in the bank.  The view was that the State could make use of that money rather than have it in the IAA coffers.  The IAA agreed to give us a dividend, all other things being equal, of &euro;12 million per annum.  The Minister for Finance agreed that we would split that with &euro;6 million for the Exchequer and &euro;6 million for the Department.  When that was agreed we had a certain amount that was extra.  Some &euro;1.5 million of that went to the regional airports.</p></speech>

I gather committee members received a note on the matter.  The majority of the funding is focused on supporting the operational costs of the provision of essential safety and security services.  The point is that this money can never be considered as state aid because it has no economic benefit.  It does not yield extra income to the airport.  If it did, it would be subject to state aid rules.  It comes with the qualification of being for security and safety, which is important.</p></speech>

There is a &euro;5 million allocation for bus and Luas investment.  The Minister said an additional &euro;5 million will be assigned partly to bus fleet purchase and partly to stage payments for eight additional Luas trams.  How many new buses will be acquired with the funding?  When will they be delivered?  Will these be new buses?</p> <p>  The money is being used to purchase new buses.  Will they be hybrid buses or conventional buses?  As the Minister will be aware, the State has decarbonisation targets to reach by 2020.  Transport is now the second largest contributing sector to greenhouse gas emissions.  It is important to have a clear move away from fossil fuels in transport.  We need to accelerate our migration towards renewable energies.</p> <p>  There is an allocation of &euro;200,000 for the Irish Rail accessibility app, which is a welcome proposal.  The joint committee held hearings on how we can make public transport more accessible for people with a disability.  The allocation is welcome, positive and to be complimented.  Will the Minister give a timeline for when the app will be up and running?  Given the intention of the app, will there will an additional requirement to ensure that the necessary personnel and supports will be at the various train stations?  When someone arrives at a station, will operative assistance be available?  I know from a previous briefing with Irish Rail representatives that many of the stations are not fully wheelchair friendly.  We are putting in &euro;200,000 for the app and that is welcome, but it may raise problems.  If a person wants to travel from a particular station but that station is not wheelchair accessible, then there may be a problem.  Can the Minister comment on that?</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;400,000 is allocated for the cycling package, which is small.  We are still well below where we were when the Minister took over in terms of our annual spend on cycling.  When does the he envisage that he will be back at the level of spending where the Department was before he took office?</p> <p>  Additional road money is welcome but we are still somewhat below our steady-state requirement.  Does the Minister have any indication of when we might be in a position to meet that requirement?  Ultimately, the longer we prolong investment in our roads, the more it will cost in the long run.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;3 million is allocated for the BMO project.  We were all told that the opening of certain routes was to save money.  Now we see that a large amount of capital expenditure is allocated at the outset.  What exactly is the &euro;3 million for?  Will it go towards the provision and purchase of garage facilitates?  How much money has the Department expended on the bus BMO project in total?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018120500002#C02000"><p>The Minister has allocated &euro;3 million to working capital for the BMO project.</p><p>I note the Minister did not allocate a single euro to the public transport obligation, PSO, despite the fact that public transport is in dire need of significant investment.  That probably shows us what we have known all along.  While the Minister might argue over the word, outsourcing is a means to the end goal of privatisation.  It is very disappointing that the Minister did not seek to give an allocation to the PSO when he got the extra money.  He is giving more money to speed up the process of privatisation to the detriment of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the public transport network.  He knows himself in doing that and by outsourcing the most profitable routes that he is weakening Bus &Eacute;ireann's business model and reducing its revenue which would enable it to fund less profitable routes.  Could the Minister make a statement in that regard?  It is clear that he is following that agenda and doing it in stages.</p><p> I am surprised extra funding was not provided, given the increasing need for security on the public transport network, in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann, something that has been in the media so much of late.  Workers have had to endure more frequent assaults and attacks and they are vulnerable.  The current security arrangements are not sufficient.</p><p> I too welcome the allocation of &euro;200,000 for the rail accessibility app.  Will the funding be sufficient to get the app up and running or will extra funding be required?  We had a report on disability and we had the groups in here before the committee.  All of them flagged up the nightmare of trying to go about their daily business on public transport.  As Deputy Troy said, due to the lack of staff one must give 24 hours notice, and 48 hours notice at the weekend, and one cannot decide on the day that one will make a journey.  The lack of staff at train stations is part of the problem.  If I think of anything else I will come back in later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018120500002#D00200"><p>I wish to ask the Minister a question on the same topic.  A total of &euro;3 million is being allocated for working capital relating to the bus market opening programme.  It arises from the gross cost contract arrangement that will go ahead in Bus &Eacute;ireann for routes that have been opened to competition.  In this case the National Transport Authority, NTA, will collect all fare revenues and carry the associated revenue risk.  The announcement by the NTA of further privatisation of Bus &Eacute;ireann services is a real blow to workers and trade unions who were of the belief that they had an agreement in 2015 to the effect that if any further routes were to be opened up to privatisation a period would be allocated for the assessment of how Go-Ahead Ireland has been doing.  The Minister is meant to be a guardian of public money, but we hear now that the intention is to hand over &euro;3 million to open bus routes to a private company.  The State will end up subsidising millions to a multinational company and it will inevitably end up providing subsidies in welfare due to the low pay of the workers that will be employed.  My understanding from talking to members of the National Bus &amp;amp; Rail Union, NBRU, is that Go-Ahead Ireland is having real difficulty recruiting workers, who are on reduced terms and conditions compared to established workers in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister will dissociate himself and say this is up to the NTA, which is independent in its operations, but none of us believes that.  We see the payment of &euro;3 million as being ideological.  Because the issue needs further exploration we should bring in the NTA and the unions in the new year to discuss matters.  The unions are of the belief that, as I outlined, this is a breach of the agreement that they had on there being a period of assessment before any further routes would be opened.  The cost effectiveness of the proposal was to be assessed, yet the Minister is now doling out more public money to allow the privatisation of services on worse terms and conditions for the workers.  I assume the private sector is being handed the Dublin to Drogheda routes and the Dublin to Wicklow routes, which are in the commuter belt and are heavily trafficked, so would inevitably be profitable.  The Minister is cherry-picking services.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann makes extra money at least it goes back into the economy whereas the private companies hand it out in dividends to their shareholders.  How long will the public purse have to subsidise companies coming in at the taxpayers' expense?</p></speech>

We must put even more emphasis on road improvements because of the safety issues that arise when there are potholes.  Deputy Munster will be aware that travelling from Drogheda, coming in from the motorway, when one leaves the national primary route, there is no proper lighting.  There are not even proper roads.  The road network is from the early 20th century rather than the 21st century.  Any additional money to be spent on the roads is very welcome.</p> <p>  I fully support the Irish Rail accessibility app.  That is an important and welcome development.  I invite the Minister to respond to the questions.  If members wish they can respond to the Minister.</p></speech>

He is correct that the &euro;5 million will go towards buses and the Luas due to the growth in passenger numbers.  There will be a staged payment for the Luas green line enhancement, which is a problem area.</p> <p>  The revised allocation will enable the NTA to take delivery of extra bus vehicles this year, enabling some of the additional services to be operated with a new bus fleet instead of older end-of-life vehicles.  Discussions are ongoing with manufacturers as regards delivery scheduling.  As the Deputy identified, there is a great need for new buses, rail and DART trains.  We are moving as fast as we can on that.  On the rail issue, we have been making some progress but the proposed refurbishment proved to be extremely expensive when it went out to tender.  Irish Rail is now looking at buying second-hand carriages.  Refurbishing some of the old carriages was going to be almost as expensive as buying new ones.  Irish Rail is now looking at leasing and buying second-hand carriages.</p> <p>  The app will be introduced early in 2019.  It is moving full steam ahead.  On cycling, Deputy Troy said the allocation of &euro;400,000 is too little but it is an extra &euro;400,000 in funding which we did not expect to have in the first place.  It is going towards trying to prevent cycling accidents.  The number of accidents last year increased by almost 50% to 15.</p><p>Fortunately, it has decreased this year, but we cannot depend on that continuing.  We are very conscious that we need to encourage cycling.  There is regularly criticism from the committee and others about the amount of money the Government is spending on cycling in the light of the number of cyclists.  We are putting in a considerable amount and have committed to spending a great deal more under the national development plan.  We have bought into cycling.  We know that it is part of the equation and helps the environment and the health of the nation and will relieve the traffic problem.  It is probably unfair to criticise the Government on the basis that we are not doing enough regarding cycling.  There was a reluctance to commit funding at one stage, but that is no longer the case.  We made very serious commitments in the national development plan to triple the amount spent on cycling.  A large amount is being spent on greenways.  Under the BusConnects project, we have committed to 200 km of dedicated and segregated cycleways to run alongside the bus corridors.  The commitment is there and it is underlined by the fact that an extra &euro;400,000 from this windfall will be spent on making the roads safer for cyclists, particularly at junctions.  We intend to continue in that vein.</p><p> On the BusConnects market opening addressed by Deputy Troy, there is probably something of a misconception.  The money is not being handed over as a current or capital payment.  It will not be allocated to Go-Ahead as Deputy Coppinger suggested.  It will be used to address a cashflow issue involving a probable gap in revenue and will enable the project to progress.  It is certainly not being allocated to Go-Ahead.</p><p> Deputy Munster raised the issue of privatisation being the end goal.  We have had this conversation before.  It is not and will not be the end goal.  Although the Deputy refers to it as privatisation, nothing is being sold.  Privatisation only occurs when an asset is transferred from one person or company to another.</p></speech>

A tendering process is being set.  To the best of my knowledge, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus are tendering for all of the routes.  It is open to outside companies, including those from outside the State, to tender.  The selected provider will get a contract which will probably run for five years.  However, it will not get any assets.  We are not selling any assets.  The contract will last for a limited period of time.  There is an open competition to provide the services.  The State companies will compete to provide the services.   They have won such tenders previously and presumably will do so in the future.  The objective is not privatisation but, rather, to introduce more competition in the market in order to benefit the consumer.  Obviously, competition is healthy.  It may not be welcome from the point of view of the incumbents, but they compete very successfully for such tenders.  We must realise that we have some very successful bus companies of which the Deputy would be very supportive which are carrying far more passengers.  The introduction of new routes and companies can only help passengers and expand the service.  That will not necessarily be to the detriment of the incumbents.  The Deputy and I probably differ in our definitions of privatisation.  She seems to believe that the tendering of the routes is privatisation.  It is true that some of the routes will be operated by new companies for a finite period, but no assets are changing hands.</p></speech>

Does the Minister accept that if Bus &Eacute;ireann does not win the tender, it will experience an immediate reduction in revenue because the majority of routes put out to tender are the most profitable ones?  The most profitable routes are being creamed off such that our national bus service is weakened every time a route goes to tender.  As the Minister knows, it is all about business models.  Bus &Eacute;ireann's chance of successfully tendering for contracts is weakened because some of the most profitable routes have been privatised and its revenue is down as a result.  It is being progressively weakened.  This is privatisation.   Assets may not be sold but the constant outsourcing to the detriment of our public transport network is privatisation.</p></speech>

What is happening in the bus and public transport market is quite exciting.  It should not be knocked.  We should welcome the fact that outside companies want to tender for these routes because, as members are aware, the passenger numbers are increasing very quickly as a result of a boom in the economy.  As a result of that, everybody is benefiting.  It would be wrong to say that it is damaging to Dublin Bus.  It is currently expanding its services because of the increase in passenger numbers.  There is room for the incumbents.</p><p>The great beneficiaries here, hopefully, will be the passengers and there is evidence of this.  Those are the people who we want to see benefit.  The introduction of new operators has benefitted the passengers.  It has not created any unemployment.  At present, the expansion in the demand for public transport services is being filled successfully both by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and by outsiders, and this competition is working.</p></speech>

We need to interrogate this further.  None of us here has to hand the figures of the routes being spoken of and we cannot really get into this.  We need to get those figures.  We need to have the NTA in and have the union representatives in.  The Minister claims that these are not profitable routes.  My understanding is that those buses are packed every day.  They certainly are at the more profitable end.</p></speech>

We need to get the figures first.  The point being made is that a cost-benefit analysis was not done in this regard before deciding to put them out to tender.</p> <p>  We need to interrogate the claim that it will benefit consumers.  Is the Minister saying the prices will go down?  Generally, what happens is that routes that are not so well populated lose out and that is not of benefit to the consumer overall.</p> <p>  Lastly, the Minister might explain what he meant.  I took it down as I have a bit of shorthand.  The Minister stated this &euro;3 million was for a cashflow issue while there is a gap in revenue.  The Minister stated it was not to help the private company.  I did not understand what was meant by a cashflow issue while there is a gap in revenue.</p></speech>

That is not what happens.  It is a cashflow issue.  In other words, it is bridging a gap.  It is a working capital requirement for bus market opening.  It arises from the gross cost contract arrangement, to which the Chairman referred, with Go-Ahead and Bus &Eacute;ireann for BMO routes whereby the NTA will collect all fare revenues and bear the associated revenue risk.  In other words, it is bridging.  The working capital requirement is driven by a combination of the timing difference between the contractual payments to the relevant operators and the subsequent drawdown from the Department.  It includes an amount to mitigate the revenue risk of the annual estimated fare revenue in the event that forecasted revenues are lower than expected.  It is a bridging cushion.  It is certainly not handing over money to Go-Ahead.  The &euro;3 million is not going to Go-Ahead.</p></speech>

The NTA will be holding the bridging finance.  It certainly will not be going to Go-Ahead in that sense.  It is a timing issue, rather than an asset issue.</p></speech>

That is not true.  It is a public service route.  Some public service routes are profitable.  What has been used in the past is the ability of profitable routes to cross-subsidise unprofitable routes.  We know the routes.  They are: the 17A, the 33A, the 33B, 45A, 45B, 59, 63, 63A, 75, 75A, 102, 111, 175, 184 and 185.  Those are the routes that are currently operated by Go-Ahead.  They are publicised routes.  They are on the website for anybody, including the Minister, to familiarise him or herself with.</p> <p>  The question I have relates to the &euro;3 million in taxpayers' money that is being made available for market opening.  What exactly is it for?  First, it was stated that because it is only a contracted service, it is for capital expenditure and the money is being spent to upgrade State infrastructure.  Now we are being told it is some sort of bridging finance.  Certainly, any time I got bridging finance I had to pay it back.  We are told then Go-Ahead is not getting it, the NTA is getting it and there is no need for paying anything back.  I am a little confused about exactly what the &euro;3 million is for.  The Minister should state clearly what the &euro;3 million is being spent on.</p></speech>

It is going in specifically as working capital, as bridging finance.  That is what it is.  It is not money being transferred somehow from the State to a private company.  It is going in as working capital and that is its pure purpose.</p><p>I will read this definition carefully because I asked for it.  It states that the working capital requirement is driven by a combination of the tiny difference between the contractual payments to the relevant operators and the subsequent drawdown from the Department.  It is purely bridging.  It also includes an amount to mitigate the revenue risk of the annual estimated fare revenue in the event that forecasted revenues are lower than expected.  It is, therefore, simply a cashflow issue.</p></speech>

There is a contract between the NTA and Go-Ahead, and payment must be made to Go-Ahead, but the payment falls due in advance of moneys being transferred from the overall PSO pot from the Department.  That is one aspect, while the other is that this is a gross-cost contract.  It is not like the Dublin Bus contract, which, like Bus &Eacute;ireann, collects all the fare revenue and keeps it.  The difference between its costs and the fare revenue is the PSO payment to those operators.</p> <p>  In the case of the two Go-Ahead contracts and the Bus &Eacute;ireann contract for Waterford, they are gross-cost contracts, which means the NTA collects the fare revenue and Go-Ahead does not keep it.  It is paid an amount to provide the particular services.  Fare revenue is only estimated and, therefore, there is a revenue risk for the NTA and the fare revenue might not be as robust as forecast.  For that reason, it needs to hold working capital within the NTA to counter it. </p></speech>

There was some toing and froing but I asked the Minister a number of questions which were not answered.</p> <p>  Of the &euro;5 million for bus and Luas investment, how many new buses will it deliver?  Will they be hybrid buses?  When were the eight additional Luas trams ordered and when will they be delivered?  I also asked how many rail stations are not fully accessible.  While the allocation of &euro;200,000 is most welcome, have we quantified how much it will cost to make all our rail stations fully accessible?  The Chairman and I attended the briefing with Irish Rail, and he is aware there is a significant problem with accessibility at rail stations.  It will take considerable capital investment to address it.  While the app is welcome, if people are being brought to a station but they cannot be facilitated when they arrive, that is another question.</p> <p>  On the cycling budget, according to the Minister's own figures, he is not spending what was spent by his predecessor.  In 2015, the annual cycling budget was &euro;18 million but last year, it was just over &euro;10 million.  The allocation of &euro;400,000 is welcome, and the Minister claims that I am being overly critical by saying it is not enough, but we are not where the Department was before he came to office.  I welcome that the Minister says he is a late convert to cycling and that he has bought into it, which is positive, but he should demonstrate his conversion by giving back the money his Department stopped giving to cycling infrastructure for the past two years.</p></speech>

Golf is a very wealthy sport so why does it need such a subsidy?  The Irish Open was sponsored by Dubai Duty Free last year.  Is that also the case this year?  Prize money for golfers is stratospheric so why does the taxpayer have to fund Irish Open golf to the tune of &euro;750,000 while the Women in Sport programme gets &euro;150,000, with Paralympics Ireland getting even less?  Well-funded sports in which well-heeled people take part seem to enjoy quite a lot of subsidies and grants.  I do not see how the Irish Open could need a handout from the public purse.</p></speech>

The funding represents an increase of &euro;250,000 on the level of funding provided in 2018.  The money being provided to Paralympics Ireland is to meet a cost overrun from the hosting of the World Para Swimming European Championships at the National Aquatic Centre in August.  On 5 April last, Sport Ireland was contacted by Paralympics Ireland with a request for support in delivering these championships.  Paralympics Ireland stated that it was experiencing significant financial challenges in the context of hosting the championships in Dublin from 13 August to 19 August.  These financial challenges centred on two areas, transport and accommodation, which were mostly due to costs escalating since the bid stage in August 2014.  They requested an underwriting agreement to the value of &euro;140,000 from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to ensure the financial viability of the event and to eliminate any risk of the event cancellation, the effects of which would be very significant for Paralympics Ireland and the Irish sport sector.  It is now anticipated that the drawdown will be close to &euro;100,000.  In meeting this request, Sport Ireland noted that Paralympics Ireland would provide an additional &euro;100,000 and the International Paralympic Committee would provide an additional &euro;150,000.  With the provision of these additional funding streams, Paralympics Ireland delivered a successful championship.  They probably met what was needed at that time.  The issue relating to the Irish Open is somewhat different from that relating to golf clubs.  I appreciate that the Deputy has an interest in golf clubs.</p></speech>

I know it brings in tourists and I am not averse to golf because people like it, but there is massive prize money for this competition.  Are we going to subsidise something which is very well funded as it is?  There are many events that bring people into the country, such as the marathon.</p></speech>

The soccer team was probably more successful than the men's so the amount allocated to women's sport seems quite small.  When officials are in meetings with Sport Ireland, these are things they should be asking about.</p></speech>

It looks quite poor that we are only giving &euro;150,000 in additional funding to Women in Sport, but I am conscious that it is a Supplementary Estimate.  What does this bring the actual 2018 figure to?  What percentage of the overall sports expenditure is geared to women in sport?  I would hate the perception to go out from this committee that golf is elitist and in my county, many small golf clubs do great work with juvenile golfers.  Any teenager should be able to participate in the sport of their choice.</p> <p>  A portion of this money comes from a special dividend from the IAA.  Are we confident that this money will be available for the various sporting bodies next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-05a.1398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2018120500002#J00100"><p>I will deal with Deputy Coppinger's comments first.  The point she makes is fair.  We should examine in detail the proportionate amounts given to these various organisations, as we do.  The &euro;150,000 for the Women in Sport programme comes from the Supplementary Estimate.  The Deputy rightly points out that, superficially, that is only one fifth of the amount given to golf.  We doubled the funding for the Women in Sport programme to &euro;2 million.  In the area of disability, we created a new &euro;1 million programme for disability sport through the deployment of sports inclusion disability officers in all 26 local sports partnerships countrywide.  We also gave a &euro;1.5 million allocation to high-performance programmes in support of the Tokyo 2020 preparations.  We have certainly acknowledged, through the supplementary grant of &euro;500,000 to women's hockey out of the IAA dividend, the tremendous success of Irish women in sport in the past year.  We will continue to provide support in the future.  We have a bit of catching up to do in that area.  That is readily acknowledged.  We are determined to do that.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman raises a good point.  Golf is always painted as very elitist.  In many clubs playing golf at a high level is only open to the better off, but there are pitch and putt clubs all around the country.  That should be acknowledged.  People derive a huge amount of benefit for their health and mental health from pitch and putt.  It is to be found in every village in Ireland.  It is not an elitist sport which should not be encouraged in the same way as any other sport.  It works at all sorts of levels.  We must not forget that high-performance sport is one thing and big events another, but participation at village and street level is more important.  While we all applaud the great achievements of our sportsmen and sportswomen around the world and the medals and great titles they have brought back, I have no hesitation in saying that the real benefit of sport to the nation is found in the young boys and girls one sees every weekend getting huge benefits for their mental and physical health while being kept away from other pursuits which might not be so good for them.  That is the great benefit of sport.  Participation is equally important - and probably much more important - for the health of the nation than the medals, which we applaud.  The medals and icons are very important.  It is important to have people who are great achievers, but having large numbers of people actively participating on the ground is emphasised in our sports policy equally to, if not more so than, the achievements of high-performing athletes.</p></speech>

We are talking about giving &euro;750,000 to one event at which the winner received prize money of $1.116 million - whatever that is in euro - and for which there is a $7 million total prize fund.  We are not talking about helping people with their mental health.  We are talking about subsidising very well paid people.  That is all I am saying.  If we are giving money to this one event, my question is whether it is needed.  This event is run my Rory McIlroy and sponsored by Dubai Duty Free.  I am not going to labour the point but the Minister should not pretend that it is for the benefit of village pitch and putt clubs.</p></speech>

I was just trying to say that participation at street level is equally important.  I do not want to dismiss the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open because its benefits to tourism in Ireland are significant.</p> <p>  On the Acting Chairman's question, I have not worked out the percentage but we can do that very easily.  It is extra money.  The &euro;51.6 million goes to sports in general.  It would be easy enough to work out what percentage of that this figure is.</p></speech>

The amount of funding being spent on the Irish Open as opposed to on Paralympics Ireland, anti-doping measures and the Women in Sport programme can be perceived badly.  That is why I was using the example of the percentage of this year's overall expenditure being spent by the Department on the latter programme.  This is IAA funding.  As the Minister acknowledged, it was a windfall.  Will this windfall be available next year?  In the event that it is not, will the Women in Sport programme or the high-performance programme suffer a reduction in funding?</p></speech>

I cannot guarantee that dividend will be available next year but we anticipate that it will.  In other words, the expectation is that we will get the same &euro;12 million per annum, &euro;6 million of which will come to the Department, but it is not certain.  It depends on the conditions in the IAA at the time.  If it is in a similar position to where it is at the moment and where it was when we got the last dividend, I would anticipate that we will get the same dividend.</p></speech>

The Great Britain market has been particularly challenging for Ireland in the wake of Brexit.  The numbers have fallen so it is a positive development that additional funding is being allocated.  It is a little bit outside what we are talking about here but, in terms of the additional funding secured in the 2019 budget, has the Minister engaged with the key stakeholders to ensure that the necessary supports are put into the various regions that will be most adversely affected by the reintroduction of the 13.5% VAT rate?</p><p>Has the Minister engaged with key stakeholders to ensure the necessary supports are put in place in the various regions that will be most adversely affected by the reintroduction of the 13.5% VAT rate?</p></speech>

The achievement in tourism is phenomenal considering the drop in the currency in the UK as a result of Brexit and the fact that the number of visitors from Britain has increased this year despite the fact that we have suffered so much in the context of currency movements.  That is due to a large number of factors.  Tourism worldwide is increasing but there have been some very effective marketing campaigns by both Stage agencies.  Tourism is flourishing.  The problems with tourism are the problems of success including not having a sufficient number of hotel bedrooms and other accommodation to meet the need of the demand of the people coming here.  However, we anticipate that the money being given will be spent wisely, not just in diversification but also in defending the British market, and the signs so far are that that is happening.  We anticipate a great deal of further success in the tourism industry this year and next year.</p> <p>  On the 13.5% VAT rate, it was a disappointment but we do not anticipate that it will result in some sort of permanent downward movement in the tourism industry because of the &euro;35 million that has been granted to give incentives and promote marketing by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  We believe that will be sufficient to keep the tourism numbers at a very healthy level.</p> <p>  There will be supports for the regions.  The Acting Chairman will be aware that in his own region, the Hidden Heartlands is something to which the tourism industry and the Government are fully committed.  We anticipate that will increase in the coming years.  It is the last geographical branding the country has and means the entire country is now covered by a message which has been a very successful strategy by the tourist agencies and by the Department.  The supports, if necessary, will certainly be put in place.  That is the reason the money is being provided, namely, to give incentives and make life more successful for those who may suffer from the difficulties Brexit produces for the tourism industry, but the current signs are that we will be able to fight it successfully.</p></speech>

He will acknowledge that some regions are not benefiting to the same extent as and face greater challenges than others.  While it must be acknowledged that the extra money is being allocated, it is important that the supports are put in place.  We must ensure that industry and stakeholders are consulted in order to make sure that the best supports are provided.</p></speech>
