Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Daly, Catherine Murphy and Barry will be substituting for their party colleagues.  There will be a substitute for me in the third session and we will know who that will be in advance of that session.  Are the minutes of the meeting on 19 May agreed?</p></speech>

Mr. Tom Parlon gave completely misleading information to the committee at one point in his contribution last week.  He since corrected that information when he was interviewed last Friday on the "Today with Sarah McInerney" radio programme.  It is important that he correct the record of the committee.  He was asked specific questions relating to costs by several Deputies and gave information which subsequently received widespread coverage in the media.  He now admits that information is wrong.  The committee should contact him to ask him to correct the record of the committee.  The committee should consider that aspect of the minutes.</p></speech>

Does the Deputy wish to postpone agreement on the minutes?</p></speech>

It would be worthwhile for the committee to receive that analysis as it would indicate the viewpoint of the Department and might be more accurate.  If Mr. Parlon has withdrawn his statement, we need to clarify the position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#A00800"><p>It is agreed that we will write to him and invite him to address his remarks during the session.  We can then consider the minutes in that light.</p></speech>

That statement was subsequently reported on by an RT&Eacute; news programme.  If one extrapolates from that reference, approximately 45,000 healthcare workers would have tested positive, which is incorrect.  What ought to have been stated is that one third of those who have tested positive are healthcare workers.  It is important that the incorrect statement be corrected.  In fairness to the news presenter who reported on it, she was only following up on what was stated before the committee.  It is important that we correct that statement.  One third of those who have tested positive are healthcare workers.  There are more than 130,000 workers between the HSE, private nursing homes and disability facilities, so 7,500 positive tests means less than 6% of them have tested positive.  It is important that that message be conveyed rather than incorrect information.</p></speech>

We received a large volume of correspondence at 9.30 a.m. regarding issues raised last week concerning nursing homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#B01400"><p>I will make a quick point on that.  I requested last week that we have that meeting at this hearing.  We were asked by the secretariat to follow up with items arising from the hearings regarding follow-up documentation.  That was supplied but, again, we got the information an hour and a half before today's meeting.  It is a large amount of information and members must now trawl through hundreds of pages.  It is not a coincidence that it landed at 9.30 a.m.  We need to be much sharper and more robust with the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Health.  We need the information we are looking for well in advance of our sittings to allow us to do our jobs.  That should be noted for our future work.</p></speech>

I move on to the work programme.  Following a meeting of the working group last Friday, it was agreed that any of the following members may take the Chair whenever required to do so by virtue of the absence of the Chairman, Deputies Butler, Carroll MacNeill and Cullinane.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Butler will chair today's third session.</p> <p>  The following meetings have been agreed in principle by the committee.  Next week, we will deal with the use of private hospitals in the first two sessions and travel restrictions in the third session.  On 9 June, we will take oral medical evidence on issues related to minimising the risk of a second wave while reopening the economy.  We will also have two sessions on supports for businesses.  The working group will meet again on Friday when it will consider a draft programme that will take us to mid-July.  The output of that meeting will be submitted to next week's session for approval.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

We have witnesses waiting outside to give evidence.  We have invited them here and I would like to move on to hearing from them.  We can discuss these matters further in the working group on Friday, which Deputy Shanahan is welcome to join, as is Deputy McGuinness.

Is it agreed that those already prepared will be forwarded to members to give them an opportunity to propose changes by close of business tomorrow?

I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 186 that the committee should also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I now invite Mr. Daly to make his opening statement and ask that he limit it to five minutes.  As we received the opening statement in advance, it has been circulated.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Anne Costello, nursing committee director, Nursing Homes Ireland.  The work of this committee will represent one of the most important analysis of a national emergency that will forever be ingrained in our country's history.  I wish it well in its work in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>  Nursing homes are traditionally very positive settings and homes of inspiration and happiness to the communities within them.  They are a home from home.  Covid-19 has brought huge levels of upset, sadness and worry in through their doors.  I now take this opportunity to call upon us to commemorate forever all those who, tragically, lost their lives in our nursing homes and in our country because of this cruel virus.  We should take the opportunity to laud the considerable sacrifices of nursing home residents.  The loss of a loved one's personal touch and, for many, the loss of friends has caused huge upset and worry for thousands of our most special residents.  Under very pressurised circumstances, our staff have made extra time to sit with residents and have prioritised the use of technology to connect residents with loved ones, often taking time outside of working hours to fulfil such work.</p> <p>  We applaud the staff in our nursing homes, HSE, private and voluntary.  These 40,000 people are on the Covid front line.  They have made sacrifices willingly, and with great commitment they continue to provide person-centred care, comfort and support.  I thank the staff in the nursing homes for the care and support provided to residents over the weeks and months, with much of it provided to residents with Covid-19.  The recent months have presented a stressful and demanding time, and these people ensured residents received excellent care in the most challenging of circumstances.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has presented a tragedy for nursing home residents, but it should not be lost on us that four out of every five nursing home residents who contracted Covid-19 recovered from the virus.  This is testament to the tremendous dedication and professionalism of the staff under extremely strenuous circumstances.  There needs to be a greater appreciation that care of the older person is complex.  Nurses in our nursing homes have very specific clinical expertise and a broad knowledge base founded on the science and art of the person-centred gerontological care model.</p> <p>  During the first three months of the year more than 2,500 people entered nursing home care under the fair deal scheme.  Every month, 1,000 people transfer from our acute hospitals into private and voluntary nursing homes.  During this national emergency, 7% of Covid cases entailed transfer of residents to hospital.  As an easily transmittable virus, we knew in early January and February it could take the lives of nursing home residents in our communities.</p><p>Preliminary research indicates up to 40% of transmission is passed by asymptomatic persons.  The mass testing of residents has seen asymptomatic residents and staff test positive.  Nursing homes have huge levels of experience in managing the outbreak of flu and norovirus every winter and have extensive experience, both clinical and practical, in implementing infection prevention control measures, but a global pandemic is on a different scale entirely.</p><p> We were exasperated in early stages and felt the sector required a very specific plan.  We knew Covid-19 had a disproportionate impact on older people.  The planning and focus was almost exclusively on our acute hospitals.  We were aware people in our nursing homes would be among the most susceptible to the virus and a national strategy and response was required.  The challenges of personal protective equipment, PPE, testing, aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff and discharges from acute hospitals are well versed at this stage.  Our decision to restrict visitors on Friday, 6 March was informed by our nursing committee, comprising clinical experts, and it was not taken lightly.  It was taken on a Friday because we were conscious of the many visitors who may have come to nursing homes that weekend.</p><p> Key State organisations left the nursing home sector and its residents isolated in those early days, and the dismay will live forever with us.  However, we welcome the lead of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in eventually bringing senior officials from his Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, around the table to support the sector and our residents in coping with Covid-19.  The evidence from Ireland and internationally is no individual element of the health service can manage the global Covid-19 pandemic alone.  The supports provided by HSE community services are appreciated and have delivered valued resourcing supports to residents.</p><p> Covid-19 continues to live with us.  We give early welcome to the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to establish a nursing home expert panel to support good planning and safeguards to protect people who call a nursing home their home.  However, one significant voice is absent, that representing nurses from our nursing homes, who continue to operate very much on the front line.</p><p> Members of the Oireachtas will be aware that Nursing Homes Ireland has outlined annually a request that the Government should lead in establishing a forum on long-term care.  That call has gone unheeded for almost a decade but today we reiterate that call.  We wish to move forward but Covid-19 now lives among us.  We are actively engaged with the Minister, Deputy Harris, his officials and colleagues in the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, in presenting measures that can ease visitor restrictions in our nursing homes.  Clear policy is required and there is a requirement to balance delicately health, safety and risk to life against the mental well-being and happiness of residents.  Social connection for nursing home residents is critical.</p><p> Lessons can be learned from closer engagement brought upon us by Covid-19.  There is now a requirement for a better and more integrated working relationship between the State and the entire nursing home sector.  The core focus must be on meeting the complex health and social care needs of nursing home residents.  As a society, we will be stronger working together.</p></speech>

The mission of Sage Advocacy is to promote, protect and defend the rights and dignity of vulnerable adults, older people and healthcare patients.  We support and advocate for people independently of family, service provider or systems interests.  We have made a detailed submission to the committee, so in these opening remarks I want to focus on where we go from here.  We see little value in shroud waving and comparing deaths in one nursing home with another.  As Mother Jones famously stated, "Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living."</p> <p>  I will first give some sense of what it has been like from the perspectives of residents, relatives and staff.  "You have no idea how awful it is &ndash; it&rsquo;s horrific."  These were the words of a member of staff in a nursing home that experienced a serious outbreak and many deaths.  The impact of an outbreak has been frightening for many residents, and for those with dementia, the arrival of people in full PPE was terrifying.  Serious shortages of staff meant that there was little, if any, time to provide support to residents in facilities where many died.  For families with relatives who were extremely ill or dying, the inability to visit or even to talk to their loved one by phone was a source of considerable distress and frustration.</p> <p>  Approximately 20% of older people need some form of support and care, of which less than 5% will live in a nursing home at any one time.  Nursing home care is not long-term care.  The average length of stay is just over two years.  In 2016, Sage Advocacy, along with other NGOs, organised a forum on long-term care for older people.</p><p>The unanimity of opinion at that forum was summed up in a question.  Why, despite decades of policy reports and recommendations to Government, is there still a systemic bias towards care in congregated settings and no formal legislative basis for support and care in the community?  The report of the forum spoke of the need to develop a vision for long-term support and care which is as compelling as that of the hospice movement at its best.</p><p> At the core of this issue is the fragmented nature of social care for older people.  This is not just about what did or did not happen in March and April.  Home support services, such as they are, are not provided on a statutory basis or regulated and have no clear vision, other than the level of home care packages that can be provided in any one year.</p><p> Care in nursing homes is provided on a statutory basis and is regulated, but has an overly complex and ultimately dangerous architecture.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, buys care from private providers without proper consideration of the range of needs.  The HSE administers the scheme but - this is critical - the contract is between the older person and the nursing home.  HIQA sets the standards, but has no role in setting the price, and inspects, but has no powers to investigate complaints.  Crucially, as Sage Advocacy&rsquo;s February report on medical care in nursing homes pointed out, there is no clear framework for the provision of medical care to the most vulnerable of our older people, nor are there ratios set for the level of suitably skilled nursing staff.</p><p> Over recent decades the State&rsquo;s approach to the residential care of older adults has been one of retreat in favour of private providers, with the remaining public facilities providing care mainly to the more frail with complex care needs, sometimes in famine era buildings.  Elements within the HSE, working with NGOs, put forward proposals for a change to a teaghleach or smaller-scale household model, but they were not supported.  The State, having outsourced the service, practised social distancing while the public, notwithstanding the good service provided by many facilities, is increasingly questioning the morality of private investment in human vulnerability.  Simply stated, we are talking of vulnerable people in a vulnerable sector. </p><p> Our detailed recommendations are set out in our submission.  The five I would highlight are: an integrated system of long-term support and care spanning all care situations with a single source of funding; the integration of private nursing homes into the wider framework of public health and social care; clear guidelines on the skills and level of nursing staff and medical care required in congregated care settings related to the needs of residents; a wider range of service and ownership models for homecare and care in congregated settings; and legislation for adult safeguarding and the protection of liberty in places of care and legislative recognition for independent advocacy. </p><p> The Covid-19 public health emergency has shown some of the great strengths of Irish society.  It has also shown weaknesses.  We have a two-tier healthcare system and a two-tier siloed approach to the long-term care and support of older people which is biased towards congregated settings.  We owe it to ourselves, and to those who have sacrificed so much, to do better.  Let us shed a tier and set about building Sl&aacute;intecare, a single-tier national health service with an integrated system of social care focused on home and a much wider range of options between home and nursing homes.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

It strikes me that the nursing home sector showed a degree of foresight and planning and tried to flag issues at a very early stage.  The hundreds of pieces of correspondence we received at 9.30 a.m. today indicate that, as Mr. Daly said in his opening statement, a national strategy and response was required.  The correspondence and letters from March show that Mr. Daly was begging for assistance and PPE and that, to use his words, he was pleading with the State to stop the aggressive recruitment of staff from the nursing home sector.</p><p>In short, it appears that nursing homes were flooded with patients and starved of staff, and yet there was no plan.  Does Mr. Daly have any idea why no plan was forthcoming, when all of the international experience would tell us that there was a need for one?  We know now that more than half of the deaths that have occurred have occurred in the nursing home sector.  Why was there no plan?</p></speech>

The point we have been continuously making is that given the vulnerability of the age profile and the complexity of care of older persons, there should have been a national plan.  From where I sit, what I have seen is an overt focus on the acute hospital sector to the exclusion of community care in general.  Clearly, the discharge of large numbers of patients from the acute hospitals was an attempt to ensure the hospitals were ready.  We heard that a good deal in terms of ensuring the hospitals were prepared.  In fact, the surge that was predicted or expected in the hospitals materialised in the nursing home sector.</p></speech>

In peacetime - in normal times, as it were - there would be regular transfers of people from acute hospitals.  Our concern was that there was no plan.  In fact, the issue of testing was critical in hindsight.  The fact that residents who had come from acute hospitals were not tested prior to admission to the nursing home was-----</p></speech>

These patients were to become residents but they were not tested.  Was any protocol given to nursing homes?  Were nursing homes instructed that these people had to isolate for 14 days?  Did those discharging people check in advance that nursing homes had single room accommodation or were people simply discharged to create space?</p></speech>

On the basis of the correspondence that I have seen from the acute hospitals, nursing homes would have taken those precautions in terms of isolation, where possible.</p></speech>

That was not public health policy at the time, but it would have been practised in most nursing homes.  This was compounded by the fact that if nursing homes had large numbers of asymptomatic residents, then we could have staff members caring for residents who subsequently tested positive.  These staff members would also have been caring for other residents within a particular nursing home.</p></speech>

He requested that all discharges would undergo a full risk assessment, a full medical assessment and be tested for Covid-19.  I have been told by the Minister for Health as well that the protocol dictates that a patient discharged must have two negative tests prior to transfer.  That did not happen in March.

Chairman, I want to point out again, on the record, that we received a huge volume of correspondence at 9.30 this morning.  It is not helpful.  It is more helpful for us in doing our work if we get it in good time.  I am looking at correspondence from Mr. Daly dated 17 March sent to the Department.  Mr. Daly stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We require a commitment to constant two-way dialogue as we strive to protect the nation.  In such regard I am following up again with regard to critical issues. </blockquote> <p>At the time we were looking at what was happening internationally.  We could see what was happening in Italy and other countries where the surge was happening not only in the hospitals but in the nursing home sector as well.  We knew that there was an acute issue in the nursing home sector.  Yet, Mr. Daly was writing and requesting that there would be a constant two-way dialogue.</p><p>Is it fair to say he was right but was not getting much back in response?  That is what seems to be in the correspondence: a lot of letters from Mr. Daly but not a huge amount by way of detailed correspondence-----</p></speech>

As to what we suggested at that time, I had come across some evidence from my colleagues in Scotland that we should replicate some of the advice and guidance there.  That took some time to take hold.  It is fair to say we had a good engagement with officials, but clearly we were also exasperated by the fact that we had not met the Minister at that stage.  The meeting was, I think, at the end of March.</p></speech>

The dismay will live forever with us. </blockquote> <p>I will come to Mr. Taylor as well on this, but could Mr. Daly briefly describe the impact of having to deal in this environment not just with the deaths that happen but also with caring for those patients?  I refer to the impact that this has had on the residents and the staff and the fact that so many opportunities were missed.  The staff and the residents were on the front line without as much as the comfort of their families, who were waiting outside.</p></speech>

I was getting calls from members and dealing with staff and with families.  As I said in my statement, our first priority should be the residents because they have had a difficult period with no visitors.  They have also lost friends and what they see as their family.  It was therefore very difficult and we were exasperated by the lack of engagement, as we saw it at that time.</p></speech>

It is very important.  He described the impact on the residents and the staff and the relatives of the staff: "You have no idea how awful it is - it's horrific."  As to what was happening at the time, what feedback was Sage Advocacy getting from residents and their families, specifically relating to that period when, as Mr. Daly has described, nursing homes were being flooded with patients but starved of staff at the same time?</p></speech>

It works with individuals and families, sometimes where a person lacks capacity, or their representatives.  We do not have an operational role in the nursing homes.  The Deputy will appreciate that because of the restrictions, it was very difficult to get contact.  We did nevertheless have a lot of contact with some relatives in some cases but also with staff.  In many cases we were acting almost like a sounding board for some people who are under an awful lot of pressure in the nursing homes.  One of the key issues was that there is a belief that the hospitals were suddenly emptied out all into nursing homes.  I would like to see the data on the transfers from the acute hospitals to the nursing homes because I think they are mixed.  That is my very strong impression.  I know there were some nursing homes that took in people and other nursing homes that closed down, restricted visiting and said they would not take anybody from acute hospitals-----</p></speech>

It has 12, all of whom are business people.  I looked at their accounts and there are wealthy companies represented among those directors, who are very fine people in every respect.  Some &euro;23.3 million was the profit of eight of those directors in the last accounting year.  I cannot get the accounts of the other directors because they are part of other companies.  Is it fair to say that the nursing homes sector is a privately funded organisation and has a great deal of money to pay for, for example, PPE, testing, staff accommodation and extra staff in this crisis?</p></speech>

The other thing I said was that the issue about compliance and inspection was what happens after the inspection.  The inspection may highlight an issue where there is what could be seen as an area for improvement.  All of the nursing homes, public private and voluntary, would then receive an action plan.  The question then is to follow up on the action plan.  If HIQA was unhappy, it could take corrective action.</p></speech>

It is exceptionally clear and it is something that I have said all of my life: the care of older people in nursing homes is not acceptable.  The nursing home private sector is not compliant in the main, right across the sector.  It comprises very wealthy companies which complain that the taxpayer is not doing enough for them.  I wish to state exceptionally clearly that we need a total change in the way we look at the care of older people.  We need the home care packages mentioned by Mr.Taylor, in the smaller units referred to, and to look after people with dementia.  We need to stop this game of blaming everybody and to accept the fact that we are not doing enough and have never done enough.  Unless things change now, we are going to go down the same road.</p><p>I respect Mr. Daly, whom I have met a number of times, but I want to make it exceptionally clear that it is not good enough that this system would continue, and the tragedies that have unfolded in many homes because of the deaths of loved ones.  We have seen it every day on the television when it comes on about those poor people who have passed away.  I knew many of them and I am saddened, and I know that the families are saddened by this.  It is a scandal that this happened.</p><p>I point to a report in <i>The Guardian</i>about a British Parliament hearing.  There is not one death certificate in all of Hong Kong for a person in a nursing home who had Covid-19 because not one of them there died.  I just get so angry at this.</p><p>We need to move forward together but we must establish the facts.  The truth is the truth and the truth will out.  We have to change radically everything to do with older people.</p></speech>

That responsibility rests with HIQA.</p><p> I have met many Members of this House over the last while.  We hold an Oireachtas open day every year and we have met many Members at that.  I spent eight or ten weeks last year coming in to meet Members one-to-one on the issue of a continuum of care.  We need to develop a suite of care services for the older population and Nursing Homes Ireland members are doing it already in many cases and we will not be found wanting in our responsibilities.</p></speech>

This awful pandemic has borne down heaviest on older people, particularly on those in nursing, residential and care homes.  We have to be cognisant of the fact that 62% of all deaths that have happened so far have been in those settings and that 93% of all who have lost their lives so far are in the over 65 age bracket.</p> <p>  I have listened to the last speaker with interest and I want to bring the discussion back to the fact that there were failings over the last two months.  We all realise that and it is important that we delve into it.  It is also very important that we accept that four out of every five people in nursing homes who got Covid-19 recovered and I would like to thank the 40,000 staff in nursing, care and residential homes who have gone far beyond the call of duty.</p> <p>  I undertook a survey between 7 April and 8 April, in which I contacted 80 nursing homes in the south of the country.  The results I got from them at that time bear out exactly what Mr. Daly said in his opening statement about the insufficient testing of residents and staff, a massive shortfall of PPE and an aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff.  I want to point out that when I conducted that survey, at a time when I was being contacted by nursing homes all over Ireland as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for older people, 50% of the nursing homes that came back to me - and I got a 25% sample - had insufficient staff.  That bears out what Mr. Daly said about staffing.  On PPE, 30% of the nursing homes that came back to me had sufficient PPE.  This was between 8 April and 9 April when we were entering the surge.  However, 60% of the nursing homes that came back to me had no PPE and 10% had a three-day supply at that time.  That testifies to the fact that nursing homes, whether they were public or private and whether they were care homes or facilities for people with additional needs, it made no difference.  They did not have the staff during the Covid-19 pandemic and there was a shortage of PPE.  I will stand over that assertion and I have all the emails to back it up.</p> <p>  Mr. Daly said that Nursing Homes Ireland sought detailed Covid-19 advice from the HSE in a letter on 28 February.  I accept that it was 30 March before Nursing Homes Ireland met the Minister and his officials.  After Nursing Homes Ireland requested dedicated guidance for residential care settings, when did it receive that advice?</p></speech>

From the initial request on 28 February to 30 March, would it be fair to say that for Mr. Daly, as chairperson of Nursing Homes Ireland, which represents approximately 485 nursing homes in the sector, it was disappointing that it took four weeks for officials to meet with Nursing Homes Ireland?</p></speech>

Many matters were being escalated and we were hearing that NPHET was discussing certain matters but we felt it was important that the voice of the nursing home sector and the frustration that was felt by our members was heard at an official level.  We were disappointed that it took almost a month before we got to meet with the Minister.  I appreciate that he was busy in many other areas but I would highlight that given the vulnerability of older people, we felt this issue should have been higher on the agenda.</p></speech>

I know there were many calls, including from my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, for nursing homes to be represented on the NPHET taskforce.</p><p>Does Mr. Daly believe it realised the urgency at the initial stage because we had all seen the pictures from Italy and Spain where older people were left in nursing homes without care?</p></speech>

There was NPHET itself, a vulnerable persons subgroup and a nursing homes group.  As an organisation and a sector, we had no representation on any of those three committees.  That, to me, was more than disappointing.  It was unacceptable in my mind.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly mentioned in his opening statement that there was "aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff initially by the HSE".  I have heard that from different nursing homes I spoke to.  Can Mr. Daly expand on that?  Was the recruitment above and beyond a general advertising campaign or did the HSE directly head hunt staff from nursing homes?</p></speech>

We had written to the director general of the HSE and to the Minister.  There were three letters on that occasion, on 9 March, outlining our concerns around that issue.  What happened was people were on panels in some cases.  There was also, we would suggest, a targeting of people who were working in the sector.  We would have made the point that denuded one element of the health service to support another element, which was counterproductive.  We would have asked for a moratorium on recruitment.  This happens on an ongoing basis and people transfer for whatever reason.  However, in the teeth of the global pandemic, we felt it was appropriate to ask the HSE to do that.  It did not agree to do that at the time but there has been some improvements in that respect over the past number of weeks.</p></speech>

Yes, the last number of weeks have been encouraging.  Obviously, yesterday's announcement that there were no deaths was very encouraging for all of us, as a society.  Things have definitely improved but we cannot afford to be complacent at all.  I am aware there is some talk within NPHET and among others about a potential second wave.  That is where the expert group the Minister has established is important because it will, hopefully, do what did not happen, maybe, back in February and March, and provide a roadmap for Ireland Inc. for public, private and voluntary nursing homes.</p></speech>

We all understand how it works but Mr. Daly said it fell silent as homes incurred considerable and responsible costs to manage the pandemic.  I accept the Minister came on board with a package.  I also accept the fact that any expenses incurred in March were not allowed and it was only the expenses incurred after 1 April.  It is only fair to be clear about this matter.  Many nursing homes incurred a lot of expenses in March that they could not recoup.  What did Mr. Daly mean when he said it "fell silent" as homes incurred considerable expenses?</p></speech>

It is fair to acknowledge that on 4 April that was announced.  We were very disappointed it was not backdated to 1 March, as the Deputy said.  There are two issues here.  There is an element of that scheme which talks about outbreak assistance, so there is extra funding, which is very positive, for those that had an outbreak.  We would argue as well that those who spent considerable moneys to keep a nursing home Covid-free, in some respects, are not being recognised by the fact that the additional funding, in part C of that particular scheme, is only for those who had an outbreak.  We were disappointed with the level of engagement by the National Treatment Purchase Fund at a very early stage.</p></speech>

We will never know how Covid got into nursing homes, hospitals, homes and communities.  We can only surmise.  During the first three months of the year more than 2,500 people entered nursing home care under the fair deal scheme.  Every month 1,000 people transfer from acute hospitals into private and voluntary nursing homes.  I accept that Mr. Daly may be unable to answer my next questions.  How many people transferred in March after restrictions were imposed?  How many of these patients from the acute sector were tested before going into the nursing homes?  The crux of the issue is that these patients may have had Covid without realising it and may have, involuntarily, brought it into the nursing homes.</p></speech>

I thank him for all the work he does advocating for older people.  I have met him previously.  Was he contacted by very many families, sons and daughters of people in nursing homes who are very concerned about their parents at this time?  Unfortunately they have not been in a position to visit.  I know nursing homes have done an awful lot of good work with FaceTime, phones and all that.  Could Mr. Taylor explain the level of contact he has had from people who are worried?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mervyn Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#M00300"><p>It was considerable.  I said on "Drive Time" before that one of my abiding memories of this crisis has been a sense of phones not being answered when a place went into crisis.  It is important to say that in Deputy Butler's own area, in the south east, they got away relatively lightly.  It was the north-east quadrant from Dublin across to Mullingar and up to Cavan that was very badly hit.  In that area, there were nights one would put one's head in one's hands.  There were people who were despairing.  They could not get through because the staffing situation was so difficult.  The nursing homes were really stuck for staff.  Some places were down to absolute skeleton staff until the cavalry came.  The fact of the matter is that they needed support.  People were literally worn out.  I think of one woman in particular who had a dying husband and a son who had lived in the same nursing home and had gone into a hospital and died.  People were literally worn out and we were almost trying to pick up the phone calls for them because they were running out of energy.  That is one of the key things.  It sounds like it has nothing to do with clinical care but one of the most important things was the lack of ability to answer the phones.  To think of a nursing home with 50 people in it, that is at least 50 families all trying to get through, and there is nobody able to answer the phone.  All sorts of stories were magnified; that is one of the problems.  It is about trying to separate fact from fiction in these situations.  We heard of places where there were all sorts of allegations about numbers of deaths which were subsequently not true.</p></speech>

I want to ask Mr. Daly about the distribution of PPE.  I understand it was chaotic for a while and nobody was getting anything.  Now I believe we are at a stage where some people are over-supplied and some are under-supplied.  That is the experience of my colleague, Councillor R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey in Clare, who tells me she went around with a supply of PPE and found that some nursing homes did not want it and some were desperate.  Is that Mr. Daly's experience with his members?</p></speech>

In the early stages, as the Deputy said, it was quite chaotic.  Everybody was scrambling to ensure that they had enough supply.  We made a suggestion in the early stage that every nursing home should have a three-day supply in-house so they could deal with either a confirmed case or, more important, a suspected case.  We also felt that among our members, if we had a three-day supply people could share, maybe, in a given location.</p></speech>

We talk about congregated settings.  Typically, people are sitting in sitting rooms, watching TV, sharing rooms on occasion or whatever.  Nursing Homes Ireland has received guidance from the Department of Health on how they should operate from the infection control point of view.  Does that mean that fewer people can fit in a nursing home?  How is it affecting Nursing Homes Ireland members?</p></speech>

It is looking at how we can plan for the next six to 18 months.  Over the last while we have seen that people are practising cocooning, in effect.  In the private and voluntary sector, the vast majority would be in single en-suite rooms.  Unfortunately, as regards the social connectedness piece, people very often are staying in their rooms.</p></speech>

In some homes where there has not been a Covid outbreak and where an acute hospital is still discharging and they have taken the appropriate steps in terms of risk and testing, it is appropriate that a person would be transferred.  In those cases, a person would be isolated for 14 days.</p></speech>

They might have had a fear but now that fear is much greater and it is among families as well.</p><p>Government policy is to move more towards home care and having a statutory home care package and away from relying on the fair deal scheme alone.  This combination of fewer people fitting in a nursing home because of infection control rooms, fewer people wanting to enter them and the State supporting more home care would seem to add up to much less demand for nursing home spaces.  I do not know whether this is how Mr. Daly sees it.  If this does happen, will it lead to nursing homes either closing or having higher fees to stay in a nursing home with fewer people in it?</p></speech>

Clearly, what we need to develop as a society is a continuum of care for older people.  We always get caught up in the silos of home care, acute care, and housing with supports.  We need to develop a continuum of care.  There is a legitimate question on what we term the future viability of some homes, in particular smaller homes.  We are very concerned about this with regard to maintaining service continuity.  We have an ageing population and an increasing ageing demographic.  It is also important to say the age profile of nursing homes is primarily over 80 and over 85.</p></speech>

Hospices have the shortest expected length of stay.  Will future nursing home stays be shorter, for example, for one year?  Will Mr. Taylor describe what fits into the gap between home care and nursing homes?</p></speech>

Mr. Daly and I have been on the same platform regarding a continuum of care for a number of years.  It is everything from home care, split housing and boarding out to supportive housing, mutual and housing co-operatives and housing with supports.  There is a need for nursing home care but it is also how we try to envisage it for the future.  We must bear in mind there is a wide range of nursing homes.  I looked at the recent lists and 49% of nursing homes have fewer than 50 residents.  This has its own issues.  We want people to live in smaller more homely places but the fact is the trend is towards larger places.  How do we get the balance right?  It can only come with the continuum the Deputy is describing.</p></speech>

I will direct my first question to Mr. Daly.  It has been pretty clear that, in his words during media appearances yesterday evening and this morning and in his opening statement, he has been shifting responsibility to the HSE.  Is there anything he would have done differently with regard to his organisation earlier this year?  Is there anything he would look back on and say he should have done this or that?</p></speech>

We take our responsibility very seriously.  I am highlighting the facts, which are that there were gaps in terms of the supports.  It is not about supports for the private, public or voluntary sector; it is about supports for older people.  Many of the measures we took on infection control, sourcing personal protective equipment, isolation within nursing homes and nursing homes being prepared with contingency planning could be improved but that is for another day.  At this point, nothing stands out, to be honest, with regard to whether we would do things differently.</p></speech>

I know it also has members from the voluntary sector and small and medium enterprises.  Nursing Homes Ireland's large corporate members have considerable experience of dealing with the HSE through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The individuals involved are self-starters who have a lot of contacts, although they may not necessarily be living or domiciled here.  Is Mr. Daly satisfied with their efforts?</p></speech>

It does not pick a public home or a private home, a large home or a small home.  The efforts of all of the sector, public, private and voluntary, have been to try to suppress the virus.  At this point, I do not have any concern but ultimately that is a matter for HIQA as the independent inspectorate.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Daly think this has had an impact on the staffing levels and the ability to attract staff?  Nursing Homes Ireland has had its own recruitment campaign since 17 March, which would indicate this has not been successful.  Mr. Daly said the HSE has been aggressive in its recruitment campaign but does he think the Nursing Homes Ireland structure in terms of pay for health staff has been a factor in this?</p></speech>

The National Treatment Purchase Fund sets the fees and the fees, in turn, dictate the pay scales within the sector.  We would love nothing better in the morning than to be on the same rates as the HSE but the State is not providing that level, despite the fact the fair deal is supposed to be a level playing field.</p></speech>

Given there has been an issue in terms of being prepared for this across the State, would Mr. Daly consider the setting up of a pandemic or crisis fund within the nursing homes sector, which he represents?  I am referring to a sort of sinking fund into the future for those that can pay, and they would pay in so there would be a fund that could be drawn upon if there is a second or further wave of this crisis.  This would mean that for those few weeks that were spent with the HSE, getting responses and not getting responses, it would not have to be such an issue because there would be that reserve, which would come from the nursing homes' own resources.</p></speech>

The issue was PPE generally, as it just was not available.  Members were sourcing it, they were buying it overseas and buying it locally.  Finance was not the issue - let us be absolutely clear on that.  The issue was that it was a scarce commodity in an international market and the source of supply had dried up, not just for nursing homes but for all elements of the health service.</p></speech>

The point Deputy Butler made was that the scheme is from 1 April whereas, in fact, members would have spent quite considerable sums in March which are potentially not recoupable under the temporary financial assistance scheme.</p></speech>

Any examination of what has happened in the nursing homes must be viewed in a policy context.  There is no doubt bereaved families and Irish society generally are paying a very high price for what I would regard as a confluence of policy failures in the care of older people which have been graphically and tragically exposed over recent months.  It is important that we bear in mind what those policy failures are.  The first is the two-tier health service.  The second is in regard to social care being treated as the poor relation of the health service.  The third is the fact that nursing homes are regarded as a good investment opportunity, as opposed to a central element of the healthcare service, and that the incentivisation of investment in nursing homes has led to the unrelenting privatisation of the sector.  The fourth is the fact that older people themselves are incentivised to access nursing home care because of the lack of statutory entitlement to home care, in spite of the fact that home care is what older people want and is in the best interests of their health needs.  The fifth area that has been absolutely exposed is the light-touch regulation of this entire sector.</p> <p>  I recognise that Deputy O'Dowd had to leave.  I would make the point to Deputy O'Dowd and other Government Deputies that those points have to be made loudly as well and must be heard clearly.  We are wasting our time examining this whole area unless we recognise that policy context and those policy failures. </p> <p>  I have a number of questions for Mr. Daly.  The first relates to the staff ratios in operation across the sector.</p><p>What ratios apply in respect of nurses to residents and healthcare assistants to residents, and what is the policy in respect of casual staff?</p></speech>

I find it hard to believe that he would be precluded from having safe ratios as regards nurses to residents.</p> <p>  I will list the other questions I have for him and perhaps he could answer them together.  What is the policy in Mr. Daly's sector on staff moving between nursing homes?  How much of the &euro;72 million support fund has been drawn down to date, and what have his members been using that support money for in the main?</p> <p>  I refer to the transfer of patients from acute hospitals, which we know should have happened anyway.  We should not have large numbers of older people in acute hospitals when they do not need to be there.  Mr. Daly identified this as the source of the virus in nursing homes.  The CMO disputes that.  Does Mr. Daly have data to support his contention?</p></speech>

One was on the policy of the sector on moving staff between centres.  A number of our nursing homes, particularly in rural Ireland, would have a steady state of staff.  In urban areas, more so, there would be some movement of staff between centres.  However, there would also be movement of physiotherapists and speech and language therapists, and of other professionals coming in and out of nursing homes.  There is no absolute policy one way or the other.</p> <p>  On the &euro;72 million, as of last Friday, &euro;8.7 million has been drawn down and the majority of that has been spent on PPE and staffing.</p> <p>  On the issue of the transfer of residents, I am not saying it was the sole determinant.  However, I am saying it was a significant contributory factor because, as we know now, there was much greater community transmission of the virus.</p></speech>

I will conclude, however, by referring to the passionate speech made by Deputy O'Dowd in which he referred to the private nursing home sector putting profit before health and safety.  The Deputy has since left the meeting but I point out to the remaining Government members that the reason for that is that we have gone from having a nursing home sector that was majority publicly owned 35 years ago to one which is overwhelmingly privately owned.  The reason for that change was that a policy of privatisation backed up by massive tax breaks was pursued by Governments led by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  There was, therefore, more than a touch of hypocrisy in the bit of outrage we saw earlier.</p></speech>

As somebody who has been involved in trying to help the HSE to source PPE through contacts that I have, I am well aware of the cost of PPE and of what was being paid by some of NHI's members and the difficulties getting it.  I do not think Deputy O'Dowd was quite clear in highlighting the fact that NHI members are not being paid for those purchases made back in early March.  That needs to be put on the record because at the moment the record reflects that is not the case when, in fact, NHI members have not been paid.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Daly about recruitment.  Would Mr. Daly say it was a difficulty for the sector that the HSE was actively targeting healthcare personnel for recruitment, and that they were coming from some of the homes of NHI members?</p></speech>

Nursing staff are a scarce commodity worldwide, so that put extra pressure on the sector.  We asked for a moratorium on recruitment for the period of the pandemic at least.</p></speech>

Legislation has been anticipated for safeguarding adults and the Law Reform Commission has a consultation going on regarding how such a framework might best occur.  We believe that is a mechanism for framing legal recognition of independent advocacy.  There is also a need for legislation on protection of liberty of people in congregated care settings because that is a serious issue.  People have been transferred from acute hospitals to nursing homes on temporary transition funding.  The question is: will they have a choice of staying there or getting the package they need to support them to go home?  Legislation can come either way.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the staff in nursing homes who have worked incredibly hard.  I know of their hard work because I contacted many nursing homes in west Cork, such as Cramers Court in Belgooly, CareChoice Clonakilty, Bushmount Nursing Home, Skibbereen Residential Care Centre, Fairfield Nursing Home in Drimoleague and Deerpark House Nursing Home in Bantry.  Each of them has gone through a difficult time.  Thankfully, the number of cases of Covid in west Cork has been very low, which is a blessing in its own right.  However, there are questions that need to be asked and I must address them as quickly as possible in the time I have.  Most of them will be for Mr. Daly.</p><p> Was a strategy in place to test patients who were moved from hospitals to nursing homes in order to free up acute hospital beds?  If there was such a strategy, what percentage of those patients were tested and moved only on the basis of a negative result?</p></speech>

We received communication from the acute hospitals and the HSE community healthcare organisations that the patients were deemed to be low risk, had not been in contact with Covid and would be transferred.  There was no definitive strategy at that point.</p></speech>

As another Deputy noted, the question is what we will do next and whether there will be a targeted testing approach.  I do not believe that the HSE is planning mass testing.  It is clear that there must be a roadmap for testing in order to ensure that nursing homes can take patients from acute hospitals and reopen to visitors.</p></speech>

From what I can gather, it currently takes two weeks for residents to be tested and ten days for staff to be tested.  Is Mr. Daly aware that Animal Health Laboratories in Bandon,  west Cork, is turning around Covid-19 tests in a day?  If he is not, will he get Nursing Homes Ireland to avail of this incredible service such that testing can be carried out in our own backyard rather than samples being flown to Germany and all over the world?</p></speech>

Turnaround time has been reduced to approximately three days.  We will be guided by the recommendations of the public health authorities in respect of the next wave of testing.  We understand that will be announced before the end of the week.</p></speech>

What we have been dealing with is a national response.  Ultimately, the HSE is running the testing programme.  We have asked that testing kits be made available to staff in nursing homes in order that they can take swabs themselves, which would be far quicker than having to wait for the National Ambulance Service to so do.</p></speech>

It can be very comforting for a resident to have a person who he or she knows doing the swab rather than an external person.</p></speech>

It seems to me that it is taking between ten and 12 days to get tests completed.  If it takes another three to five, six or seven days to get the results, it defeats the whole purpose.  My point is that we need to look to local laboratories to carry out these tests.  I urge Mr. Daly to consider using such laboratories.</p></speech>

We got that today at 9.30 a.m.  We have not had time to go through all that correspondence in detail, but I have isolated some items, which I want to go through because they illustrate exactly what is in Mr. Daly's opening statement.  </p> <p>  I will start with No. 32.  I will not name the individuals involved, but Mr. Daly wrote to a senior official in the Department on 16 March setting out his concerns.  I know there was prior correspondence, but on that date, he emailed this individual seeking a commitment to a dialogue.  He referred to critical issues he had raised previously referred to considerable anxiety, access to PPE and issues concerning essential workers, and he suggested that a working group should be established to co-ordinate activities in the home care setting.  Does he recall that?  </p></speech>

He also referred to exhaustion of stocks, stated that residents and staff were awaiting testing and that was a difficulty.  He also stated that "Delays occurring can present cataclysmic consequences."  In that correspondence, Mr. Daly again sought an urgent meeting regarding outstanding issues.

I will go to correspondence No. 42.  This was sent directly to the Minister for Health.  It was an urgent request for a meeting and a conference call.  That was on 19 March, and there was no response to that until the end of March.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I refer to a letter he wrote to the Minister in which he states:" I am writing to you to request an urgent meeting or conference call to discuss important issues."  Mr. Daly then set out all the issues again.  He continued by respectfully requesting immediate engagement to ensure the NHI could continue to provide high quality.  That was on 19 March.  It was not until the end of March that there was a meeting.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Mr. Daly, therefore, had outlined that issue right through the process.  He wanted a working group in place, but his group had been left out of the process.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

One was the vulnerable persons subgroup and a nursing home subgroup was established as well.  That was the one to which I was referring.  There was a specific nursing home group and we did not have a seat at that table.  That was unacceptable.</p></speech>

I noted in some of the correspondence, which we are only now getting an opportunity to comb through, that some nursing homes were forced to use painters' overalls and supplies from a local school and a vet as personal protective equipment.  Does Mr. Daly find it profoundly shocking that that is the situation that staff and managers in the institutions were left in?  The sector was crying out for help day in and day out, week in and week out during that timeframe and nursing homes and the staff were forced to used painters' overalls and supplies.</p></speech>

The HSE was doing its best at the time but we would have felt that some of the PPE should have been directed towards the nursing home sector given the vulnerability, age profile and complexity of residential care.</p></speech>

I appreciate that we can look back with the benefit of hindsight but in early March Nursing Homes Ireland took a decision to impose restrictions in regard to visitation.  Is it not the case that NPHET met a week later and took a different approach?  Mr. Daly mentioned in his opening statement that NPHET publicly challenged the decision that his organisation took.</p></speech>

That was a particularly difficult week for the staff in our homes.</p></speech>

The statement that the NTPF "fell silent" is a very strong one.  In what area did it fall silent?</p></speech>

Given the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund in terms of funding under the fair deal scheme, we would have expected it to reach out and engage with the sector in terms of what those costs would look like.</p></speech>

That is a very strong statement.  It strikes me that Mr. Daly was very disappointed and angry with the State actors that they did not respond.  Despite all of the telephone calls, emails and other correspondence and the yellow and red flags being raised, the organisation and its members and residents of nursing homes were not given the human and financial resources that they required because there was an absence of a plan.  Would that be a fair assessment of what Mr. Daly was getting at in that sentence of his opening statement?</p></speech>

He gave a very robust defence of the Department.  When Mr. Breslin was here last week I put questions to him on some of these issues and he said that there was guidance and a plan throughout February and March, contradicting much of what is stated in all of the correspondence and Mr. Daly's opening statement.

I acknowledge the phenomenal and committed work of individuals in the sector who have worked really hard.  I have stayed in touch with those in my area and last week we raised the issue of testing and tracing.  I will be raising a significant matter that arises with respect to insurance but Mr. Daly is representing Nursing Homes Ireland, a representative body of for-profit and private nursing homes.  Deputy O'Dowd has, over the course of his career, expressed concerns about how older people are cared for.  The purpose of this committee is to assess the State response, and as Mr. Daly indicated, it is one of the most important analyses that may be conducted.  It is in that vein that I wish to interrogate some of the matters raised by Mr. Daly.</p><p>The most important statement made by Mr. Daly, both here and in the media over the past couple of days, is that the sector felt isolated in early March, that this was distressing and that there was a lack of engagement.  I will go through this as we now have the benefit of the correspondence between the Department and Nursing Homes Ireland.  I apologise if this is dull but it is important to be careful.</p><p>Going back to the beginning of the year, there were two items of correspondence, with one relating to insurance and a second concerning a former Deputy, Mr. Jim Daly, who was not running for re-election.  The correspondence of 28 February related to a call of thanks with respect to guidance on Covid-19.  From 28 February onwards, there was very significant engagement on a daily and often multiple times daily.  This was at assistant secretary level with Dr. Kathleen MacLellan.  It is important because of what the witness said to go through some of the correspondence and I will give Mr. Daly the opportunity to respond at the end.  Correspondence from the Department on 2 March states: &quot;Thank you for your email.  We continue to ensure members are appropriately informed.&quot;.  The reply from Dr. MacLellan states: &quot;Tadhg, many thanks for keeping me updated.&quot;  I imagine some in the media will go through this correspondence but it is important for the committee's purpose for it to be done.  On 4 March Dr. MacLellan wrote:</p> <blockquote> 	Tadhg,<br /><br />... Yes I can confirm that there [are] a number of subgroups being established under NPHET.  I will be chairing the Vulnerable People subgroup </blockquote> <p>Dr. MacLellan is the assistant secretary in the social care division and she indicates that she is chairing that subgroup and is the primary point of correspondence with Nursing Homes Ireland.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

On 5 March, Mr. Daly states:</p> <blockquote> 	Thank you for [the] invitation to [the] stakeholder briefing in the Department tomorrow.  I can confirm that a number of our members participated in a conference call with Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly [in the] HSE this afternoon ...  I would appreciate a quick [update]. </blockquote> <p>The correspondence continues and I do not want to take the committee's time by going through this in detail that is too great.  On 10 March, however, there is a letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Health, which states:</p> <blockquote> 	I refer to your letter of 9 March.<br /><br />As part of preparedness planning for Covid-19 we are examining a range of work force issues and I have asked relevant officials to look [at that] </blockquote> <p>This is in early March, when Mr. Daly indicates that his organisation felt isolated.  There is correspondence on 10 March at 7 p.m. and 8 p.m.  The correspondence continues, indicating that guidance was issued on 10 March and Mr. Daly thanks Dr. MacLellan for the correspondence indicating that guidance was issued.  How is it precisely that Nursing Homes Ireland felt isolated?  All this correspondence is from a period between 2 March and 10 March.  Was it the particular engagement of the Minister that Mr. Daly sought?</p></speech>

On the issue the Deputy referred to in terms of the Secretary General responding, he stated that it was escalated to other officials in the Department.

Thank you again.  We wish to acknowledge your engagement ... We are committed ... and thank you for your participation."  I appreciate that there is back and forth and clarity in respect of PPE and that that was an issue.  I appreciate that testing was an issue.  I appreciate that these were issues, collectively and nationally, not just for the sector but also for the State.  Mr. Daly said he felt isolated.  It is a really important statement.  When he engaged with Deputy Cullinane, he stated that he sought a meeting with the Minister on 19 March.  To correct the record, he had a conference call with Department officials on 20 March.

As a country, we will reflect on what has happened with great sadness and shame.  How best can we deal with all of the correspondence Mr. Daly has submitted to the committee and been asked about today?</p> <p>  Separate from this committee, is it the case that we now need a general inquiry at some stage into what happened so that we can understand clearly and have the time to tease out the step-by-step failings that have occurred?  Whether it is the Minister, the Department or whoever, we are talking about the care of the elderly and a significant number of deaths that may or may not have been avoided.  Does Mr. Daly see the need for a more substantial inquiry into all of this?</p></speech>

That would inform the next steps.  Similarly, the expert group that has been appointed by the Minister has an important job to do.  I would not like to prejudge what is going to come out of those two groups but, clearly, there are lessons to be learned.  The challenge for us, as a society, is to ensure that we continue to develop high-quality care-----</p></speech>

What happened here is a complete failure of policy and a disregard for the care of older people.  There are significant lessons to be learned from this, but the fact is that there is conflict, in the context of some of the issues raised, between Mr. Daly and the Department of Health, NPHET and so on.  That conflict needs to be resolved.  As policymakers, we need to be clear about where the failures occurred and also about the evidence Mr. Daly has for some of his statements.  I would want to be clear on the direction nursing homes will take for the future because it is, without doubt, a shame on all of us that this happened and that there was not the type of response that there should have been from those who were central to delivering such a response in respect of the queries that were made.  Mr. Daly is the one who is highlighting all of this and saying it.</p></speech>

Is there now a discussion with the HSE for that to be put in place and for it to be done within a particular timescale?  Surely, we could set a timescale of the next 14 days for that to be in place in every nursing home throughout the country.  Is that physically possible at this stage?</p></speech>

Life expectancy in this country has increased by seven years since 2000.</p><p>In other words, people are living seven years longer now compared with the year 2000.  Nursing homes have made a contribution to that increase in life expectancy.  On average, how many deaths are there in all the nursing homes across the country per month?  Have we a figure for that?</p></speech>

What has happened is tragic and heartbreaking.  It has happened in a lot of other countries, although notably there are countries that managed to act decisively and early and avoid the outbreaks we have seen in our nursing homes.  Both Mr. Daly and Mr. Taylor have laid out that older people lack a voice generally in policymaking and that nursing homes - really, we are talking about the residents and the staff when we talk about nursing homes - have also lacked a voice in this crisis.  The Government's Covid action plan for mid-March refers to nursing homes only once as somewhere to send hospital patients.  The plan makes no reference to any supports or risks that need to be examined for nursing homes.  Mr. Daly has said that the first time he managed to get a meeting with the Minister was 30 March, when we were well into the crisis in the nursing homes.  The first time the National Public Health Emergency Team even mentioned nursing homes in its minutes was in the minutes for its 12th meeting on 10 March.  Its recommendation was that the restrictions that the nursing homes themselves had put in place should be relaxed.  The National Public Health Emergency Team therefore held two positions in the same week: one, that schools should all close, and two, that nursing homes should be more open, which I find absolutely extraordinary.  Would representation on the National Public Health Emergency Team and closer contact with senior officials and Cabinet have made a difference?  The Minister's position, which he has outlined repeatedly to me, is that HIQA, the regulator, represents nursing homes at the table.  Do the witnesses believe HIQA can represent nursing homes at the table?  Critically, looking forward, do the witnesses believe that nursing home residents and staff and older people have a sufficient voice now, be it on the National Public Health Emergency Team, in senior policy settings, in senior HSE areas or at a senior political level, in order that we can properly prepare for the potential second wave which may come and make sure we do not see these outbreaks and tragic deaths occur again in our nursing homes, and indeed for older people in other settings?</p></speech>

I contend that having a voice for the sector and older persons on NPHET would have been important.</p><p> HIQA is the independent regulator for public, private and voluntary settings.  It is on NPHET, but so is the HSE, which is a provider of care through its own public facilities.  Clearly, the private and voluntary sectors were not represented on NPHET.  HIQA can speak for itself this afternoon, but its role is more about regulation than representing the voice of the sector.</p><p> Regarding the Deputy's third point, I have spoken to many parliamentarians over a long number of years about the voice of older people.  In my role, I represent the providers of care, but-----</p></speech>

The Minister and I have discussed the matter repeatedly in this Chamber.  The answer he keeps giving me is that nursing homes and their residents and staff do not need any representation because they now have regular access to him.  We are still in the middle of this crisis and are planning for a second wave.  Does Mr. Daly believe that nursing homes have sufficient voice at the right political, administrative and official levels?</p></speech>

There has to be some link on clinical governance and nursing support across each of the six new HSE regions planned under Sl&aacute;intecare.  There was a constructional problem with private nursing homes, in that they were literally outsourced and forgotten about.  I am clear on that.</p> <p>  Regarding a voice, I look forward to legislation that will legitimise the role of independent advocates.  I remember private nursing homes throwing our staff out and not allowing them to contact residents.  That is a rare occasion, but it has happened.  When we talk about a voice, we need to talk about a right for independent advocacy and recognising that practice in law.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for the witnesses before they leave.  Earlier in the meeting, there was a dispute concerning a teleconference.

We will ask for those reasons.</p> <p>  The Care Quality Commission is the United Kingdom's equivalent of HIQA.  It required that every care facility identify a clinical lead by 15 May.  In Ireland, some HSE facilities have a medical officer who is responsible for the care of all staff and some do not.  In many HSE and private facilities, there are many people under the care of many different GPs and there is no one person responsible for the care of everyone.  Would a similar approach to the UK's be beneficial in Ireland if a clinical lead had to be appointed for every care facility?</p></speech>

We have made that point.  We felt it was a missed opportunity in the revision of the General Medical Services, GMS, contract last year.</p><p>We are on the record in outlining that there should be a requirement for a specific GMS contract for residents in nursing homes.</p><p> The only other point, Chairman, is that the current standards speak of the resident retaining the right to his or her own GP.</p></speech>

It is important to put on the record that general practice is a great support for their patients who are our residents.</p></speech>

One of the things that led us to develop this work, in which we collaborated with Nursing Home Ireland and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, was our concern that it was unclear what the clinical leadership is in nursing homes, particularly in private nursing homes.  Some residents are being charged &euro;25 and others &euro;40 a week for a GP service when the fact of the matter is that they should be entitled to this anyway because of their age.  In some places there would be a very good structure while in others it would be very difficult for GPs to come in.  I want to quote very briefly from this report:</p> <blockquote> 	The point was made that nursing home staff may not have the exposure, experience and training available in acute hospitals.  It was also suggested that skills sets of nurses working in nursing homes may have gone down in recent years with a concomitant fear of making decisions in potentially crisis situations. </blockquote> <p>The difficulty here is that if a nurse needs support and there is not strong clinical support, then there is a real weakness in the system, and there has to be clinical leadership.</p></speech>

I thank them for joining us in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We are joined from committee room 1 by three representatives from the HSE: Mr. David Walsh, national director of community operations; Ms Sandra Tuohy, assistant national director of older persons services and Dr. Siobhan Kennelly, national clinical advisory group lead older persons.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 186 that the committee should also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such plans.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times.  If they believe that they are not being so treated I ask them to bring it to the attention of the committee.</p><p> We are not taking an opening statement from the HSE as last week we received a statement from Mr. Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE.  I invite Mr. Quinn to make his opening statement and ask that he limit it to five minutes.  As we received the opening statement in advance, it has been circulated to members.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mary Dunnion, chief inspector of social services and director of regulation.</p> <p>  Before I start, on behalf of HIQA, we wish to convey our sympathies to the families of those who have died in nursing homes and across the country during this pandemic.</p> <p>  HIQA, through the office of the chief inspector, registers and inspects 584 nursing homes accommodating approximately 30,000 residents.  From the onset of this public health emergency, HIQA has endeavoured to make an effective contribution to the national response through our interactions with the Department of Health, the HSE, providers, residents and relatives. While routine inspections were not initially possible, HIQA has a process in place whereby all centres are formally contacted by an inspector on a regular basis to assess how they are managing in the provision of safe services to vulnerable service users.  In addition, the chief inspector issued eight regulatory notices with the aim of reducing the regulatory burden on providers. </p> <p>  Inspections required to register new centres or facilitate increasing capacity have been expedited within days.  HIQA has provided information to the Department of Health and the HSE on those centres with a history of poor compliance with key regulations, as those services were at increased risk of Covid-19 outbreaks. </p> <p>  Formal processes are in place whereby HIQA escalates actual or potential risk to the HSE&rsquo;s crisis management teams.  On a weekly basis, the chief inspector and her leadership team meet the HSE to formally discuss ongoing issues and to escalate risk within the sector. </p> <p>  To support the public health response, HIQA provided the HSE with key information such as the locations of nursing homes, the number of residential beds and staffing levels.  Furthermore, the HSE and the Department of Health availed of HIQA&rsquo;s online notification system to ensure the timely distribution of information to all nursing homes.</p> <p>  Currently, 80% of nursing homes are operated by private providers.  Although funded through the nursing homes support scheme, the HSE did not know this sector.  As a consequence, the infrastructure required by the HSE to support the private sector was under-resourced and became increasingly challenged.  In addition, the current model of private residential care for older persons has no formal clinical governance links with the HSE.  Importantly, this means there is no national clinical oversight of the care being delivered to some of our most vulnerable citizens. </p> <p>  Many nursing homes and disability centres were adequately prepared and managed to contain Covid-19 outbreaks.  However, the private nursing home sector faced unique challenges.  For example: timely testing and results; access to sustainable levels of PPE, oxygen and subcutaneous fluids; and baseline staff numbers, including senior nursing expertise in infection prevention and control. </p> <p>  In recognition of the difficulties faced by the providers of residential services, HIQA initiated a number of interventions from 5 March.  These included the escalation to the HSE and the Department of Health of risks and trends requiring a more co-ordinated national response.  On 18 March, HIQA made a formal offer to assist the HSE in liaising with designated centres.  This was in recognition of the fact that there was no established relationship between the HSE and the private sector. </p> <p>  Every day HIQA collates data on the number of designated centres with suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19, as well as the numbers of unexpected deaths in designated centres.  Since the end of March, this information has been supplied on a daily basis to the Department of Health initially, and then to the HSE and the HPSC. </p> <p>  From 1 April, HIQA requested a formal escalation pathway for a more strategic co-ordinated approach to the supply of PPE, resident and staff testing and results, a longer-term approach to staffing and infection control advice. </p> <p>  To provide support and assistance to providers and staff, HIQA established an infection prevention and control hub on 6 April.  HIQA continues to review information received from members of the public, care staff and family members.</p><p>It must be acknowledged that the creation of crisis management teams in each CHO area and the resources provided by the HSE at the community level played a significant part in supporting the private sector, and importantly, in protecting residents.  COVID-19 has presented significant challenges to the current models of care in place for our older citizens.  Since our establishment, HIQA has endeavoured to influence policy in the area of older persons&rsquo; services based on our experience of the sector.</p><p> HIQA believes that the quality and safety of our health and social care services would be greatly improved by a review of the current regulatory framework and the introduction of an accountability framework, to include a commissioning model.  As part of an accountability framework, HIQA believes that a system of care management could be introduced across the HSE&rsquo;s community service areas.  Such a model would closely align with the principles and goals articulated within Sl&aacute;intecare, as the key aim of the system is to support people in, or as close to their own homes as possible.  These care plans are based on a multidisciplinary assessment and would enable a sustained shift away from institutional models towards a more person-centred system whereby care is provided in the home.  I thank the members for their attention this afternoon.  We look forward to answering any questions they may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#OO00300"><p>I extend my deepest sympathies to the families of all the people who have passed away in our nursing homes and in our society as a result of Covid-19.  I recognise absolutely the hurt and pain people have, particularly when loved ones pass away in a nursing home.  They do not get to see them or say goodbye.  It is an appalling vista which is brought about by the nature of the virus itself.  I also acknowledge the tremendous work of all our health service people, workers in nursing homes, care assistants, cleaners and people who help out in every way.  These people do fantastic work, often for very poor wages and without proper recognition.</p> <p>  I have met Mr. Quinn and communicated with him.  I have appealed some of his decisions to the Information Commissioner in the past, in an effort to get transparency around the care of people in nursing homes.  I wrote to him on Tuesday, 24 March seeking an entitlement which I believe the people had at the time and still have, namely, a categoric assurance from HIQA that all nursing homes and care homes are fully compliant in infection control.  The reason I wrote the letter was the HIQA report to which I referred earlier, which indicated that, at the time, only 123 of the 581 nursing homes subject to HIQA inspection met in full all of the regulations.  I did not get that commitment from Mr. Quinn.  While I note what he is saying here today, as I understand it, he has to be accountable.  The office of the HIQA chief inspector has statutory responsibility for the registration and inspection of nursing homes and other residential services for children and adults with disabilities.  As part of its remit, HIQA can inspect nursing homes and make binding decisions relative to the safety and quality of care provided to residents following inspection.  That is the statutory power HIQA has.  I note Mr. Quinn's call for additional powers, with which I do not disagree.  Why was Mr. Quinn not able to give that categoric assurance to me and, more importantly, to all of the residents that all of the homes they were living in were fully compliant in infection control?  Clearly, we both know they were not.  That is my first question.</p></speech>

To be clear, in my response to the Deputy I suppose what I was trying to articulate was the fact that as part of the general response to Covid-19, a multi-agency response was required in terms of getting that sort of assurance for this pandemic.</p></speech>

In 2019, which are probably the more up-to-date figures, 238 inspections included regulation 27, which is the one particular to infection control.  Of these 238 inspections, 20 cases were not compliant and a significant number were only substantially compliant.  There are several reasons for this.  The national standards for community centres called for a national integrated approach to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.  To date, this is not in place.  On the rare occurrences when outbreaks of winter vomiting and influenza occur these procedures are effective but the national standards are not able to deal with the case of a pandemic.</p> <p>  One of the big issues that makes centres not compliant is the premises.  In this context, there is a statutory instrument that gives nursing homes until January 2021 to become compliant.  Until they reach this level of compliance they cannot be compliant with the standards of infection control.</p></speech>

I have not seen the figures.  I am glad Ms Dunnion has given them to me.</p> <p>  There is a particular problem when nursing homes are inspected and major or minor non-compliance is found and I will use a particular nursing home as an example but I will not name it.  This particular nursing home was inspected in March 2019 and the report was published in July 2019 but the follow up inspection was not until December 2019 and that report was published in March 2020.  There was a year between the first inspection with negative outcomes and the report of the follow up inspection which, in this case, appeared to show compliance.  Without going into the details, this nursing home was non-compliant with regard to health and social care, safeguarding and safety, residents' rights and dignity and suitable staffing.  Its complaints procedure is compliant.  Notwithstanding all of the powers HIQA has, the process of inspection and follow-up does not seem to be working as quickly as it ought to be.  I appreciate that follow-up is part of the process but it is not fast enough or good enough.</p> <p>  There is no change in the figures we have.  The majority of nursing homes are not compliant.  In this crisis HIQA is statutorily accountable.  I do not suggest it is passing the buck to anybody else, and I agree it includes other agencies, but ultimately the buck stop with it.  As an inspectorate, does HIQA require more staff?  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but the figure in its most recent report was that 76% of nursing homes were inspected last year as opposed to 100%.  If HIQA does not have enough staff to investigate, look at, help and support private and public nursing homes it cannot do its job.  Does HIQA need more powers?  It seems that non-compliance can drag on and on.  I do not agree there is a difference between major and minor infractions.  By definition, a nursing home should be 100% compliant.  Does HIQA need more powers to ensure this happens?  A huge part of this is not just finding what are the issues but training and making available to public and private nursing homes the professional capacity to upskill all of their staff.  It is good enough finding fault in one sense but if people do not upskill an inspector cannot be there 24-7.</p> <p>  We have had a serious problem with a private nursing home in Dundalk where there has been an awful lot of sadness and upset at the terrible outcome for so many people in a very short space of time.</p><p>It seems there was a situation whereby out of a total of 24 professional staff, particularly nurses, only six were available to maintain that nursing home because of illness and absence for other reasons.  Given that we are in this sort of crisis, not just nationally but internationally, does HIQA, in the context of its investigations, have the power to seek information from the nursing home, from the HSE and from others in order to get to the bottom of what happened and give closure to the families in Dundalk that are so distressed?</p></speech>

In recent years, we have sought a review of the regulations.  The regulations that currently obtain were developed, in the main, in 2009 and, subsequently, in 2013 and are worthy of review to keep pace with current models of care.</p> <p>  Before passing over to Ms Dunnion, I must stand that, in the context of the training of staff, at the beginning of our corporate planning period last year, we changed the emphasis of some of the work we have been doing regarding standards development.  We have been looking at the development of training and guideline materials to assist the implementation of standards within health and care settings.  For example, we have developed a training module in regard to infection prevention and control in the community standards and we are also in the process of developing a training and guideline module for human rights-based approaches to care across the nursing home sector.</p></speech>

I would like to know at what point HIQA became aware and how it escalated the issue.  I would also like to know how the HSE first became aware and how it escalated the issue, given that it obviously reached a point where the RCSI hospitals group was appointed in or around 17 April.  I would like to have those answers first.</p></speech>

From that time, Midlands Louth Meath community healthcare organisation, CHO, was involved with the nursing home and subsequently on or around 17 March the RCSI hospitals group made a decision to become more centrally involved.  In the interim period, however, a number of supports had been given, including staff supports from both the acute hospital and community setting as well as personal protection equipment, PPE, infection control advice.</p></speech>

If so, what was its reaction to them?</p> <p>  In his opening statement this morning, Mr. Taylor stated there was little knowledge of the nursing home sector in the HSE.

Some families expressed concerns about the fact that we were inspecting.

In all cases where testing was needed, it was directed.  That was based on our knowledge of the clinical course of the presentation of Covid-19 in older people at that time.  There were also strong recommendations made in respect of facilities where residents might have had contact with patients in acute hospitals, that those facilities were able to isolate those patients and provide the appropriate level of IPC support.  That was all out there from the earliest possible stage.</p></speech>

As a matter of public record, I can show the Deputy evidence of the correspondence that myself and officials in the HSE issued through the system, in line with the public health advice and with colleagues from Infection Prevention and Control.  It is very important to understand that we are in a very fast-moving situation when we are trying to address these issues.  We were aware of the fact that we had approximately 670 delayed discharges in acute hospitals at that time.</p><p>One of the biggest concerns for me, both as a clinician and as a geriatrician who is very involved in the care of these patients, was that in the event of an anticipated surge in these acute hospitals, many of those who had finished their acute episodes of care would be at very high risk in terms of contracting Covid.  Everything we did and all the guidance we issued - including the very comprehensive guidance that was issued again on 17 March regarding how patients would be cared for in nursing homes, regardless of whether they were in public or private facilities - was on the basis of the information we had and our understanding of the pandemic.  In addition, there was a balancing of the risk for individual residents and how that risk would be managed by clinicians in acute hospitals and in long-term care settings.</p></speech>

We are limited in terms of what we can do and how we do it.</p> <p>  Deputy McGuinness queried the appropriateness of inspectors being allocated to certain care institutions and asked whether it should be done on a random basis.  What is Ms Dunnion's view in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.524" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#UU00500"><p>I understand why people might wonder about that.  The issue is that some inspectors may have responsibility for 30 nursing homes, although that rotates over a period and is not a fixed allocation.  As nursing homes and disability centres are scattered throughout the country, sometimes the location determines which inspector can be assigned.</p></speech>

As a social worker, I am usually the one on the receiving end of interrogation by HIQA.  It is nice that, for once, the tables are turned.  Mr. Quinn stated that there is no clinical governance linked to the HSE for private nursing homes.  I ask him to deal with the clinical governance for private nursing homes.  Are there minimum staffing levels, staff-resident ratios and so on?  How are such matters decided?  What clinical governance exists, apart from HIQA enforcing standards?</p></speech>

Obviously, individual residents who may have been referred into gerontology or other forms of services have specific links in that way.  The key issue I outlined in my opening statement is the fact that there is no specific national structure or control in the context of the clinical oversight of the care of people who have been admitted to nursing homes as a result of multidisciplinary or other assessments.  That absence is problematic as matters stand.</p> <p>  On minimum staffing levels, I will defer to Ms Dunnion in her role as chief inspector of social services.  Issues in that regard were raised in the session this morning.</p></speech>

HIQA would very much welcome those regulations being looked at and would be happy to work on and contribute to that discussion.  The regulations are very weak.  It was stated during the session this morning that HIQA does not allow ratio staffing.  That is totally untrue.  The staffing levels are determined by the legal entity, namely, the provider of the nursing home, be it private or statutory.  In a clinical context, staffing levels are not weighted as highly in a nursing home.</p><p>By way of example, the legislation describes "a person in charge of a nursing home", whereas a director of nursing with gerontology would be a much stronger description.  There are significant opportunities to look in that context at staffing and we can see the challenges staffing brought during this pandemic.  </p></speech>

We identify a significant shortage of staff if we see it, but it is totally dependent on the provider.  Statutory nursing homes and private nursing homes will decide their own staffing levels, and I believe the regulations are poor in that context.</p></speech>

A question that is perhaps more relevant for the witnesses from the HSE concerns how infection control is going to change how nursing homes operate.  We are all trying to cope with social distancing, including down to the other side of Leinster House here.  Fewer people are going to be in nursing homes as a result of social distancing.  How will the system cope, on the statutory side in particular, with those changes and that impact?  Is there concern about a reduction in admissions to nursing homes and the knock-on effects?  If that happens, there will be a major loss of income from falling numbers.  How does the HSE see the nursing home sector in general managing to cope with that?  If the private sector is under more pressure, will that in turn put more pressure on statutory and community services?</p></speech>

Deputy Costello is correct that capacity, in any setting, whether acute or long-term care, will be different in future, depending on the premises.  There is an issue, and we need to rethink our model of care to address those issues because there is no short-term way of increasing bed stock or otherwise increasing capacity.  We need to examine the model and see how we make it function in future.  I am sorry, but I think we are out of time on that issue.</p></speech>

There is obvious concern about the lack of HSE clinical oversight of nursing homes.  HIQA has been the regulator for more than a decade now.  After many visits to and engagements with nursing homes, did it at any point write to the Department of Health or the HSE prior to spring 2020 regarding that oversight model?  If so, when was that and what were the details of that correspondence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phelim Quinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#VV00800"><p>In the course of recent years, we have written to the Department of Health on many occasions regarding the regulatory framework and the way that framework impacts on the sector.  One of the key issues, for example, even concerning the advent of Sl&aacute;intecare and planning for a statutory home care scheme, is that we have submitted several regulatory models to the Department of Health.  They try to account for the older persons care pathway to ensure the regulatory framework spans that pathway and is not specific to individual care settings.  I believe issues such as clinical governance could be addressed in that.</p></speech>

There has been engagement with the Department on things such as the statutory home case scheme.  That scheme, however, appears to continue to be in development as a separate scheme.  Our recommendation, however, based on our own experience within the sector, is that there should be more of a regulatory framework that spans the entirety of older persons services. </p></speech>

I want to be clear on whether HIQA has physically visited any of those nursing homes in which there have been outbreaks.  We know the inspectors need to use PPE etc., but have they gone in person to where there have been outbreaks?</p></speech>

Most of what we have done up to this point has been based on information that we have also been exchanging with our colleagues across the four UK jurisdictions and across Europe.  The pattern of inspection that we have engaged in has been very much informed by the engagement that we have had.  My colleague will provide detail for the committee on the types of inspections that we have done to date and on the fact that we have reserved the right to do what we term risk-based inspection throughout the pandemic.</p></speech>

However, that situation is changing because we are moving now into risk-based inspections under the guidelines of the national public health guidance.  As I said, we have conducted a number of inspections since March but these have been, generally speaking, in the context of either opening new centres, changing so that there can be increased capacity if that is feasible and correct in line with the regulations and around contingency planning, particularly in the nursing homes that did not have an outbreak because we identified the risks.  We learned, as did everybody else.  That has been a good exercise with the nursing home providers.  The feedback has been very positive in the context of that.  We begin risk-based inspections now.</p></speech>

In terms of the gerontological expertise within the leadership of HIQA, I understand none of the 15 Covid-19 health technology assessment guidance focuses on older people in nursing homes.

The Deputy mentioned as an example the evidence summaries that have been developed by our health technology assessment directorate.

I made a point earlier that I think is worth repeating, namely, we are viewing all of this in the context of an extremely weak and irresponsible policy context.  If anything, we should learn from this experience that this virus has exposed huge weaknesses in how we provide social care in this country.</p> <p>  I was struck by the comment in Mr. Quinn's opening statement that 80% of nursing homes are operated by private providers and that although they are funded largely through fair deal, the HSE did not know this sector.  It is a damning statement of our national health service that in regard to up to 30,000 very vulnerable patients resident in nursing homes, the HSE did not know this sector and it needed to get information from HIQA.  Mr. Quinn went on to speak about the current model of private residential care having no formal clinical governance links with the HSE, which is really extraordinary.  There is no national clinical oversight of care for what is probably the most vulnerable group of patients in this country.  That is damning.</p> <p>  I have some questions in regard to HIQA's action in this regard.  It is clear HIQA had serious concerns about the lack of clinical oversight for this large number of patients.  What did it do with those concerns?  With whom were they raised?  Apart from commenting on them in reports, with whom did HIQA raise them and on how many occasions did it raise them with the HSE, the Department or Ministers?  What was the reaction when it did so?</p></speech>

This is one of them.  It is quite interesting that, as part of the solution and in the context of the work being done jointly by ourselves and the HSE in the endeavour to support the work of private nursing homes subsequent to the pandemic, we have seen greater co-ordination of care and a greater understanding of where care takes place within the sector.  As already stated, on a number of occasions we have raised issues that we have had regarding the current regulatory framework.  We have written papers and submitted them to the Department, which in the main is the policymaker in this instance.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Quinn for his answer.  My second question relates to infection control.  The authority does many annual inspections in respect of infection control and there are many concerns about that.  At what point did the authority raise concerns about particular nursing homes that had fared poorly in inspections relating to infection control in the context of the virus?</p></speech>

It is not a failure of any one body - Nursing Homes Ireland, HIQA, the HSE or the Department - but at its heart it is a gigantic political failure to act in the interests of our elderly people.  Since the late 1980s we have been privatising the care of the elderly.  It was described by the Ombudsman in a 2010 report as a creeping move towards privatisation that has now become a gallop.  We have a reversal of what we had in the 1980s today, with 80% of nursing homes in the private sector and 20% in the public sector.  There should be no attempt by anybody to say "It is not me, it is them or it is not them, it is me".  All are to blame here.</p> <p>  I point out to the HSE and HIQA that this is very similar to the Ruth Morrissey case in the context of CervicalCheck.  The court was very clear in that instances when it stated that one cannot argue that because a service or care is subcontracted, responsibility can be passed on.  Both HIQA and the HSE accept that patients are referred to private nursing homes.  Responsibility for what has happened here cannot be avoided.</p><p>I have a couple of questions for the HSE.  I understand Mr. Walsh is a member of NPHET.  Is that correct?  We went through the minutes of NPHET, a committee which has been meeting since early January, and the first mention of care of the elderly was in early March.  Can Mr. Walsh tell me when he decided that this was an issue for NPHET?</p></speech>

Despite this being a global phenomenon, it seems to have gone under the radar.</p> <p>  In the first three months of this year, 2,500 people were transferred from acute hospital settings into nursing homes under the fair deal scheme.

My next questions are to HIQA.  In its statement, HIQA said it told the HSE about specific homes.  What specific homes did it warn the HSE about?  Did it warn the HSE about specific homes and what action did the HSE take on foot of that?  The statement also said that HIQA told the HSE where the homes were.  Does that mean HIQA told it where all of the homes all over the country were located?  If it did, did it highlight what particular homes it felt might struggle more than others based on its previous inspections, especially the 18% or so of homes that failed inspections?</p></speech>

The first part of the Deputy's question referred to particular homes.  We dealt with those homes that had made contact with us and were struggling to cope with the virus within those homes.  At that point, we referred specific issues to the HSE for support.</p> <p>  The location of homes gets to the heart of what I said earlier.  The HSE is not necessarily familiar with the entirety of the sector.  We supplied it with information on locations, the numbers of residents and staff etc. in those homes.  </p> <p>  I want to reference the point made by my colleague earlier.  She had provided to the Department a list of high risk homes.</p></speech>

They are possibly for HIQA or the HSE.  Maybe a written answer for one or two of them might suffice.</p> <p>  My first question relates to nursing homes and personal protective equipment availability.  I understand gowns are still a particular issue for several nursing homes.  There also appears to be confusion regarding the use of PPE in certain sections and nursing homes, especially over where and when it should be used.  This is informally coming back from some nursing homes managers.  Have the authorities issued any guidance aside from what came out earlier on in the engagement?</p> <p>  I have a question on staffing, especially in respect of healthcare staff who are deemed vulnerable or at risk.  Again, there appears to be confusion in terms of those who are vulnerable.  They are basically told to isolate at home.  Others who have been exposed to Covid-19 patients are at risk.  Maybe this needs to be clarified nationally to nursing home managers.</p> <p>  I brought up another issue in the D&aacute;il some weeks ago.  It still has not been addressed by the HSE.  Why are senior nurse managers in nursing homes not allowed to take swab tests and present them to the local care setting?  I know in Waterford at present we have been successfully using the University Hospital Waterford south east regional pathology laboratory.  We are turning around swab tests in less than 24 hours.  It seems we have to send out National Ambulance Service personnel to take swabs.  Why are we doing that when we have qualified people in-house to do it?  Maybe someone could answer that.</p> <p>  The HSE has supplied accommodation relief for healthcare workers who are living together.  This was not extended to nursing home personnel.  They have to meet these challenges themselves.  Does either the HSE or HIQA have thoughts on that?</p> <p>  I want to ask HIQA about nursing home inspections.  My understanding is that the authority has been engaged in desktop reviews for quite a period and that authority staff have visited the facilities.  I believe any further reviews should be done by way of desktop review.  We should not have inspectors coming in or transiting in and out of nursing homes unless the authority has a specific concern backed up by a complaint.</p> <p>  In one of the opening statements, a HIQA inspector stated that significant facilities are the point of failure, in other words, the infrastructure on-site.  Has HIQA any plans to support policy to allow some mandating of capital by Government to allow these systems to be rectified?  I presume we are talking about private homes that are not in a fit state and that were never meant for the number of patients they are now carrying.</p> <p>  Is there an opportunity to look at the early de-isolation of patients?  I am referring to those who have proven antibodies.  Surely, we can find a way to recognise these patients and allow them to have access and go back to their family members.</p> <p>  Has HIQA any specific opinion on the failure of the Minister for Health to appoint someone from the nursing home sector to the expert review panel?</p></speech>

Going forward, they will be risk-based inspections where there is a risk to quality or safety.  That is under public health advice.</p><p> We will be very pleased to work with the expert review panel and submit any information that we have and that it requires.

A number of CHOs have put in place training in order that the nursing homes can run that testing.  Part of that is about then being able to get the tests to the relevant laboratories.  A national testing pathway is being put in place through NPHET and the HSE.  That will be available to us in due course in terms of how testing will be upscaled.</p> <p>  The other question the Deputy asked was about the possibility and the role of antibody testing in a nursing home population.  Unfortunately, we have very little evidence that antibody testing will play a huge role, particularly in that population, in residents' ability to mount immune responses, so we cannot say with any assurance that that would be the appropriate way to go.  We are, however, with HIQA and others, very conscious of the role of visits, which a number of Deputies have highlighted, so that guidance is being reviewed and will go through NPHET - I hope on Thursday, as mentioned - in order that we will be able to start opening up visiting in our nursing homes again.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions, starting with HIQA.  I understand that for new builds of nursing homes and community hospitals, 80% of resident accommodation must consist of single rooms and there must be no more than four residents per multi-occupancy bedroom.

We feel very strongly about it and have taken many regulatory decisions based on the amount of space available for each resident.  This has been challenged by providers, and the statutory instrument allows them that opportunity until January 2021.  We believe, however, that it is very important, not only for infection control but for residents' rights to personal possessions and freedom of space, to be able to have visitors and that privacy.  We see that as an essential component of a person's life in a nursing home.</p></speech>

I will just quote from some of the report and I will not mention the hospital.  The report states:</p> <blockquote> 	- The use of multi-occupancy rooms for up to seven residents did not support the receipt of personal care and communication in a manner that protected privacy and dignity.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />One resident had complained that sharing a five bedded room with one en-suite bathroom was difficult.  Residents in a six bedded room had taken over the bed spaces of vacant beds to store some of their personal items as they did not have enough space by their own beds. </blockquote> <p>Why were these community hospitals not brought up to standard?  I have spoken to the staff in this hospital.  The stress they have been working under has been phenomenal.</p><p>They have been let down by the Government, the HSE and someone here because the standards should have been complied with in 2016, as with other community hospitals.  They were not complied with, though, which has sadly led to Covid deaths.  I am not saying that this is the specific reason, but it very much looks from HIQA's report like there was an issue and standards were not met.  They still have not been met and it has cost lives.  Why were the standards not applied across these hospitals by the first deadline of 2016?</p></speech>

That would be quite an exercise.  In the first instance, our rationale for providing the list for what we believed were centres that were more at risk was to enable a swifter response from the support services.</p></speech>

We are all clear that the overall increase in demand for PPE required us to prioritise the distribution of same to those premises that were affected by either suspected or confirmed outbreaks.  To date, the HSE has supplied in or around &euro;27 million worth of PPE to private nursing homes since the beginning of March.</p></speech>

The protocols that are in place and that have been developed in conjunction with colleagues in public health and infection prevention control speak to the role of testing in the specific patient scenarios.  The Deputy has to remember that in early March we were still in a situation where many of our hospitals did not have Covid-19 and many of the people who were being transferred out would not have had any exposure to Covid-19.  In those instances, it was appropriate not to test patients but all transfers were given a caveat that where there were any suspected symptoms, patients were not to be transferred and they were to be tested first.  In addition, all facilities were to have appropriate isolation facilities to be able to manage and monitor patients with appropriate precautions from an infection control point of view for a 14-day period when that transfer was made.</p></speech>

One of the things that is important to highlight in terms of some of the response is that we were also beginning to learn that presentations of Covid-19 in older people were quite atypical.  They did not fit the case definition that would have been put out in terms of cough, fever and shortness of breath-----</p></speech>

The guests from Nursing Homes Ireland told us in the earlier session that it was looking at international experience.  Was it the case that Nursing Homes Ireland was way ahead of where the HSE was?  It wanted the testing because it was looking at asymptomatic patients.  The HSE refused that point blank time and again.  It was looking for PPE that was not coming.  Most importantly, it instigated visitor restrictions that NPHET - including members from the HSE - overturned.  Was it not the case that Nursing Homes Ireland was ahead, that the HSE and the Department of Health were unfortunately behind the curve with the restrictions and supports that were needed and that as a result of this virus, we have unfortunately seen a huge loss of life within these settings?</p></speech>

We had a number of incidents and deaths in a number of facilities like Portlaoise, Phoenix Park and the community hospital in west Cork.  I have spoken to people who worked in those facilities.  For instance, I know that there were no changing facilities for staff in some of those facilities and there were six patients per ward.  Surely these facilities were identified as high risk at a very early stage.  What action was taken to deal with the situation when they were identified as high risk?</p></speech>

There have been 76 outbreaks in mental health facilities as well as a very significant number in older persons and disability settings.  Without prejudice to the numbers that HIQA may provide afterwards, there were 90 premises on the HSE older persons side that required either full replacement or remedial works to meet the standard around the maximum of four to a room.  The infection control guidance and advice that applies to every setting applied to each of those premises as well.  As part of the area crisis management team process, each CHO was required to implement those measures right across those settings.</p></speech>

In fact, as part of the capital programme, there is a very significant amount of pretty serious capital work yet to be done before the overall standard is met.  Certainly, services worked within the limitations of their physical infrastructure to meet the standards and implement the infection control guidance with assistance from local departments of public health and from their consultant colleagues from hospitals.</p></speech>

It seems clear given the scale of clusters, outbreaks and fatalities in nursing homes that opportunities were missed to support the nursing homes and prevent contagion into them.  Various vectors into the nursing homes have been discussed today, including staff being discharged from hospitals, for example.  I believe one of the reasons is that nursing homes and older people have had no voice in the room where the decisions are being taken, which is the National Public Health Emergency Team.  I have put this to the Minister for Health repeatedly in the D&aacute;il and he has repeatedly told me that nursing homes do have a voice and HIQA is their voice.  The Minister's formal position is that HIQA is the voice of nursing homes on NPHET.  We have a limited number of minutes from NPHET meetings but on 30 January, the second meeting, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  On 4 February, the third meeting, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  At the fourth meeting on 11 February, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  At the fifth meeting on 18 February, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  On the eighth meeting on 25 February, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  At the ninth meeting on 3 March, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  At the 12th meeting, on 10 March, HIQA was present and nursing homes were discussed.  The action that was agreed was that the unilateral restriction of visiting to nursing homes was not required at that time.  At the same meeting, NPHET agreed that we needed to look seriously at closing all of the schools in the country because the outbreak had become so severe.  Within 36 hours, it made that recommendation and the Taoiseach implemented it two and a half days later.  If HIQA has been the voice of nursing homes on NPHET, and given that it has clearly been at all of the meetings, why did it never raise the crisis that was emerging in nursing homes?  When the crisis was finally raised, why did HIQA stand over a decision that visitor restrictions were unnecessary which the nursing homes had put in place themselves because they were aware that there was a crisis?</p></speech>

There was no specific reference at that point to HIQA being the voice of nursing homes.  HIQA is an organisation with a very wide remit.  It has a remit for the regulation of health and social care services in Ireland, which includes our healthcare services, adult social care services, children's services, health technology assessment and standards development.  It was from that perspective that it was my understanding that HIQA was being invited onto NPHET.  I would appreciate that there has not been reference within the minutes in respect of nursing homes.  However, I am also aware that on 4 March there was a specific sub-group of NPHET set up to look at vulnerable people, which would have included the nursing home sector.  Colleagues from HIQA were at that point nominated onto that group.  I believe it is from that point as well that HIQA played a very significant role in providing information, data and a number of other sources that dealt with the way in which we were looking at nursing homes, perceiving the problems within the nursing home sector and also how we at that point started to support that sector.</p></speech>

The only people on the National Public Health Emergency Team are civil servants from the Department of Health, HSE officials, a few virologists and HIQA.  HIQA representatives were the only people in the room at all of those meetings who had any understanding of what was going on in nursing homes.  Why did it take so long to raise the issues?  When it was raised on 10 March why did HIQA stand over a decision not only not to protect the nursing homes but to open them up again?</p></speech>

We in HIQA are not public health experts and we followed and accepted the public health advice at that particular time.  I appreciate the public health advice changed two days later when the disease profile also started to escalate in the country.  At that point, NPHET decided to restrict visiting.</p></speech>

Mistakes are made in a time of crisis.  The most important role of the committee and all of the stakeholders is that we learn to be better prepared in case we have a second wave, which is highly probable.  In his opening statement this morning, Mr. Daly of Nursing Homes Ireland referred to aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff initially by the HSE.  Is it true that the HSE actively head hunted staff from nursing homes?  Was this not unfair and counter-productive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.691" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#GGG00600"><p>I discussed with Mr. Tadhg Daly, I cannot remember the exact dates but early in the process, the issue of recruitment.  I assured him of a couple of things.  The first was that the national director of human resources wrote to each CHO and hospital group asking them not to recruit actively from the private nursing home sector.  The second was regarding the Be On Call For Ireland panel.  The national director of human resources made it clear within the HSE that nobody working in a healthcare setting in the country, including in private nursing homes, should be recruited through that process but that it should be used to bring in new people.</p></speech>

I know the HSE cannot prevent a staff member moving to another job but at this time of an unprecedented pandemic it had a huge effect on the ability of nursing homes to be properly staffed during the peak of the crisis.</p></speech>

I know there have been a couple of cases where people did move, and that is regrettable, but in the main private nursing homes are not a target for recruitment by the HSE.  Obviously there are people on panels, and Mr. Daly said so this morning, and there is movement between the sectors at all times, but certainly the message I have given out, as has the national director for human resources, is that we do not want to undermine in any way the provision of healthcare in any other part of the system.</p></speech>

With regard to the staffing issue, it is not in anybody's interest for one sector to deprive another sector of staffing.  Clearly, there are going to be major issues to be addressed as a result of this in terms of governance and resilience in general within the private nursing home sector, in particular a need for them to reflect on their own staffing issues and possibly the issues that arise in terms of short-term contracts and the security they themselves can give to those staff.</p> <p>  To move on to the Deputy's question with regard to the transfers, again, the big learning has been around the fact that asymptomatic transmission was not a feature of WHO or ECDC guidance until 18 March and the guidance we had been issuing around the end of February and in early March did not reflect that.  In fact, if we look at the WHO guidance, it indicated &ldquo;possible&rdquo; asymptomatic transmission, so everybody was still rigorously applying a case definition that was based on people having symptoms.  When these patients were moved, they were not tested on the basis they did not have symptoms.</p> <p>  The other key piece was that if staff coming in from the community to work in these care settings did not have symptoms, they were not being tested either.  We have learned a lot from the mass testing exercise in that regard.  Clearly, the guidance we will be issuing to revisit that will look substantially different on the basis of the learning we have had in terms of that testing piece.</p> <p>  I would like to reiterate it is not the case that testing gives a definitive result where Covid is concerned.  People can be Covid-negative today and Covid-positive tomorrow.  That is the nature of the condition itself, particularly in the pre-symptomatic phase.  It is also the case that we know that about 20% of patients who test as negative or not detected for Covid may actually develop symptoms in the following 14-day period.  For that reason, all of these transfers were advised to be isolated and monitored for a 14-day period because these are our best safeguards. </p></speech>

Does Dr. Kennelly accept that this non-testing, even after 18 March, would have contributed to higher mortality in nursing homes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.699" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#HHH00500"><p>It is very hard to say that, with all due respect.  We have looked at the international evidence.  The first published report that really reflected the high prevalence of asymptomatic transmission, particularly in congregated settings, was on 27 March in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.  That is how quickly things have been evolving in this pandemic.  We know we had testing of asymptomatic residents in our mass testing exercise, which took place on 14 April.  It is very difficult to say because we do not know what the mortality looks like in terms of patients who have tested positive but who were asymptomatic.  Clearly, we are going to have to look at the staff testing protocols, how that is to be done on a regular basis and how that situation gets managed from here.  That is what the national testing strategy is going to inform in the coming weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.700" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#HHH00600"><p>At the outset, I want to convey my sympathies to the families of all those who have passed away in the nursing home setting at this time, and to acknowledge the trauma for families and, equally, for nursing home staff.</p> <p>  The focus today is very much on Covid-19 and how that has hit the nursing homes but, in the interests of balance, it is important to acknowledge that many nursing homes remained free of Covid.  Equally, with regard to the nursing homes that were hit by Covid-19, it was not just peculiar or particular to nursing homes and it is what we are living with currently.  There needs to be balance in the whole discussion.</p> <p>  Deputy Butler put it superbly when she acknowledged that in any crisis situation, the measure will be what we learn from it.  In that respect, I would like to point to the fact there was quite an amount of confusion and lack of clarity at the outset as to how things were operating within the nursing homes.  Nursing homes were told that patients were to remain in nursing homes and not be transferred to hospitals yet, at the same time, patients were being discharged from hospitals and brought to nursing home settings without testing.  All of that confusion did not help the situation.</p><p>Equally, it is my understanding that on 14 April the HSE informed HIQA that due to difficulties in sourcing PPE it would not be possible to provide the three day baseline for PPE, as promised, and PPE would be directed to those areas termed greatest risk.  On that particular date, 14 April, the number of clusters in nursing homes had risen to 158.  There was a litany of confusion and lack of clarity but going forward, and I have discussed this with a number of nursing homes in my own constituency, is there an ongoing commitment from the HSE to provide PPE or is there a cut-off date?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.702" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#JJJ00200"><p>The HSE is committed to providing PPE and as the CEO said, probably at this committee last week, we are looking at a probable total commitment over a 12 month period of in excess of &euro;1 billion across all sectors.  To date across private nursing homes, the HSE has provided in or around &euro;27 million worth of PPE and millions of items.  At this time there is no suggestion whatsoever that is going to cease.  If anything, as more need is identified, it is met.  That being said, in discussions with Nursing Homes Ireland we have encouraged it to continue to explore its own sources because more is better.  Until such time as we can not only meet demand but begin to accumulate stock to provide a buffer, I do not think any of us will be satisfied on the overall position regarding PPE.</p></speech>

A point raised with me by a number of nursing homes is the current position where if a patient has to be transferred to a hospital for a minor procedure - it may well be an X-ray, a cardiac issue or a pacemaker or a defibrillator check - on return to the nursing home, even though he or she might have only been on the hospital campus for an hour or two, he or she is expected to go into 14 day isolation.  That adds considerable trauma for the individual, families, and the nursing home.  Nursing homes are now making the decision on what is most urgent so that people might or might not attend hospital.  Is there a better way of doing things going forward?  Is it possible services may be made available at nursing home sites rather than people having to go to hospital?  Is there an opportunity for learning there?</p></speech>

As somebody who has been working in the sector for a number of years, I am well aware of how people are trying to balance those risks.  We are trying to issue guidance on what care can be delivered, when, and by whom in as responsive a way as possible.  It is important to reiterate that.</p> <p>  On those short-term visits the Deputy is talking about, the feeling is that anything that can be done in a short period does not require isolation afterwards.  Again, it is important that people understand the role that asymptomatic transmission and the potential for asymptomatic transmission play in this.  Clearly, people who need overnight or more prolonged stays will require isolation on transfer back.  That will all be addressed.  It is important to note everything that is happening is being monitored on a close basis by our colleagues.  Massive issues have been highlighted by the Deputy's colleagues with regard to the discussion around governance and resilience, and how they are going to be managed out in terms of the ongoing risk of transmission and ongoing risk to nursing homes.  As a clinician, I am alive to it, as are most people here, and unless there is a systemic address of some of the issues that have been highlighted throughout the discussion they will continue to pose a challenge.</p></speech>

When we started large-scale testing in nursing homes turnaround times were not where they needed to be.  That has improved week on week, and there is still some improvement to be got.  The GP referrals are now working very well.  We need the same turnaround for nursing home testing and any employment-related testing.</p></speech>

The witnesses from HIQA spoke about national clinical oversight.  The Care Quality Commission, CQC, HIQA's equivalent in the United Kingdom, required that a clinical lead be identified by each care facility by 15 May because the situation in the UK at the time was the same as the situation still is here, wherein a number of different GPs were going in and out of care facilities treating different patients without clinical oversight in the care institution.  Is that something HIQA would like to see happen here and, if so, would it require legislative change?  I ask that question given the committee's remit.</p></speech>

An expert group has been brought together by the Minister and we are waiting to see what its interim arrangements will be.  There is a longer-term issue around policy on the care of older people and the alternative pathways that might be there for them.  That issue is really worthy of exploration.  It would be timely for the legislation and regulations to be reviewed and considered by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this is not ideal and it is certainly not suitable in these times.  Beyond that, however, there are patients who do not want to be in single rooms.  I appreciate that it may not be possible to facilitate that now but hopefully it will be possible at some point after we return to normality.  I expect there will be patients, including one person who was very close to me until earlier this year, who are adamant that they do not want to share a room and be isolated.  I wondered if HIQA, in laying out standards, considers this.  People should not be forced to share a room but perhaps they should be able to do so.  Does HIQA have a view on that?</p></speech>

We view a nursing home as somebody's home.  The residents have made a decision to live there and, as a consequence, it is important that it is designed to meet their requirements.  To address the Chairman's point, the important question is what will be the future of the sector.  There are many different types of steps which would be really important.  One step would be to recognise that some residents do not require the same level of care as others and that, therefore, there would be different types of facilities.  We are more than delighted to share a paper we have done that looks at the regulation of services as opposed to the premises, which is all about rooms, facilities and so on.</p></speech>

We need to be wary of that.  Those who test positive are isolated for 14 days if they are in hospital or in a care facility.  Are they tested again at the end of the 14-day period?</p></speech>

One of the issues that we have come to understand in the course of this is that some patients who have been hospitalised have been persistently testing positive beyond the 14 days.  What we understand better now than might have been the case even some weeks ago is that the positive status one gets at 14 days probably has very little of what we would call active virus in it, so the potential for infectivity is low.</p><p>The guidance has been amended to say that if one tests positive at the end of the 14-day period, one is recommended for a further isolation period of seven days.  There is no further testing after that period.  That came through the national expert advisory group on Covid-19 that meets on a frequent basis to assess this evidence as it comes through.  On people who want to transfer and who may have been positive at the end of the 14-day period, they are still safe to transfer as long as they can be accommodated in single room accommodation for that seven-day period.  We believe the risk of transmission to be very low at that point.</p></speech>

I am not a virologist or an infectious disease expert and some of these questions might be better directed to such an expert but essentially patients knowing when they may or may not have had symptoms will influence when we might know when the 14-day period started.  In general, it is taken from the date of the first test result that is positive.  In the absence of symptoms, the 14-day period is completed from then on.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Oonagh Buckley, deputy Secretary General, civil justice and equality, Mr. Michael Kirrane, assistant secretary and head of immigration service delivery, and Mr. Mark Wilson, principal officer, international protection accommodation services.  We are also joined by the following representatives from the HSE: Ms Siobhan McArdle, head of operations, primary care; Dr. Kevin Kelleher, assistant national director, strategic planning and transformation, public health and child health; and Mr. T.J. Dunford, head of service, primary care operations.</p><p>I advise our guests that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I invite Ms Buckley to make her opening remarks.  I remind members that they will have five to ten minutes for questions and responses from the witnesses.  I ask Ms Buckley to keep her opening remarks to five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.727" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#RRR00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman and the committee for inviting us to participate in this session to specifically look at how the Department, operating alongside relevant officials from the HSE, has worked to reduce the risk to residents in our centres and address any instance of infection that occurred.  As committee members will be aware, the Department has been working to try to address the weaknesses in how we accommodate and provide services to applicants for international protection, while at the same time trying to manage a significant increase in the number applying for protection and seeking accommodation. In addition, fewer people with permission to be in the State have left our centres due to problems with sourcing housing in the wider community.</p><p>Consequently, we have been reliant on centres that have been working at almost 100% capacity for the last couple of years, augmented by a series of hotels and bed and breakfasts which provided emergency accommodation.  Some of that accommodation consisted of rooms in hotels that continued with their normal commercial business.<br/><br/>When faced with the pandemic, and conscious of the heightened challenges all congregated settings have in that context, particularly centres like ours where people leave every day to work, study and engage with the local community, our key priority was, and continues to be, to ensure the safety and well-being of our residents, centre staff and the wider communities in which they live and work.  This has motivated every action we have taken during the pandemic.<br/><br/>Our centres are following the guidelines prepared by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, for residential settings with vulnerable residents.  I acknowledge the support the HSE has provided to us, in particular its national social inclusion office.  Working together, we continue to develop the appropriate policies and responses for the benefit of our residents.<br/><br/>Congregated or residential settings pose specific challenges during this pandemic, but this is not unique to direct provision settings.  Shared accommodation is common in homeless and disability services, student accommodation and private rented accommodation.  Given that reality, the HSE&rsquo;s advice on all congregated settings is that during the Covid-19 crisis, non-family members sharing a room in centres are considered to be a household.  This means they should implement social distancing measures from other households, that is, residents in other rooms, and they should self-isolate if they are displaying symptoms or if directed to do so by the HSE.<br/><br/>One of our first objectives was to work to cocoon our most vulnerable residents.  The Department could readily identify older residents and, in fact, we worked to put in place solutions for residents over the age of 65, rather than 70.  As we do not hold medical information about our residents, those considered especially vulnerable to this virus on medical grounds and identified to us by the HSE have also been cocooned for their protection.<br/><br/>We then sought to address issues around providing isolation facilities, given the inevitability that in a pandemic our residents, interacting as they do daily with the communities around them, might contract the virus.  We therefore required facilities for self-isolation, both on-site and off-site.  Centre managers were instructed to provide up to three rooms on-site.  Given the occupancy pressures in the centres, there was also a need for off-site facilities where residents could be cared for until it was safe for them to return to their centre.  We identified four suitable premises in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dundalk, with capacity for 299 people and, in conjunction with local HSE officials, put in place the necessary supports for isolating residents.  Each of these facilities has a non-profit organisation on-site providing psychosocial supports to residents and being supported by HSE healthcare professionals.<br/><br/>We also knew we had to reduce the density of residents living in our centres.  In recent months, therefore, we have procured more than 1,550 permanent and temporary new direct provision beds.  We relocated more than 600 of our residents, about 7% of our total population, in the period from mid-March to early April to support social and physical distancing in centres and enable cocooning measures to be put in place for the most vulnerable.  This, I know, has caused no little controversy as we moved residents with much less notice than normal, and with fewer of the interactions with local communities that have become part of better engagement with communities as we try to work to ensure decent accommodation for our residents.  By doing this, we have brought the maximum occupancy in any room to not more than three single people in any centre.  In addition, we limited the numbers of single persons sharing a room to two for the new locations we have opened in response to the pandemic.<br/><br/>We have worked hard to try to ensure that residents in our centres, and the management and staff, have the tools and knowledge to help prevent outbreaks or reduce their impacts if they occur.  Residents in all centres have been made aware of the need to practise social and physical distancing, good hand hygiene, coughing and sneezing etiquette, etc.  Translations of public health advice have been provided to all centres and we are communicating with residents and centre managers via regular newsletters, which are also available on our website <i>.</i>The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres.  Visitors have not been permitted in our centres since 19 March.  I thank the managers and staff of those centres who, given the needs of the pandemic, have continued to act and perform types of work they never thought they would be asked to do.  They are front-line workers of another type and I thank them.<br/><br/>To help residents with their personal needs for support, a telephone support service for residents, run by the Jesuit Refugee Service, has recently been launched and Department officials have also begun virtual clinics to engage more directly with residents.</p><p>Managers have been asked to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas.  A regular supply of hand sanitiser is provided by the Department and distributed by it.  Other PPE is also distributed as required and in line with HPSC guidelines on its appropriate use in residential settings.  Centre managers have put in place measures to stagger meal times and visits to communal laundries and so on.  Where a person is symptomatic and awaiting test results, additional protocols are applied, including around meals and cleaning.</p><p> In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, we have put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre management and their staff.  It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present, relating to the implementation of Covid-19 guidelines and measures.</p><p> Committee members will be aware of the efforts the Ministers for Justice and Equality, most recently the Minister, Deputy Flanagan and Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, have made over recent years to try to improve the direct provision system, in particular driven by and building on the recommendations made by Mr. Justice McMahon in his report in 2015.  At this stage, approximately one quarter of residents have own-door accommodation and approximately half have access to kitchens and food shops so they can live and cook independently.  Thousands have access to the labour market.  Dozens of our residents are also acting as carers at this time.</p><p> New national standards for accommodation providers were published last August and are due to come into force at the beginning of next year.  While the process of reform has increased, the Ministers and the officials of the Department here today fully acknowledge that further improvements are required and will continue to act to try to achieve this.  An expert group chaired by Dr. Catherine Day is establishing best practice in other European states in the provision of services, including accommodation to international protection applicants, and it is looking at longer term trends and solutions.  An interdepartmental group was established to ensure that all Departments are proactively delivering on their responsibilities to international protection applicants and the short-to-medium term options which could be implemented to improve the system.  Its report is ready to be submitted to a new Government.  Despite the crisis conditions imposed by the pandemic, the work of these two groups is advancing at pace.</p><p> My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

Equally, there is much that could and should have been done better, which, when not done as it should be in terms of best practice, can have a catastrophic impact.  I wish to raise this afternoon the catastrophic impact on the lives and quality of life of the residents of the Skellig Star centre and the wider community of Cahersiveen due largely to what I would regard as very poor practice.  It is my intention to proceed by posing three short questions.  I would appreciate it if those questions could be answered, following which I will continue my line of questioning.</p> <p>  I seek clarification on the following questions.  First, did the HSE, as suggested by the Minister for Justice and Equality, fail to inform the Department of Justice and Equality of a positive diagnosis of Covid-19 at the Dublin hotel accommodation base of a large group of asylum seekers?  A yes or no answer will suffice.  Second, knowing of the positive Covid-19 case, why did the HSE not authorise testing of the group before they were sent to Kerry?  Third, will the representatives present explain who made the decision to overrule the legitimate concerns and misgivings of HSE Cork-Kerry about moving a large group of people during a pandemic to a place which Cork-Kerry HSE deemed to be utterly inappropriate given its poor services of primary care available in the area?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kevin Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#TTT00500"><p>When instances happen, wherever they happen around a case being identified, the individual case is spoken to as to who would likely be their contacts.</p><p>That is what happens in these circumstances.  It is my understanding that the first case arose approximately 12 to 14 days after the person involved was moved.  It is unlikely that was as a consequence of what happened in the hotel.  Even so, as a consequence of the investigations carried out by the public health people in the hotel, there was no need to speak to people outside the group that was concerned because of the way they lived together at that time.</p></speech>

The testing programme for Covid-19 towards the end of March related to people who presented with symptoms of the virus.  At that point, people were advised to contact their GPs.  They continue to be advised to do so and their GPs will discuss their clinical symptoms and refer them for a Covid-19 test.  With regarding to mass testing, which is a proposal in this instance, I will pass the question to Dr. Kelleher as it is a public health query.</p></speech>

That is what happened.  At that point, the totally appropriate decision in the circumstances was made.</p></speech>

Equally, I am still not clear who overruled the HSE in Cork and Kerry and its misgivings.  I will move on, however.</p> <p>  I note from the submission by the HSE head of primary care that the HSE is of the view that the first case of suspected Covid-19 in the Skellig Star occurred on 30 March.  That date puzzles me because I have verifiable evidence of a written communication from the Skellig Star to the Department of Justice and Equality on 24 March confirming a suspected case of Covid-19.  The resident concerned was placed in isolation on 20 March, one day after arrival in Cahersiveen.  Two points arise.  If the Department of Justice and Equality knew of a suspected case on 24 March, why was the HSE not aware of it until 30 March, almost a week later?  The timeline might not be of importance to either the HSE or the Department of Justice and Equality but it is very important to the residents of the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen.  This timeline confirms unequivocally that Covid-19 was transported by bus on 18 March and 19 March to the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen.  I say this without apportioning any blame whatsoever to the residents of the Skellig Star.  Rather, I apportion absolute culpability to the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality for not conducting the necessary Covid-19 testing prior to those people leaving Dublin.  To my mind, at the very least this was a grave oversight and at worst an unequivocal dereliction of duty of care to all concerned.</p> <p>  I also raise a point concerning oversight of the Skellig Star as it currently operates.  As has been made clear in previous discussions, the HSE has indicated that it advises, recommends or suggests appropriate public health measures but that it is up to the operator to implement those recommendations.  The Department of Justice and Equality has delegated operations on the ground to a private operator in return, no doubt, for a substantial fee.  The key question I wish to pose is who, among the organisations whose representations are assembled here, including the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality, has oversight of what the operator is doing on the ground?  Is it the HSE, the Department of Justice and Equality or neither body?</p> <p>  Are the witnesses aware the operator did not appear at the Skellig Star until 26 March, eight days after residents first arrived?  Is that oversight?  Untrained staff were left in charge, resulting in chaotic scenes when residents arrived on 18 March.  There was no social distancing, no beds were available and sufficient rooms had not been prepared.  I could raise a number of specific points regarding daily oversight at the Skellig Star but time does not allow.  I will, therefore, mention just one.</p><p>Are the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE aware that no professional deep cleansing of the Skellig Star has ever taken place, from 18 March to this very day, 26 May?  That is despite 25 confirmed cases of Covid-19.  How is it being cleaned?  I will tell the committee how it is being cleaned.  Mr. Price Stardrops, a white vinegar spray Mr. Price advertises as being cheaper than all the rest at &euro;1.49 a bottle, is what is being using throughout this entire pandemic to clean and disinfect the Skellig Star Hotel.  Is that best practice?  Is that acceptable?  Is that good enough, given that there have been 25 positive cases in the Skellig Star?</p><p> I have asked for an independent inspection of the Skellig Star building.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, refused on the grounds of the health and safety of workers carrying out the inspections.  Yet, the HSA can investigate more than 400 meat plants and construction sites can be investigated for proper adherence to social distancing measures.  The quality of life and health and welfare of the residents living 24-7 in an infected and unsuitable building cannot be provided for, yet all these other inspections can take place.  It is utterly shambolic and unacceptable.  I ask the Department to do the honourable thing, that is, carry out inspections and close the building.  I would appreciate any answers in the time that is left.</p></speech>

That is the first report we have been able to find, but if Deputy Foley has verifiable evidence of something earlier, she should please share it with us and we can then check our systems.</p> <p>  We have to go by HSE advice on testing and our colleagues from the HSE have already explained the protocols around testing.  As to the view of Deputy Foley that there is culpability around a lack of testing, I cannot concur with that because there are protocols around how testing should happen.</p> <p>  With regard to oversight of the service provider, the Department of Justice and Equality is the responsible Department for direct provision centres.  They are our residents and are people for whom we have the ultimate responsibility.  Normally we would have a protocol of three unannounced inspections of every centre every year.  That is what we aim for.  It has been difficult to achieve given the number of centres we are now running.  In the context of the pandemic, we have to consider our staff and their health and safety.</p> <p>  As it happens, the Deputy may not be aware that a member of staff was present on the night the centre was opened.  In fact, she stayed in the centre to see that everything was right.  The Deputy will be aware that there were a number of teething problems as the centre opened because it was opened quickly and there was no time to spend four to six weeks, which is the norm, making sure everything was working correctly.  The staff member who stayed made sure that the centre was as proposed, that people settled into it, that heating was provided in each room because, as the Deputy knows, the boiler had problems in the intervening period, and that the necessary arrangements were in place for the centre.</p> <p>  I understand what the Deputy is saying about the centre's staff who almost certainly came from a previous employer, as is the law.  We also encourage centre managers to employ locally because that provides good jobs to communities.  We have been very consistent.  We opened the centre much faster than normal.  We did not have the time to do what we normally do in these circumstances.  The centre manager did not have the time.  We have been in daily contact with the centre manager over the past six to eight weeks.  I speak to the Minister every day about the Skellig Star in Cahersiveen.  We have regular interactions with the staff and are constantly looking at what they are doing.  We are happy that the centre is now being run very effectively and well.  There are good facilities in the centre and we are happy it is working well for the residents that remain in the centre at this time.</p></speech>

I will address the first question to Ms Buckley.  Ms Buckley mentioned the national standards published in August of last year.  One of the first themes in the national standards relates to how there must be a responsive workforce and how recruitment of staff should be able to deliver safe and effective services for both children and adults.  Ms Buckley mentioned that the 15 staff in the centre had to learn new skills.  Had any of them any experience whatsoever in working in a direct provision centre beforehand?  Had any of them partaken of the Tusla course?  Had any of them even been Garda vetted?  Is it true that two of the managers actually left in the first four weeks after the centre opened on 19 March?</p></speech>

I want to come back to the question of the timeframe for that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the opening sessions.  There was some change in the management.  I believe one person resigned in the first week or so.  The centre manager in place now is a very experienced centre manager who ran a direct provision centre for many years.  Considerable experience has been put into the direct provision at this point.</p> <p>  Now I will come back to the Garda vetting.  It was brought to our attention on Wednesday last that there may have been staff on site who had not been Garda vetted.  We immediately reached out to the Garda vetting unit.  The unit indicated to us that there were concerns about the way in which the Garda vetting had been done and the fact that there were some staff on site who had not been Garda vetted.  This is a very serious thing.  It is obviously the employer's obligation to ensure Garda vetting is done.  It is also part of our governance structures and we have to ensure that it is done.  I can now say that, with the co-operation of the Garda vetting unit, all staff who need to be Garda vetted have been Garda vetted as of Monday.  However, it was an unacceptable thing that happened and it was something that-----</p></speech>

That includes in respect of the accommodation provided.  Under the theme of national standards, which Ms Buckley also mentioned, the document states that the planning and design of accommodation should be informed by the needs of residents.  This includes the need for own-door accommodation and accommodation which is homely, accessible and furnished.  Moreover, privacy, dignity and safety should be protected and promoted.  Is it not the case that none of the rooms provided were own-door?  There was no own-door accommodation.  The rooms in the former hotel did not even have a kettle.  Sharing of bedrooms had to be undertaken by approximately 60 of the residents who went there first.  Social distancing in this hotel was completely absent because the residents had to share the laundry, lifts, corridors and dining facilities.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

They come into force on 1 January next year, as I said.  They are standards that we will be working actively to go towards.  It would be very much our preference that, instead of having one quarter of our residents in own-door accommodation, we would have 100% of our residents in own-door accommodation.  We are quite a long way from that as of yet, and in those circumstances people have to share facilities.  They have to share laundries and bathrooms in many cases.  Many of our single residents have to share with strangers.  That is the state of play and it was the state of play when we opened the Skellig Star Hotel.  The same standards that would apply in many of our centres apply in the Skellig Star.</p></speech>

The report also stated that there should be specialised training for staff on residents who may have suffered trauma, sexual abuse or domestic abuse in the past.  Was any of this taken into account by the person who went down to look at this premises in September of last year?</p></speech>

With respect, we have to go with what is offered to us under the current model of acquisition and procurement of accommodation for direct provision.  As I keep repeating, we are not happy with the current model and we would like to move away from it but we are not there yet.</p></speech>

If we had filled the Skellig Star to its maximum capacity against our standards, it could have accommodated between 150 and 160 people.  We never put that many people down there.  I think that at the maximum the number of people was 103.</p></speech>

That is about the size of a double bed.  Is that standard, referred to in the publication which came out last August, still the one the Department will use into the future?</p></speech>

The new standards, when they come into force next year, will be higher.  In the meantime, we have taken the voluntary decision to reduce the number of people we have sharing any room, regardless of size, to a maximum of three.  In fact, in many of our centres we now have a maximum of two strangers sharing a room.  Obviously, family units continue to share.</p></speech>

That would have been own-door accommodation.  Two of the cottages were actually offered for free.  In an effort to take some families out of the Skellig Star, an offer was made.  That was turned down by the Department.  Is that correct and, if so, could Ms Buckley indicate why it was turned down?</p></speech>

We had a number of reasons for that, but one of the principal reasons is that direct provision is not just a bed for the night.  A lot of services, a lot of food and a lot of other issues have to be provided.  We are very pleased that somebody was willing to offer us accommodation.  We would much prefer if people offered us accommodation that we could rent under the HAP system and if we could move our nearest 1,000 people with permission to remain into that accommodation.  If that gentleman were willing to rent us his accommodation on a HAP basis, we would be very happy to try to see whether we could accommodate some of the people with permission to remain in the State who need housing.  We would be very keen to get them out of their current accommodation.  If we could move those 1,000 people into the wider community, we would then be in a position to stop our use of so much emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

Did any further inspection take place between September and March, after the initial inspection?  When exactly was the decision made to move to Cahersiveen and who made it?  What criteria were used?  Who decided which people to pick?  There is a feeling in Cahersiveen that women and families were brought down there just to appease the local residents in case they had any fears that there would be single men in the area.

While we had residents who were staying in the same accommodation as people travelling from abroad, we felt that was our biggest risk.</p><p>We needed to concentrate all of our residents in centres where we were the sole occupant and could apply a greater degree of control over people coming in and out of the centres.

The decision was taken the previous week that we would have to move people.  Having signed the contract on 16 March, we moved the first residents on 18 March.  When I say that happened much more quickly than normal, I am not exaggerating.  As the committee knows, we would normally take some weeks to engage with the local community and we would probably be able to shape the residents that needed to travel and so forth.  In this case, however, we had to move populations from five different locations, four of which were in Dublin, to a number of areas.  Cahersiveen was only one.</p></speech>

It would be uncommon for there not to be an outbreak once there was a case and we would know about it.  The number mentioned relates explicitly to the 14 outbreaks.  I doubt if there are many more than that, but I cannot say explicitly because of the way the information comes.  In particular, it would be difficult to say in respect of people living in some of the other accommodation that Ms Buckley mentioned and that would not be as easily identifiable to us as direct provision services.

There are a number of interesting findings.  Some 83% of respondents said that they did not have access to information about the pandemic.  I appreciate in certain circumstances that there would be language issues or other communication barriers.  I note from Ms Buckley's comments the level of effort that she has put in to communicating about the pandemic.

Can Ms Buckley give some information on the particular efforts she has made in communicating the public health advice to people in these environments, please?</p></speech>

From the get-go we knew that communicating with centre managers and the centre residents was going to be one of the biggest challenges we would have.  We established a new team drawn from staff across the Department who volunteered for this work, and set up a system where firstly we rang every centre manager on a daily basis.  We asked how things were progressing, and if there were things that they needed, for example PPE, or whatever.  We were receiving direct information from centre managers.</p> <p>  We also started centre newsletters initially for centre managers, which were issued twice or three times a week.  We then started doing one for centre residents which went out at least once a week, but sometimes more frequently than that.  That provides a great deal of information, often in many languages, for the centre residents.  We have multiple languages and people with multiple levels of capacity in languages in our centres, which is something we are very conscious of.  We therefore tend to try to have as many communications as possible published in the major languages.  I am sure we do not reach everybody every time.  We will continue to do this and to keep pushing information into our centres.</p> <p>  One of the recent innovations which we asked centre managers to set up was for WhatsApp broadcasts for all of their residents.  Broadcast is a more secure way of sending information out; it can be sent directly into the phones of residents as it comes through, which is done through constant efforts, reminding and reiteration.  We also try to ensure that centre managers themselves are putting up appropriate signage, etc.  We continue to do that on a daily basis.</p></speech>

As Dr. Kelleher has said, that has thankfully led to a situation where we have not had a single serious case of Covid-19 in our centres so far and long may that remain the case.</p> <p>  One of the lessons that we have learned is that before the pandemic, health services were provided to residents of the centres in the same way as they were provided to all the citizens of this country.  Asylum seekers get a medical card and access GP services in that way.  We are reliant on national advice from the national social inclusion office.  That system is perfectly adequate for normal health needs of residents in normal times, possibly with the exception of mental health, but as our population is reasonably young and healthy, it is probably not enough at this time.  I have written to the HSE, and to a colleague of Ms McArdle's, requesting that it review the types of supports that it offers to vulnerable persons, including to direct provision centres, at this time, whether on a national or regional basis.  That is certainly a lesson that we have learned.</p></speech>

At a local level, in each community healthcare organisation our social inclusion services work within primary care services to ensure that every resident in direct provision receives all the information required to support his or her health outcome.  At a practical level, that means engaging people with their GP services in the wide range of primary care centres-----</p></speech>

I only have about 30 seconds left and I want to ask the Department one more question.  I am terribly sorry to interrupt.  As I understand it, there have not been new cases presenting to Ireland at the rate there had been.  What steps is the Department taking to use what might be described as a lull or a pause in new applications to try to expedite the processing of existing applications or has the Department been hampered in that way because of the courts being limited in their sittings?</p></speech>

The numbers have fallen off in the last month or so but we were still getting a steady stream of people applying for international protection and seeking to access the accommodation services up until the middle of April.  As soon as any travel restrictions are lifted, that flow will happen again.  We have consistently allowed people to apply for asylum and we have never stopped that.  However, we have had to restrict a lot of access to our buildings.  Unfortunately, the Department's systems are largely paper-based and that has very much restricted our capacity to take decisions.  We are actively planning for a resumption of that work, which should allow us to resume taking decisions, particularly positive decisions that we hope will allow people the opportunity to move on with their lives.</p></speech>

Why did the Department not follow the public health advice?  Earlier it was mentioned that the Department has to go by HSE advice on testing.  Why not the HSE advice on distancing?</p></speech>

How many new households were created?  When I say households I mean people who did not know each other in advance.

How many new households do we have, if Ms Buckley understands my question?</p></speech>

I will have to come back to him on that because it would involve us doing a calculation on how many cases we moved of existing cohorts of people and put them together where they were, so that would not be the creation of a new household.  I would have to check how many times we put single people, who had not shared rooms together before, into new rooms.  I will see if we can work that out and get back to the Deputy with the figure.</p></speech>

These are people who did not know each other and are strangers.  They are put into a room where they have no other choice but to share with a stranger and obviously the risk level is very high.

The direct provision system is what I consider to be an inhumane and difficult system in which people must survive.  Ms Buckley mentioned that she will be back in terms of some regular business and try to process applications for citizenship.  If we are on a downward trend for Covid-19, and hopefully we are, there are fears of a second wave and a flu outbreak in the winter.  Have Ms Buckley or any senior officials in her Department considered a fast-tracking approach for citizenship or a citizenship amnesty for asylum seekers in this period?  Such a scheme would empower asylum seekers to move into the community, access payments, access the housing assistance payment, to make their way and contribute to Irish life and not spend another winter living in direct provision.</p></speech>

Permission to remain or the grant of refugee status does not actually give one citizenship.  There is a further requirement of residency that takes a number of years.  I assume the Deputy is talking about permission to remain in the broader sense.</p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, we have nearly 1,000 people with permission to remain who remain in our centres.  We would like them very much to be accommodated in the wider community because that would free up a lot of space in our centres for the people for whom we have to provide accommodation. </p> <p>  We have certainly been asked by the Minister and the Government to examine the case of undocumented workers and to look at people in the wider community who may not have a current status.  We have not been asked to fasttrack things.  We have not needed to be asked because we are constantly working on trying to improve the speed with which we take decisions on whether people are granted permission to remain or not.</p><p>We have not been asked to change the criteria on the basis of which we make those decisions.</p></speech>

They would be the sort of decisions that the caretaker Government would find difficult to achieve.  If I was asked to prepare such a proposal, I could certainly look at that.  Obviously, we have some sterling examples of people who have worked very hard in places such as care settings who live within our centres, many of whom have permission to remain, as it happens, but some of whom do not.  There would be, perhaps, ways of adjusting some of our more individual considerations that could allow us to do that if we were so asked by a Government.</p></speech>

We have had 1,734 tests so far.  What are the criteria as regards further tests?  Is it just people who have developed symptoms or who have asked to be tested because of that, or is there a protocol for further systematic testing in direct provision centres?  Are there concerns that people in the direct provision system are afraid to speak up and say they have symptoms for fear that they may be moved away from their support services and networks in their specific centres?  Are there any actions to counter that?</p></speech>

So far, I have got a record of us performing just shy of 2,700 tests, of which 180 were positive.  There were ten places tested where no case was identified, which gets us close to 1,000 tests.  It shows a very different picture across the system.  There were some places with nobody positive at all.  Our current position is that we would take it on board primarily as a consequence of symptoms of an individual who shows signs of Covid-19.  We would then investigate that with a clinician as a consequence and decide how to progress it.  One would hope that the first person would be asked to be properly isolated such that they would then reduce the risk of passing on to anybody else and the person they were sharing a room with, if that was so, would then be asked to isolate as well and restrict their movements.</p></speech>

However, towards the end of last week we became aware that the particular hotel was starting its economic business again and was taking in paying customers.  In the circumstances we felt the same risk issues arose so we have ceased our use of that hotel and have moved all of the residents to other facilities in Dublin.</p></speech>

We consider the competing pressures and risks attached to where we have people and move them as we have to.  It is an ongoing system that has a large number of new arrivals and, therefore, there must be movement within the system for the system to operate.  As was explained earlier, when we open a new centre there is a requirement that we wait until the contract is signed before we can communicate it to our colleagues not only in the HSE but also in the Department of Education and Skills-----</p></speech>

What would happen with that matter now is that the public health section would make contact with the Department of Justice and Equality and convene an outbreak control team meeting.  That public health-led process would ensure proper communication is maintained throughout the outbreak.  In respect of movements in the second week of March, the environment was very different.  We were responding very quickly.  That was within the second week of activity ratcheting up in terms of concerns.  If the Deputy recalls, there was the potential for a wave of 25,000 cases by the end of that month.  Decisions had to be made.  IPAS and I liaised with the national social inclusion office.  We considered the issues attached to whether to make a decision to move-----</p></speech>

I did not need a big long reply that really did not answer my question.  It does not appear very clear what the line of communication is.  Could somebody communicate with me in writing to tell me what the line of communication is in a situation where there is a Covid positive case?  Who has responsibility to notify the Department of Justice and Equality with regard to a direct provision centre?</p><p>Perhaps that could be followed up with me in writing.</p></speech>

As soon as I saw how cramped and crowded and on top of each other people were, it reminded me of playing house as a kid, with bricks and stones and lumps of planks, and of pushing everything together so we could all lie down together and have a mess.  That is no way to treat human beings but the evidence for it in the context of Covid is quite shocking.</p> <p>  The reality is that the HSE has given advice for all congregated settings to the effect that, during Covid, non-family members sharing a room are considered to be a household.  We have a particular difficulty with this in direct provision because of the overcrowding to which I have just referred but also because, much of the time, people who are sharing rooms do not speak the same language, are not of the same religion and do not get to know each other.  Do the witnesses agree with that advice?  If they do not agree with it in the context of direct provision, have they ever objected to it, sought clarification on it or looked for it to be changed? </p></speech>

It reflects the fact that, in congregated settings of this type, and direct provision is only one, there are particular difficulties in applying social distancing in that context.  These guidelines take account of that, which is what they have to do because there are settings like this, such as direct provision, disability services and homelessness services, across a broad range of the areas where people who are not members of one family are sharing rooms.  The advice has to take account of that and we have to try to apply best practice around that.  Ireland is not unique in this regard.  The EU guidance on this matter reflects almost entirely what we have done in terms of trying to ensure best practice.  However, acknowledging the fact-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-05-26a.852" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020052600002#EEEE00400"><p>That is fine.  The point I want to make is that if it is not their job to query that advice, it is their job to look after the occupants of direct provision.  I am of the view that those two things are contradictory.  The Minister recently stated on radio that they are in his care and if anyone works for the Minister, surely their care should matter to those who look after them.</p> <p>  On 12 March, the Taoiseach stated that gatherings of 100 or more people indoors should be cancelled.  The provision of services in the canteen at Knockalisheen direct provision centre, where over 200 asylum seekers receive their meals, was not cancelled.  Distancing in areas such as communal toilets and showers in Kinsale Road, Great Western House, the Glenvera Hotel, Hazel Lodge, Clare Lodge, Cahersiveen and other locations was not possible and did not happen.</p> <p>  The residents in Cahersiveen received a letter, which I presume came from the Department, although the witnesses might clarify that.  It stated that, unfortunately, there had been two new confirmed cases in the past week and that this was clear evidence that some residents were not following the public health recommendations, thereby causing further infection.  It also stated that the period of advised restrictions on movement would need to be extended for a further 14 days and that because social distancing was not being followed by everybody, the period of recommended self-isolation was to be extended.  Translating this into layman's terms, it means that the residents of these areas who cannot self-isolate or socially distance correctly are being blamed for their own plight.  Will the witnesses comment?</p></speech>

It was prepared on the basis of both public health guidance and knowledge of how the centre was operating.  However, I would counter that the authors did not wish to apportion blame to any of the residents and that it was merely a reminder of the importance of adhering to the public health guidance.  I have to say also that it was supported by on-site supports.  There is a HSE support community health care worker to attend on-site seven days a week, who provides and supports residents in terms of interpreting the public health advice and, where queries arise, engaging with centre management to support residents in adhering to that public health guidance.  It was by way of providing additional communication and to explain to residents why the period of extension was happening.</p></speech>

That sounds like they are being blamed for their own plight.  I repeat to the witnesses that these centres are totally inadequate for the purposes of self-isolation and social distancing, particularly during this crisis.  If anything, it has exposed the horrors and inhumanity of direct provision in a sharp way.  Who is the author of that letter to the residents?</p></speech>

The direct provision situation is at the top end of things that must be addressed.  I will ask a number of questions and the respondents can come back at the end.</p> <p>  I have two questions for the Department of Justice and Equality.  The witness said at the start that all staff have been Garda vetted and Tusla-approved.  What training has been undertaken, if any, in terms of understanding the requirements of infection control?  Ms McArdle said there are people on site but there is a significant issue around communication and translation, particularly in terms of having something in writing, which I ask the witnesses to look at.</p> <p>  Given what we now know, has the Department or the HSE looked at doing a review or analysis of the asylum process and the length of time it takes for applications to be considered?  A "Yes" or "No" answer will suffice.  The rate of refusal last year was approximately 67%.  The question that first comes to mind is why we have people waiting so long to get an application approved or otherwise.  This would seem to feed into the numbers.</p> <p>  In terms of the HSE and isolation rooms for suspect cases, do the witnesses know how these are being dealt with and if isolation is being observed?  The evidence is that it is not.</p> <p> I refer to communal spaces in direct provision centres.  Has anybody thought to come up with a rota system so people are not in the same room at the same time using washing and eating facilities?  Maybe that is happening, but will somebody give me some information on that?</p> <p>  Approximately 800 applications to the asylum process last year were from people of African descent.  A good deal of medical data is building up to say this group of people may be more at risk to the severe outcomes of Covid-19.  Has the Department made any efforts to prioritise them and ensure they are first to be removed in the case of a outbreak?</p></speech>

We have done quite a degree of training, supported by the HSE.  In fact, a very useful webinar was done, which all centre managers were strongly encouraged to watch and participate in.</p> <p>  As we said to the committee, there is a telephone line, which we are paying for and is provided by a group called Safetynet, which both takes their queries around safety issues and health issues and proactively works with the centres to try to improve their safety.  In addition the HSE sent an infection control nurse into the specific centre in Cahersiveen.  The nurse went through a very detailed checklist of what could be done in terms of managing infection control, particularly in the context of an outbreak.  That checklist, which was extremely helpful, was then promulgated to other centres as necessary to help them with infection control.  It is worth bearing in mind that the people who run our centres are, in the main, hotel or accommodation managers, and they have never had to do this before.  We are having to learn what they need to know and are providing it to them as best we can, over time.</p> <p>  With regard to translations and comments, we translate a lot for the residents as well so they know about the basic things, about cough etiquette and so on.  These are the things that we have started to learn and practice by rote, although I noticed I coughed into my hand earlier which I probably should not have done.</p> <p>  Mr. Kirrane may wish to come in on the issue of processing. </p></speech>

Our average processing before the pandemic was 15 months for a first-instance decision.  We want to get that down to nine months, and indeed to get it below that.  We have had our challenges with the pandemic because we cannot carry out face-to-face interviews as part of the process, which we must do as it is a legal requirement.  We are looking at how we can get back and start that process as quickly as possible through the use of video-conferencing and a series of other measures.</p> <p>  In the longer term, the Catherine Day advisory group has been established.  One of its terms of reference is specifically to look at how to further speed up processing cases and to look at best practice across Europe in relation to doing that.  It is currently undertaking its work and is expected to report in the autumn.  It is in all of our interest to speed up the processing of cases because by doing so, it would mean that people would be in the direct provision system for a shorter period, and those who are given a positive decision could get on with their lives and move out of the facility as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

That was done by arrangement with each of the CHO areas.  With the on-site isolation rooms it is a little more difficult to say, but they are only ever a temporary solution while a person is waiting for a test result.  If he or she is confirmed positive, or is in close contact with others, he or she is taken to one of the off-site self-isolation facilities.</p> <p>  There are rotas for all the shared rooms and facilities, and we strongly encourage centre management to put that in place, and continue to encourage them to do so.  It is far and away the best way to manage this within what is a closely-confined setting where people have to share laundry facilities, eating areas, and so forth.</p> <p>  With regard to people of African descent, we have cocooned everybody identified to us as either in the first or second category of health vulnerability.  Those were identified to us by the HSE.  We have to go by what it tells us because we do not hold people's health information.  We have not been given any additional advice around people of African descent, but obviously if that becomes part of the evolving knowledge the HSE passes onto us, we would do whatever it asked us to in that regard.</p></speech>

This is something I have said before, and I say it again today.  Our Government has failed these people, and the people of the communities in which people in direct provision live.  As I said a few months ago, this is a box-ticking exercise by the Government.  It was trying to show Europe and the world how it was willing to take people in under direct provision, but not telling the world what conditions these people would be living in.  All too often we have seen ten beds in one room.  Is this the norm for many in direct provision?  In March approximately 110 people in several direct provision centres, including a number of children and heavily pregnant women, were given scant notice and ordered to move to Cahersiveen in County Kerry, without testing in advance, in order to avoid overcrowding and the development of Covid-19 clusters.</p><p>They were forced to leave the lives they had started in Ireland behind.  On 18 March, there was an outbreak of the coronavirus in the centre.  In mid-April, the development of a Covid-19 cluster ensued, resulting in 24 cases to date.  Since mid-April, all remaining residents have undergone the ordeal of a 24-7 voluntary but strongly advised confinement in the 56-bedroom centre, with restricted access to its limited outdoor area.  They have also endured 14-day isolation periods in their small bedrooms, sometimes in recently infected rooms, some sharing with strangers and others as entire families.  Together, we are now presented with a horrible new dilemma which only the witnesses and their colleagues have the power to resolve.</p><p> Was there a testing strategy in place to test people who were moved from one direct provision centre to another?  If there was such a strategy in place, what percentage of the people in direct provision were tested and moved only on the basis of a negative result?</p></speech>

The moves were arranged by the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, if we understood there to be an issue in a centre, the testing would then be developed as a consequence of what we knew about what was happening in the centre.  As the committee heard, if a case or contacts were identified, they would be moved out of those centres as quickly as possible to separate isolation facilities.  The testing depends on the circumstances, the conditions, the numbers, etc., in those centres.</p></speech>

We only have a very short period of time and this is likely to be a very long answer.  The Deputy has to understand testing in these circumstances.  The test we use only tells us that the person is positive or not detected at that moment in time.  It does not mean the person is negative for the next week.  The person could be tested the next day and be positive at that point.  A test is not the answer.  The answer is about how we take on board the whole process.  We have given advice from the very beginning of this process around this area.  Our first advice was put up on our HPSC website in early March.  It was revised in April.  It states very clearly how to deal with this issue, both in terms of trying to prevent it and when there are outbreaks.  There is further advice on our website about dealing with outbreaks.  The committee has heard some of those details.  We have sought to put in, where necessary, additional staff like the infection protection control nurse, having a community worker on sites on a daily basis and things of that nature.</p> <p>  We seek to work with our colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality to try to reduce the burden of people with Covid in these facilities as much as possible but it is difficult because of the circumstances.  Along with them, we are trying to put in place systems that do that.  They are basically the same things we ask everybody in the country to do.  It is not that different at all.  It is about good hygiene, good respiratory etiquette and social distancing.</p></speech>

We would have a very grave difficulty if asylum seekers were singled out for testing ahead of any other group in society.  They are only tested when the HSE needs them to be tested.  That has to remain the case.</p></speech>

I asked if there was testing in place when patients were moved from a nursing home or hospital to another nursing home.  I am not singling out any sector.  It is important when people are moving from one care provision facility to another, regardless of what it is, that Covid testing would be done.</p> <p>  With the potential for a further wave, what planning is under way to ensure people resident in direct provision centres will be permitted to follow clear social distancing guidelines?</p></speech>

It is a marathon and not a sprint.  We are starting to plan at this point for how we can ensure that we can maintain the lower level of density in our centres that we have achieved at this point.  We are starting to plan the use of self-isolation facilities, how we use them and what we need to retain in that space.</p><p>That is particularly challenging because several of the hotels we are using have indicated they will return to commercial business when the economy reopens.  Hotels will not be as readily available and, as such, we must plan very carefully around how we might do that.  That is a specific issue within the broader challenge of trying to improve the quality of the accommodation we provide on a general basis.  We are working very hard at so doing.  We await the recommendations of the group headed by Catherine Day which are likely to come through in September and should set us on a track in respect of where we go more generally in providing appropriate accommodation options for people who come to Ireland and apply for international protection.</p></speech>

If not, why not?  They are vitally important.</p> <p>  Ms Buckley noted in her opening statement that the Jesuit Refugee Service, JRS, had launched a support service for residents of centres.  How long has it been in place?  How many calls has it received?  How much feedback has the Department received on it?  I know from experience that the Department will not accept complaints from anybody other than residents.  In that light, why was that service introduced?</p> <p>  On testing and the HSE, the Department stated that there are approximately 8,700 residents in the asylum system.  The HSE has tested 1,734 of them.  Why have all residents not been tested?  What is the difference between hostels for asylum seekers and nursing homes, where there has been blanket testing of all residents and staff?  Why has that not been rolled out for asylum seekers?</p></speech>

The short answer is that through our labour market access records we were able to identify 160 people who we thought were working in a care setting and might need solutions to be provided for them.  We proactively tried to contact each of those healthcare workers.  In fact, we asked a particular NGO to help us do so, which it readily did.  Unfortunately, there was a relatively low take-up of the accommodation offers by the healthcare workers.  Between 10% and 20% of them indicated a willingness to accept such an offer.  There are many reasons for that, such as that they have family in the direct provision centre and do not wish to leave them or they are perfectly happy in the direct provision centre.  Many people are quite happy where they are.  The accommodation on offer from the employer or the HSE may not have been of the right kind or they were not happy with it.  The choices open to us were to evict them from our centres or tell them they must give up their job in healthcare, neither or which we were willing to do.  As such, all we can do is to continue to recommend to people that they take up the offer.  We are continuing to do so, but it is not mandatory for people to take up the offer.</p> <p>  On the JRS support line, we got it up and running on Thursday.  We had been working on it for a couple of weeks.  In the first two days, we received 11 calls.  Ten of those issues had been resolved by the time we got a report yesterday morning.  The line is up and running and it is a very useful way for people who need to raise an issue, for whatever reason, to so do.  We continue to ask people who have a problem to, please, tell us about it first because we can fix it.  If they raise a problem about their centre, that information will never travel across into the International Protection Office.  It will have no effect whatsoever on one&rsquo;s application for asylum or permission to remain.</p></speech>

If the Deputy wishes to raise anything specific, he can refer it directly to me.  We are open to Deputies raising specific issues as well.

We got positive results as a consequence of some testing we did when we learned of outbreaks in some centres.  We actually performed that type of mass testing in nine or ten centres.  No cases were identified when we screened all the residents.  That coincided with the information we were getting from elsewhere from mass testing.  Outside areas with known outbreaks, testing produced very few, if any, positive cases.  We are now very clear, therefore, that mass testing is not the appropriate way to go.  It is far better to look at this issue in the context of testing known cases and being very strict and quick with that.  That is what we are doing now as a consequence and we always do it very rapidly.  Our testing is down to the point where results are available and back in 36 to 48 hours, at the longest.</p></speech>

I will focus on the current level of provision and the safeguards in place.  Regarding vulnerable people, I note from Ms Buckley&rsquo;s opening statement that has been deemed to be those over 65 years old rather than 70.  Taking those vulnerable to Covid-19, therefore, as those people over 65 and those with underlying conditions, what is the current state of play?  Do all those people have their own rooms and all the necessary safeguards around them to protect themselves from contracting the virus?</p></speech>

We were lucky, in one respect, that the number of those aged over 65 years is low, somewhere short of 70.  A further three dozen or so people with high health vulnerabilities were identified to us in recent weeks by the HSE.  We have put solutions in place for all those people.  In some cases, those solutions do not involve them having their own space.  In at least one case, two ladies I am aware of asked to stay together because they are friends.  Several members of our older population are also part of family groups, want to stay with their family network and are in a household in that way.  Appropriate solutions, that the HSE is okay with, have been found for all that population, but it is, thankfully, quite small.</p></speech>

There was also a situation where people sharing rooms but not in the same family were deemed to be of the same household.  They were asked not to interact with other households.  In reality, however, there are shared bathrooms in some cases, as well as shared cooking facilities and communal areas.  How is that being done in practice in light of the very tight spaces many of these men, women and children are living in?</p></speech>

Ms Buckley mentioned rosters.  For the rest of us in Ireland there is no question that families would share each other's space in kitchens once it was properly cleaned afterwards.  Is it the case that families, households or groups in rooms have to use the same cooking facilities, although it might be at different times of the day?</p></speech>

In some cases, however, the HSE has advised us and we have had to close the communal cooking facilities, which is of course a step backwards in the independent living of residents.  We have had to go back to direct provision of food in the centres for that reason.</p></speech>

The current public health advice for wearing masks is that people in indoor settings and reasonably close contact with others - in shops, for example - should consider wearing such masks.  This does not necessarily mean medical masks but even cloth masks.  Do the residents who want such masks have access to sufficient face coverings to comply with that public health advice in direct provision centres?</p></speech>

We effectively have a weekly delivery of PPE to every centre.  I am not sure what the current advice is on the use of masks in congregated settings.  I might have to call on a colleague from the HSE to give that information or perhaps we can get the advice to the Deputy.</p></speech>

We would have to go on the best advice available to us as to whether people should wear them in those circumstances.  That is why I want to come back to the Deputy on the current state of play with regard to the advice.  As he knows, there is great concern within the HSE that people would not use medical grade gear inappropriately, and there may be some circumstances, as I understand it, where it may cause problems.</p></speech>

They have no choice about that.  If it is not the case, the Department might look at this but I hope any resident who wants a mask would have access to one.  My understanding of the current public health advice is that should be the case.</p> <p>  I ask about the children in direct provision.  They no longer have access to school and they are living in impossible positions that I imagine will scar them very deeply for years to come.  For the children who cannot go to school, have other educational supports been provided such as tutoring in centres, remote schooling or safe spaces where they can do their studies?  Have any other psychological supports been provided for the children?  I imagine many of them are very scared right now.</p></speech>

For example, there were 32 children doing their leaving certificate this year and we had to give some definite thinking to how we would work with those at an earlier stage of the development of the pandemic.  We also have children transitioning from sixth class to first year and we have a small number who came into our system but have yet to be linked with schools.  Those particular children are targeted by relevant educational welfare officers and arrangements have been put in place to support them.</p> <p>  We have also been linking with colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development around library drops as a support for children.  All centres are obliged to have Wi-Fi and all rooms have televisions, which can assist children in linking with programmes such as the RT&Eacute; "Home School Hub".</p></speech>

At the same time we were asking centres to follow a protocol.

In general, the transfers taking place at the moment involve individuals who have tested positive.  They have been moved to an isolation facility and have completed their period of isolation.  Either they need to be transferred back to where they came from or transferred on to another centre.  The other group of people who are moving into our system are the people who are still arriving and applying for international protection on a daily basis.  We are working with our colleagues in the HSE to try to introduce an effective quarantine system for them for a couple of weeks.  Then we need to move them on to other centres.  The system is a live system.  There are constantly people flowing into it and fewer people flowing out of it.  We have to keep the system moving.  We are in constant engagement with our colleagues, especially in the national social inclusion office, as to how we can continue to maintain the system safely.</p></speech>

It needs to be radically reformed because it is broken.  Again, that is not a reflection on the people with whom Ms Buckley works, who are doing hard work under very difficult circumstances.</p> <p>  Ms Buckley referred a number of times to the Catherine Day report and the analysis that has been carried out.  Can she tell me offhand whether that will examine a systemic review - in other words, looking towards moving away from the private sector towards public provision of housing for these very vulnerable people?</p></speech>

In how many cases are decisions on applications pending?  Of those cases, how many judicial review procedures are in place?  Can we have an idea of those figures?</p></speech>

Is there a process in place for moving them to safer accommodation?  If so, are there many people in respect of whom the Department has had to use that process in order to be sure?  I raise this question because where the virus has been identified in a particular centre, these people will move back and forth from a hospital to the centre.  What kind of numbers are we talking about there?  Is there a process in place for dealing with that?</p></speech>

If there is an outbreak in a centre, it is generally the case that the HSE tells us we cannot move anybody into that centre.  That is the normal process in those circumstances, for obvious reasons.  We certainly would not move medically vulnerable people into such conditions.  I am not entirely sure I followed the other aspects of-----</p></speech>

In the normal course, if somebody is identified to us, particularly by his or her GP, as requiring specific provision, for example, access to hospitals, there is a standard process that we always use in those circumstances.  In a normal year we have many people requiring special medical facilities.  They might have HIV, for example.  We make special provision for them in terms of accommodation.</p> <p>  As promised, I have found the figure the Deputy was looking for.  At the end of April there were 5,694 applications for international protection on hand in the international protection office.</p></speech>

In the event of somebody giving birth, we had an instance of this in Cahersiveen, and they were not and would never have been returned to the centre in Cahersiveen.

The HSE is at the moment looking at how we will have to provide all our services into the future of this pandemic.  It is one of our key tasks at the moment to see how we can provide services such as the Deputy is talking about - maternity services - which actually have carried on the whole time throughout this, as clearly they need to.  We are looking to how we provide services such as these in a world where Covid-19 will exist.  It may or may not be known if people have Covid-19, and therefore we have to provide the services in those ways.  We are seeking to do this in many very innovative ways.</p><p>Increasingly, some of this will happen via telephone and video etc. to facilitate a lot of this and to ensure people are not being exposed, either when coming into our facilities or when they are already in our facilities.

Those efforts have continued throughout the pandemic and even during the lockdown.  Eighty people moved out of our centres as part of that assisted process during the month of April, which was great.  We need to do more of that and we are working strongly with two NGOs that helped that process.  We have a co-located official from the local authority services and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive who helps us with housing assistance payment, HAP, applications and so on, and we are very keen for as many of those households as possible to move out of our centres as quickly as possible because that relieves a huge amount of pressure on us elsewhere.</p></speech>

The officials present can account within that policy but this House has failed in the care of the elderly, the respect shown to them and the care they deserve at this time in their lives.  We also failed with the disability sector and the section 39 organisations, which were mentioned earlier.  We did not touch on those in depth at all.  However, when I asked a question of the HSE about the funding for section 39 organisations, that question has still not been answered and those section 39 organisations that provide services in group settings and houses do not have the funding to meet today's public health requirements.  I am being told that by a number of different organisations and we are letting them down in this House if we do not insist on getting the appropriate answers from the HSE and every other body that is associated with this.</p> <p>  On direct provision, what we are again experiencing is the failure of a policy that has been implemented by successive Governments for the past 20 years because we have deliberately ignored the most vulnerable in society.  These people who come to our shores are vulnerable.  For a long time, Members of this House have been highlighting in Second Stage debates of legislation the faults and failures in the care of the elderly, the disability sector and the direct provision facilities.  The finger clearly points at us here.</p> <p>  I am not asking the witnesses to comment on the following issue that has arisen but they can do so if they want.  So many different Departments and Government agencies that are involved in this deal with their business almost in silos.  They do not connect with each other as successfully as they should.  There is a clear effort being made by many concerned to deflect, obfuscate, ignore the double standards that exist and move on.</p> <p>  For example, in today's hearing the Chairman or Acting Chairman read out before every session that one shall not refer to an individual in such a way as to make her or him identifiable.  Witnesses are asked to refrain from that.</p><p>Today, we heard the centres being named where Covid had been identified.  That is in the direct provision setting but when it came to the care of the elderly the Department was asked not to do that.  There are double standards that cannot be ignored and we have to deal with them.  Ms Buckley, when the Department offers or awards a contract, what oversight kicks in from there on to ensure that the rights of the people in these settings are protected?  We constantly refer to public health standards and advice but I think we should be guided about what we would want to do in the name of humanity and compassion rather than just tick a box.  How does the Department oversee the contracts that are offered?  Does the Department have inspectors?  Does it report back?  What does it do with breaches and so on?</p></speech>

Any flaws or faults that are found are immediately referred to the centre manager and asked to be addressed directly.  There is a follow-up visit, if needed.</p> <p>  In terms of governance of the rights of the people, the Deputy will be aware that under the McMahon report of 2015 centre residents were given access to the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  The Ombudsman now conducts a very proactive campaign of visits to centres.  Indeed, he published his report in the last few weeks.  He deals very proactively with complaints that come in.  As well as the capacity to complain to us which, as one of the Deputy's colleagues has already said, some people do not like to do there are many routes now to try to ensure that centres are effectively managed.</p></speech>

One of our key tasks now, applying a risk framework, is to look at those centres that need additional supports from us and to proactively offer them.  Since we put in place the call centre and so forth, centre managers are actively encouraged to come to us or come to the safety net line with any concerns that they have, which they do.  They ask us for PPE and things that they need or tell us about their concerns about, for example, people wanting to return to the centres.  We have a very strong interaction with them now.</p></speech>
