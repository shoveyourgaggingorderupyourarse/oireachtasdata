    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#A00200"><p>We will begin in public session.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  Deputy Paul Murphy is substituting for her.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the implementation of the new national retrofit plan and the broader issue of emissions from buildings.  We are joined by witnesses from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, which is responsible for the roll-out of the national retrofit plan.  SEAI has published a very interesting national heat study in the past number of months so we will touch on that as well.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. William Walsh, CEO; Dr. Ciaran Byrne, director of national retrofit; Mr. Brian O'Mahony, head of the community and national retrofit department; and Ms Margie McCarthy, director of research and policy insights.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  There are limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending from outside the Leinster House campus and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as those physically present on the campus.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House campus.  If they are joining us online, I ask that prior to making their contributions to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of Leinster House.  I now invite Mr. Walsh to give his opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today to discuss the national retrofit implementation plan.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Margie McCarthy, director of research and policy insights; Dr. Ciaran Byrne, director of national retrofit; and Mr. Brian O'Mahony, head of the community and national retrofit department.  To assist this discussion, we separately submitted relevant briefing material on the national retrofit programme to the committee last week.  I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to present my opening statement.</p> <p>  SEAI is at the forefront of Ireland's clean energy transition.  We are funded by the Government of Ireland through the Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications and the Department of Transport.  In 2022, our budget allocation is more than &euro;440 million.  Of this, &euro;267.2 million is allocated specifically to energy retrofits in homes and communities.  </p> <p>  At SEAI, we are acutely aware that the energy transition must be a just transition.  This is carefully considered across our delivery programmes, our research and our policy advice.  Of the &euro;8 billion allocated in the national development plan to home energy upgrades, half of this figure is ring-fenced for action to support vulnerable and energy-poor households. </p> <p>  SEAI places citizens, communities, suppliers and other stakeholders at the heart of everything we deliver.  We are catalysts for action through our grant and incentive programmes and our capacity-building processes with citizens, communities, and the business and public sectors.  We have had a major transformative impact on the Irish economy and in the past decade, our actions have underpinned more than &euro;1.2 billion in energy savings. </p> <p>  The Government's climate action plan 2021 sets ambitious residential energy goals for 2030.  This includes installing 600,000 heat pumps, 200,000 of which will be in new homes while 400,000 will be retrofitted into existing homes.  It also includes achieving 500,000 B2 building energy rating, BER, home upgrades.  Both of these key targets support the reduction in carbon emissions from the residential sector from approximately 7 million tonnes in 2018 to between 3.5 and 4 million tonnes in 2030.  The quicker we achieve this, the sooner the broad range of benefits will flow to Irish households in the form of cheaper-to-run, warmer and healthier homes; improved air quality; and improved security of energy supply.  </p> <p>  In 2021, SEAI was designated as the national retrofit delivery body.  SEAI has unique experience in residential energy policy implementation.  In the 20 years since our establishment, the warmer homes scheme has helped to improve the warmth, comfort and health of more than 143,000 vulnerable energy-poor homeowners while the house of tomorrow programme demonstrated the feasibility of technological solutions leading to stronger building regulations for energy.  Through our implementation of the BER programme, more than 800,000 homes, or almost 50% of the housing stock, have a BER, which puts Ireland to the forefront of this important consumer empowerment instrument.  The greener homes scheme supported 33,000 renewable home heating systems building market confidence in, and establishing, robust supply chains for technologies like solar thermal and heat pumps.  The better energy homes scheme has provided &euro;292 million to support more than 268,000 homeowners to complete shallow and moderate home upgrades.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.7" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>SEAI&rsquo;s community energy grant scheme has demonstrated the power of aggregating projects across homes, communities, and commercial buildings.  Last year&rsquo;s national home retrofit pilot helped demonstrated a proof of concept for the OSS approach to home energy upgrades.  This addresses some of the key challenges to date, namely, multi-annual funding for contractors, more generous grants for increased measures, and greatly reduced complexity for homeowners.  The national roll-out was launched by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in February.  All SEAI programmes follow the same principles of establishing clear objectives, focused development, fast deployment, efficient delivery, regular review and refinement, and clearly measured outcomes.</p><p>SEAI programmes benefit from our modelling and research capability, which supports the delivery and design of programmes, founded on an evidence base.  Our recently published national heat study is a comprehensive analysis of the options for reaching net-zero emissions from the heating sector by 2050.  Comprising analysis across all sectors, the study includes key insights to decarbonise the residential sector.  This study is informing Government heat policies and will support the evolution of the national retrofit programme, ensuring it is best in class to meet targets.</p><p>February&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister of the new grant rates paves the way for the next wave of residential energy upgrades and sets Ireland on the journey towards our 2030 targets.  The new national home energy upgrade scheme offers increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost for a typical B2 home energy upgrade, up from 30-35%.  The scheme offers a hassle-free home energy upgrade with OSSs providing an end-to-end service.  This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; managing contractor works; and quality assuring the work.  Homes owned by private homeowners, non-corporate landlords, and approved housing bodies are eligible for the scheme.  Fixed, transparent grants ensure contractors and homeowners alike are clear on their entitlements.</p><p>The scheme was developed using design thinking principles, putting the customer at the heart of the journey.  We undertook a significant amount of consumer and behavioural analysis to support its development.  The new scheme is designed to be scalable and support the achievement of our ambitious targets.  The SEAI works closely with contractors and homeowners to ensure their home energy upgrade journey is made even easier.</p><p>A key part of the OSS registration is for companies to demonstrate that they have the quality systems and capacity to deliver at scale.  Currently, two companies are fully registered as OSSs, having completed due diligence and a further 17 are actively engaged in this process.  There will be ample opportunity for smaller contractors, who may not be in a position to register as a OSS, to partner with registered OSSs.  This is already happening extensively in the industry.  Additionally, the &euro;8 billion allocated in the national development plan to the national retrofit plan sends a clear signal to the market to prepare for increased opportunities and delivery at scale.</p><p>Our retrofitting targets represent a decade-long project, one which will build rapidly towards the goals set out.  Many of the challenges are clear, such as supply chain capacity, material inflation, homeowner willingness, the rental market, governance and low-cost finance.  In particular, I wish to advise that we are closely monitoring supply chains and inflation, and actively engaging with the construction industry, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, education and training boards, ETBs, and the wider retrofit landscape to increase retrofit-related training opportunities.  In light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, SEAI is collaborating with colleagues in our parent Department and other State agencies to mitigate impacts which will affect all of society.  Further details on what we are doing to address these issues are included in the additional material provided.</p><p>The benefits of the national retrofit programme far outweigh the costs, particularly when the multiple benefits - financial, economic, employment, health, security of supply, and environmental - are considered.  We passionately believe the clean energy transition must happen urgently, and we stand ready to support all of Irish society on this journey.  Our approach is based on insights, research, and expertise from two decades of programme delivery.  The challenges ahead require us to work at pace and to deliver ever greater results, learnings, and improvements in collaboration with key stakeholders.</p><p>I acknowledge the strategic leadership provided by the board of SEAI and pay tribute to the staff of SEAI for their commitment and dedication.  In concluding, I thank our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications for their ongoing support, particularly in the context of the actions assigned to SEAI under the Climate Action Plan 2021 and the national development plan.  I welcome discussion with the committee, and I am happy to answer any questions members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

There is quite a lot in it.  It is interesting.  I invite members to indicate if they wish to ask questions.  Could I get agreement, as we usually do, that we will have two minutes for questions and we will have second, third and fourth rounds if we have time?  Is that okay?  Okay.  I thank members and invite them to indicate if they wish to ask a question.  Those who are joining us online might indicate using the raise hand function.  If witnesses who are joining us online wish to come in on any particular question, they should use the raise hand function as well.</p> <p>  I have one quick question for Mr. Walsh on his statement.  I will come back in later with other questions.  He mentioned that two companies are currently fully registered as one-stop shops, having completed due diligence, and a further 17 are actively engaged.  I ask about this because it is something that was mentioned on the radio a short time ago.  Is that what Mr. Walsh would have expected at this stage or would he have expected more?  Is everything going to plan?  That is just a quick question, but he can take all the time he needs to answer it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#B00400"><p>Yes, we have two through the gate and 17 more coming.  It is pretty much broadly in line with what we expected.  I will give some additional context on that.  We are taking a very significant and deep focus on the capabilities of companies that are prospective OSSs in terms of their quality management systems and also their ability to scale.  We have a pre-eligibility questionnaire piece and then we follow up with a strategic plan.  While we have been working with the OSSs prior to the announcement of registrations, we have been quite fastidious in terms of looking at those applications and making sure they meet those relatively high bars.  We are about where we need to be.  Obviously, we would like to be a little bit quicker but we want to make sure that we get it right and have all of the bases covered than to get it done fast.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#B00500"><p>If I can, I will add just one point to Dr. Byrne's comments.  We opened the scheme on 9 February for applications and we are focused on processing those applications.  As Dr. Byrne says, we have two through the gate now and we have 17 further applications on which we are working.  Many of the one-stop shops are gathering a pipeline of prospective customers and we are engaged in ensuring that is expedited because from our perspective, delivery at pace is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#B00600"><p>I thank Mr Walsh for that, and Dr. Byrne as well.  I will move through the list of speakers.  The first is Deputy Bruton who is joining us from his office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#B00700"><p>I thank the witnesses very much for the presentation and for the work that has gone into getting this scheme up and running.  I would like to pursue the Chairman's question a bit further.  What spread do we need in terms of the number of one-stop shops to be able to say that they have a nationwide launch and people can go to somewhere within a reasonable distance?  Specifically, at the time of the announcement I recall that some national organisations like An Post and the credit unions were involved.  Are national organisations of that nature pushing through this process, so that we can expect to see a fairly wide coverage?  I fear people may be delaying while they wait for this.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the supply chain challenges and also how this industry will grow by year five and year ten, to give us an idea of what scale of industry we will see grow.  It will give confidence to people to enter the industry if they see the speed with which it can grow.</p> <p>  When will we see the loan scheme?  That will be key if it is to be linked to savings in energy bills.  There has been a suggestion at the committee by Friends of the Earth that we should step back from the BER B2 threshold for the OSS and that we should reduce it so that we quickly get the more easily accessible energy savings in the midst of this crisis.  I invite the witnesses to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#B00800"><p>I will deal with the first couple of questions.  On the spread of the one-stop shops, of the 19 companies, many of them have a national footprint and will be doing work right across the country.  A number of them are also tied in to the large utility providers so, while they are separate companies in their own right, they are very much linked to utility providers and have that kind of national spread as well.  The current target for OSS registration is approximately 20 for this year and we will be growing it further from there.  As was mentioned in the opening remarks, from the point of view of OSSs, we are looking for relatively large companies that have the capacity and capability to deliver at scale.</p><p>The model for many of the one-stop shops, OSSs, will be that they will work very closely with the middle-sized and smaller contractors.  The OSSs will be responsible for quality and project management delivery.  They will work with the local contractors.  That will allow them to enforce and support the national spread of OSSs and retrofit works.  We believe we are in a reasonably good place in that regard.<br/><br/>I will comment on the supply chain before handing over to my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, who has very much led on the matter.  We are very much cognisant of the supply chain.  We have done a lot of work on quantity surveying the OSSs and building in inflation in respect of the grant schemes.  We are about six weeks into the war in Ukraine, which has supercharged things.  Last year was a very difficult year for the supply chain.  The committee will recall <i>Ever Given</i>, the ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal.  That gave rise to significant global supply chain issues.  We are seeing some restrictions on or some issues with the scheme, particularly in the context of the lead times for the likes of windows and doors.  I ask my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, to comment a little further on the supply chain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#C00200"><p>On the supply chain side, the SEAI has been building to this point for more than ten years and has done many shallow retrofits.  In the past two years, our programmes have pivoted towards deeper interventions resulting in ratings of B2 and beyond, up to even A1.  During Covid we have seen many of the supply chains cease to operate globally.  They have had to be refilled in the past 12 months.  We have seen that that has started to unwind from product and material availability.  There has been a knock-on impact on costs.  Last year, right after the lockdown in Ireland was lifted, we looked in detail at the cost side to see what the costs were in the marketplace, both in our schemes and externally.  Then we noticed during the summer that we were getting reports that costs had increased even last year, so we went back out again in the autumn, and we plan to go out again this year.  We are preparing to go out and to see what is happening with the costs because of recent inflation as a result of a number of geopolitical factors.  That is looking just at the cost.</p> <p>  As for the supply side in Ireland, as Dr. Byrne said, there are 19 applications for registration as a one-stop shop.  We aim by the end of 2022 to have 20 one-stop shops registered.  Some of them will be companies that do national coverage and some may be focused more regionally or on particular types of building stock for homes.  That is how we foresee this will go.  The market will not be a homogenous one-size-fits-all one for everybody in Ireland, with many companies having the exact same business model and approach across the country.  That is what we see coming through from our experience in the past two years on the development call.  We will have to see how we move through the coming years, but if we had 20 one-stop shops operating by the end of the year, and the applications we have received to date give us comfort that we will achieve that easily, I think we would be able to meet the demand that we see at present and that we have seen grow in the past quarter.  In 2021, some of our one-stop shops did more than 500 deeper renovations, resulting in ratings of B2 and beyond, so the one-stop shops have that capacity and we are confident about that and about the supply side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#C00300"><p>I will take the remaining couple of points arising from Deputy Bruton's questions.  One of them, I think, had to do with the growth in the market in respect of B2 ratings.  We are putting in the foundations for a multi-annual, decade-long plan in respect of building the pipeline, the market and the suppliers.  We are starting off at this point with the first of the one-stop shops.  We will be working on this right through to 2030.  We have a significant target of B2 ratings to reach.  We want to achieve approximately 65,000 to 70,000 B2 ratings per year from 2026 or 2027 onwards, towards the end of the decade.  We are at the early stages of that.  As Mr. O'Mahony mentioned, a significant amount of work has been done in preparation for these one-stop shops in developing the national retrofit plan and scaling the various parts of the market.  From the launch in February, we have started officially and we are out at it, even though the SEAI has a 20-year history of delivering retrofits.  We are starting to realise the step change in ambition in respect of delivery.  The cruising altitude, if I may call it that, is about 60,000 to 65,000 B2 ratings per year.</p> <p>  As for the point about the loan scheme, we are working very closely with our colleagues in the Department on that.  The Department is taking the lead role in that.  A lot of the work will be done by quarter 3.  We hope and anticipate that that will be available at the retail banks by quarter 4 of this year.  We are supporting that work.  We have some people on our team working on the energy finance side of supporting it.  My understanding is that the European Investment Bank, EIB, is undertaking its due diligence on the scheme.  Obviously, it will do that to its satisfaction.</p> <p>  I will make a final point about stepping away from the B2 ratings.  That is a very interesting point and one we will keep abreast of as this crisis moves on.  The committee should be aware that we have a number of other schemes.  The one-stop shop scheme is focused on B2 ratings.  We also have the better energy homes scheme, which consists of the individual measures for the can-pay sector.  That scheme allows homeowners to carry out just one or two measures.  It is not focused on achieving a B2 rating.  The warmer homes scheme is the scheme for the energy-poor.  We achieve a number of B2 ratings under that scheme but we also do some shallower retrofits under it.  As this crisis matures, we are keeping a close eye on that.  We may have to pivot back on the scheme to look at different measures so we encompass more people rather than carrying out more measures for fewer people.  It is a live situation and we are keeping abreast of it.</p></speech>

The retrofit scheme is fantastic, and I think everybody wants it to achieve, but I have some concerns from what I have heard and what I read earlier.  I can sum up those concerns with some of the figures the witnesses have just presented.  Dr. Byrne mentioned that the SEAI is aiming for 65,000 B2 ratings or thereabouts per annum once this is ramped up, but with the 19 one-stop shops, assuming they are capable of doing what Mr. O'Mahony has just said, which is about 500 ratings of B2 or higher per annum, we are looking at a shortfall of around 55,000 on the basis that 500 multiplied by 19 is just short of 10,000, so there is a significant gap there.  While the witnesses have mentioned optimism and expectation, I am concerned from what I am hearing that perhaps we have been too ambitious about being able to achieve these targets on the basis of the size of the sector, notwithstanding any other concerns about supply chains.  The aspect of delivering at pace and the geographic spread of these large-scale contractors is important.  I stress that this is not a criticism of either the SEAI or the targets, but it seems to me that 19 firms large enough to do this at scale simply is not enough.  I would like the witnesses to put my mind at ease in that regard.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to touch on - and I am glad Mr. Walsh started his contribution with this very point - is the level of support offered to lower income families who may currently be in energy poverty.  Between the SEAI, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, my understanding is that about 58% of the overall budget is targeted at low-income families in social housing stock, among others.  Within the public sector, and across the two Departments and the SEAI in co-ordination with local authorities, are the witnesses confident we will be able to achieve the targets and goals at local authority level in respect of those in local authority housing stock, among others, that are being set out for the SEAI?</p> <p>  Finally, I thank Dr. Byrne for the mention of the low-cost finance scheme being with the European Investment Bank.  That was going to be one of my questions.  Availability by quarter 4 of this year is to be welcomed, and I hope that goes well, but the witnesses might address the two major points I have made.</p></speech>

There is no question but that these are ambitious targets.  We have a target of 20 companies for this year.  The funding we have between now and 2030 is &euro;8 billion, fully half of which is for the energy-poor sector, so the B2 ratings will come from across all the SEAI programmes, not just the one-stop shops.</p><p>We are considerably ramping up our warmer homes scheme, which is the energy-poor scheme.  We expect to deliver a lot of B2s from that.  We also have the solar photovoltaic, PV, scheme, which we get a lot of B2s out of, and the better energy homes scheme.  We are going to be strategically looking at our community scheme, from which we get B2s as well.  The B2 target is not from the one-stop shops alone.  It is from all the schemes across the SEAI.</p><p> We are in the process of growing the market and the Deputy articulated a very good concern.  There are 20 companies right now.  Experience, both in our previous history growing and developing schemes and generally, has taught us that we should grow the market in a balanced way.  A clear policy direction is baked into statute.  We also have significant finance.  Those are two of the biggest concerns of the industry.  We have been going back out to the industry and contractors and telling them they now have an ability to scale up their businesses.  They now have assurance that we will be here for the long term, they have a good sense of the policy direction and they also have significant finance backing it up through demand from homeowners.</p><p> The other point about retrofitting, which will be significant in growing that market, is that retrofits will be required wherever there are homes in the country, in every constituency.  We are seeing a lot of positivity from contractors who feel they have a rewarding and satisfying career and business opportunity in their local area, rather than heading to the larger urban centres where a lot of construction activity takes place.  We believe it is very much a stretch target but it is achievable.  We will continue to grow the one-stop shops but we have a relatively high bar because of the conditions I outlined earlier around quality, capability and scale.  There is no upper limit to the number of one-stop shops.  We will continue to grow that number.</p><p> On the lower-income families to which the Deputy alluded, exactly half of our &euro;8 billion budget is going towards the warmer homes scheme, which we are in the process of scaling up.  We have had significant interaction with the local authorities and on foot of the new scheme we have also been back in to our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities.  The committee will appreciate that I am not in a position to speak on their behalf about delivering their targets but it would be fair to say we have a shared vision.  We already have a pilot programme in the midlands where we are working with local authorities.  They can go into particular estates or areas and retrofit all the homes rather than just one group or the other.  We are in the process of building another pilot programme with them to build this capability.</p><p> From a contractor's point of view, and they are the ones delivering this, they consistently say to us that aggregation is what is important for them to be able to do their business efficiently.  In a housing estate, which might have formerly been a local authority housing estate entirely under the purview of the local authority and the Department, there are typically mixed homes now.  Even in some private sector estates there are mixed homes because of the various parts of the rental sector and housing assistance programmes.  This is about achieving the target.  Those 500,000 B2s are the roadmap to the target.  The target is ultimately CO2 emission reduction.  We want to build a system where contractors can go into a housing estate and it does not really matter what type of home someone is in.  It is about reducing the emissions.  If it is a can-pay home, a home that can pay part of it right now, a fuel-poor home or anything in between, we will be able to get the contractors to aggregate.  That is the basis of the pilot scheme that is currently running and will end this summer.  We will take learnings from that and those will be used to build onto the next scheme with the local authorities.</p><p> I share the Deputy's views about the loan scheme.  We are working hard with the Department.  We have done a lot of work on our behavioural analysis and affordability is coming up as a significant factor.  A lot of people are interested.  The surveys we did late last year showed that approximately a third of people had not really thought about it, a third were interested but had not acted and a third were interested and had acted.  I would be strongly of the view that that has changed radically in the last six or eight weeks, and certainly since the start of the year.  The low-interest loan will be very significant for people getting on that journey, and that is coming.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has told us that over the course of Covid there has been a K-shaped economy, in the sense that some parts of the economy have done very well.  There are a lot of pent-up savings so a lot of people have the funding to do it themselves but we are acutely aware that a lot of people do not.  One of the key priorities of the retrofit plan is that it be equitable and a just transition.  Even if somebody has some savings built up, a bit of money may be required for the retrofit and so the low-interest loans will be significant.  With regard to the way they are priced, ultimately when the monthly payment is made they should be very close to the cost of a utility bill or lower.  People will get a much improved living environment, a warmer home and a healthier place to live and will increase the value of their home for a relatively modest sum.</p></speech>

Retrofitting has become even more crucial in the current context.  Of course the emissions reduction is our priority but we are also talking about safety, fuel poverty and energy security for families and households.  I am a little concerned about the narrative around growing the market.  As Dr. Byrne himself said, the ultimate goal is emissions reduction, so we need to make as much retrofitting as possible happen as soon as possible.  Each year, two years or three years is time lost in terms of emissions and there are vulnerabilities there around fuel poverty.</p> <p>  At the moment, a lot of the emphasis is on low-income households but often that still is in a narrative of homeowners.  Of the 500,000 homes to be retrofitted by 2030, 36,500 will be local authority housing stock.  That is less than 10%.  Dr. Byrne spoke about incentivising and encouraging people and making homeowners make the decision but the State and local authorities are the homeowners for a very large amount of housing stock in the State.  Given the energy crisis and the fuel poverty that is likely to be acute in the time ahead, should we be changing that ambition?  For example, that 36,500 could be the ambition for local authority housing for the next two years and then we could add to it and quadruple it, at a minimum, over the period ahead.  These are the houses the State can access and is in a position to do that.  I am concerned when I hear about pilots because it seems the commercial schemes and the underwriting of loans are moving ahead at scale.  With local authorities, on the other hand, there has been a pilot and there might be another one, when we really need this to be the area where energy moves ahead at scale.</p> <p>  We have measures when it comes to landlords.  We have sticks as well as carrots in this regard.  I do not buy the split incentive idea.  Is giving the same level of grants to commercial landlords who are renting out properties the best use of this, when we could also raise the BER requirements for properties?  What are Dr. Byrne's thoughts on that harder measure being part of what we do?  Perhaps it could be accompanied by incentives but-----</p></speech>

It is about disability allowance as a category.  The carer's allowance is one of the categories to qualify for the warmer homes scheme.  I ask Dr. Byrne to address the backlog in the warmer homes scheme.  Should disability allowance be one of the categories as well?  Is there space for a joint product, that is, retrofitting combined with adaptive needs for persons with a disability?  That could be a very attractive grant for older people, who are less incentivised.</p></speech>

The Senator referred to the emissions reduction.  That is of course the ultimate target and we have to build the market.  While we are putting the structures in place in SEAI, we do not do retrofits.  Homeowners do not do retrofits.  It is the market that does retrofits.

With regard to the customer journey, the demand-led schemes have to be right for the homeowners.  They have to press the green button to go.  Right beside them, they have to be right for the contractor to be able to do that work.</p> <p>  On the matter of the State and local authorities, I am sure the Senator will appreciate that I cannot comment on the local authority target of 36,500.  There was a lot of discussion around it with the Department and that is the target that was set out and agreed.</p><p>I can say, from discussions with the authorities, that there is a real willingness between them and us to share information and examples of pricing to see how we can get better bang for our buck on costing.  I take the point about pilots and having more pilots, but doing a &euro;25,000 to &euro;40,000 retrofit on a home is a complex piece of work and we need to get things right in terms of how we build that scale.  There is an old phrase, and I hate to use it, but it is very difficult to retrofit a retrofit.  It is about getting the quality and processes right.  We are putting the building blocks down now for a ten-year, and probably longer, programme.  That is why we are spending time getting things right so that when we get it right, we can scale up quite quickly.</p><p> On building energy rating, BER, requirements, landlords and the rental sector, I take the Senator's point on the split incentive but it is a very significant and complex policy area.  There is a requirement under the Housing for All plan that there would be mandatory BERs brought in by 2025.  Our schemes are open to what we term non-commercial landlords.</p><p> I will ask my colleague to speak on warmer homes scheme and the disability allowance.  We changed the disability criteria with the Government announcement in February.</p></speech>

We are doing a programme where we are helping to bring them on the retrofit journey.  That would mean connecting them in to existing programmes we have in the SEAI depending on their eligibility criteria, whether those would be the warmer homes scheme, the better energy homes scheme or a community energy upgrade scheme.  That is one programme.  It is called the health age-friendly homes programme.  There is another programme on which we are working with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to help Ava Housing.  This is for homeowners aged over 65 years who are considering upgrading their homes by refurbishing them, perhaps to provide additional housing for other people.  At the same time, we provide retrofit support for that.  There are a number of programmes that are happening, cross-departmentally or cross-agency, to help people in these situations.</p></speech>

I may pick up on some of the points made by Senator Higgins.  The warmer homes backlog is in the region of 7,000.  The Minister indicated in February that we would need to get to 400 a month to start clearing that between this year and next.  Are we at 400 a month?  How many did we do in the first quarter?  If we are not at 400 a month, when will we reach that?  How will we deal with that backlog if we are not there yet?</p> <p>  Will the SEAI give the committee a year by year and scheme by scheme target out to 2030?  It would be helpful for the committee if that were available.</p> <p>  On attic and cavity walls, in a written reply to me, the Minister indicated he expected there might be a doubling of demand from 4,500 to 9,000.  Where are we on that?</p> <p>  If I want to apply for the 80% scheme or the one-stop shop scheme today, are the schemes open and available for people to apply?</p> <p>  I refer to the key performance indicators, KPIs.  These include 500,000 B2 ratings and 600,000 heat pumps.  Are there any fuel poverty or social indicators in the KPIs, such as taking people out of fuel and energy poverty?  There could be a scenario, and Mr. Byrne indicated this, where we could deliver a lot of B2 ratings by getting B3 ratings to B2 through small works, but it is a very different thing to say we have taken a certain cohort out of fuel poverty.  I do not know what that would equate to and whether that would involve taking out of those E, F and G ratings and bringing them up to C or B2 ratings.  I would like a comment from the SEAI on the indicators and incentives to deliver on B2 ratings and heat pumps versus taking people out of fuel poverty.</p></speech>

The plan for this year is to do approximately 400 homes a month.  That would be a 4,800 turnout this year.  As of this morning we have 865 homes delivered under the warmer homes schemes.  We have not hit the 400 a month rate yet.  We have 474 in March and slightly fewer than that in February.  Obviously, a lot of that is to do with the timing.  We have a contractor panel of about 30 contractors who have been working very closely with us to see all the pain points in terms of their delivery.  Some of those are to do with inflation and some are to do with internal and external processes.  I have been working directly with the contractors to remove those pain points to improve their delivery and outputs.  We believe we will hit the 400 monthly target in the next two months and then we hope to exceed that so that we will come in at the average for the year.</p> <p>  On the figures year by year and scheme by scheme, we have targets we can provide to the committee.  We have the figures on the B2 and non-B2 and so on.  However, we anticipate the schemes will change in the coming years, so it is about the annual targets and how we package them.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the attic cavity; that is the 80% grant.  To be clear, while we are registering the one-stop shops, the better energy homes programme is and has been active all the way along.  At this exact time, we have received 9,116 applications across the solar PV programme.  That is approximately 46% of the total number of applications received from last year.  On the attic cavity grant, which is the 80% grant, we have been heading for a 350% increase between January and March - that is in the quarter 1 figures - which is a significant increase in uptake.  They are the 80% grants.  An important point for the committee is that the grant levels available in the one-stop shop scheme are the same grant levels available on the individual energy grants but the list of measures is not as extensive.</p> <p>  On KPIs around poverty and the fuel poor, half of our &euro;8 billion budget is going to the warmer homes scheme.  As of 8 February, we have changed the targeting of this scheme.  We want to prioritise those in worse need, which would be as the Deputy identified, namely, those homes with BERs of E, F and G.  It is a demand-led scheme.  There are quite a range of eligibility criteria.  It is not totally linked to the energy performance of the home.  As a result of the Government decision in February, we are now prioritising the worst categories, those of E, F and G, to bring those up ostensibly to the B2 rating.  This particular programme is in transition.  It started as a relatively shallow -measures energy programme and it has transitioned to the much deeper measures of the B2.</p></speech>

The first piece of work is talking to the homeowner.  There is then a technical assessment, the home energy assessment, which is a specific technical report on the home.  On the basis of that, the one-stop shop will sit down again with the homeowner to outline the options available and the homeowner will decide on them.  The work is then programmed in.  While a homeowner might make a phone call and have an initial consultation with a one-stop shop today, it could be six weeks before works are started on the ground.</p></speech>

I apologise because I do not want to be evasive.  We have two companies registered and we will wait until we have four, which will be midway through next week, to put their names up on our website.  The reason for this is not to be uninformative or unhelpful but that the significant interest in this would swamp the two companies.

The IPCC cannot give enough warnings that we have only a certain amount of time to turn this around in order that we do not leave behind a disastrous situation for future generations.  There is a considerable onus on us to turn this around and reduce emissions.</p> <p>  The IPCC report indicated that approximately 18 countries had demonstrated a consistent reduction in emissions.  One was the UK, which is successfully reducing emissions, mainly through renewable energy.  Another was Norway, where a measure has been the roll-out of electric vehicles, EVs, and the EV network.  Where Ireland can begin to achieve a consistent reduction in emissions is through a significant roll-out of renewable energy, especially offshore wind, and the retrofitting scheme to save energy and reduce the use of fossil fuels in home heating.  With that in mind, there has been significant debate recently around carbon tax.</p> <p>  It is amazing, considering the findings of the IPCC report and the consistent warnings, that there is still a debate around abandoning one of our key measures to tackle climate change.  That measure is carbon pricing and using the revenue from carbon tax to roll out key schemes, such as agri-environment and retrofitting schemes.  How important is the revenue from carbon tax in rolling out this retrofitting scheme?  How would abandoning the carbon tax or delaying an increase in the rate of carbon tax impact on the acceleration and roll-out of the retrofitting and warmer home schemes and helping people in fuel poverty to create warmer homes?</p> <p>  I will speak on a parochial level.  I know Dr. Byrne cannot give details on the two companies that are through the door in terms of the one-stop shop.  Cork is the biggest county and I am from west Cork.   Dr. Byrne mentioned that some one-stop shops would be national and others would be regional.  Is it envisaged that Cork would have its own one-stop shop?  Cork South-West, which I represent, is an approximately three-hour drive from one side to the other.  Is it envisaged there would be one in that area?  Can Dr. Byrne give that type of detail?</p></speech>

It is ring-fenced and targeted at the fuel poverty sector.  At a higher level, carbon tax has a considerable evidence base with regard to affecting behaviours.  The higher the cost of energy as a result of carbon tax, the greater the reduction in energy people will use.  It will make people focus and think about the energy they use.  That is very important.</p> <p>  We see things in the energy crisis that we cannot control.  We cannot control, from an Irish perspective, the wholesale cost of oil and gas.  What we can do is look at where it is possible, and it is possible, for some people in society to use less.  That will be very important in this energy crisis.  Carbon tax and carbon pricing incentivise that effect and force people to think about how much energy they use and what they use it for.</p></speech>

There is no restriction on becoming a one-stop shop.  Once a company meets the eligibility criteria, is of appropriate scale and has the appropriate capability, it can become a one-stop shop.  What we in the SEAI have seen in the 20 years of the organisation is companies start off with small single measures and build their capabilities to the point where they can become successful contractors, in the normal way a business might scale up.</p> <p>  If there is a contractor in Cork that wants to get into this business, believes it has a future in this area and builds up its capabilities, it can apply.  Once it meets the criteria, it can be a one-stop shop.  That is contractor led.  A point that pertains to places such as west Cork, in particular, which is a good three-hour drive across the county, is that the retrofit is happening in every community in the country.  If a contractor is based in west Cork, it is much nicer for him or her to drive around west Cork doing the retrofitting than drive to Cork city, Dublin or wherever the work might be.  There is considerable benefit for contractors and many of them look to this.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, to comment on the listing.  I do not have the geography of all the companies, but there may well be a Cork-based company on the list.</p></speech>

I do not know if I should mention some company names and not others.  What Dr. Byrne says is correct.  We have worked with the company for more than ten years and it has expanded its services and capabilities.  It is based in Cork but provides services throughout the country.  In the past two years, a company in Dunmanway has provided one-stop shop services.  There are companies in Waterford and Tipperary.</p> <p>  I can mention many counties in which people provide services but they also provide services in the counties around them, which is what we want to see.  We want to see people build up their businesses, locally and regionally.  Some may want to do it nationally as well.  There are specific Cork examples, both big and small, but there are also a number of nationally prominent companies connected to utility companies that cover every county in Ireland.</p></speech>

That was attributed to the better energy homes scheme.  The biggest chunk of the underspend related to the warmth and health well-being scheme.  I can understand why the organisation was not going into homes during Covid, particularly those of people who have respiratory health issues.  My question concerns what the SEAI decided to do with the underspend.  The document that was presented to the Committee of Public Accounts showed that the reductions were partially offset by the increases in solar PV, EV, and deep retrofit schemes.  Looking at the programmes, there was an underspend in the programmes that are directly targeting energy poverty.  That underspend was then redirected to schemes that, let us say, do not affect those on low incomes.  There is a lot of talk about reducing carbon emissions.  That is absolutely essential.  However, retrofitting should go hand in hand with reducing energy poverty.  How did the SEAI factor in where it was shifting that underspend?  What decision-making process was taken to direct the money?</p><p> Linked to that, the 2020 social impact assessment carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform found that it was impossible to conclude that SEAI schemes alleviated energy poverty or actually lifted people out of energy poverty.  The reason for that is that the data was not being collected.  Is SEAI now collecting that relevant data, including data on indicative household income, expenditure, energy usage and BER both before and after the retrofit?  Is SEAI measuring that now, so that at least when the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is assessing the new programmes, we are actually reducing energy poverty along with reducing carbon emissions?</p></speech>

On our appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts and the numbers that we presented for 2020, I do not have the numbers to hand.  From recollection, I can give the Senator a broad, general overview of where we were and how we operate as an organisation.  Clearly, for us as an organisation, 2020 was a really difficult year to get into homes and to have people working.  For a long time, our contractor base could not get into homes, nor did homeowners want them in homes, even after the lifting of restrictions.  Momentum stalled, from that perspective.  We were not in a position to fully expend the budget that we had over those two periods - more so in 2020 than in 2021.  We work in cash-based accounting like many other public bodies.  Effectively, it is a case of "use it or lose it" in-year.  We look at where there might be opportunity or demand in areas.  The Senator referenced the solar PV scheme.  That scheme requires a visit that takes half a day in and out of a home.  People are much more amenable to that than the four weeks, let us say, of a contractor coming in and out of their home for retrofitting.  We found other opportunities to spread our funding around in-year.</p></speech>

It was evenly balanced.  In respect of EVs, I think we can all accept that anybody who is living in energy poverty is not buying himself or herself an electric vehicle.</p></speech>

The thing with energy poverty and our energy poverty scheme is that was as much as we could deliver in 2020 and 2021.  For 2022, we have a budget of &euro;110 million to deliver the 4,800 homes that we can retrofit.   That is contractor capacity.  That is what we can do based on the industry right now.  We are looking to grow that industry.  Dr. Byrne has outlined some of those plans.  From our perspective, we have been funded to do what is needed and deliverable in the fuel poverty sector.  Dr. Byrne has referenced the numbers that we have delivered.  Last year, we did an average of around 180 homes a month.  We are getting up to a ramp rate of 400 now.  We have faced costs relating to inflation.  The procurement exercise was completed in 2019 for the warmer homes contractors.  Clearly, we have been faced with construction inflation.  We are facing off those challenges, but we are still delivering those numbers.  To go back to the Senator's point about the EV and solar PV schemes, they are programmes that are there.  There are grants available because there is market failure in them for the uptake levels that we need need from an "Ireland Inc." perspective to hit our 2030 targets.  Where we see opportunity and there is underspend in conditions such as those we experienced in 2020 and 2021, we will look to do that.</p></speech>

Along with that, as part of the national home retrofit scheme, we carried out a pilot programme in the midlands.  We focused on certain areas and took different approaches in different local authority areas to see if we can do both private and local authority homes that are co-located.  As was mentioned earlier, the project will conclude in the summer and we will undertake a review of what worked and what did not work.  That will be fed back into the programmes for the next few years.</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier that the warmer homes programme, our flagship energy poverty programme, started off as a shallow measures programme.  It involved very light measures.  It started off back in around 2009.  We would have seen large numbers of homes being visited but subject to relatively shallow measures.  On foot of the report of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and also a different report to identify the efficacy of the programme, we have been pivoting it from an energy poverty to an energy efficiency programme.  What that means is that we are taking much more significant measures on a per-home basis.  We are now doing pre-BER assessments.  We look at the BER rating of the home before we start, then we put significant levels of retrofit into the home, and we look at the BER level after completion.  We are looking at that definite uplift.  The average spend on the programme was around &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000, which pivoted up to about &euro;18,000 to &euro;20,000 last year and up to &euro;27,000 on the sub programme, the warmth and well-being programme.  We are addressing those measures and concerns from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  On the monitoring on an individual home level, we do not monitor every single home.  I might refer to my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony to comment on that.  We do a degree of monitoring.  </p></speech>

Once a householder is eligible, they are on the programme.  We do not look at that because we do not set the criteria.  Living in energy poverty is one of the criteria.  Once a householder meets the threshold criteria, they are on our programme.  As a result of the Government decision made in February, what we are doing is pivoting down and looking at the worst performing homes, those with BERs of E, F and G.  Typically, but not always, they are the people in most need.  There are heritage homes and things like that.  We are moving towards that.  In terms of the criteria, we just have a list.  Once a householder meets the threshold criteria, they are on the programme.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  The national retrofitting scheme, and the fact that it benefits people who are already comfortable financially and can put up the money to match the grant, is almost an economy of scale for warmer homes.  The more money you have, the more money you will get.  We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis that started well before the war in Ukraine.  We are now in real danger of having a two-tier system, where one group of people are living in damp, cold homes and the others can put solar panels on the holiday homes that they drive to in their EVs.  What is being done to avoid this damaging situation?  Can the witnesses see the difficulties that this kind of economic apartheid approach will cause?</p><p> Regarding the waiting list for the warmer homes scheme, some people have been waiting 18 months for a survey.  Those who applied in August 2021 are being told they will have to wait 18 months, which will mean that this will not be done until 2023.  I obtained that information in response to a parliamentary question I tabled.  Many optics are at work here, but meanwhile heating bills are rocketing.  What does the SEAI intend to do to clear the backlog in the warmer homes scheme?  When will that be completed?</p><p> One of my constituents owns a bog and he fills his garage full of turf.  He does not have the same romantic notions about it as I do, such as the smell of turf, etc.  He would love to get his home retrofitted, but he is on a low income.  How are the one-stop shops being designed to specifically support lower-income households and the owners of rental properties?  All the Deputies here will confirm we are being notified of eviction orders constantly.  We would like to see the SEAI plan to ensure there is going to be an uptake of the scheme by those in lower-income homes and also that it can be availed of by landlords to allow their tenants to benefit.  We do not, however, want to see tenants being evicted.</p></speech>

Regarding the schemes, a significant portion of the budget, half of it to 2030, is dedicated to the warmer homes scheme and the fuel poverty scheme.  On the can-pay sector, if we want to call it that, we have two programmes.  The one-stop shop deals with all the measures in one go.  We also have individual measures schemes, where homeowners can choose to avail of individual measures depending on their resources.  Additionally, in February, the Minister launched 80% grants for attic and cavity wall insulation.  As part of our package when we launched that scheme, we carried out quantity surveys to determine how much the costs would be for the archetypal home and found it to be approximately &euro;2,500.  This means a project of this kind will be grant funded to the tune of approximately &euro;2,000.  The &euro;500 it will cost to undertake a typical attic and wall cavity insulation project, when we price it out with credit union or An Post loans, is relatively affordable.  Therefore, we are considering all parts of the can-pay sector.  It is not really a case of "The more you have, the more you get".  We have a fixed grant menu.  That is not allocated on the basis of house size; we have done it by house archetype, namely, detached, semi-detached, bungalow, terraced or apartment.</p> <p>  On the waiting list for the warmer homes scheme, as I mentioned earlier, we have 5,700 homes on the list and a target to complete 4,800 homes this year.  We have a legal framework in place and we must work within it, and that is somewhat restrictive.  I am working with the contractors to deliver in this respect, including examining and understanding the impact of inflation and changing some of the operating models so we can improve their cash flow and delivery and outputs from the scheme.  Ideally, we wish to increase the number of subcontractors working with the main contractor on the scheme to clear the backlog.</p> <p>  Deputy Cronin also mentioned the rental sector.  To be clear, the one-stop shop grants and the better energy home grants are open to non-commercial landlords.  Owners of a small number of properties can avail of the grants.  Equally, retrofitting works do not require people to be evicted from their homes.  We have not heard any reports directly of people having been evicted as the result of retrofitting works being carried out, but the RTB has many statutory powers in this area and it is putting processes in place in this regard.</p> <p>  Turning to the affordability aspect, we touched earlier on low-interest loans and these are going to be a significant contributor in this regard.  We are talking about Government-backed loans.  The key premise here is that the Government takes a share of the risk, and this means that the interest rate charged can be much less than normal market rates.  We believe those low-interest loans will be a game changer for all parts of the can-pay sector in respect of retrofitting.</p></speech>

The end point of a policy intervention is to have some outcome.  In this case, it would be to have more people availing of attic and wall grants.  At this stage, we do not believe that increasing this grant would deliver retrofitting of more homes, and it might just inflate prices in the sector.  I ask my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, to comment on this aspect as well.</p></speech>

We have seen some homes where the support being provided has since gone up fourfold.  Therefore, when we look at the marketplace, the first aspect to consider is if there is enough capacity in the supply chains to enable the installation of these two measures to cater for people's increased interest and appetite.  It is great to see, because these technologies are easier and faster to install.</p> <p>  If we increase the grant rate, typically, to 100%, our concern is that some homes will cost more.  That will also lead to cost inflation.  We advise proceeding cautiously.  Let us carry out our review and develop our understanding by doing a quantity survey of the costs across the country.  When we have those data, then we can react.  We are planning this process now.  We will have the information early in the summer, and we can then provide it to the Government to allow it to make a decision.  Our counsel is to proceed cautiously now, because there was a major intervention in February.</p></speech>

As we discussed, we have 19 companies involved in the one-stop shop initiative and then we have approximately 33 contractors on the warmer homes scheme, of which 30 are active.  Additionally, we also have contractors registered for the better energy communities scheme, but I do not have that figure to hand.  Many of the bigger contractors, of course, will work across all the schemes.</p></speech>

Competition is how we can stave off inflation.  We saw this, for example, when we originally launched the solar-PV scheme some years ago.  Only about ten to 12 providers were active in the market at the time, but that has now increased to the point where there are 130 providers.  The increase in competitiveness in the marketplace is one of the main measures we can leverage to try to counter inflation.  This is, of course, all predicated on there being a normal environment.  Unfortunately, other factors are in play here.</p></speech>

Some 55% of the money from that tax is ring-fenced to go to meeting the costs of the retrofitting scheme.  Mr. Walsh mentioned this aspect earlier.  Will he give a breakdown of the amount of carbon tax that is ring-fenced for the SEAI for this year and what that money is going to be used for?  Mention was made as well of how many homes are going to be examined and the schemes involved.  I would appreciate a brief breakdown of what the revenue from the carbon tax is going to be used for this year.</p></speech>

That information will be very useful, if we can get it.  A debate is raging in my party now concerning carbon tax.  Other people are saying we should scrap the tax altogether.  My view is that it is an important measure and we must use it to work towards retrofitting homes.  If people understood what it is being used for, then we could go a long way in doing that.  This brings me to my next point.  Sometimes the public understanding is that retrofitting homes is expensive and hassle-filled.  That is not the case, however, because we are providing 100%, 80% and 50% loans.  Alongside those 50% loans, as the witnesses will be aware, are low-cost loans, where the money is de-risked to enable people to get low-interest rates.  What is the SEAI doing to try to promote this concept among the public more widely?  I refer to letting people know that retrofitting is a hassle-free way of upgrading homes, that they will save a great deal of money on their bills if they undertake it and that this is something they should be seriously considering.  Alongside the Government's endeavours, what is the SEAI doing to promote this message?</p></speech>

Many of our generic advertisements on radio and television will have been seen over Christmas.  We also have an active sustainable energy community network.  We have 600 sustainable energy communities, and we are leaning into those communities.  When we get the schemes up and running, we will be leaning into those communities and working with them to promote and develop retrofitting.  We will be undertaking initiatives such as community-based marketing.  This means going local.  When advertisements appear in the newspaper, this means that people in communities can go down to their local parish hall and be introduced to one-stop shop contractors.  We did a great deal of work on our various channels in respect of social media, podcasts, etc., and in the context of linking in homeowners in the context of the customer journey.</p> <p>  The Senator has hit the nail on the head.</p><p>For many people it can be technical, a hassle and where people are busy, etc.  We bring the evidence forward of a homeowner who has done this, here is one who did not, but one of these is a happier person, has a better result and has a warmer home.  There is a great deal going on.  The Senator will have seen in the newspapers since the start of the year where a number of commentators have been discussing their own experience on retrofitting and are talking to people.  We have also linked in with OSSs to have those kinds of joint approaches.  </p><p> Unfortunately, as a result of the war in Ukraine, the interest in this area has ramped up greatly and has superseded the demand that it has generated.  People are now looking at this when they see the spike in energy prices.</p></speech>

How much on average can an individual expect to save on energy costs for their home in a year, after an average retrofit, where he or she, perhaps, has cavity walls and attic insulation done?  I am aware that there are many different ways of doing this and it depends on what one gets which I understand, but can Dr. Byrne give an average example where I have had a retrofit done, on what I expect to save, please?</p></speech>

There are two parts here.  One is saving on the energy and reducing the emissions but one is also transforming one&rsquo;s home.  This is part of the journey we are trying to get across to people.  It is certainly about money but is also about the home that they want to live in.  The examples in some of the results we have seen in the warmth and well-being scheme survey show that it is a much healthier, warmer and drier place, as a home, to live in.  We have some quality standards, QS, information on some of the averages but it is very much dependent on people&rsquo;s usage over the course of a year.</p></speech>

That is the key point that is sometimes forgotten behind this.  I have time one final question.  Perhaps I will come back in later on, if that is okay as there are other contributors, such as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, who wish to come in.</p></speech>

They said the better energy homes scheme covers 4,800 homes annually.  Many have a BER of B2 because the overall target is for 500,000 B2-rated homes.  How many of the 4,800 homes this year will meet that B2 target?</p></speech>

The average contribution for a home a number of years ago home was approximately &euro;3,000.  It is now up around &euro;18,000, &euro;20,000 and &euro;27,000 for the warmth and well-being scheme.  That is because we are doing significantly more and deeper measures that take longer.  There is a fine line then between doing as many homes as possible and bringing as many to the B2 standard as we can.  Over the coming period, the plan is to increase incrementally to the point where they will all ultimately be B2-rated.</p></speech>

Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke requested and Dr. Byrne replied that he would give a projection on this to 2030.  Is that projection on a quarter-by-quarter basis for B2-rated homes because ultimately, the 500,000 target is a B2 one and is not just attic insulations, for example?  Will the SEAI be able to provide that projection to show the graph and the ramping up, where it believes it will meet that 500,000 target?</p></speech>

We have to move from approximately 7.5 megatonnes of CO2 emissions now to 3.5 megatonnes of such emissions.  The B2 is a pathway to the target.  Not all homes may get it to a B2 standard.  For example, in the BER rating scale, if a home that is currently at the bottom of that scale has a G rating and it is brought up to a C3 rating, that will have abated quite a significant amount of carbon but it has not reached a B2 rating.  We will be looking to blend those two together where we may not get every home up to a B2 standard, albeit that we have a B2 target, but we will be looking at the carbon saved.  This is ultimately about the savings in CO2 emissions.</p></speech>

This is the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in the State.  It is important for the committee to understand the scale of this and that it is a very extensive project.  Over the next number of years we intend to pivot, learn, improve and continue to build and the heat study has helped us with this.  We will build that capacity to move from 8,000 this year to bigger numbers and to develop that capacity as a nation to start delivering the 50,000 or 60,000 homes that we need every year.</p> <p>  The other point there is that this is a very significantly important part of just transition.  Jobs that are going to be lost in other sectors are going to be created within the retrofit sector.  I am giving this information by way of high-level background before Ms McCarthy makes her contribution.</p></speech>

I refer to Deputy Christopher O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s points on the recent IPCC report.</p> <p> The National Heat Study is a comprehensive analysis of how we use heat in Ireland.  It looked at all of the technologies that are available to us and then modelled four scenarios to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from heating by 2050 in line with our national goals.  </p> <p>  In particular, on the residential side, we are aware that this is the biggest demand piece within the heat sector.  In the residential sector we know that particular types of housing, such as detached houses, for example, are responsible for two thirds of the emissions here, due, in particular, to oil usage.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the B2 target, as my colleague Dr. Byrne has explained, we are working very closely now with the Government.  The heat study was launched back in February.  One of the key, absolute findings of the study, and why I have mentioned Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, is it is saying that we need to deploy technologies that are available at scale and at pace immediately to curb emissions and not to wait for technologies.</p> <p>  Part of that is the deployment of heat pumps and we have already heard about the targets for those.  For example, one study we will be looking at and we are about to launch with our colleagues in the OSS and retrofit team examines the heat loss indicator in homes in trying to ensure, first, that the fabric upgrades are optimal to deliver in cost-effectiveness by not increasing running and electricity costs within homes but still delivering on comfort and health benefits, as outlined by my colleagues earlier.  The heat loss indicator study will look at whether we are at the optimal level requirement in what is known as a heat loss indicator within the home, which is a measure to heat the home and to retain it to allow heat pump technology, or similar low-cost, low-carbon technologies, to be deployed.</p> <p>  That will play out and, as Dr. Byrne has said, that will be an evolution of the retrofit programme in respect of the requirements we have within grants programmes.  These will obviously feed in to future climate action plans and through the Department for consideration of these targets.</p></speech>

We cannot afford to have any slippage as we have such a short timeframe now of less than eight years.  To ensure that we are keeping on track and that there is not any slippage, it is going to be very important for that ramping up graph to be publicly available to show these targets.  The documents refer to an average of 45,000 homes, but we cannot be looking at averages and we need to know now how many B2-rated homes, and not the other BER levels, that the SEAI will hit.</p><p>Next year, the SEAI hopes that there are more and then it will keep building up until it makes sure that it is achieved by 2030.  That will be key.  I would appreciate if Mr. Walsh could provide that graph.</p></speech>

A lot has been covered.  Retrofitting is a bit of a political football.  The 100% and the 80% often gets left to the side, but the majority of funding is going in to those measures around poverty reduction, in particular fuel poverty reduction.  Mr. Walsh has said that.  Six months ago, people would have been paying for almost 100% of the other types of retrofitting and now we are saying that the State is providing up to &euro;25,000 of that, which is a significant increase.  If we were to do as some suggest and to ensure that everybody gets it for free, do we know what the cost of that would be to the State if it was 100% free across the board for everyone?</p> <p>  The reality is that there is no other way to pay for that than to increase taxes.  The money must come from somewhere.  That means the taxpayers who are probably benefitting are also paying the tax in the first place.  Nothing is free.  Something has to be paid for, either through people's taxes or through somebody else's taxes.  It would be useful if Mr. Walsh had costings on what it would be if it was 100% free, on top of the &euro;8 billion.  That would be useful to put it in perspective.</p> <p>  What is clear in the IPCC report is that it sets out what has to happen, and it must happen across all sectors.  What tends to happen from a political point of view is that we say, let us not put money into electric vehicles because people who can afford EVs do not need to be supported.  What I hear from Mr. Walsh, however, is that when certain things are maxed out and we are doing as much as we can in the warmer homes energy scheme based on all of the resources, we do need to still use our funding in order to try and put more things into the market that will help us to reduce our emissions.  That is my understanding.</p> <p>  There is a cap on the grants the SEAI is providing for electric vehicles so that, as I understand it, those expensive models of cars are not getting the grant.  Is it within the remit of the SEAI to look at electric bikes, for instance and to push for that?  I come from a rural constituency and while it is all very well to say that people who can afford electric vehicles do not need support, that is not the case.  We have 53% coverage of public transport, and we are trying to ramp that up to 70% with Connecting Ireland, but there are people who will always need cars.  From what I have seen, there has been a significant reduction in the cost of lithium batteries, which has decreased the cost of electric vehicles but we still need to get more of them into the marketplace to reach our targets.</p></speech>

We did invite them to speak about heating and they may not have prepared so much for the questions on transport asked by Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  If Mr. Walsh wishes to respond, he may, but we understand that it is not within the remit of his appearance before the committee today.</p></speech>

Thank you, Chairman.  I will make some kind of response to the questions and I might ask Dr. Byrne or Mr. O'Mahony to respond.  As part of the national development plan, we worked on the holistic concept of retrofitting Ireland so we may have some numbers, but we did not commission a report to estimate that.</p> <p>  The IPCC report is alarming and it does point to actions individuals and countries can take.  On electric vehicles, we have seen the first quarter figures for 2022 versus 2021.  Some 12% of cars sold in quarter one this year were electric vehicles compared to approximately 5% last year.  We can see an increase in uptake of electric vehicles, which is welcome.  In general, every electric vehicle that we sell is one internal combustion engine off the road.  That is the main driver behind this.  As an organisation, we run the electric vehicle scheme and the charging infrastructure schemes on behalf of the Department of Transport.  We are able to provide policy advice on the challenges and changes that we see, such as the change in the scheme to address the fact that a lot of the higher-end vehicles were being supported through grants.  There is only a limited amount of funding available for the conversion from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles over the next ten years and we want to make sure it is maximised.  The Department made changes to address that.</p> <p>  In terms of retrofit, going forward we see technology will reduce the cost.  In 2012, we sold eight electric vehicles.  We were trying to increase the number we sold.  We were up to 14,000 last year and given the demand at this point in time we believe we could sell as many as we could get into the country.  It is because technology has switched.  Electric vehicles have overcome issues such as range anxiety and they are a very enjoyable drive compared to what they may have been before.  The cost of EVs is driven by some of the component parts.  It is the same with solar PV, which now costs 80% of what it used to cost.  We see demand increase on that basis.  We see the same with retrofit.  When we get better at doing retrofit, and when we can reduce costs as we move through the decade, it is the same concept, we see the capacity for us to start delivering at the levels we speak to when technology will allow us to do that.  As Ms McCarthy outlined in relation to the national heat study, we see where we can target our interventions and start to really ramp things up.</p> <p>  Regarding Ireland's retrofit programme, we spoke last week to 20 countries at the International Energy Agency.  All of those countries want to hear about what is happening in Ireland because what we are doing is class leading.  That is feedback that we have got through the week in email after email asking questions about how they can do what we are doing.  From that perspective, we are very happy that progress has been made, but we are not going to sit on our hands, we have got to get better at this because we must deliver the 500,000, an increase from 8,000 and onwards up to the numbers that Deputy Whitmore has asked about.</p> <p>  E-bikes are a policy issue for the Department of Transport.  We see the value in e-bikes, in particular in the context of increased cycling infrastructure that has been put in place by many local authorities at the moment, which we welcome.</p> <p>  I have touched on the piece around technology.  A lot of what is happening at the moment, and what will get us to 2030 and also 2050, will be technology.  Ms McCarthy referenced that right now we do not have time to wait for certain technologies that people promised would arrive in 2029.  They said that we should hold off until then, but we need to take action today based on the technology that we have and to push forward on that basis.</p> <p>  A question was not asked on research and development, but SEAI has a significant budget and we work with industry and academia to take technology and apply it in the Irish context.  We are very different to many other parts of the world.  We have a different reliance on fossil fuels and a different opportunity with offshore wind, onshore wind and onshore solar.  Technology is an important part of what we are doing in SEAI.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#K00700"><p>I thank the SEAI for the presentation.  I might go back and forth if that is okay.  I will start with a big-picture question.  Would it not make more sense to go about this in an entirely different way?  I mean instead of providing grants, which introduce an element of regressiveness, in that those who can afford to match funding get the benefit of funding.  Instead of relying on private companies to get involved - we know of only two so far that are one-stop shops - would it not be better to go about this an entirely different way and say that it is a crucial priority for us to retrofit all of these homes?</p><p>More than 1 million homes have been identified as being poorly insulated.  Should we not establish a State-run company to do it?  This would create tens of thousands of green jobs.  It would be done at zero upfront cost to homeowners because the State will be able to borrow at a lower rate than any homeowner would.  We could share out the costs between the State and homeowner over a period of 15 or 20 years.  Would that not be a simpler, more direct way of doing it, as well as being more in line with the scale of the crisis, primarily the climate crisis but also the cost-of-living issues people are experiencing?</p></speech>

The Deputy expressed a very fine view but this is a matter of Government policy.  We have been working with our parent Department.  I know there was a retrofit working group at Secretary General level, which made proposals that were accepted by the Government.  This is, therefore, the route we are on at the moment.  The Deputy will appreciate that we are not really in a position to comment directly on his suggestion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#L00300"><p>I thank Deputy Murphy very much for his question.  From our perspective, as Mr. Byrne mentioned, the national retrofit task force commissioned a body of work which looked at different models adopted elsewhere in the world.  It also engaged internally in Ireland Inc. with the Construction Industry Federation and a whole host of stakeholders.  This is the model that was adopted.</p> <p>  To give one note of caution, which relates to Deputy Whitmore's comments, we do not have any time to lose here or to stop and think about what else we could do.   It is crucially important that this retrofit plan drives forward.  We believe we have ensured, insofar as possible, that this is effective and efficient from a value-for-money perspective in terms of Exchequer funding, carbon tax revenue, etc.  It has taken us probably four years to get ourselves into the space we are now in, registering one-stop shops for a comprehensive scheme with the private sector on board and funding available in the NDP.  Those wheels do not move fast but we are in a good space now to spring forward and deliver the homes we need to deliver the carbon savings provided for under the climate Act as well as our sectoral emissions.</p> <p>  What is powerful about this figure of 3.5 million tonnes is that is down to a citizen level.  It is a matter of individuals.  It is a matter of what people understand and about asking citizens of Ireland to do something.  From that perspective, it is very much asking people to do their piece and control what is controllable within their environment.</p></speech>

It is asking individuals to do this, as opposed to saying that as a society we need to do it and that if I, as an individual, cannot afford &euro;25,000 and do not qualify for the warmer homes scheme because I do not receive any social welfare payments, I will be able to benefit from and participate in this transformative change that we need to happen rapidly.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh made the point that there is no time to lose.  I could not agree more.  In that case, why has the &euro;8 billion allocated been so dramatically backloaded?  I can understand a certain lead-in time.  I presume that is the explanation to get the scheme up and running and so on.  However, it takes a long time to hit the high rates.  Of the &euro;8 billion, over &euro;5 billion is due to be spent in the last three years of the scheme.  It ramps up very slowly.  In 2023, the sum provided is less than &euro;300 million.  In 2024, it is less than &euro;400 million and in 2025, it is less than &euro;500 million.  Why is it so slow to reach the levels of the &euro;2 billion a year, which will be hit by 2030?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#L00500"><p>That is a very good question.  It leans back into the point that Mr. Walsh made earlier about the precursor to this, the report by the national retrofit task force.  The task force did significant work, not just consulting domestically with a whole range of sectors but also looking at a whole range of international examples to identify what might or might not work.  It is on that basis that we are building targets and measures that we think are achievable.  These take account of the capacity of the supply chain, labour market availability, inflation and how it has moved in, as well as the ability to generate demand.  That was the basis on which targets were to build up slowly.  Experience has shown that where you build them up slowly, even potentially too slowly, but in a way that means they are sustainable and deliverable and give people time to build up, you end up in a much more sustainable market.</p> <p>  The other important issue with retrofit is that we are going into people&rsquo;s homes.  As I mentioned, a retrofit cannot be retrofitted.  It is therefore important that we build that quality piece and get the systems and processes right.  We really do not want to go gangbusters at this and then find out we have done the wrong thing or are not doing it the right way or we end up with issues.  That is why there is some degree of caution in building up and getting it right the first time.  We are building the building blocks up to 2030.  In reality, we are building the blocks for beyond that.  We are really aiming at 2050.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#L00700"><p>Quickly, Deputy.</p></speech>

In fact, for some private renters, this will mean they will get evicted.  The landlords will decide to take advantage of this scheme and upgrade the home, which will allow them to say it is a renovation.  On that basis, they can do what is known as a &ldquo;renoviction&rdquo; of tenants.  Even if people get to stay in the property, the landlord will be able to hike up the rents.  Landlords will not get the benefit of reduced heating costs so they will presumably take back that benefit in rent, that is, if they engage in this scheme in the first instance.  Is it planned to give more to benefit those in private rented accommodation?  Again, it seems to me that a more simple way of going about this would be to say that by a specific date - 2030 or whatever - the standards required to have private rented accommodation will include achieving a BER of B1 or higher.  Is anything more planned for private renters?</p></speech>

In terms of the private rental market, the scheme is open to non-commercial landlords to upgrade their properties.  We do not have direct evidence of people being evicted on foot of doing a retrofit.  As we confirmed earlier, it is possible to do a significant level retrofit without having somebody move out.  That does not mean it will not happen.  We have other agencies, however.  The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, has statutory powers in that regard.</p> <p>  On the rental sector, our understanding from the Housing for All plan is that it is planned to introduce a minimum BER standard by 2025.  That will generate activity in this area.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O&rsquo;Mahony to comment further on the rental sector and the split incentive issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#L01000"><p>The Deputy is correct that the rental sector is a difficult sector to address.  Everybody talks about the split incentive, whereby the landlord owns the property and gets the benefit of the capital improvement, but the tenant bears the operational cost.</p> <p>  On the issue of decanting, we typically have not seen that happening at large volume in our schemes to date.  I recognise that we want to scale the numbers through this decade.  That is because we need to build the supply chain with us, as my colleague just mentioned.  The State is looking at minimum energy performance requirements for rental properties, as well as for all properties.  This is a proposal contained within the Fit for 55 package that is being reviewed at the moment.  That direction of travel is already being discussed at policy level, both nationally and within Europe.  </p> <p>  I will revert to one issue, which would apply to all homeowners or people.  We are trying to support the retrofit of homes, but every one of these homes has a person in it, where that person owns the property or rents it.  We are very much aware of that.  Over the last decade, we have acquired considerable experience.  In the schemes we are deploying in 2022 and going forward, we spent a lot of work doing voice of the customer, VoC, surveys.  We asked people beforehand what they understood about SEAI and then asked what their experience was going through the process with SEAI.  We tried to profile the type of people who do upgrades.  Traditionally, people would have said that solar PV would be younger people who are possibly in newer homes.  What we found, however, was that older people concerned about their energy bills have been installing solar PV.  People are also using it in homes that are already improved and have come through one of our schemes.  We learned a lot like that.</p> <p>  Last year, we carried out a number of focus groups and surveys and visited individual houses when retrofit works were taking place.  Homeowners agree that they need to do something but they believe Government needs to help.  When we were developing the new schemes - the better energy homes scheme, shallower measures, the one-stop shops and the warmer homes scheme - homeowners told us that retrofitting was too expensive and they needed more supports.</p><p>That is why we came up with the recommended supports that are now in place.  A deep retrofit will be about half the cost and it will cost 80% less for shallower measures.  These are targeted correctly.  We are trying to address the upfront costs through the grants.  Homeowners also said that if there was a low-cost financing package available, they would consider taking action now.  We all know these things but homeowners are coming back and telling us this.</p><p> Last year, the heat pump grant was &euro;3,500.  We have nearly doubled it to &euro;6,500.  Homeowners have said that they would be interested in a heat pump but it is too expensive and they would be interested in a heat pump if the costs was equivalent to the cost of an oil or gas boiler.  That is what we did this year.  We rearranged how the grant offering is presented.  If homeowners upgrade their house and insulate it, they are left with the decision on whether to leave the heat pump behind, which they do not want to do because the cost is the same as installing a replacement oil or gas boiler.  We are trying to drive people in this direction and support them.  They are coming back saying this to us.</p><p> Homeowners have also said they like how the one-stop shop brings them from start to finish.  They like that approach where the measures are taken using a stepped approach rather than all in one go.  They may need to do their walls this year and their heating system next year.  They see the benefit of the one-stop shop.  We have listened to what people are saying both in and outside our schemes.  We have also tried to structure the schemes to build for the future.</p><p> I refer to a point mentioned by my colleague, Ms McCarthy.  The heat study is another piece of work that was carried out.  It tells us that there are other ways in which we can help people reduce the carbon footprint of their home and help the State as well.  We do not foresee that the supports we offer today will be fixed for the next decade.  We foresee that we will be introducing new technologies, ramping down other technologies and finding solutions that meet homeowners' needs.  We will be reacting to what the homeowner wants.  That is why the heat study is really important because it raises these questions that challenge certain assumptions about heat pumps, solar PV panels or energy efficiency.  In the next year or so, we will focus on, test and try to learn about some of those measures, such as the heat loss indicator.</p></speech>

The word "renoviction" is new to me.  From an SEAI perspective, we have a social justice element to our work but we also need to protect our retrofit brands.  We will keep this matter on our radar.  We can certainly engage with the RTB to see what is happening there and to ensure we introduce any measures we can to avoid that scenario and incentivise the landlord market in an appropriate fashion.</p></speech>

It would not be fair to members to spend all the time I would need to go through all the questions I have, so I will put only a few of them to the witnesses.  I am very happy to hear about the national heat study that was just mentioned by Mr. O'Mahony and referred to earlier in the session.  I had a good read of the report on the train this morning but I did not get all the way through it.  It looks like a very good study and I commend the SEAI, in the first instance, on it.  It is a significant piece of work that will help the SEAI charge forward.  I think we will be leaning on it for some years to come.  Of course, it will evolve and I am sure there will be reviews of it in time.</p> <p>  One issue that jumped out at me was the four scenarios that are posited for reducing emissions and reducing energy use in buildings through to 2050.  There is a baseline but there are also the balanced, high electrification, decarbonised gas and rapid progress scenarios.  In the cumulative graph, there is a significant gap between the rapid progress scenario and the other scenarios in terms of cumulative emissions.  It is 60 or 70 megatonnes over the course of the programme, through to 2050, which amounts to about one full year of Ireland's total emissions.  I am interested to hear more about that.  Everybody has correctly spoken about the urgency of this.  Is the rapid progress path one that we can achieve and is it what the SEAI is aiming to achieve?</p> <p>  The study also mentions district heating, which is an area we are way behind on in this country.  There is some good work being done.  Will the SEAI tell us more about the potential for district heating?  I am curious to know whether it has engaged with local authorities on the issue.  The development plans will be finalised in the coming months and it seems to me that if district heating is not built into local authority development plans, progress on district heating might be stalled for a few years.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses talk about the legislative barriers to prevent further installation of fossil fuel boilers?  What are those barriers?  Can they be removed and when should they be removed?  I will come back with more questions in the second round.</p></speech>

As he said, there are four scenarios considered in the heat study, one looking at decarbonised gas, another concentrating on the deployment of electrification, another being a balanced view of that, and, as the Chair mentioned, a rapid progress scenario, which sees fast and large-scale deployment of readily available technologies.  The rapid progress scenario is ambitious in exceeding current climate action plan actions.  That has been recognised within the ambitious climate action plan, which called out the national heat study in a number of actions as it would inform the future 2022 climate action plan.  Those discussions are already in place.  We have been working closely with our colleagues within our parent Department and other Departments, such as the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Transport, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, on the outcomes from the heat study.</p> <p>  I refer to the point made about the rapid progress scenario.  The key recommendation for action coming from the heat study, and this goes back to points made by Mr. Walsh and a number of Deputies and Senators, is that we cannot afford to lose time.  The rapid progress scenario is essentially based on the deployment of technologies that are available today and can be rolled out at scale and at pace.  These include heat pumps.  One can already see a significant target within the climate action plan to deliver those and the strong potential of district heating to deliver to the residential sector across the country.</p> <p>  On the second question, the study has identified strong potential, much more than previously identified, for district heating.  The national heat study took almost two years to complete and more than 50 experts contributed to the delivery of the report.  There was significant engagement with stakeholders across the heat and energy sectors and the report provides a comprehensive view.  The district heating piece looked at the geospatial identification of where the potential might be at an initial stage.  It has identified where there is very high potential, medium potential and where there are areas that need to be investigated more.  District heating is an obvious no-regrets policy movement forward in terms of urban centres and even some of the larger towns around the country.  It has fed directly into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's co-ordinated steering group with all stakeholders in the area, which is examining what the barriers are and what requirements are needed to deploy district heating at a faster pace than previously.</p><p>That includes all elements from financial to planning and regulatory to the actual utility around installation of pipelines etc.  I cannot emphasise enough how much district heating is strongly supported by the national heat study.  There are actions in play, however, and it is expected those actions will be very clearly delineated.  Obviously, it is not for me to say and, as my colleagues said, policy is set through the Department, but I believe it is more than likely the intention is to identify these actions in the next action plan.</p><p> In terms of the legislative barrier, to go back to my earlier point of the heat study and the B2 target, the heat study is saying that it is very important to have efficiency measures rolled out at scale.  Reducing our energy demands is of significant importance but we continue to grow our emissions due to economic recovery, population growth and a range of factors.  We also need to consider how to eliminate fossil fuels out of our heating sector to reach net zero by 2050.  There is a strong recommendation from the heat study effectively to announce or state a timetable for the removal of fossil fuels from the different sectors such as residential, industry, commercial, public buildings etc.  Different levels of timelines are identified in the heat study.  Obviously, this is a study to inform policy, so different levels of timelines are identified, but in the rapid progress, they are fairly imminent.</p><p> Again, that is something for discussion and consideration in the Department.  It is taking into consideration the timelines that have been identified through the heat study and considering how those can be borne out through a timetable for the elimination of fossil fuels.  Obviously, however, there are things to consider such as, if there is a timetable, what the market lag would be in areas that are identified for district heating.  Can we eliminate fossil fuel oil and gas boilers within a timeframe that allows people to be able to avail of district heating zones or else will they be given significant lag time to be able to install heat pumps, for example?  All of that will be taken into consideration as policy decisions emerge in terms of that timetable.</p></speech>

I will finish reading the report on the train home on Thursday and will probably get some answers to my own questions.  We will move to the second round of questioning.  Senator Boylan is first up.</p></speech>

That quote can have a more significant and immediate emissions reduction impact than a fabric-first approach.  Maybe it is one for Ms McCarthy to address.  Will she tease out for us what exactly she means?  Is that taking out the oil boiler and just replacing it with more efficient heating and not retrofitting?</p> <p>  The other question is around the Energiesprong model.  It might be said we are where we are so we cannot go back and do it that way.  I think the Energiesprong approach, however, which uses the prefabrication of retrofitting material, has shown it is more efficient in terms of assembly lines.  It is also more attractive to female workers because it is not on-site work; it is factory work.  Has the SEAI considered that Energiesprong prefabrication off-site retrofitting model?  If so, what changes would we need in regulation to bring that into play?</p> <p>  My final question is on the deep retrofit scheme.  The previous iteration of retrofit saw hundreds of thousands of euro going to very wealthy individuals.  It was flagged by certain people that there needed to be a cap on how much was available.  My understanding is it was disbanded.  Is the SEAI still paying out grants on the deep retrofit scheme?</p></speech>

Our deep retrofit scheme was a pilot scheme we ran over two to three years.  With that scheme we developed and piloted a model.  We learned lessons from that scheme, which informed the one-stop shop.  That scheme was to push homeowners to upgrade to an A2 BER.  The pilot itself looked at people who could pay a significant amount of money to get that upgrade.  The learnings from it have informed our one-stop shop programme and informed us with regard to the archetypes in the Irish system, that is, the types of houses, which are very different from many other countries in terms of the uniqueness of some of those houses.  I will ask Dr. Byrne if he has anything further to add, then I might just-----</p></speech>

We are finishing off on one set of contracts on that scheme.  We are still paying out grants on that scheme and then we are closing it out.</p></speech>

As I said, the heat study strongly supports fabric efficiency to ensure homes are insulated in terms of health and well-being and in reducing people's energy demand to heat their homes.</p> <p>  One thing the study points to is the use of the word "evolution".  The elimination of fossil fuels has to become very much a key feature of the upgrade conversation with homeowners.  We need to look at the optimal level of upgrade to ensure that if a person gets to a stage of investment in his or her home and is debating between replacing his or her gas boiler or continuing with some of the deeper retrofit upgrades, he or she strongly considers the heat pump installation at a level that is appropriate.  In other words, he or she is putting a heat pump into a home that can operate well and keep his or her energy bills low.  Therefore, its upgrade has been to that level.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier the heat loss indicator study we are about to launch into, which will look at the optimal level in terms of the indicators from a home to be able to manage installing a heat pump while working within cost-effective ways so that energy costs are not going up and people are still living in comfortable homes.  That will play out.  We are just going through the approval process at the moment.  That will influence the requirements and criteria we roll out through the grants programme in terms of being able to support people on a grant to install a heat pump.  That is just one example.</p></speech>

In 2021, the target was 13,000 heat pumps to be installed.  Was that reached?  What did we do in 2021?  If we did not reach it, how are we going to fix not reaching it?</p></speech>

I will have to check that and come back to the Senator.  I am not entirely clear that the target was 13,000 for 2021; it sounds a bit high.  I can come back to the Senator with the absolute data, however.</p></speech>

The technology is advancing at a rapid pace.  We had our energy show last week at which all the heat pump manufacturers took stalls.  From speaking to them, there is significant interest and much commercial investment going into heat pumps, both commercial and residential.  The technology is similar to other technology; it is getting better.  We are very much seeing a move towards that.  As Ms. McCarthy and Mr. O'Mahony pointed out, our heat loss indicator will help us to establish exactly the right point at which a heat pump will work efficiently to keep bills low and provide heat in the home from an Irish perspective and establish what measures we have to take to get us there with a view potentially to lowering the figure we have at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#N01500"><p>I have some follow-up questions.  Is the SEAI of the opinion that planning permission is needed for external installation or is it exempt?</p><p>On what basis would it be exempt?  Some masters students went to the effort of contacting every local authority throughout the State and there was a mixture of opinions from various planning departments.  I would like to have the SEAI's perspective on that.  With regard to engagement with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, I have had reason to be in contact with the Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board, ETB, and there is much work going on there.  How quickly is a scaling up of courses expected to be available?</p><p> Will the SEAI comment on the sustainable energy communities, SECs, in regard to the opportunity it sees there?  I certainly see an opportunity.  Every time I meet the SECs they reference a new grant or support that is to be available to them to support good work.  They refer to it as LEAF funding but I do not know how the SEAI refers to it.  When might we see that?</p><p> There are concerns in terms of the equity test.  A number of members have made the point about lifting people out of energy poverty.  It is interesting to hear from the SEAI representatives about the evolving nature of the schemes, the pivot from energy poverty to energy efficiency, the various studies including the heat loss indicator study which then maybe points towards a different metric for assessing the appropriate intervention.  I refer to a stage where a heat pump might not be the way forward.  We might project ourselves forward post the heat loss indicator study to say there might be significant emissions reductions in a poorly insulated house to take it from BER rating G to C and a heat pump might not be the answer there.  What might the alternative system be in such houses?  Are they likely to be supported in the time ahead?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#O00400"><p>That is dependent upon the competent authority which is the local authority responsible where that house is located.  Typically full planning permission is not needed.  It is necessary to go for derogation.  In general this applies to areas where there may be conservation requirements on particular homes in those areas.  The masters student is correct, it does vary depending on where the house is and upon the local requirements therein.  In general, we have not come across challenges for people to do this but there are challenges where people say that red-brick homes around Dublin or some of the urban centres could be more of a challenge because the aesthetic is being changed, with a newer front compared with neighbouring houses.</p> <p>  The last Senator to speak mentioned Energiesprong.  We are aware of that.  That is suited to where there are homes of the exact same typology constructed together.  We are going to be looking at that.  We have previously worked closely with the local authorities in retrofitting homes and we think there is an opportunity for innovation in this sector going forward.  The last couple of years have been focused on getting everything up and running and getting the programme moving but there will be opportunities for that type of approach and other approaches.  We are aware of them.  We are considering them in our future work programme.</p> <p>  I will answer this last question and if I have missed anything I will come back.  There was a question regarding what if I do not put in a heat pump.  Our programmes are focused on a B2 target.  If you do shallow measures you do not have to get to the B2 target, so you go to a C3 or a G home I think was mentioned.  That can happen and that homeowner may continue to use his or her oil or gas boiler.  They will have captured the comfort benefits for themselves and the reduced energy costs and they will have a healthier home.  However, as Ms McCarthy mentioned, we look at this as a whole throughout the State and our long-term goal is to decarbonise all of these homes for society.  We are aware of that and that is why we want to put those homes on this pathway to B2 or zero emission homes as discussed in Fit for 55 and other European directives in which we are participating.  We are cognisant of that but some of those homeowners may retain their existing heating appliance or if it is near end-of-life, they may replace it and there are going to be other solutions that we mentioned.  There are going to be biofuels that could potentially be used.  There are Irish companies looking at this sector as well.  We do not see the solution being homogenous, that it will only be heat pumps for everybody.  There will be solutions required depending on the home and the location.  </p></speech>

We have an active context with the ETB sector.  Five of them are prioritised, they are specialists in the green economy, the nearly zero emissions building, NZEB, and retrofit area.  The Deputy mentioned the Laois and Offaly ETB.  We have actively engaged with Laois and Offaly ETB in our training centre in Mount Lucas.  We have linked in some of our contractors with the ETBs because they are bringing the students and the people coming to upskill or reskill and we are linking those in with our contractors on the actual programmes.  I have engaged directly also with Limerick and Clare ETB recently in regard to its centre, understanding its needs and making sure it is aware of our programmes and scales of ambition and I am aware of what it is doing in order that we can join the two together.  Once we get through the registration process with the one-stop shops, one of our key deliverables will be effectively to have networking sessions between the ETBs and the one-stop shops in order to join them together.  We have done that already in the warmer homes scheme.</p> <p>  On the LEAF,as the Deputy called it, in respect of sustainable energy communities, that is the local energy activation fund and we are currently working on that.  That is another policy area.  Ultimately it will be decided by the Government and the Minister.  It is a small-scale grant.  The whole thesis there is really the catalyst-type grant for sustainable communities.  We did a significant piece of work on it which we hope to complete very soon.  It is about getting those smaller grants to communities to allow them effectively catalyse people moving into the one-stop shops and other energy schemes as well.   </p></speech>

It relates to the risks to meeting the targets.  Dr. Byrne mentioned supply chain capacity as a concern or a challenge in the current market.  I have been through the retrofitting process recently and it is very difficult to get workers and materials.  Has the SEAI done a risk analysis of the current inflationary rates or the current supply chain constraints?  Has scenario modelling on the risks to meeting the targets been carried out?  This would include such as things as likelihood of longer timeframes.  Has that piece of work been done?</p> <p>  The Chair mentioned that this session is not about EVs but the SEAI mentioned the budget for technology.  One of the things with EVs that many of us have concerns about is the significant investment, I believe it is &euro;10 billion,that is being put into this sector.  Many people cannot afford a new EV.  There are options to retrofit cars.  This is a much cheaper way of doing it as it would mean that people who cannot afford brand new cars can still transition to a zero-carbon transport model.  It is also the most environmentally-friendly if it uses the existing car structure.  Has the SEAI considered EV retrofitting?  Some work has been done.  Some people in my constituency of Wicklow have done it and are working on it.  I understand that it is done to a much greater degree in other countries such as the Netherlands.  Has the SEAI examined that as a potential?</p></speech>

I will break it down into two parts, what I describe as a before and after.  Before is before the war in Ukraine and after is the last 40 days.  In launching the one-stop shops we had a significant amount of market and behavioural analysis and also quantity surveying of our schemes and looking at that, as well as discussing with the contractors, the prospective OSSs, their capability and capacity to deliver, looking at the market ability and looking at the schemes in existence.  We mentioned the national home retrofit pilot scheme, which would have given us many lessons.  We built all of that into the schemes.  We built inflation at a certain level into the scheme as was.  It would be fair and reasonable to say that the world has shifted in the last 40 days.  There were already concerns about inflation and the supply chain prior to the start of February and they have absolutely accelerated.  We are looking again at the schemes in terms of quantity surveying and understanding where we are now, having built them in.  It is moving very fast so we are in that space at present.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Walsh to comment on the EV scheme.  I can do retrofitting buildings, but not retrofitting EVs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#P00200"><p>Regarding EVs, we have been approached about the concept of retrofitting and we have looked at it, but I do not have the answer to that.  We can certainly come back with a response to that.</p> <p>  As regards electric vehicles generally, the technology is expensive at present and there is a host of very good people internally in SEAI who are fascinating to listen to about the technology that is developing and evolving for electric vehicles.  One common piece that we hear, even speaking to the suppliers or the importers, which is what they are called because they import from different parts of the world depending on where the manufacturer is, is cost parity by mid-decade or shortly afterwards, primarily driven by the production levels.  At present, most manufacturers are producing internal combustion engines.  Once that switches and the electric vehicles are built in the bigger factories, as there is a requirement for economies of scale, that is where there is a real opportunity to reduce costs.  Clearly, as Dr. Byrne mentioned, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has not helped with materials and minerals that are required to build batteries and so forth.  Also, some of the supply chain in certain brands is in both Ukraine and Russia, so that will certainly have an impact on particular manufacturers.</p> <p>  The piece with electric vehicles is that we all are focused on electric vehicles; my mind is pivoted on this.  It is cars and internal combustion engines we are taking off the road.  If a two-car family becomes a one-car family with an electric bicycle or whatever might be the case, that is really where the sweet spot will be.  I realise that is a generic remark to make in the context of homeowners, but it is the concept of what we are taking off the road and what we have to put back on the road to address transport concerns for people, whether that transport is a service or is using another form that is not an electric vehicle.  They are the highlights.</p> <p>  With regard to the concept of retrofitting existing vehicles on the road to an electric vehicle, we will revert to the committee with the research we have done on that in the Irish context.</p></speech>

The committee has been hearing that frequently and it is good to hear that SEAI is thinking along the same lines.  Ms McCarthy wants to respond to some of the questions.</p></speech>

In a general sense, the SEAI research, development and deployment programme is our annual competitive call and support for research.  We do quite an amount of consultation across Departments, State agencies and internally with our own experts across delivery programmes to identify topics where there are gaps in the knowledge and in the way we can deploy and deliver in-market but also around technologies for the longer term.  Within the same call we also have an open topic, so ideas can be proposed by the applicant.  That is open to both industry and universities.  Collaborations are what we are really looking for across those groups.  That will open in the coming days for this year but, unfortunately, I do not have to hand what research we have in play currently or what awards are out there, but it is certainly an opportunity where we look at topics such as the one the Deputy raised and support them through that scheme.</p></speech>

One is what the interest rate will be on the low-interest loan.  I saw different numbers suggested.</p> <p>  Second, what is the SEAI's estimate of the number of attic and cavity homes which have not yet reached an acceptable standard and could be supported by the 80% grant?  That is certainly low-hanging fruit in terms of immediate response in the present environment.  In addition, what is its view on moving estate by estate?  In my constituency, some estates have very bad insulation standards.  They are known from when they were built.  Often, they are older estates.  Rather than waiting for the individuals to approach the one-stop shop, there is clearly an opportunity to take some of the estates with the worst standards and go in with a package for them and the authority could get a lot of people doing it together.  Is that feasible or is the authority depending on sustainable energy communities to pull those together or the one-stop shop?  How might that lower-hanging opportunity be achieved?</p> <p>  Is there potential to accelerate solar installation?  The committee heard about barriers because of lack of guidelines, but can we accelerate that?</p> <p>  Finally, there are 90,000 vacant homes that are deemed accessible to coming back into use in some shape or form.  Has the authority looked at that cohort of homes as potentially a win-win to combine what the authority is doing with, for example, the repair and lease scheme or some of the other schemes that are available, and go with an enhanced package?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#P00600"><p>I will take some of those questions and also bring in my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony.  Regarding a low-interest rate loan, I cannot specify a rate at present but what we are talking about is a significant discount to that available in the current market.  There are figures being kicked around and I have seen them, but it is not appropriate for me to mention a figure because nothing is validated as yet.  However, it is considered to be at a significant discount to the rates available in the current market from the pillar institutions.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. O'Mahony to comment on the attic and cavity question.  In terms of estate by estate, that is exactly the principle of what we are doing.  The Deputy spoke about aggregation.  When one speaks to a contractor, the contractor wants to make business efficient for it, so it has to go into an estate and rather than going to number 1, number 7 and number 13 and then trying to find another couple of customers, the contractor wants to build the schemes and link them in a way whereby they go through the estate.  From the customer's point of view, one does the whole lot.  The other piece is where people get their information.  They trust scientists and certain places.  They trust their community organisations, the sustainable energy communities, SECs, and community-based marketing.  Some of the community-based marketing that will happen through the SECs will link the one-stop shops to those types of estates, but we are making sure the structures are in place and the schemes are developed in a way that they can do that.  In other words, what we are about is retrofitting homes, and how they are paid for and who pays for them is nearly a secondary consideration.  Once we retrofit the homes we get the carbon emissions down, and it is to make it as efficient as possible to do that work.</p> <p>  Regarding the acceleration of the solar scheme, we believe there is capacity to accelerate that scheme.  It is going particularly well at present.  We have seen almost a trebling of applications in the scheme between January and March.  Obviously, the current crisis has improved that even further and we believe there is potential to scale that.  However, we have to be careful.  It was a &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million business last year so within that one has to be careful.  One can scale it to a point, but one does not want to scale it to a point where one breaks it.</p> <p>  We have commenced our engagement with the local authorities on the retrofit package.  They have been doing retrofit, we have been doing retrofit and we have had the midlands pilot scheme.  We have engaged again in talking about the aggregation piece.  Certainly, the vacant homes is an area that we can look at with them in terms of how we join up.  Again, it goes back to the end point, which is about ensuring that we retrofit as much as possible to reduce emissions.</p><p>To some extent, we nearly have to supersede, insofar as we can, various silos, budgets and thought processes where we do our bit and you do your bit.  We have commenced that engagement with the local authorities.  Looking at the so-called low-hanging fruit, the vacant homes could be a very useful discussion.</p><p> I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Mahony, to comment on the potential number of cavity-insulated walls out there.</p></speech>

Only a couple of months ago, we updated them based upon the 80% grant.  We will provide them afterwards.</p> <p>  The second point is on solar.  A further point to note is the issues that might constrain the deployment of that.  People talk about our planning.  The planning requirement is that up to 12 sq m can be installed on a roof, which covers most homes and provides at least a 2 kW system to people's houses, which is probably the appropriately sized system people want.  Some people want larger ones than that, for which planning permission is required at present.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is looking at that but that change is requiring strategic environmental assessment to be carried out, which I understand is under way at present.</p> <p>  The other element is on the grid side.  ESB Networks has done an analysis on that and people can deploy solar photovoltaic, PV, on residential properties without any issue.  It has scaled up its administration side with regard to people applying for grid connections through the NC6 process, and that has happened already.</p> <p>  Connected to that, smart meter roll-out is progressing.  In excess of 700,000 smart meters are deployed at this stage and the figure is growing year on year to support people who are interested in generating their own energy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#Q00300"><p>I want to add one or two pieces to both Dr. Byrne's and Mr. O'Mahony's comments regarding estate by estate.  The solar PV scheme has been good for us in terms of our one-stop shop model.  We have 800,000 building energy ratings, BERs.  As an organisation, we have a geographic information system, GIS, map that shows where the low-hanging fruit is for many of these one-stop shops, and we will be able to provide them with intelligence-based information where they can go and knock on doors.</p> <p>  I will come back quickly to the solar PV scheme, where we have seen the installers who are working with us have been excellent at delivering this scheme and ensuring that when they go into an estate, they put up the sign locally that they are doing the work and their pipeline is driven by referral on the spot.  The solar PV scheme was set up in recent years.  We have had the opportunity to get some of the learnings we will implement with the one-stop shop.</p> <p>  There is a secret sauce, as it were, with solar PV.  People are very interested in it.  If we could get people as interested in retrofit as they are in solar PV, we would be absolutely flying.  Those are merely some further comments I wanted to add to those of my colleagues.</p></speech>

Where that is not happening, and Mr. Walsh touched on this, not because there is not community buy-in but because there are strangers living on the street, there is no residents' association and there is no group, what happens then?  If I am at No. 1, do these guys come along and physically knock on the doors of Nos. 2, 3 and 4 stating they are doing this work down the road and it would be beneficial and cost-effective for them to do it?  How does the SEAI do that outreach where there is no community group coming together to say it wants to retrofit ten of these houses all at once?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022040500002#Q00600"><p>That will be done by the one-stop shops.  They are engaged in it.  Most of them have a sales and marketing outfit for doing that.  As Mr. Walsh mentioned, we can help them target them using the building energy rating, BER, database, on which we have nearly 1 million BERs.  In a weird kind of way, their success is our success.  From a business perspective, every time someone is walking the streets or driving into an estate, it is cost.  The more we can target them, the better.</p> <p>  There will be an element of the communities.  Within the communities, typically in towns and villages, not every estate is linked in to it but they can be pushed in the right direction.  We are also talking about supplying leaflets to local authorities so that when they do local authority homes, they can drop a leaflet in to neighbouring houses stating what is being done next door to the local authority home and giving contact details for the local one-stop shop or the one-stop shop programme so that neighbouring houses can get it done too.  It will be a combination of all of those.</p> <p>  The experience, anecdotally, in the solar scheme Mr. Walsh mentioned and as referenced in the media previously is that when people see it being done in their neighbours' homes, a good example of which is external wall insulation, which is visible, as well as insulating the home it has a nice aesthetic effect on the home in terms of changing the entire frontage of the home.  Many of the referrals from one come from the other.  One will see contractors going up through estates, maybe not doing every house in a street, but certainly one begets another one.  The push is to try to get as many people as possible.</p></speech>

We see the ambitious plans we have with apprenticeships and getting people into the market who can do these retrofits.  What has the SEAI in place in terms of quality of standard and quality of care for contractors who are registered with it?  Will the witnesses outline what safeguards the SEAI has in place to make sure the quality of work is top standard so that we can reduce the chances of a cowboy builder or someone who is not up to scratch getting involved in this?</p></speech>

We deal with them slightly differently.</p> <p>  On the installers who are doing the individual measures, it is basically driven by competency.  One has to be registered with the SEAI to participate in our schemes.  That ensures an installer has the right level of competency and it is also a business that is paying tax, is insured etc.  Also, as part of that agreement in registration, when works are complete, we carry out inspections of them.  We feed that information back to the homeowner and to the contractor.  Primarily, it is important the contractor or the installer understands our technical requirements.  We get involved on an individual basis by going on site to do an accompanied inspection with them and by doing workshops with them.</p> <p>  At the one-stop shop level, our engagement is at a slightly different level because we are dealing with somebody who is doing everything from a technical design all the way through to the quality as well.  We engage with them, both on that individual inspection level but also on how their business is working with regard to delivering all those services.  Therefore, there is another layer on top of it.  It is how the one-stop shop is working and how it is delivering the quality to the homeowner - everything from how the business is run to the customer interface, the quality on the ground and the handover to the homeowner.</p></speech>

If I am a homeowner new to this and I must work alongside the SEAI to pick a contractor, it would be useful and would provide a level of guidance if there was a standard table or feedback in the same way as is seen with a restaurant.  It would state the number of contractors in County Louth and give the top ten based on reviews of works that had been carried out in the past ten or 12 months.  People can be quite overwhelmed when they see so many contractors, and it can be difficult to decide who to go with if there is not a level of local knowledge about who is the best.</p> <p>  When this was first announced, it was said this would be used as an excuse for evil landlords to evict renters.  The point is the vast majority of retrofitting does not require the individual to move out of his or her home.  It is not a red herring but maybe a misunderstanding of what retrofitting is by individuals who stated this would be an excuse for landlords to evict people.  That absolutely will not be the case.  I am fairly sure that in the small number of situations where somebody may have to move out for a retrofit on a rented property, the Department will be keeping a strong eye on that.  What would Dr. Byrne's comments be on that?  Will he outline a situation where an individual would have to move out of a home?  I assume these would be a small percentage of people who would be getting a total and utter retrofit done.  Will Dr. Byrne give a breakdown of how a situation would occur that someone would have to vacate a home to have a retrofit carried out?</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh mentioned the social justice element of our work.  It is incumbent on us to make sure that does not happen.  We do not have information on it but we will be keeping a close eye on it and linking in to the other State agencies and services in this regard.</p><p>For the vast majority of retrofits, people do not need to move out.  What sometimes happens in retrofits, not necessarily on the rental market side, is that somebody decides to do a retrofit as part of a bigger, wider renovation of the home.  For example, they might pull out the kitchen and do the whole thing.  That may be a situation where someone needs to move out of his or her home.  However, if someone is in a home and doing the broad B2 level retrofit, there are very few situations where he or she has to move out.  We see it sometimes in warmer homes scheme.  Again, much of it is for health reasons and things such as that, more so than actually having to move out of the home.</p><p> We do not have information on the schemes yet that this is happening or has happened.  We are alert and aware of them.  We have a social justice side as well and it is very important for us because reputational damage could occur quickly, which could have significant impacts as well.  We will be keeping very close watch on this.  If it materialises and becomes a problem, we will be prepared to look at and work on our schemes.  We have levers we could probably put in place in terms of the eligibility for grants and what must happen.  However, it is around doing that massive renovation in which one might be pulling out the entire home or building an extension.  In some cases, people do move out.  However, for the retrofit piece, by and large, people do not have to move out.</p></speech>

The same will happen for the strategic environmental assessment, SEA.  The problem was getting to that point.  The appropriate assessments are not the difficulty.  I believe it is important to put that on the record.  We should see that soon if the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage moves on it, which was something I was concerned about in the first place.</p> <p>  On a personal note, I now have solar panels.  There is an app and it shows me how much I am gaining, which is then shared widely with everybody I know.  It is not just the people on my street.  That kind of shareable information is having a knock-on impact because it can be seen what the gains are.  Are there opportunities to do that across the board, not just with solar but to think innovatively about how we share and use digital and social media to share what the benefits are?  Senator McGahon raised the question of how much a person actually saves from attic insulation and these things.  Is there more the SEAI could be doing around that?  Those are my main comments on it.</p> <p>  To go back to one other point around electric vehicles, EVs, absolutely modal shift has to be number one, but we also need to be very aware that modal shift is only one thing that has to happen.  We also need to be very honest with ourselves that there needs to be a shift across the board in every form of transport.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for the clarification on the appropriate assessment and moving that on.  That has been in the pipeline for a while, so it is very positive to hear.</p> <p>  In terms of the broad piece around digital technologies, we are in the middle of kind of a retrofit revolution, but it is also a digital revolution because what we will be doing in ten years&rsquo; time in terms of building control maintenance and controls and things like that is still evolving.  The idea of using an app to control one's solar panels and see and share among others is one of the technologies.  There is some very good, interesting stuff around heating controls in buildings.  Now, you can look at them remotely and it can help you calculate your savings and things such as that.</p> <p>  On savings, I was a little bit obtuse with the Deputy because it is very hard to pick a single figure.  Again, what people use and how people use homes is different.  There can be two people in the exact same home who use it in a different way.  You can see, for example, from solar panels, very quickly with those types of apps how much energy you are getting from that source, which can be very valuable.  That space is something we are working toward in the future.  When one thinks about the iPhone, for example, which was only launched in 2007, and where it has come to now in 2022, it must be asked what we will be doing in 2030.  It is a very important space to be in.</p></speech>

Speaking to the outreach piece again, how are we reaching those communities and cohorts that are eligible but perhaps do not know they are and are missing out on a very good scheme and the potential to upgrade their homes?</p> <p>  Dr. Byrne already touched on the landlord sector and how non-commercial landlords are eligible for all of the schemes.  However, for whatever reason, a landlord may be interested in doing his or her own home but may not be so interested in doing his or her rental property.  How does Dr. Byrne look at that?  Does he look at that differently?  Are there incentives, perhaps, to landlords to retrofit their rental properties so that, obviously, the benefits pass on then to the tenants?</p> <p>  The last question is taking a big step back from all of this.  The European Commission&rsquo;s energy performance of buildings directive, EPBD, has driven much of the change we have seen over the past 20 years in the built environment sector.  However, as I understand it, that is being reviewed now.  Has the SEAI been involved in any discussions with the Commission?  How would Dr. Byrne see a review of the EPBD impacting on the SEAI&rsquo;s current plans?</p></speech>

The UCC study was very important.  Dr. McCarthy was the primary author of it and I reached out to her to inquire about it.  The Chair is right; it was co-authored with some personnel from MABS.  One of the issues is, broadly speaking, that at the point of engaging with MABS, people have a lot of things going on in their lives.  Therefore, the ability to go forward to start thinking about retrofitting and the next steps forward is not really there.  I took the learnings from that on board and we are looking at our energy poverty schemes.  We have the can-pay scheme and the cannot-pay scheme, which is the warmer homes scheme.  Within the can-pay, it is quite a broad church.  There are people with plenty of money to do it and there are people who do not and who are struggling.  We are constantly evolving our model and looking at what we can do it make it easier.  In terms of what we are talking about now, with leaning in to our sustainable energy communities, we are having more targeted workshops with the likes of MABS, the Peter McVerry Trust, and things such as that.  We then ask, within those frames, how we specifically look at those groups of people rather than leaving it totally as demand-led?  In that cohort of people, there are many things going on in their lives and retrofit is not typically top of the pile.</p> <p>  On landlords, we have touched on it and it is a policy area that we will have to address at a societal level.  There provision for minimum BERs by 2025.  On the question of how to incentivise the landlord, the Chair will appreciate I am being a bit reticent to get into that space, but there is also benefit to the landlord in retrofitting a property he or she owns.  We have demonstrated evidence that moving up the BERs increases the value of the home.  Therefore, there is a capital gains piece.  It may not be the biggest, but in the current housing market it is probably bigger than it was for landlords to do this work.  As we are migrating and going back to that kind of key learning from the heat study, which is to grab the ball, run with it and do it now, we will have to lean back in and look at the policy incentives, what we are doing and whether we are doing enough.  One of the key principles of what we are about in retrofit is trying to be agile.  We are talking here today and I have no doubt that if we come back next year or the year after, we will be saying we are targeting a slightly different sector because we are doing okay in one sector and need to do more in another sector.  We will be at that.</p></speech>

Does the SEAI's data show if a property is a rental property versus privately owned?  Can it say that, if at the end of the year landlords are not taking the opportunities that are in place, it needs to change its approach?</p></speech>

The energy performance building directive is being recast and it is actually connected into the Fit for 55 discussions that are happening at the moment.  They are primarily led through our parent Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p><p>There are several proposals on the table and also some things that are going to happen.  There is talk of having zero-emission buildings by 2050.  The definition needs to be tied down but it effectively means that each building will have an A rating.  We have to get to a position where every building in Ireland or throughout Europe has an A rating.  Taking a step back from that, and based on some of the current proposals, it is a question of ensuring there are no G-rated buildings, which are the worst-performing buildings and comprise about 15% of the building stock.  Another proposal is to focus on removing all the F-rated buildings.  What we are starting to see is an effort to incentivise people and businesses to act and address the worst-performing buildings, namely those with G and F ratings, and eventually those with E ratings.  That is coming down the tracks.  In the other direction, we are trying to build the industry and supply chain at scale to address these matters.</p><p> Also at play when we talk about the energy performance building directives are two main directives of interest to us, namely the energy efficiency directive and the renewable energy directive.  We talked about how microgeneration and renewables could contribute to large-scale decarbonisation, but also decarbonisation at home level.  The energy performance of buildings directive will be seeking to boost renewables that are on-site or to achieve zero emissions on-site while having electricity coming in as well.  We are very much aware of the interplay between the directives.  We are working with our parent department with regard to them.  This is our long-term goal for the State, but we are now focused on building the supply chain.  Let us build momentum among homeowners and the public and commercial sectors so they will want to go on the journey of renovating homes by 2030.</p></speech>

I am not fully aware of the report referred to.  Much of the information is usually on the leaflets of, say, local Deputies.  We have done mailshots.  There was a period in which we found it very difficult to get people to apply for the scheme.  We worked with the Department of Social Protection, which, due to GDPR considerations, could not give us the names and addresses of people, but it could mailshot leaflets for us.  We have taken measures like that.  Dr. Byrne said half of the &euro;8 billion we have is to address the cohort in question, so we will have to find the other 91%.</p></speech>

Several Deputies and Senators touched on this subject.  Mr. Walsh mentioned that there was a BER map, a GIS map.  How well populated is that?  Various groups I have met, including even the likes of Codema in Dublin, are saying they are building from the bottom up but are not there yet.  Does the SEAI have something different?  Is it specifically about BERs?  Are there assumptions on houses built at a certain time or are there assessments?</p></speech>

Is this specifically in relation to the warmer homes scheme?  Are the SEAI&rsquo;s systems sophisticated enough to capture what is required?  Some people eligible for the warmer homes scheme may be financially better off and in a warmer home than some on low incomes and in colder homes but who are ineligible.  Is there information to differentiate between these cohorts at this point?  Is this something the SEAI is examining?</p></speech>

With regard to the BER, which relates to the energy performance of the home, we have the biggest database in the country.  Therefore, we know about the home.  The issue is that it is difficult to get full listings of those in income poverty from the Department of Social Protection, for various reasons.  To get the full picture, it would ideally be a matter of matching the income poverty listing with the listing on homes to get the full picture.  You can work by proxy to a degree and examine cohorts and BER data, based on the view that if you stratify by region, area and cohort, you might get close.  I understand the Department of Social Protection would have quite significant listings of the people on the various types of allowances, but this is not information that can be shared adequately.</p> <p>  On the other point, the BER database exists.  Several companies are working to utilise it.  Companies such as Codema and BERWOW are building packages to get more intelligence from the database to feed back into the market to help with targeting.</p></speech>

We have a million BERs in the database but one triggers a BER if one is renting a home, buying or upgrading.  There is still a cohort who have lived in the same home for the past 39.24 years and have never obtained a BER for it.  There are various levels of data.  It is a matter of using technology insofar as possible and predictive analytics.  This is an area that my colleagues look into.  There are calls put out and funding for this kind of stuff.

Mental Health Ireland has sent its apologies as a representative could not attend today, but it has made a comprehensive written submission, which we all have had the opportunity to read.</p> <p>  The witnesses are here for a round-table discussion on the future funding of higher education.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Ryan to make a brief opening statement, followed by Dr. Duffy, Dr. Morning, Mr. Smyth and, finally, Ms Murphy.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member will have an eight-minute slot to ask questions and for the witnesses to respond.  As we have a sizeable number of witnesses, I will try to keep strictly to the time slots.  I am conscious and wish to bear in mind that two of our witnesses will have to leave before 1.30 p.m.</p> <p>  As everyone will be aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  I remind Members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I now ask the witnesses to make their opening statements in the order I outlined a few moments ago.  They have five minutes each.  Mr. Ryan, the floor is yours.</p></speech>

I am the head of the office of mental health engagement and recovery for the HSE.  What I will speak about relates directly to my work in that role and may come across as quite nuanced, but I think the concepts and what we are here to talk about are scalable in respect of a mental health promotion approach right across HSE work and all health domains.  The role and function of mental health engagement and recovery is to ensure the experience of service users, family members, carers and their supporters informs the design, delivery and evaluation of our mental health services.  This is achieved through co-production processes and ensures the personal lived and recovery experience of service users, family members and carers is used as a service improvement and therapeutic resource within services.  The work of engagement and recovery is central to achieving the person-centred and recovery-orientated service set out in our national policy, Sharing the Vision.  The contemporary understanding of recovery is that of an individual achieving a meaningful life and realising personal goals and ambitions regardless of the presence or severity of his or her mental health challenges.  A recovery-orientated service is one that facilitates an individual in achieving those recovery goals through the provision of clinical excellence and is informed by lived mental health and recovery experience.  Over recent years the HSE mental health service has enhanced the recovery approach in services with a number of innovative initiatives through the office of mental health engagement and recovery.</p> <p>  We have area leads for engagement in all community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  These facilitate approximately 35 local engagement forums, whose membership is made up of service users, family members, carers and other interested stakeholders.  Additionally, we continue to develop a lived experience cohort to our workforce through the introduction of peer support working on multidisciplinary teams and through our recovery education and recovery college structures in partnership with our NGO colleagues in Mental Health Ireland.  Recovery education is about empowering service users, family members, carers, staff and other stakeholders to an enhanced knowledge of recovery and their role in achieving recovery, whether for themselves or in supporting or facilitating others to do so.  In 2022 we expect to have approximately 130 experts by experience working directly in the HSE mental health services.  I am one of those.  Engagement and recovery also oversees the individual placement and support, IPS, programme, which supports people with long-term and enduring mental health challenges to find meaningful work.  According to our latest figures, more than 1,000 people are registered in the IPS programme and 441 people have secured meaningful employment since the start of the programme.</p> <p>  In response to the Department's request for submissions on the future funding of education, engagement and recovery has made a submission on the requirements of a contemporary approach to mental health delivery.  That approach is based on the principles of recovery and person-centredness underpinned and facilitated by lived mental health experience.</p> <p>  Recovery, as I have outlined, is not merely a clinical process.  It also incorporates a personal development process that involves empowering individuals, their families, service providers and communities to be active partners in achieving, supporting and sustaining mental well-being and recovery from mental health challenges.  This recovery approach is very well served by an educational and adult learning model that accesses, supports, uses and enhances personal lived mental health experience.</p> <p>  In a contemporary mental health service, lived experience is an expertise that is essential to the delivery of services that provide maximum opportunities for individuals to recover.  This expertise, in the context of providing a recovery-orientated service, is comparable to other forms of expertise such as clinical, social, occupational etc.</p> <p>  Our third level colleges and further education providers must respond to these new paradigms in healthcare by meeting the educational and training needs of all stakeholders in the health community, notably clinical staff, service users and their families, carers and supporters, to ensure they have the necessary skills to fulfil their respective roles in recovery-orientated services.</p></speech>

Supported by the HSE and other funders, Jigsaw has, over the past 16 years, established a track record in achieving better mental health outcomes for young people by providing a range of primary care therapeutic services for those aged 12 to 25 as well as creating supportive communities around them.</p> <p>  With more than 240,000 students enrolled across the higher education system, our third level institutions are home to a large cohort of Ireland's youth population.  Indeed, when we add those in further education, this number rises to almost 400,000.  As an organisation focused on supporting the mental health of young people in settings where they live, learn, work and play, higher and further education represents an area of great interest for Jigsaw.  At Jigsaw, we recognise that college years represent a key transitional life stage for young people, offering opportunity, challenge, experimentation, unpredictability, instability and more.  Internationally, evidence points to increasing severity and complexity of mental health difficulties among third level students.  Emerging international research also indicates that the Covid-19 pandemic, and its associated consequences have had a disproportionately negative effect on the mental health of third level students.  At Jigsaw, we have experienced this at first hand, where more and more young people aged 18 to 25 are seeking the services of Jigsaw throughout the country and online, but long before Covid, the indicators were not positive.</p> <p>  Jigsaw's My World Survey highlighted the proportion of young adults reporting severe anxiety as having increased from 15% to 26% and those reporting severe depression as having increased from 14% to 21%.  This is over the course of a decade.  These, I am sure members will agree, are alarming figures.  What is clear is the current landscape of mental health and well-being supports for students across higher education institutions, HEIs, nationally is fragmented and inconsistent in nature.  We know that not all HEIs have fully documented guidance on key areas such as mental health policy or protocols for responding to students in distress.  Where such guidance does exist, it is not always clear how it is implemented in practice or embedded in campus life.  Far too often, HEIs rely on the efforts of individual staff members or student bodies rather than adopting a coherent, campus-wide approach.  At Jigsaw, we believe it is imperative a whole-of-campus, collaborative approach is needed, part of which will include the active participation of students and the move towards embedding well-being within the curricula.  This must be a core component of the educational journey of all students.  Indeed, this whole-system approach to student mental health and well-being is recommended in the national student mental health and suicide prevention framework of 2020 and again in the higher education healthy campus charter and framework of 2022.  Jigsaw has first-hand experience of successfully contributing to such an approach within the post-primary sector.  Our One Good School initiative is currently supporting more than 150 post-primary schools in their implementation of a whole-school approach to mental health and well-being, supporting students, educators, school leaders and parents.</p> <p>  To inform this statement, we consulted our youth advocates - a large cohort of youth volunteers who support our work across a range of areas.  What was clear is that, on the ground, many students feel unsupported.  Key takeaways from our talks with young people include their sense of a widespread lack of awareness of where to go for help and, if support is identified, the need to jump through hoops to cross the threshold.  Our youth advocates pushed for the need to create a more sustained focus on mental health and well-being as part of the student experience for all and to move away from once-off initiatives, such as well-being weeks.  They called for a fresh approach, one that includes and involves all facets of the college community and that is collaborative, innovative and open.</p> <p>  At Jigsaw, we fully acknowledge the complexities of addressing mental health and well-being in HEIs, but we believe promoting student mental health and well-being requires much more than a functioning student counselling service.  We need to work collaboratively to address the current fragmented and inconsistent nature of mental health and well-being support available to students to avoid duplication and ensure equitable access to an integrated mental health support system that best meets the needs of all students.  Given the diversification of the student profile in recent years, it is crucial to ensure a range of targeted mental health supports and services are also provided to meet effectively the needs of students who may be considered more at risk.  The valuable roles students play in the lives of one another need to be nurtured.  Peer-based mental health and well-being programmes should be further developed and expanded and become a key feature of HEIs.</p> <p>  What is crystal clear to us in Jigsaw is that increased investment is now needed if we are to make a real, meaningful difference to the mental health and well-being of Ireland's young people and give them the best possible chance at a full and healthy future.  The students of today are our future professionals, parents, politicians and One Good Adult who, in turn, will go on to support the mental health of future generations of young people.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee for this opportunity.  I look forward to comments and questions from members.</p></speech>

I am the mental health content editor at SpunOut, Ireland's youth information service run by young people for young people.  We provide young people in Ireland with access to quality, non-judgemental information services with more than 181,000 readers relying on our information resources every month.  We continually engage with young people through a range of exercises that give us significant insights into the challenges young people face when entering further or higher education.</p> <p>  As my colleague from Jigsaw knows better than me, findings from the seminal My World Survey 2 highlight that poor student mental health is a pervasive and problematic issue in Ireland.  Roughly one fifth of the Irish student population experiences severe depression and anxiety and more than 10% of students reported a suicide attempt.  Research conducted since the Covid-19 pandemic indicates further deterioration in student mental health.  These findings reflect what we see on the ground.  Since the start of 2021, our 50808 text support service has engaged in more than 2,000 conversations with young texters relating to further or higher education.  Anxiety featured as an issue in 43% of these conversations, while 38% of texters talked to us about stress, 21% about isolation, and 15% shared that they were having thoughts of suicide.</p> <p>  Younger students are at an increased risk of mental health difficulties.  For many young people in Ireland, entering further or higher education coincides with a key transition stage in their life.  That comes with challenges and adjustments that impact on mental health.  Young people are frequently presenting to our youth information chat service inquiring about whether they can defer a college course due to their mental health deteriorating.  This underscores the need for sufficiently funded dedicated mental health support services that can provide students with the right intervention at the right time.  We welcome the commitment of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to the issue of student mental health and the recent allocation of an additional &euro;5 million for student counselling and mental health services.  However, we need a longer term strategy for the resourcing of mental health supports in these areas.  College mental health services are facing a rapidly increasing wave of demand.  We urge the committee and indeed the Minister to continue to advocate for dedicated Exchequer funding for student mental health services.</p> <p>  In 2020, the Higher Education Authority published its national student mental health and suicide prevention framework for Ireland.  We see a number of elements of the framework as being particularly crucial going forward.  First, students experiencing mental health difficulties need access to safe, well-resourced clinical supports that are culturally appropriate and inclusive for all.  This is vital, because those who identify as LGBTI+, international students and those from ethnic minorities are all at higher risk of experiencing mental health difficulties.  Our student population is also changing in terms of how students engage with their education.  A traditional approach to student mental health that solely relies on on-campus supports is no longer accessible to all.  Hybrid approaches that include digital and online support services are a cost-effective solution, but they are underdeveloped in higher education and need investment.  The framework also calls for the development of universal preventative interventions to maintain the mental health of all students.  Adopting such a universal approach helps to identify those most in need earlier and it normalises help-seeking.  Providing the necessary mental health supports will require a professional workforce trained in the use of high quality, evidence-based interventions.  We need the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to create more training places for clinical, counselling, and educational psychologists and to pay the associated fees for all trainees to ensure an equitable opportunity.  We also need more mental health nurses, psychiatrists, social workers, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals.</p> <p>  Major steps must be taken to ensure further and higher education opportunities are genuinely open to everyone, especially those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds.  The first review of the SUSI grant rate in ten years provides a vital opportunity to support students.</p><p>We can and must set the SUSI grant at a rate that adequately covers the costs of engaging in further and higher education.  I would urge the committee to adopt a broad, societal approach to the intersectional issues of mental health inequality, social exclusion and economic inequality when setting out recommendations on the future of mental health support in further and higher education. </p><p> Our student population has never been more reliant on us to deliver in the area of mental health.  We need the investment, leadership and structures of accountability in pursuit of a vision where students in Ireland are supported to achieve and thrive in further and higher education and beyond.</p><p> I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

I now call Mr. Mark Smyth, past president of the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#E00300"><p>On behalf of the Psychological Society of Ireland I would like to thank members for the opportunity to address the committee in respect of discussion on the future funding of higher education.  For many years there has been a growing imperative to expand our psychological workforce and this imperative has escalated because of the psychological impact that Covid-19 has had, especially on our young people.  We know that as a direct result of the pandemic, demand for mental health support has significantly increased and is likely to continue to do so.</p> <p>  Successive HSE and Government reports have identified that there is a significant shortfall in the number of psychologists being trained in third level to meet demand.  A 2021 HSE report estimated an additional 321 psychologists were required in mental health services alone to meet demand.  This does not take into account demand in other areas such as education and higher education.</p> <p>  What we have failed to address thus far, despite repeated direct advocacy to Government, is how we plan to increase the number of training places and associated funding for the three professional training programmes to meet current and future demands.  If significant funding were to be allocated in budget 2022 for higher education training places, then, at best, an increased cohort of trainees would begin in September 2023 and would go on to qualify in late 2026.  Each year of delay to additional funding being allocated to third level psychology training programmes will add another three years to when they will qualify and enter the workforce.</p> <p>  In 2021, there were 66 funded HSE clinical psychology places in universities and, in addition, the counselling psychology training programme has approximately 14 places, with 20 to 22 on educational psychology programmes.  This is not enough to meet current or future demand.</p> <p>  A petition of more than 2,400 signatories joined the PSI&rsquo;s continued calls for the disparity in funding for psychology trainees to be addressed by Government.  Currently, trainee clinical psychologists have 60% of their fees paid and receive a student salary, while counselling and educational psychology trainees in third level pay fees of approximately &euro;14,000 per year and complete three years of unpaid work throughout the duration of their studies and training in university.</p> <p>  The PSI has highlighted to Government for the past three years in pre-budget submissions and direct correspondence to Government Ministers and the Taoiseach that one of the greatest barriers to getting qualified psychologists into the workforce is the inequity of counselling and educational trainees having to self-fund for the full period of their doctoral training, as well as pay &euro;14,000 per year in university fees.  This results in many not being able to afford to enter the profession, or a select few who can afford to self-fund, which risks the psychological workforce not being representative of the full socioeconomic spectrum of the community they represent and support.  We have advocated with Minister, Deputy Harris to work with the PSI to find ways to alleviate the burden of fees on trainee psychologists in third level education.</p> <p>  Thus far, the PSI has been met with deafening silence from Government on additional funding.  How should the PSI understand that, on one hand, we hear regular statements in the media and D&aacute;il about the need to support the mental health needs of our population but, on the other hand, we have had no engagement whatsoever from Government about increasing the numbers of professionally trained psychology places in third level.</p> <p>  The PSI wishes to highlight the unjustified inequity of the current operationalisation of the disability access route to education, DARE, scheme which is a third level alternative admissions process for whom the aim is to reduce barriers to accessing education, but in the area of mental health it in fact does the opposite.  The DARE scheme is administered by the Irish Universities Association, IUA, for school-leavers whose mental health difficulties have had a negative impact on their second level education.  It offers reduced points for applying to third level education.  The current criteria for entry via the mental health condition route specifies that the only profession eligible to verify a mental health difficulty is a consultant psychiatrist.  The PSI is of the view that this is an unnecessarily restrictive practice and there is a need for a change in this specification.  The PSI would argue that there is no justification for the exclusion of highly qualified chartered psychologists from verifying the impact of mental health on young people&rsquo;s education.  Extensive training in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions forms a core part of the training programmes in psychology and, therefore, is a skill-set and competency common to both psychology and psychiatry.  A young person may have attended an appropriately qualified psychologist for assessment and-or support for their mental health condition. With the current process, the young person will be forced to also attend with a psychiatrist they are unfamiliar with and incur additional costs to the family.  This creates a situation of inequity of access for the young person and their family.  The position of the IUA, in the view of the PSI, represents an excessively narrow and medicalised view of mental health.</p> <p>  The above position is not consistent with the core value of equity in the Government&rsquo;s Sharing the Vision policy, which outlines that equity is access to services characterised by inclusiveness, fairness and non-discrimination.</p> <p>  The PSI is calling on the Oireachtas for support in petitioning the IUA and Government to urgently commit to a review and reform of these restrictive practices currently in operation regarding the validation of the impact of mental health conditions on young people and students and to remove this unnecessary barrier to accessing third level.</p></speech>

I call our final witness, Ms Trish Murphy, who is representing the Irish Council for Psychotherapy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Trish Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#E00500"><p>I am speaking from the position of the Irish Council for Psychotherapy, but also as a student counsellor and the acting director of Trinity Student Counselling Services.  As our colleagues already said, we know that anxiety and depression are on the rise in our young people.  Particularly, My World Survey 2 was fantastic in giving us those figures.</p> <p>  Mental illness is likely to surface in the ages from 17 to 25 and therefore is also likely to present in the student population.  Increasing diversity in third level also means that students with pre-existing mental, physical and emotional needs are attending colleges and our international student population has significantly grown.  All this points to the pressure on services at third level, including health, counselling and disability services.  These are the primary points of contact for young people of that age in this country.  A decrease in stigmatisation of mental health issues plus increasing anxiety and academic pressure to do well have all been factors in the huge rise in demand for counselling service and even the private sector is having huge difficulty in meeting the surge in need.</p> <p>  Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education in Ireland, PCHEI, was founded in 1994 by a group of student counsellors from third level colleges.  They met for a number of years and the organisation has developed and represents student counselling services in the vast majority of higher education institutes, HEIs, in Ireland.  Student counselling services are dedicated mental health support services available free to all third level students.</p> <p>  The role of student counselling services, first and foremost, is to provide psychological counselling to students who may be experiencing personal adjustment, development or psychological problems.  They also play a preventative role by assisting students to identify the learning skills required to effectively meet their educational and life goals.  They are involved in the support and enhancement of student well-being throughout the campus community and play a role in contributing to safety and risk on campus.  Student counselling services provide a range of key mental health interventions: clinical assessment; one-to-one counselling; group counselling; online support; risk and crisis management; outreach and prevention; training for HEI staff to support students; policy and procedural development; psychological health workshops and programmes; and developing peer support programmes.</p> <p>  PCHEI is full of highly qualified, professional student counsellors.  Its psychotherapists are eligible for accreditation with the Irish Council for Psychotherapy.  They are also eligible for qualification with PSI, which we just heard about, and the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.  Accreditation means that practitioners are properly qualified to work to recognised standards of professional competence.</p> <p>  I added a slide that members will see.  The numbers of unique students presenting for counselling last year, across the HEI sector, was 14,500.  They served 70,000 clinical sessions for that age group across Ireland.  As members can see, that is a huge number.  However, this year will completely overshadow that because already the rise in demand this academic year has far exceeded that of previous years.  Currently in Trinity we have a 23% rise in demand for one-to-one clinical services.</p> <p>  I turn to our funding issues.  Most funding for student counselling comes from core budgets of colleges.  In the past two academic years, the Government has given funding to colleges, which has allowed for more counselling sessions to take place, plus outreach work on the consent and suicide prevention frameworks.</p><p>However, the reality is many counselling centres have become rapid access in that they serve crisis and emergency demands first, and this lessens the possibility for therapeutic change as there are consequences for ongoing short-term therapy models.  If this cohort, that is, student counselling, continues to be the main provider of mental health services to this age group, more resources need to be made available to meet properly the psychological and psychiatric needs of the students.  This will necessitate more counsellors, more access to psychiatry and a more varied response to our rising international and diverse student needs.  The expectation is that a large number of students will enter our third level system as they flee war in their countries.  This will necessitate a mental health and trauma-informed response that will put extra pressure on a system already under excessive duress.</p></speech>

It is no reflection on the discussion and I thank the witnesses for their work.  This is a discussion around the general question of higher education funding.  I refer to what Ms Murphy and Dr. Morning were speaking about.  At present, funding of services such as counselling comes from the core grant.  In the allocation of funding, should there be a specific top-slicing made available for counselling and other services?  We saw in the past year that the Minister made additional funding available for additional hours.  Perhaps Ms Murphy and Dr. Morning would respond to my first question and others can come in if they wish.  Should that funding be top-sliced rather than a decision made by each higher education institution?</p></speech>

If we are going to get extra counsellors, we need to have them for years.  There is no point in having them for one year only and not being sure if we will be able to provide them the following year, which is sort of the case at present.  If it was top-sliced and guaranteed, it would allow for planning, prevention and many of the suggestions we have about implementing peer programmes and other programmes that we could use.  At present, people can only be employed for one year with the hope they can be employed again, but many people get other jobs because they are in such demand, so we have to train in new people.  It is really undermining the work.  Yes, of course, I think it should be top-sliced.</p></speech>

It is all about creating long-term solutions.  The dreams of the types of supports that can could be offered cannot happen overnight.  It takes a lot of forward planning and gradual building up of those resources.  Top-slicing would facilitate that.</p></speech>

Jigsaw would suggest that it should be looked at in the round and how that money could be spent in a preventative way.  If it is dedicated just for hours, potentially a whole-of-campus system might not be developed.  It is about a range of supports that could be supported through consistent year-on-year funding.</p></speech>

We are not training enough counsellors, psychotherapists or psychologists.  Without multi-year funding, it is very difficult for people to make a choice.  Between taking a one-year contract or a permanent and pensionable post, they will take the latter all the time.  We need that continuity.  If it is a post for one year and the person moves on to something else, we have lost that expertise.  In each area, people working in youth mental health develop an interest, expertise and skills.  If they move on because of the promise of only one year, that skill base is lost to other areas.  I echo the calls that it needs to be multi-annual funding.</p></speech>

They would provide an input and direct mental health work during that time, which is an added bonus and a service to it.  I work in a child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS.  When we take trainees onboard, it is a help to us.  It is someone else who can work under supervision.  They cannot work independently for three years, but we would get the benefit of them from day one once we increase those place numbers.</p></speech>

Dr. Morning made the point about the need for SUSI grant reform.  It is my view it should be a priority, but the Government has to make difficult investment and spending choices.  Dr. Morning will be aware there is a proposal being floated around cutting student fees.  My personal view is that if there are resources to be made available at higher education level, it should be an increase in the core grant, because of underfunding, and in reform of the SUSI grant scheme.  I do not know whether Dr. Morning has a perspective on this.  I know budgetary negotiations are going on.  In an ideal world, everything could be done, but what should be prioritised?  I am always concerned that if the core grant is cut, one of the first services to be cut would be counselling.  If the fee income is reduced, that is what universities and higher education institutions will do.</p></speech>

In an ideal world, one would not have to be prioritise over the other.  The impact financial pressures can have on a person's mental health cannot be underestimated.  Working and supporting oneself through education is becoming the norm more than the exception to the rule.  There are substantial pressures associated with that and it has a very real impact.  It also has an impact on who is able to access third level education.  Certain groups within our population are disproportionately negatively affected while there is no reform to the grant.  That has an impact on everything.  It trickles down to the people who can get to the point where they can engage in graduate programmes and become trained.</p></speech>

It is important we do not become too micro too soon and that we look at the overall needs of what keeps people well in third level education.  We need to think about prevention as well as intervention and what are the self-management and resilience techniques we can build into the student population to keep them well.  Having a bird's-eye view is important as well as identifying the holistic needs exactly.</p></speech>

If we look at the evidence of young people who are at the highest risk of developing mental health difficulties, they are students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, those with a disability, those from the LGBTQI community and those who are ethnic minorities.  Some targeted funding, such as through the SUSI grant, would potentially make the most difference.  The other issue we have not talked about yet is the drop-out rate.  We know from the My World Survey that there is a significant difference in terms of those young people's mental health in the university sector versus the IT sector.  We should be looking to support them and looking from a more equitable base.</p></speech>

This committee is examining the issue of funding of the third level sector.  We invited the witnesses in to deal with an important aspect of it, namely, the funding of mental health and support services for students in that sector.  Three witnesses have referred to the My World Survey 2.  I will start with Dr. Duffy.  Jigsaw was partly responsible for that.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The witnesses will emphasise that they want to see increased resources but there is a responsibility on members of the committee to also look for the cause of the alarming increase in the number of young people reporting severe anxiety or depression.  The statistics Ms Murphy provided in respect of Trinity College Dublin have given us greater cause for concern.  What does Dr. Duffy believe is the cause of these alarming rises?  Is it that more people are reporting it or is it actually increasing?</p></speech>

The My World Survey was developed in conjunction with the school of psychology in UCD.  We first published it in 2012 and did another cohort in 2019.  As has been referred to this morning, it showed a negative picture regarding those young people who are struggling.  The Deputy asked about looking at what is behind that.  The positive side is the reduced stigma in terms of young people able to talk about mental health and access supports.  That is a positive thing.  That is potentially reflected in young people being more aware and able to say they feel down, worried or stressed.  It is a good thing that they are telling us about those things.</p> <p>  That is important in what we do with that data.  There is a sense of increased stress among students, particularly young female students and young female pupils in schools.  They are the biggest cohort coming to Jigsaw.  There has been a significant change over the past five years.  We traditionally saw about 56% female and 44% male.  That has changed to approximately 70%-30%.  That can be seen in third level.</p> <p>  The following is one of the things that makes a difference in trying to support young people, particularly thinking about young men.  It does not mean when more young women are coming that mental health is equally divided between genders, because it is not.  How it is expressed certainty is not equally divided.  It is thinking about resources in third level, how they will be accessed and how to provide that level of support.  Useful in further developing that is providing anonymous support, 50808 text support and the live chat we do in Jigsaw.  It is looking at a range of supports that will help people.</p></speech>

That is all the way up.  Men tend to have more dramatic crises when they have them.  More succeeded suicides are by men, so we need to target those and we put a lot of effort into doing that.  We use online supports.  Many of them use the online SilverCloud, which is a counsellor-supported support, and a variety of things to access them.  Young women present more often but the crises often tend to be around young men.</p></speech>

It does not help situations and is how people try to cope with them, which is not good.  I see people putting huge pressure on themselves.  There is perfectionism and the idea I have to be the best I can be across a range of things.  Our young people put huge pressure on themselves.  Their parents' expectations are very high, as are their own expectations of themselves.  When they come to college and find they are not the head of the class like they used to be, the effect on them over years can be devastating.</p></speech>

There is a strong evidence base that people experiencing mental health difficulties self-medicate with substances.  To purely address the substance is not getting to the root of the issue.</p></speech>

One of the greatest difficulties so many struggle with anxiety and to such a significant degree is that we are failing spectacularly when it comes to early intervention.  Anxiety, particularly, responds well to primary care level intervention but we have primary care waiting lists of up to two years in some areas.  With any mental health difficulty, the longer someone waits for help, the more impact it will have and the more resources that will be needed.  CAMHS is getting flooded with young people sitting, waiting without intervention and deteriorating to the point where they need it.  We do not want to medicate children for mental health when we know that, in the first instance, talk therapy is effective.  We do not have enough people to deliver it.  I echo Dr. Morning's point that we have done huge work in reducing stigma.  We are encouraging people to come forward, talk and share, and they are doing it.  The are doing so in the expectation there will be someone to listen and help them, and, unfortunately, we do not have those people available to provide them with support when they need it.</p></speech>

The trends in mental health and health generally in WHO statistics and so on are that lifestyle-related issues are becoming the predominant challenges, pandemic aside, to mental health.  The response has to incorporate a much stronger upskilling of people to self-manage, build resilience and learn how to manage their mental health more.  It relates to the point about early intervention.  If we teach people skills as early as we can to manage and improve their mental health, it will not stop everybody going to a more acute phase, but it will certainty help.  That is what we mean by the recovery approach.</p></speech>

We have a benchmark but, as far as I know, we do not have the data to see how far we are from that figure.  Once we have the data, we need to engage with Government to say what the shortfall is and ask what the plan is to reach the benchmark.</p><p>We know what is recommended.  We do not know what we currently have.  One of the concerns is that even if we knew how many we needed, where we would get the staff to fill the gaps.</p></speech>

We know what is happening.  We know because young people ring politicians in the middle of the night.  They should not be ringing us to ask us for clinical help.  We also know from the Irish Patients Association report and yesterday's HSE report that many people who present at emergency departments get fed up waiting for hours and they leave.  This is a very dangerous situation for us to be in, as well as the fact that it compounds the problem in emergency departments.  We have to quantify the problem and then see that we do not have enough.</p> <p>  With regard to the Psychological Society of Ireland, the sponsor pays 60% of the course fee and the student pays 40% in the case of clinical psychologists.  What are the terms and conditions associated with the sponsorship?  Is there a public service requirement in it?  Could the students emigrate or move to the private sector on completion of their studies?</p></speech>

There are not enough graduates coming through.  In my experience many stay and continue to work in the HSE.  We have a limited pool.  As I mentioned in my submission, it is estimated that more than 300 are needed in mental health alone.  This does not take into account the Prison Service, the Higher Education Authority or Tusla.  As well as this there are not enough people in private practice.  People cannot ring someone to get an appointment privately because it is the same pool of people.  There are terms and conditions for this but the counselling and educational trainee psychologists are not employees.  They have no rights, they get no pay and they pay &euro;40,000 for a three-year course.  When they are asked whether they want to work for a system that has asked them to work for free for three years and pay &euro;40,000 for the privilege, many will choose not to and, to be honest, we cannot really blame them.</p></speech>

We cannot stand over that.  This feeds into the precarious working conditions throughout the third level sector.  We certainly cannot ask people to do it free.  This was my next question.  They must undertake 300 hours of unpaid work in the course of their studies.  How does this compare with the number of working hours for a clinical psychologist?  I am trying to get a sense of how closely they compare.</p></speech>

There are slightly different metrics with regard to the number of hours required.  Overall the same amount of experience is required in the HSE criteria to work in the service.  As a senior clinical psychologist I often have a counselling or educational trainee or a clinical psychologist with me.  They do the same work.  They provide the same public service.  One gets paid and two do not.  The equivalence of what they deliver to young people in mental health is equivalent but they are not treated with equivalency.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we need engagement to make it happen.</p></speech>

Certainly TCD has been corralling many people.  The psychology department has offered its students to help.  It will take a lot of resources.  I do not think the short-term model will work for very traumatised students.  We will have to change this and find some funding somewhere to support it.</p></speech>

I will be very specific with my first question.  My subsequent questions might be a bit more general.  My first question is for Mr. Smyth.  He made the point very well on the issues surrounding trainee clinical psychologists and educational counselling psychologists.  I will make a general point first.  We discuss mental health a lot in these institutions.  It is a big political issue.  It is not just related to third level, albeit it is a huge issue there and among young people.  Fundamentally there are certainly issues with the allocation of resources and how systems are managed.  The fundamental problem is we do not have enough mental health professionals in the system.  No matter what way we chop and change it there are not enough to meet the demands.  This is a huge political issue. A significant element of this is the fact that people cannot afford to become psychologists or psychotherapists.</p> <p>  I will come back to my point on clinical psychologists, which may also apply to educational and counselling psychologists.  An issue arises prior to becoming a trainee.  There are approximately 60 places for clinical psychologists and to qualify for them they also need clinical experience.  To obtain this clinical experience they need to be from money or be willing to get into debt or work lunatic hours at the weekends.  Perhaps there are similar issues with psychotherapists.  Does Mr. Smyth have a response on this?  Some of the solution probably relates to assistant psychologist positions that are funded.  There are probably not enough of these that provide sufficient clinical experience for people to qualify for the funded programmes.  Perhaps there are comparable issues with counselling and educational psychologists.  The issue is how to get clinical experience without getting into &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000 debt.</p></speech>

It was just formalised this year as a specific grade.  There are 114 assistant psychologist posts in the HSE.</p><p>There are some within the Prison Service and some within the section-38 organisations, but there is still a large cohort who end up having to work for free.  </p><p> While we greatly value the role of assistant psychologists, we are a little concerned given the experiences of our colleagues in the UK, where the British Government invested a huge amount in assistant psychologists only to find a bottleneck resulted.  In other words, assistants remained stuck at assistant level for a number of years.  The HSE has addressed this issue by imposing a three-year limit but we want those concerned to progress to training programmes.  Assistant psychologists, while they assist with the work, cannot work independently.  With regard to setting up an expectation that they will work independently and address all the issues we have, there is a really important adjunct, but we really need to get the individuals onto the training programme.  While the pilot programme - with its 114 posts - is good, it is not enough to meet the demand from graduates coming through.  Therefore, we hope there will be an expansion.  The HSE commissioned research to find evidence as to whether the model worked.  It found it did so it set it up as a programme, but 114 will not meet the demand.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Trish Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#J00300"><p>Psychotherapy is slightly different.  A four-year postgraduate programme is available in various institutions.  Psychotherapists are slightly older so they fund themselves, for the most part.  We operate a training programme in Trinity with up to 20 trainees, whom we supervise.  All those trainees are offering their time for free, and that is why we can see so many students.  There is no funding at all for any of the programmes.  The strength is in the mix.  We have assistant psychologists, clinical counselling posts and a variety of modalities represented.  It makes for a very rich offering.  The diversity we are looking for in our system is very hard to achieve.  We cannot get people from different backgrounds to come in because it simply costs too much money.</p></speech>

I will direct it primarily at Mr. Ryan and Drs. Duffy and Morning, but if Mr. Smyth and Ms Murphy want to respond also, that will be fine.  The figures from the My World Survey show an increase of 15% to 20% in the number with severe anxiety and an increase in those reporting severe depression from 14% to 21%.  These are not small increases; they are very significant.  They occurred before Covid, which I presume could have been an exacerbating factor.  My question on this might be a bit nebulous.  What is behind the increases?  I am sure there are all sorts of environmental issues.  At third level there are particular pressures but these statistics are not necessarily specific to third level.  Has much research been done on this?  Some of the factors could be global but some could be particular to Ireland.  Why are the increases so significant?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.278" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#J00500"><p>We know most mental health difficulties that span across the lifetime occur by the age of 17.  The entry path to adulthood is the key developmentally.  If mental health difficulties are going to occur and be lifelong, they will most likely occur at this time.  That is why we do the work in Jigsaw on supporting young people between 12 and 25.  We know that piece of it.  We also know that, before Covid, there was a significant difficulty regarding the needs.  In this regard I am referring to reduced stigma and better awareness, including better awareness among parents, in schools and in the wider environment.  Better awareness is helping people to seek help, but part of the difficulty concerns who is available to support people once they say it is okay not to be okay and that they are reaching out for help.  Recognising that we focused on psychology this morning, we need to note there is a significant need.  That has been identified in surveys, not just in my work but also in other work.  We can see that when we introduce new initiatives, such as those online, the uptake is significant.  However, we end up competing against each other, with each of us looking for the same mental health professional.  In Jigsaw we operate a transdisciplinary model, which means we can have social workers, mental health staff, occupational therapists and psychologists all coming with some form of psychotherapeutic training.  That is really needed.  What we want to do is ascertain how we can support that with an early-intervention model.  What is lacking, however, is a focus on connectivity overall and the journey regarding primary care, secondary care and third level.  Some need support at primary care level when young, and then they enter CAMHS and services at third level.  They should be supported to work through a recovery model, enabling us to go along.  The difficulty is that there are no supports even for us to have conversations about coming together to think about this and how to plan for some factors in the longer term.</p></speech>

It is great to have them here.  They have a huge wealth of knowledge.</p><p>I have a couple of queries I might pose on some of the submissions.  I thank the attendees.  Mr. Ryan, from the HSE, referred in his submission to some of the elements in the HSE and community health organisations, CHOs, in respect of local engagement.  That was quite important to raise.  How do area leads for local engagement link in with third level?  I was missing a step concerning local engagement in the community regarding people facing mental health issues.  Do they link in at third level?</p><p>My next question is for Dr. Duffy, from Jigsaw.  I come from Ballinasloe and represent east Galway and Roscommon.  Last Saturday an amazing event was held at the GAA club in Caltra, working with Jigsaw, other sports clubs, including the athletic club at the ladies' club.  It was a wonderful initiative.  The organisers brought together local or national sports celebrities, such as Michael Meehan, whose family did so much for Galway football, in addition to referees and commentators.  There was also a comedian, Sir Stevo Timothy, also known as &quot;Farmer Michael&quot;.  They spoke to local families and children about the pressures on young people.  It was an amazing initiative in a rural area, bringing all the groups together to say the issue is huge for us right now.  I pay tribute to those concerned and acknowledge what Jigsaw does at local level.  Jigsaw's local group supported the initiative to which I have referred.</p><p>Inequity of access was mentioned.  It is important to address this at second level in addition to third level, but it is at second level that we make a difference.  There was recently an allocation through DEIS funding whereby more than 240,000 students can now access DEIS supports.  This means smaller class sizes and additional access to mental health supports within the school.  That is what we need to move towards.  We need to be providing additional supports at school level.  While we can talk about Student Universal Support Ireland, regarding which there is a review involving the Minister, Deputy Harris, the rolling out of DEIS supports at both primary and secondary levels is crucial.<b></b>The delegates might have some comments on it.<b></b>What other supports can be considered at secondary school level to prepare our children because dropping out is a huge issue at third level?</p><p>Ms Murphy, with her background in psychotherapy and who is representing Trinity College, might answer my next question.  Given the drop-out rate in the first year at third level, we need to focus on secondary schools to make sure all the careers guidance teachers have a role.  Considering the apprenticeship programme, the additional courses being made available through the CAO and the new report on leaving certificate reform issued by the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, could Ms Murphy comment on the expansion of the transition year?  With the broadening of the apprenticeship programme, how can the third level sector work with secondary schools and career guidance teachers on opportunities for those who do not take the traditional route to college and on how they can achieve qualifications?  I will leave it at that but I will ask a couple more questions if I have time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#J00700"><p>I will refer to the question on second level.  Transitions are particularly important, particularly in respect of youth mental health.  We are aware that the transition from primary school to secondary school is a key stressor for young people.  The same is the case with the transition from secondary school to third level, if that occurs.</p> <p>  One of the points I was making in my opening statement was on the importance of including well-being in the curricula.</p><p>It is hugely important to do that within the second level system in order to enable and support young people who can have the skills, the wherewithal and the confidence to apply for third level.  That is a really big issue.  When one reads some of the reports and research that has been done, they looked at those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds.  Their experience was that they were relying on a teacher or a career guidance counsellor, or somebody else, to help them to think about their career choices.  How do we ensure that the have the competence to do that?  My main point would be to think about not just the funding of higher education separately, it is also about thinking about the supports at second level.  Once they funnel in the supports, early intervention and prevention are key.</p></speech>

Following on from that, I am aware that my university, the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, was the first mindfulness university.  This is something that all universities are now putting in place.  That mindfulness theme is so crucial.</p> <p>  On local engagement, there were 35 local engagement leads.  When will Mr. Ryan clarify if there is a link there with third level?</p></speech>

There is an expertise we have developed in engaging with communities and service users, and tapping into their knowledge around recovery.  That is very transferable to the colleges.  We already have a partnership with our recovery colleges, which is linked to NUIG, DCU and the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT.  That has been recognised as a world first with third level.</p></speech>

The feedback from student counselling is that we are usually extremely impactful in retaining people in college.  There is an innovative and transformational programme currently under way where there is a model of peer-assisted support happening in third level.  We had this for a long time in Trinity College and it is called Student2Student.  This is where every incoming student has a student mentor who is trained and who stays with them for one year.  We hope that the new pilot programme for more support will be implemented across all third level colleges.  It plays a huge part in getting people to stay and making them feel that they belong.</p></speech>

Ms Murphy spoke about the mentorship being crucial, and we have spoken about this before along with Dr. Morning and Mr. Smyth.  It is crucial that we get those additional supports.  I am aware that more than &euro;500,000 has gone to Trinity College in terms of mental health supports in the past two years.  This has been to recruit additional counsellors and to support those students.  I would love to see that this year.  The CAO form has been expanded to include apprenticeship programmes and further and higher education.  With regard to the levels of drop out across all of third level, if we are to use these other resources and supports through further and higher education where we are pumping in a lot of investment into our technological universities as well, we must ask if the level of dropout changes at the end of first year.  Again, my apologies.  We might get time at the end to come back to this.</p></speech>

My background is that I was involved in education for 15 years, and even in my time would could see on the ground how the prevalence of students dealing with issues such as anxiety, and the increasing levels of students receiving a diagnosis of ASD or ADHD, and so on.  I have said before that as a teacher I had never really felt adequately trained to deal with a lot of the issues that presented themselves to us as a teaching staff.</p><p>I wish to pick up on one point that Dr. Duffy and Ms Murphy mentioned, which is around embedding resilience in the curricula in higher education institutions.  Reference was made to the practice being particularly <i>ad hoc</i>.  Will the witnesses please define for the committee what they mean by embedding?  Is it similar to implementing a well-being module at second or third level?  Perhaps the witnesses could expand on that.</p></speech>

It is about looking at the appropriate knowledge base and providing the students with the knowledge about their own mental health, and the mental health and support of others.  It is about including this as part of knowledge raising at first and then skills development.  Seeing it as something that is really important is also part of it: for example, if students are doing an English degree, that they would all have access to a particular module.  That would be very helpful in terms of people understanding and having a knowledge about themselves, knowledge of language, and being able to see whether those skills are transferable.  It also reduces the stigma and helps people to understand where supports are available, what supports they can have themselves, what level and range of supports are available, and what is the threshold for those supports.</p></speech>

Of course we should.  It would be wonderful, but will it lower the numbers of students attending student counselling?  I really do not know.  What we are dealing with is quite serious.  Of course we should do resilience.  If we can, we should put credits in for it.  I am not sure, however, that it would reduce the actual numbers of students attending counselling.  That would take a while to work its way through, to be honest.</p></speech>

As my colleagues stated, there is often the difficulty, which we see in our own service, whereby the continuing professional development opportunities can be made available but people are really trying to work through a waiting list and really trying to devote the time to see the young person right in front of them.  It is about looking at the whole experience.  Sometimes, staff might be on short-term contracts and may be thinking that they must put the head down and do the work here.  It is about looking at the whole person.</p> <p> When we talk about the training of all of these mental health professionals, we are also talking about their own experience within third level.  This is a very important time for having a very positive experience around their mental health because they are going to be the contributors into the future.  It is, therefore, about not giving them a very stressful experience, then they just about come out and start in a role, and then feel another stressful experience.  The number of graduates who say "Well actually mental health is not for me and I am going to leave that now because I want to do something else completely", is a huge pity because we actually want to encourage more and more people to enter into the professions.</p></speech>

Whether it is a waiting list for a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or whatever consultant is required be it speech and language or physiotherapy, the pattern is quite obvious across all of our services.</p> <p>  Mr. Smyth referred to the 66 funded clinical psychology training places.  I am aware also that there are a couple of others there.  What kinds of figures do we need to be hitting?  What is the turnover of graduates that we need to churn out from colleges in the context of training individuals to go into the services?</p></speech>

With regard to children with disabilities, there are significant waiting lists there and there is a huge overlap between children experiencing disabilities plus mental health.  We just do not have the staff to do it.  We do have staff who are close to experiencing burnout and they are under huge pressure from key performance indicators, KPIs, that relate to the wait time to bums on seats.  All they get told is "Do more" and if staff move on it is "Do more with less".  Staff on the ground very much feel this pressure to do more.  They feel the pressure of the waiting lists and they feel the pressure of the families ringing up.  I take five to six phone calls each week from distressed parents who are crying and upset, and we are not able to do it.  It is extremely deflating.  Reference was made to trying to keep good people in the services but we are failing spectacularly at that.  People do not want to work in the services.  They go off and they work privately because they are not put under these pressures.  There has been talk about workforce planning reviews and we have yet to see the evidence of that.  We see individual Departments and individual silos talking about what they need, but as I have mentioned before, they are all competing for the same pool of graduates, rather than thinking how many do we need and how are we going to get them. Those conversations have not started yet.</p><p>We are failing a generation of children by not having those conversations.  We are also failing staff on the ground who are saying that they cannot cope with this and that they do not want to stay in the system.  If we put children with mental health needs or disabilities into a system that is already broken, how is it expected to be able to meet their needs?  We are not doing it.</p><p> This is not just about funding.  As has been said, it is about how we support the staff.  Most of us have no continuing professional development, CPD, funding.  On the ground, we have seen an exponential increase in the number of children presenting with anorexia over the past two years.  That is the condition most likely to kill a child, yet we are expected to do more.  There is no individual allocated CPD budget for psychologists, occupational therapists, OTs, or counsellors on the ground, which means we have to figure it out for ourselves or we have to self-fund.  We need to do more not just around recruiting but retaining staff.  We have a national panel-based system of recruitment that means if somebody spends two years in CAMHS gaining an expertise in youth mental health, and that person wants to progress to the next level, he or she goes onto a generic panel and could end up in adult or disability services.  We have systemic failures across the board in how we are recruiting, retraining and looking after our staff.  It is not just about the numbers.  We do not want to put more people in who have the same experiences the current ones do.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Smyth one final question.  He mentioned that the PSI is of the view that consultant psychiatrists being able to verify that somebody has a mental health difficulty is an unnecessarily restrictive practice and there is a need for a change in the specification in respect of it.  Will he tell us what the justification for that distinction is?  What can we do to change it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.300" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#L00300"><p>The justification given to us is that mental health is an illness and only a doctor can verify the presence of an illness.  As I mentioned, Sharing the Vision is a very progressive document which has moved on to that and looked at many different contributors to what impacts on mental health.  We know from our consultant colleagues that there are not enough consultants.  There are very few, especially in child specialties.  We have set up a system that is supposed to enable us to access third level.  I am a clinical psychologist working with young people for nearly 20 years.  I could work, and have worked, with young people for a year or a year and a half who have anxiety or depression, and at the end of that process I am unable to verify the impact that mental health difficulty has had on their access to third level.  They must go off, if they can, to find a psychiatrist.  I had a family last week who are now going on a nine-month waiting list for one private psychiatrist they have never met and do not know.  They will then have to self-fund to verify, when the young person and I already know what that impact is.</p> <p>  It is very undermining for them to have to retell their story.  We have very experienced psychologists, OTs, speech and language therapists and people working in mental health settings, such as our colleagues in Jigsaw who, equally, are not able to verify the impact.  We have set up a system that, on the face of it, is supposed to be about increasing access but in reality puts up massive barriers against families and young peoples.</p></speech>

It was incredibly interesting and concerning listening to all of them.  There are not too many surprises because, as has been pointed out by some of my colleagues, we tend to hear quite often about the challenges and issues in mental health services when it comes to responding to our young people.  We are focusing on third level, what we need to embed in future funding to try to ensure well-being and supports for those who need them, and making those recommendations to the Minister.</p> <p>  I was alarmed by what Mr. Smyth said about the very large disparity between the funding for trainee clinical psychologists and that for counselling and educational training psychologists.  I was certainly not aware of that.  I would like him to address why that is.  In response to one of my colleagues, he talked about a benchmark of one psychologist per 1,000 students.  In 2020, there were 245,000 students at second level.  I imagine it is close enough to that at present.  How many psychologists are there at the moment?  If there are 245,000 students, I would have thought from listening to Ms Murphy that we need more than the 23% increase she said happened in Trinity.  Is there a problem getting the data?  She said she does not have sufficient data to make the recommendation.  Will she address that first?</p></speech>

It is a much more inclusive model of having mental health professionals in place.  The internationally recognised benchmark is one therapist, counsellor or psychologist per 1,000 of the third level population.  We know that is recommended but, again, we do not have, as far as I am aware, the benchmarks to know how many are currently in place.</p></speech>

That would be interesting.  I ask Ms Murphy to send that on to us.  We have talked quite a bit about the interventions that are needed when somebody presents with mental health problems, but I am particularly interested in the preventative measures mentioned by Dr. Duffy.  We need to invest seriously in the preventative measures that are needed.  I acknowledge the excellent work that SpunOut and Jigsaw do.  I know that Jigsaw is starting in Tipperary and Wicklow.  I understand Newbridge and Kildare are next on their list.  I have been working with the HSE in trying to find a suitable premises there because it is an area that needs it.  Will Dr. Duffy expand on the preventative measures that he believes should be in place so we do not get to a stage where we need urgent interventions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.305" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#L00800"><p>I thank the Vice Chairperson for her support of Jigsaw.  We know and have talked this morning of the significant need to support young people.  Jigsaw is looking to philanthropic funding at present to support young people, particularly in further and then in higher education.  One of the things we are looking at is one good peer or peer-to-peer support.  We know students support each other very well.</p> <p>  The other part of it is thinking about focusing on some particular cohorts, such as student nurses, and helping them in minding their mental health, given the importance of their roles and the stresses that will be involved.  We are also looking at improving mental health in the curriculum.  As my colleagues said, that is a long-term piece.  When we talk about a preventative measure in mental health, we are probably looking at returns across a ten-year period, but it is well worth doing it because if we just focus on the acute side of it we are not making any changes.  The whole point of A Vision for Change and Sharing the Vision was to focus on primary care, especially in respect of mental health.</p> <p>  It also involves thinking about a broad understanding in making sense of mental health and thinking about the educators themselves.  We know from our experience in second level, and the Vice Chairperson referred to it, that people were taught in teacher training colleges to teach a subject.  They are now very much conscious of teaching the whole person.  How do we lecture or provide support at a third level college for a whole person approach?  It is thinking about it in terms of a broad, healthy campus.  There are great policies and initiatives and so on, but how is that being supported in very practical ways?  There is lots of information, supports and other agencies that are there.  We are very willing to play our part, but how will that be co-ordinated and supported? </p></speech>

My final question is about reducing barriers to accessing mental health supports.  That came through very clearly in what was said.  What is the best way of evaluating the outcomes of any well-being initiative bearing in mind that, as Dr. Duffy said, it could take ten years?  I will take other speakers on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.307" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Morning" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#L01000"><p>If we want to evaluate these programmes once they go in, again, evaluation is something that takes money, takes time and needs investment.  Can there be university-based research that can track people?  If we start off with pilots and contract people to follow cohorts, it is very important to measure the mental health of those cohorts before and after.  It is difficult to measure reductions in referrals to mental health services, which is one of the things we would hope to get from preventative approaches, if the numbers are increasing anyway in the face of increased pressures on mental health.</p><p> It is about constant tracking.  We want to capture the more qualitative data and person-centred picture of the impact these programmes are having.  One of the main aims should be changing the campus culture.  We know that an important protective factor is help seeking.  There are barriers to help seeking in third level education.  A lot of students do not feel comfortable in reaching out and postpone doing so.  Capturing the changes in attitudes is difficult, but it is one of the things we would want to change.</p></speech>

Our students are surveyed out of their minds.  We offer rewards for surveys so that students will do them.  There are loads of methods, everything from qualitative research to whatever else.  We would be well placed to give excellent evaluations of any programme we have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Owen Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#M00300"><p>In terms of evaluation, we have to be very careful that we are gathering the right information.  There is a great opportunity for a patient and public involvement, PPI, approach whereby we bring peers and students into the process so that we make sure that the interventions are delivering what people need rather than predetermining what is needed.</p> <p>  In terms of the barriers, Dr. Morning alluded to the fact that self stigma is a huge issue.  We have to get people used to talking about their mental health.  We need to do that as early as possible.  That starts at preschool, when a fireman comes into a school to say he puts out fires.  Perhaps we need people to know about counsellors being the people we talk to when we are not feeling well.  We need to equip people to deal with the emotional stresses of life, which are the catalyst for more serious challenges later on.  </p> <p>  We need strategic thinking about everything we do.  If we wait until we need the kind of interventions we are talking about today, that will be too late for many people.  We have to go back to early intervention and ensure that we are equipping as many people as possible to recognise their mental health issues and give them the tools to address them.  That does not take away from the fact that there are times when extra support will be needed and have to be in place.  It is about a holistic approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#M00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  I have read all of their opening statements.  As usual, I am bouncing between two committees.  I thank them for joining us.</p> <p>  A few things occurred to me.  In his opening statement, Dr. Morning spoke about intersectionality.  It seems to me there is intersectionality between the things that impact on our mental health.  Having sat on the governing authority of NUIG, our hope was to reach out beyond the community within the university to organisations outside of it.  I think in particular of Jigsaw and SpunOut.  Is there an opportunity, when we are looking at funding, to think about co-funding?  We are not just talking about the funding of higher education, but about funding organisations that have a direct impact on the lives of students and staff within that organisation. </p> <p>   It is welcome that we have the &euro;5 million from the Minister, Deputy Harris.  In third level education, reaching out through the institute itself is only one way in which people reach out.  There were comments on funding for counselling.  Am I correct in saying that it is not just about funding for counselling for people in third level?  There should be a lifelong approach that reaches out beyond the walls of our third level institutions.</p> <p>  We have done a significant amount of work in this committee on bullying in primary and secondary education.  I would love to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on the impact of that, the trauma it causes in primary and secondary school and how it would have a knock-on impact on people in third level education.  Is that thought through in terms of a trajectory and approach to mental health that runs through all of our institutions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#M00500"><p>In terms of talking about a lifelong approach, in Jigsaw the aim is to help people have a healthy transition into adulthood.  That transition might be through finishing full-time education after secondary school and then doing an apprenticeship, attending third level or a lot of other different things.  If we think about what we want as a country for our young people, we want a healthy transition.  We want young people to be resilient and robust and to be able to contribute very positively to all areas of life.</p> <p>  That involved thinking about third level institutions not just in terms of education.  The original idea of a university was education of the whole person.  We need to pull back the lens from that and think about how we do that much earlier.  We have done that very well in terms of thinking about access programmes and how to support people, in particular in terms of the traditional view of education.  How do we support someone much more psychologically in coming into third level and starting that much earlier?</p> <p>  Going back to what we said at the beginning, this involves thinking about particular targeted cohort of groups, intersectionality and who is under-represented and how we will support them in terms of being represented.  On the argument made earlier about a certain homogeneity, how do we support other entries into the sector?  We need to talk within secondary level about developing a career as a psychotherapist or psychologist and so on.  How do we encourage people to do that rather than seeing it as a middle-class phenomenon only open to certain groups of people?  There is a lot to be done and a lot to be thought about.</p></speech>

Our student cohorts are diversifying, including in how they engage with their education.  It makes sense that we should also diversify how they engage with mental health support.  We should have a diverse range because not every type of support will work for every student.  Some will have preferences.  Some types of interventions or support services will work better for some than others.</p> <p>  It is important to have options.  They can come through collaboration.  Sometimes it is as simple as universities being aware of the other opportunities and support that are out there.  That comes from joined up working and having clear lines of communication.  That applies to further and higher education, but is also one of the keys to solving transition periods and getting the transition from secondary school to further and higher education right.  It is about joining up, communicating, working together and having a person-centred approach.</p></speech>

A couple of years ago we invited everybody in.  What Mr. Smyth said is right.  We are inundated with such long waiting lists that we cannot even get our heads up to think about these things.  That is what we would naturally do.  It has been an extraordinarily difficult three years.</p><p>It does not look as if it will ease up soon.  This is a weird opportunity to collaborate.</p><p> The Senator's point on bullying was very interesting.  Another collaboration that has happened relates to a speak-out tool, which is about anonymous reporting and which all higher education institutions have recently operated.  A section of that will be about bullying.  We are getting in lots of information that we will be able to look at and resource.  A lot of that information is about bullying.  The Senator is correct.  It would be interesting to see where that is coming from.  Is it coming from an older cohort that did not benefit from the second level?  That will be fascinating when we get it.  We are approximately a year away from looking at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#N00200"><p>I will touch on the point on outcomes.  Working in mental health services, the predominant outcome is bums on seats and reducing wait time for first appointments.  Those are the key performance indicators.  We do not have outcomes that look at how the systems work with each other.  A meeting between representatives of Jigsaw, CAMHS and third-level education does not count in someone's work return.  He or she is not encouraged to do that but is instead encouraged to see people for individual works.</p> <p>  The systems around young people include the services that work together and another piece we have not spoken about, that is, the families.  Young people do not exist in isolation.  We talk about the fact that we want to teach them resiliency skills.  We do not want to put additional pressures on them because we know they have standards of expectation and think they must be all of these things.  We tell young people they have to be resilient in the face of a parent who is unemployed or who is struggling for housing and that we will teach them the skill of being resilient when what we need to do is to give them those supports at home so they have predictability and financial support.  We also need the different parts of the system to be able to talk to each other.  We should be encouraged to have meetings about how we work together.  That is not the case because we are expected to firefight.  We are left to decide whether to cancel appointments and not meet with young people so we can work with a service to improve the systems or to meet the young people and not get that pressure.  Invariably, clinicians will choose the latter.  There needs to be a mandate that directs services to work together because otherwise we will continue what we have done before, which is to work in silos in isolation, and be restricted in opportunities such as this, where we actually get to talk to each other.  The parts of the system need to come together to improve the experiences of the young people.</p></speech>

It seems to be missing.  We have gone over time but Mr. Ryan has not had an opportunity to contribute so I invite him in.</p></speech>

That collaborative piece is very important because someone who is trying to recover from a mental health challenge has holistic needs.  It is unrealistic to think that one clinician or one person could address them.  A suite of expertise needs to be available.  As others have outlined, different organisations are better equipped to respond to different things.  We must always bear in mind the needs of the person who needs the help and ask what kind of intervention they want.  Some people, for good reasons of their own, may prefer not to have a clinical intervention and may look for something else.  We need to be able to respond to that sort of diverse demand as well.  That is important.</p></speech>

What will happen if there is no intervention or proper planning?  We have an opportunity here as we consider the future funding for higher education.  We either take it or we ignore the problems and issues our guests have presented us with today.  Is there a crisis?  Can it deepen if nothing is done about it?</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Duffy how much progress has been made in the implementation of the existing policies, such as the national student mental health and suicide prevention framework.  What are the greatest barriers to that implementation?  In his submission, he referred to a fragmented and inconsistent approach.  Are there disparities between different institutions in that regard?</p> <p>  I will also ask about inflation, the cost of living and the pressures on families and students.  It seems rising inflation is here to stay.  How big a factor will that be for the next 12 to 18 months in terms of the financial pressures on students?  I know we did a survey last year - we are all surveyed out - to which nine out of ten students responded that they were suffering from financial stress, either extreme stress or stress because of financial circumstances, whether caused by Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, the cost of accommodation of the other costs of third-level education.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether there is a crisis and there absolutely is.  There is a crisis of demand.  There is a crisis in trying to meet staffing needs.  There is also a crisis in terms of vision, how we are looking at the issue and how we understand it.  Not understanding something and not thinking about is a stand-alone issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about policies.  I am not best placed to respond to that because it is about looking at the policies that are there, how they are implemented and how they will be implemented, tracked and supported over time.  However, one of the things that our colleagues, including Ms Murphy, said earlier was that everybody working in the health system is, without a doubt, very well-intentioned.  They are trained to work on a systems level.  What is happening is that in many ways, as Mr. Smyth said, they are being forced to work on the individual level.  There is a real need to think about how we can use the valuable resources that are there.  What tends to happen, as we all know, is that we get invited to participate in the development of a particular policy.  That is a fantastic opportunity that people love and that fills them with energy.  It is then left to be implemented but the day job must be done.  It is important to consider how we free up time to believe that we need to build this system and need to put the resources and time into it while, at the same time, the tide is coming in and there are so many needs and resource shortcomings, and so many young people needing support.  That is why, as I said earlier, it is not just about deciding we are going to fund particular counselling hours.  We must consider how we are going to free up some expertise.  That is something with which we struggle within our organisation.  If we want to run a new initiative, we need to take somebody who is experienced.  We also need to think about the benefits of what that person is going to bring to the service.  It is about having staff with a range of experience.  Those are the benefits of assistance, of having people from multiple professions.</p></speech>

Some of my colleagues may be better able to comment.  What is important is moving to a whole-of-campus view and thinking about this as everybody's responsibility and not only that of the counselling service.  What often happens, particularly with respect to mental health, is that people getting very scared and when confronted with someone who has a mental health problem, they refer them elsewhere because they feel they cannot do anything.  It is important to send out the message that everybody has a role and everyone can do something.  They do not have to do everything but these matters are not just the responsibility of the counselling service.</p></speech>

One of the important things to remember is that the best outcomes come from a good therapeutic relationship.  Some years ago, I was involved in a school where there were serious challenges and a lot of expertise was brought in but the young people would not engage with it because they did not have the requisite therapeutic relationship or trust.</p><p>What Mr. Duffy is talking about is very important, that it is everybody's responsibility, not just the counsellor but anybody who engages with young people, or any person for that matter, that they feel they are equipped to help them.  There are programmes such as mental health first aid.  They should be CPD requirements that everybody should look at.</p></speech>

As always, these interactions help to bring people together so that they can have conversations with people they may not have met for the past couple of years despite the fact that they work in the same area.  We hear that quite a bit.  Two things strike me.  One is expanding on some of the previous points around the things that cause anxiety.  There is the intersectionality, that element that Mr. Duffy spoke about earlier.  We have come out of Covid-19, we are launched into the middle of a war and there is uncertainty about climate and the future for young people.  There is an awful lot going on in young people's lives that I certainly hear about.  As a Green Party member I certainly hear about the climate issue.  All of us are aware that sense of security has been taken from under people.  I see it with the young people I know.  It is not just one issue, it is the fact that you never know what is around the corner.  I do not think that it has to do with one issue or another, it is just the complete lack of security now in people's lives and things are moving so fast.  That inevitably is going to bring more challenges.  Where people may have felt we had come out of Covid-19 and will deal with the consequences, we will probably see more challenges going forward.  Will the witnesses share any thoughts they have on that?</p> <p>  The other thing is, from the point of view of our work, at the end of these processes we come up with a set of recommendations based on witnesses' testimonies.  It seems quite clear that recommendations about a systematic approach or process that works everywhere is what is needed, and that it is not about an individual who is overworked saying they must phone Jigsaw to see how they can work together.  Do the witnesses have recommendations that would work for each of them?  Should it be something outside of them that would pull everything together?</p></speech>

It is everything from one-to-one, using local services, peer support and many different aspects.  If we want to reach international best practice, looking at it systemically is exactly what we will be doing.  We are well-placed to do that.  Many systems are in place to do that now, if we could simply get time to model it and extra funding to get ourselves more time to model it.</p></speech>

It sounds very simple but it often gets completely lost because we end up in terms of ratios or looking at particular funding paradigms.  It is about trying to think what will make sense for a particular young person and what are his or her needs.  Their needs are going to vary.  As Mr. Smyth and others were saying in regard to looking at services, when we think about our particular relationship around an SLA with the HSE or with particular funders it is about whether there is criteria for how it operates and how it works in a programmatic way with other agencies.  That is useful in terms of looking at it.  Rather than people doing it as a tick-box, there needs to be a qualitative piece for that in terms of how it leads to improving the lives of young people.</p></speech>

In regard to social media, news is now 24 hours.  Some of us will remember when news was only on at certain times and that is where you got it and you had to tune into it.  None of that is filtered now.  It is always available.  There is much more reliance on young people to manage themselves whereas society, news and everything else was managed in a particular way and there was a certain rhythm to it.  People are very concerned in terms of thinking about are even the seasons gone, how do we know about that, or have borders gone.  We are trying to think about where the young person gets a sense of security in themselves.  That begins very early on and we know that from psychological theory.  How do we embed and support that?  As a society, things that are really important are the child-parent relationship, the relationship with the community and the importance of team, sports and connection around the environment.  How are we prizing these things?  Are we just prizing getting a first in your degree?  What do we want as a society, as a country, as Ireland?</p></speech>

The committee on a number of occasions had engagement in particular around bullying in schools.  Senator O'Reilly referred to the report we produced, which recommended that every school would have access to emotional supports and counselling.  We are talking here about third level education but building on Senator O'Reilly's first question, sometimes at third level we see the impact of bullying that was not addressed or a situation where a young person has not been helped or supported.  Dr. Duffy spoke earlier about the fact that around 17 is the age when young people start to demonstrate their mental health challenges.  I have been working with a group led by Shona Brady who put much work into this.  We feel strongly about this as a committee.  That is bearing in mind the issues that Mr. Smyth raised about educational psychologists as well and the challenges that are there.  What does Mr. Smyth think about something like that being put in place?  I take on board what Ms Murphy said earlier about addressing bullying.  Has anybody a comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022040500002#O01100"><p>It feeds into a couple of conversations we have had about anxiety and what are the contributors.  There are indeed those higher level pieces about Covid-19 and Ukraine etc.  However, for me working with teenagers, and it touches on what Mr. Ryan said, the main anxiety they have is relational: am I good enough, do I fit in, do I have friends, do I have family.  They are the main things they worry about.  Obviously bullying is one of those things that directly impedes that because the impact of bullying behaviour is &ldquo;you are not good enough&rdquo;.  Many people already inherently have that sense of &ldquo;I am not good enough&rdquo; and bullying reinforces that.  I think Dr. Morning is right about that age of 17 being the time when significant mental health challenges arise.  What I see is similar to what Dr. Morning said on transitions.  At 13 years old young people moving from a primary school where they are relatively well protected.  There is one teacher and there is predictability.  In secondary education young people have 11 teachers, different classrooms and they are the youngest again and the question is how to fit in.  There are different rules and different expectations of what is good enough.  We see the early impacts of exclusion, bullying and not fitting in at 13 years old later on when they get to 14, 15, 16 and 17 years old.  It is coming back to those pieces.  We need counselling supports when those things have happened but we also need to prevent them.</p> <p>  We have talked an awful lot about firefighting and responding when the impact has happened but we need to do our best to eliminate it as best we can, to identify it and not to be afraid to have conversations, for schools to feel empowered to have those conversations and not worry about how this will reflect on them as a school or as a teaching environment so that everybody can have open conversations.  We need a bit of both.  It is both preventative but also being supportive.  It still comes back to relations and what Jigsaw says &ndash; I have quoted Jigsaw for many years &ndash; about the importance of one good adult.  Much of the work I do is actually not just about what I do with that young person, it is who can I support around them, who is the adult who can be there on Friday at 8 p.m. when the young person feels lonely because nobody has asked him or her out, or on Sunday evening before school.  They are far more effective.  If we support the families and carers about managing anxiety in the environment and in the moment when it happens we will have a far more effective approach than sitting with me for an hour in a room.</p></speech>

Much of the time they are preceded by subclinical forms or warning signs as these conditions begin to develop.  We know from research that things such as adverse childhood experience, which would cover things such as bullying, increase one&rsquo;s risk.  When talking about having universal preventative approaches that kind of focus on social aspects like within the family and so on, more targeted preventative and early intervention approaches can identify those who are at increased because of previous experience; that can be a very important piece of the puzzle.</p></speech>

I can even see the synergy today between everyone, in terms of picking up different issues and where all the witnesses work.  We all have the same endgame, which is to support our young people at every level, but in this case, in third level.  In addition, we try to prevent situations where they are presenting with mental health challenges.  Life is stressful enough as it is, without all of the challenges that the past few years have thrown at us.  I thank Deputies and Senators as well.</p> <p>  The meeting is now adjourned.</p></speech>

Joining us remotely from New York is Mr. Yoseph Haddad, who is an Israeli Arab citizen.  On behalf of the committee I welcome everybody.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will hear the opening statements of the witnesses followed by a discussion and questions and answers with members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions to allow all members an opportunity to participate.  I hope we will have a second opportunity for members to come back in should they so desire.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that any such direction is complied with.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present in our meeting room does.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable.</p><p>I remind members that they are only allowed to participate remotely in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.

By employing this very distinct term, a term that elicits powerful emotions in peoples and states, we believe the report to be a tactical step as part of a much broader strategy of delegitimisation to deny Israel the right to defend itself and to terminate its existence as the nation state of the Jewish people.<br/><br/>I am joined by two fellow members of the alliance, the former Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence, and voluntary chair of Magen David Adom Ireland, Alan Shatter, and Audrey Griffin, the author of <i>Hey Ireland! Israel&rsquo;s On The Line: Are We Prepared For A Potential Holocaust?</i>I am also joined remotely from New York by Yoseph Haddad, a private Arab-Israeli citizen of Israel and CEO of Together - Vouch for Us, an Israeli NGO that seeks to create better understanding and co-operation between Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews.<br/><br/>I remind the committee that the Ireland Israel Alliance, an entirely voluntarily run, non-profit organisation, was established in 2018 because a growing number of Irish citizens from across the political spectrum and from all religious backgrounds and none were, and continue to be, of the opinion that the pervasive narrative circulating in the Irish public arena regarding Israel was, and still is, disproportionately focused against Israel.  Our objective remains to bring more balance to that narrative and to make a constructive contribution to the debate.<br/><br/>On that note, I thank the Taoiseach and the Government for refusing to adopt Amnesty&rsquo;s outrageous apartheid depiction, which is one that is entirely divorced from the reality on the ground, is a gross distortion of truth and is employed to demonise and delegitimise the Israeli state.  Ireland is not alone in taking this stand, as the US, Germany, the United Kingdom, Austria, the Czech Republic, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and France also reject Amnesty&rsquo;s charge, as have organisations and individuals across the world, including Mansour Abbas, leader of the Arab Muslim nationalist party that forms part of Israel&rsquo;s governing coalition.  I will defer shortly to Yoseph Haddad, himself an Israeli Arab, who will speak about this reality.<br/><br/>The Amnesty report has essentially repackaged the ideologically-inspired claims of the Human Rights Watch, HRW, and B&rsquo;Tselem reports that preceded it; these are baseless, ideologically-motivated claims that are, in reality, an impediment to peace between Arabs and Jews in the region.  It is worth noting that the founder of Human Rights Watch, Robert Bernstein, who for several decades was president of Random House, one of the most prestigious publishers in the United States, published an article in <i>The New York Times</i>in 2009 strongly criticising the organisation he founded for ignoring serious human rights violations in closed societies, for its anti-Israel bias and for &quot;issuing reports [...] that are helping those who wish to turn Israel into a pariah state&quot;. <br/><br/>That B&rsquo;Tselem&rsquo;s similar report comes from an Israeli NGO serves to illustrate that far from being the oppressive, apartheid state B&rsquo;Tselem claims it to be, Israel continues to &quot;ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; [guaranteeing] freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture&quot;, as outlined in Israel&rsquo;s declaration of independence of May 1948.  I encourage anyone here who may not have already read the declaration, to do so.  It appealed for peace and extended a hand of friendship to all Israel&rsquo;s neighbouring Arab states, which was rejected by all of them in 1948, and led to Israel being forced to fight the first of many defensive wars.<br/><br/>Most disturbingly of all are Amnesty&rsquo;s recommendations, beginning on page 272 of the 280-page report.  To say that it is effectively calling for the dismantling of the State of Israel may not be immediately obvious to some, but let us take a closer look.  Amnesty advocates for the &quot;right of return&quot; of some 5.7 million &quot;Palestinian refugees&quot; to Israel, a country slightly smaller than the province of Munster, and which if implemented, would effectively mean the elimination of Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people.  In Amnesty&rsquo;s distorted view, every descendent of the original 750,000 Palestinians who fled Israel during the war in 1948 should be granted a &quot;right of return&quot;, a demand not supported by international law.  Amnesty also calls for a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel, including &quot;security equipment&quot;.  This sounds very much like a call for Israel to be denied the capacity to defend itself when attacked, as well as an objection to Israel maintaining its Iron Dome air defence system.  This system intercepted up to 90% of the more than 4,300 Hamas rockets fired indiscriminately into Israeli cities over an 11-day period in May 2021 and saved the lives of countless Jews, Arabs and other minorities in Israel.<br/><br/>At a time when many Arab countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, UAE, Bahrain and Morocco, are developing closer commercial and defence ties with Israel, and relations between Arabs and Jews are flourishing in many parts of the Middle East, it is tragic that Amnesty, on the heels of two similarly ideologically-motivated NGOs, would produce a report that foments distrust and inflames existing tensions within Israel and the disputed territories, ignores Palestinian rejectionism and whitewashes its violence, and, via the misuse of the emotionally-charged apartheid label, advocates for the dismantling of the State of Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people.  My colleague, Mr. Haddad, would like to comment next.</p></speech>

In the past, the committee has heard from several speakers about my country, Israel, and the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.  I am here today as a private citizen of the State of Israel to share my experience and provide the truth about what is happening in Israel from the minority perspective.</p> <p>  I am an Israeli Arab.  I was born in Haifa, which is the largest mixed city of Arabs and Jews in the country.  I was raised in Nazareth, the largest Arab city in the State of Israel.  This may surprise some members of the committee after what they have been hearing about Israel.  I, all my friends and all my community, however, regularly interact with Israelis from all sectors.  A major part of my childhood involved playing football, and I grew up playing football with Jews, Christians and Muslims.  I will tell the committee one thing: we did not see each other as being any different.</p> <p>  Fast forwarding to the age of 18, military service or national service is mandatory in Israel for Jewish citizens.  However, every year thousands of Israeli Arabs volunteer, and this number is increasing over time.  When I turned 18, I saw my Jewish friends go to the army, and I did not understand why I, as an Arab, would not also serve my country.  After all, it is my home just as much as theirs.</p><p>Even more important is that the Israeli Defense Forces, IDF, does not stand for the Jewish defence forces; rather, it is the Israeli Defense Forces.  This means that its purpose is to protect all its citizens, including 2 million Arab Israelis.  Just before my service was about to begin, the Maxim restaurant in Haifa, which is owned by Arabs and Jews, was targeted by a Palestinian terrorist who suicide bombed the restaurant, killing 21 Israelis, Arabs and Jews, and injuring 51.  I learned a painful but important lesson that day.  These terrorists did not care that they were killing Arabs.  They targeted us because we are Israelis; just the same as Hezbollah in Lebanon fired on the Israeli Arab city in the second Lebanon war; just the same as how nearly half of the Israeli civilian casualties from the second Lebanon war were Arab Israeli Muslims; just the same as Hamas who fired rockets on Israeli Arab towns throughout the country in May 2021, killing Arab Muslims.  </p><p> When we Arab Israelis join the IDF, we do it to defend our country too.  When the committee understands this, it will see that this is not a racial conflict, but a political one because we too as Arabs are targets of Palestinian terrorism.  Just last week, a Palestinian terrorist murdered an Israeli Arab, Amir Khoury, in an attack where he murdered four other Israelis.  Days before that, 19-year-old Yezen Falah from the Arab Druze community was murdered in another terror attack.  Despite that, people from outside of Israel continue to lie about the reality that we as Israeli Arabs face.</p><p> Here is the reality that the committee did not hear from Amnesty International.  Arab Israelis, both Muslims and Christians, make up 20% of the entire population and enjoy equal rights under the law, the same as any other Jewish citizens.  In Israel basic laws, the right to freedom of religion is protected explicitly, as is the right to equality under the law and the democratic principle of the state.  We are observing the highest level of nearly every position and, in fact, are over-represented in some industries.  We are 30% of all doctors, despite the fact that we are 20% of the population.  We are roughly 50% of all pharmacists.  In the last round of new doctors, Arabs comprised 50%.  Arab Israelis are diplomats, such as the ambassador to Azerbaijan, George Deek.  They are news anchors, professional athletes, military leaders, singers, senior technology executives, such as Johny Srouji, the head of Apple in Israel.  They are bankers, such as Dr. Samer Haj Yehia, who is the chairman of Bank Leumi, which is the largest bank in Israel.  Yes, they are even supreme court justices, just like Khaled Kabub, who was recently elected the first Arab Muslim to serve on the Israeli Supreme Court.  It is true that Israel is a Jewish state, but it is also a democratic state and I am living proof that it is possible.</p><p> While Israel is imperfect and racism exists, it is not systematic, but individual.  Everyday Arabs and Jews are standing side-by-side working to resolve the problems in our society.  Yet, does the committee know what does not help our society?  White Europeans at Amnesty International telling our sovereign nation of Arabs and Jews how to run our country.  Even more appallingly, Amnesty International has the audacity to define my identity as an Arab, labelling me as Palestinian, despite the fact that I am an Israeli Arab.  Not only that, but according to recent polls on identity by Saharia, only 14% of Israeli Arabs define themselves as Palestinian.  This is 14% of 2 million, yet Amnesty International thinks it knows better than us about how to define us.  This report is about eliciting an emotional response, despite the fact that definition of "apartheid" according to international law does not apply to the State of Israel in any capacity.</p><p> Speaking of smearing my country, Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett stood here days ago and claimed there was a double standard in condemning Russia but not Israel.  Even the Ukrainian president stated that Ukraine is Israel not Palestine.  It is Israel that is being targeted with thousands of rockets by a terrorist organisation that wants to see the entire state destroyed.  The Palestinians wants Israel to cease to exist, just as Russia wants Ukraine to cease to exist.  This propaganda exercise is a cynical exploitation of the tragedy of Ukraine in an obsessive attempt to once again shift the conversation to bashing Israel.  While Amnesty International and others fan the flames of hatred against Israel, it is us Israelis, both Arabs and Jews, who pay the price on the ground.  Amnesty International's report is the highest of elitism of a modern-day colonial mindset that thinks, &ldquo;We Europeans know better than you brown people how to manage your country&rdquo;.  Did they expect me not to be able to think for myself, not to have my own thoughts and my own opinion to review their ignorant misunderstanding of what is happening in Israel?  </p><p> Allow me, an Arab born and raised in the country of Israel, which seems to gather much attention from this body, to explain to the committee what Israel really stands for.  Israel stands for democracy, with a government that is comprised of left wing and right wing religious and secular Muslims, Jewish, Christian, LGBTQ and disabled members.  Israel stands for the rule of law, where our previous Arab supreme court judge Salim Joubran, sent a Jewish president and a Jewish prime minister to prison when they committed crimes.  Israel stands for freedom of expression, where members of the government can openly criticise their state, including in Arabic, in the walls of the parliament.  Let me tell the committee that we speak Arabic in the Knesset.  Israel stands for freedom of speech, where the press can, and does, openly criticise the government without fear of arrest and prosecution.  By the way, unlike in the West Bank and in Gaza, Israel stands for humanity, where the IDF itself launched a hospital for the sole purpose of providing humanitarian aid and treatment for Syrians who were injured in the Syrian civil war, despite the fact that Syria is an enemy country.  Israel stands for providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, even when Hamas bombed their own humanitarian aid convoy, which occurred in May 2021.  It stands for forming new alliances with Arab states across the region, for the benefit of both people, such as in the Abraham Accords Declaration.  Israel stands for accepting the UN partition plan, when the Arabs of the region said "No" and launched a war.  It stands for granting full citizenship to Arabs who remain, like me and my family.  It stands for taking chances and painful sacrifices for peace over and over again, even when it ends up with getting more than 15,000 rockets fired at our civilians by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  It stands for Arab doctors and nurses saving the lives of Jewish patients in the hospitals and for Jewish doctors and nurses saving the lives of Arab patients.  It stands for Arabs and Jews who stand side by side every day as citizens of that state.  Israel, my country, stands for life.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Shatter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022040500002#C00300"><p>I want to bring a message to this meeting because I have been watching the various, repetitive sessions saying same things repetitively about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The message is that words matter.  Truth matters.  We learned that through 30 years of conflict on this island.  Words can contribute to bridge building, reconciliation and peace and understanding.  They can also distort history and today's reality, exacerbate division, ferment hatred and incite and trigger violence, murder and terrorism.</p> <p>  The Amnesty International report that we are discussing falls into the latter category.  At a time of reconciliation and growing co-operation between Israel and Arab states across the Middle East, all of whom aspire to a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Amnesty&rsquo;s poisoned, unbalanced report can do nothing other than fuel public hostility within Arab states and elsewhere to constructive engagement, the deepening of new relationships and conflict resolution.</p> <p>  The report purports to present itself as a detailed analysis of Israeli Government conduct since Israel&rsquo;s declaration of independence in 1948 and condemns it as engaged since then in the application of a system of apartheid.  That is the headline-catching big lie currently fashionable within some campaigning and ideological circles.</p><p>It is designed to undermine the pivotal foundational role of United Nations Resolution 181 of November 1947, which expressly prescribed the creation of two states, an independent Jewish state and an independent Arab state, and an international regime to govern Jerusalem.  Amnesty's report says nothing about the aggressive illegal war launched by Israel's surrounding Arab states to eliminate it at birth, which also sabotaged the Jerusalem governance mechanism.  Amnesty is critical of Israel being the one and only Jewish state in the world and is on record asserting, contrary to the 1947 UN resolution, that it should not exist as a Jewish state.  To maintain its despicable depiction of Israel, one of the most culturally diverse and blended states on the planet, as systemically racist, it studiously ignores the legal fact it is internationally designated to be a Jewish state and so created and recognised by the United Nations.  It ignores the expulsion of 800,000 Jews from neighbouring Arab states who obtained refuge in Israel rendering those states <i>judenrein</i>.  It also ignores the fact that Israel, unlike some other states and entities in the Middle East, is not only a democracy but, as Yoseph Haddad states, also fully facilitates and protects freedom of religion.<br/><br/>Amnesty's report entirely ignores the region's true history, including the rejection by all Arab states and the local Arab population from day one of the two-state solution structured by the 1947 UN resolution, the continued state of belligerence to which Israel was subjected in the decades that followed; that again in 1967 and 1973 it had to fight for its continued existence; that between 1948 and 1967 when Gaza was occupied by Egypt and the West Bank, and East Jerusalem by Jordan, nothing was done to establish the new Arab state the UN prescribed in 1947 or any Palestinian state.  Amnesty also substantially ignores the substantive provisions of the 1993-95 Oslo Accords, which facilitated the creation of the Palestinian Authority and the specific detailed arrangements agreed to govern areas A, B and C on the West Bank, it ignores Arab and Palestinian rejectionism and the backdrop to and impact of both the first and second intifada and the terrorist atrocities perpetrated, which resulted in the murder and maiming of thousands of Israeli men, women and children of all backgrounds.  Amnesty ignores the ongoing defensive and security measures required by Israel to this day to protect all Israelis from attack and atrocities, the wars as initiated by Hamas from Gaza, toxic internal Palestinian division and governance dysfunction, the multiple attempts made by the Israeli state and successive prime ministers in talks with Palestinian leaders to effect conflict resolution and implement a two-state solution.<br/><br/>The report grossly misrepresents the reality of daily life in Israel.  As Mr. Haddad says, Israeli law applies equally to all Israeli citizens, including the 20% of Israelis who are not Jewish, that a variety of Israeli Supreme Court judgments have asserted the equality of all Israeli citizens under Israeli basic law; that interventions of that Court, much like our own Supreme Court, have prevented government and state overreach.  It ignores that all Israeli citizens have access to every type of employment, to first, second and third level education, participate together in every type of sport, that non-Jewish Israeli citizens are represented and have leadership roles across Israeli society, throughout all professions, are members of the Knesset and the Israeli Government, the Israeli judiciary all the way to its supreme court, professors and lecturers in Israeli universities, doctors and nurses throughout the Israeli healthcare system, and play for, captain and coach Israeli international teams.  The report totally misrepresents and distorts the Israeli political process and totally ignores the fact that the current Israeli Government is entirely dependent on a Muslim Brotherhood Arab party led by the already mentioned, Mansour Abbas, with whom the authors of the Amnesty report did not even engage.  It also ignores the cross-community involvement throughout Israel of approximately 25,000 Magen David Adom professionals and trained volunteers who act as emergency medical responders.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the Amnesty report misrepresents what is a territorial and political conflict relating to Israeli and Palestinian nationhood and identity as a racial conflict.  It does not contain an objective, factual and legal analysis but a smorgasbord of distorted history, ideological philandering masquerading as fact and is fundamentally legally flawed.  Amnesty, in its report, admits that it set out to examine the conduct of the Israeli Government through the framework of apartheid.  Having acknowledged the heinous form of apartheid notoriously applied in South Africa to be inapplicable, Amnesty then proceeds to apply a new variant, ideologically spun and created to smear the Israeli state, knowing apartheid in the public mind to be synonymous with the evil inflicted by South Africa's white supremacy governments.  In doing so, Amnesty misappropriates South Africa's bitter and cruel history and exploits for its own purposes the grievous wrong of many decades inflicted on South Africa's non-white community.<br/><br/>The report does not properly distinguish between Israel and the West Bank, between Israel and Gaza, nor between the West Bank and Gaza and presents as largely ignorant of or deliberately ignoring the widely known history of Jerusalem.  Crucially, it does not properly address the distinction between international humanitarian law and international human rights law and fails to distinguish between international law provisions applicable to disputed or occupied territory and those applicable to the territory of internationally recognised states, such as Israel.  It is a pity that its ideological and distorted depiction of the conflict, which reflects Soviet ideology going back to the 1950s and the infamous rescinded UN motion labelling Zionism as racism, has to date been so uncritically accepted by most members of this committee and Parliament and its language replicated.<br/><br/>Israel of course, like Ireland, is far from perfect.  Much can be validly criticised and should change or be reformed, but Israel's flaws cannot be correctly depicted as derived from a system of apartheid any more than Ireland's.  Is it the view of this committee that our country is applying a system of apartheid because of our failure to address the issue of Traveller accommodation, the shortage of affordable accommodation for young people, the plight of those in direct provision, delays in accessing healthcare experienced by those who lack private health insurance, the lack of adequate timely services for children with disabilities, the inadequacy of psychiatric services, the almost total absence of non-white presenters in State media such as RT&Eacute;, the existence of superior facilities in some private schools compared with public schools and the delays and difficulty experienced by non-EU foreign residents in Ireland effecting family reunification?  Does that justify Ireland being internationally labelled and demonised as applying an apartheid system or being an apartheid state or does it simply illustrate we are not perfect and much remains to be done?<br/><br/>Some members of this committee and other Oireachtas Members have frequently depicted the Israeli security wall or fence, which is referenced by Amnesty in its report, as an apartheid wall.  The necessity for the wall derives from the fact that more than 1,000 Israelis died during the second intifada between 2000 and 2005 and the Israeli Government was compelled to protect its citizens from Palestinian terrorism.  In Northern Ireland, peace walls still exist to this day to protect local communities from sectarian violence.  None of those who reference an apartheid wall in Israel similarly label the peace walls nor label Northern Ireland, whatever its governance failures, as an apartheid state.  Incidentally the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, is in reality a great deal more diverse than is this Parliament or Stormont.<br/><br/>The ideological intellectual gyrations through which the Amnesty report travels to substantiate the false charge of a new form of apartheid would be laughable if not designed to demonise and delegitimise the only Jewish state in the world, the state to which the Jewish people are indigenous, the state recreated and arisen from the ashes of history to always be a safe haven for the Jewish people who have not, in a single century over 2,000 years, been free of persecution.  It is the safe haven this State refused to offer persecuted Jews attempting to escape Nazi Germany and emaciated survivors of German concentration camps.</p><p>This committee in its deliberations, as I have watched them, is on the wrong side of history.  As far as I know, to date, it has had nothing positive to say about the Abraham accords, historical meetings taking place and agreements between Israeli leaders and leaders of Jordan, Egypt, UAE, Morocco and Bahrain or the real advances in peace, reconciliation, economic co-operation and environment protection taking place throughout the Middle East.</p><p> It has had nothing, ever, to say about Palestinian rejectionism of every advance achieved and Iran&rsquo;s malign role in the Middle East.  Nor is anything ever said about Palestinian political parties, terrorist and civil groups celebrating in Gaza, Jerusalem and in the West Bank murderous terrorist atrocities, when committed, such as those of the past three weeks that resulted in the death of 11 people and the maiming of many others.  Those murdered include two Ukrainian men, a 19-year-old Druze police officer, a Christian Arab police officer, four Jewish women and a rabbi wheeling a child in a pram.  It is equal-opportunity terrorism with cross-community tragic impact.</p><p> Too many members of this committee advocate boycott, divestment and sanctions, BDS, and are supportive of Irish NGOs opposed to normalisation of relations between Israelis and Palestinians when from everything we have learned on this island they should encourage dialogue and engagement.  Of course, if it chose, this committee could positively contribute to conflict resolution by encouraging the Government to apply the lessons of our own peace process to the conflict and exploring what positive steps it could take to encourage and foster dialogue, trust and confidence building, cross-community engagement, reconciliation and to increase Palestinian economic development.  </p><p> The unquestioning acceptance in previous hearings, by most members of this committee, of the deeply-flawed, ideologically-inspired report leads to three simple questions I will put to this committee.  I regret the absence of some members who have been vociferously critical of Israel in the past.  What is the objective of this committee in holding these hearings?  It is not clear to anybody.  Is it the objective of some to recreate in Israel the terrorist violence and atrocities perpetrated over a period of 30 years on this island by the Provisional IRA and loyalist paramilitaries and in Israel, the terrorist atrocities of the second intifada?  How many members of this committee seek the de-legitimisation and destruction of the world&rsquo;s only Jewish state?  These are serious questions that only each member of this committee can answer.</p><p> I have final questions about Amnesty and its report.  Why did Amnesty spend so much time on creating this toxic, selected edifice of half-truths and lies?  Why not use that time positively?  Why not spend that time encouraging dialogue, engagement, conflict resolution and reconciliation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.357" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Audrey Griffin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022040500002#E00200"><p>I thank an Cathaoirleach and members of the committee for the opportunity to speak.  A major indictment against the report is the deliberate decontextualisation of a conflict.  According to Amnesty, Israel was born out of the 1947 to 1949 conflict, thus creating the illusion that Jews used military aggression to take over the land.  This is not true.  Rather, the international community voted, in November 1947, in favour of the UN partition plan to provide a state for the Jewish people in their ancient homeland, alongside another state for the Arabs.<br/><br/>It was the Arab leaders' rejection of the 1947 UN partition plan and their subsequent goal to annihilate the fledgling State of Israel in May 1948 that was the source of the conflict that ensued.  Indeed, as many as seven nations on today's atlas, whose populations totalled 140 million formed an alliance and attacked Israel within hours of the implementation of its statehood.  Despite the odds being 200:1, Israel, with its meagre population of 650,000, survived the genocidal attack and somehow emerged victorious, not forgetting, that 1%, or one out of every 100 Israelis, was killed in this, the war of independence.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the majority of Arabs who were living there at the time, were recent immigrants from other parts of the Middle East and North Africa who had heard of the amazing restoration of the land by Jewish immigrants, a land that had been virtually uninhabitable for centuries.  According to author Mark Twain, who toured what was then called Palestine in 1866, this was a desolate country and a mosquito-infested swampland.  There had been no interest in reviving it before small Jewish colonies began to arrive from Europe from the late 1800s onwards.<br/><br/>Arab-Israeli journalist, Khaled Abu Toameh, explains how his ancestors were the ones who refused to take the advice of Arab leaders in 1947 to 1948, to temporarily leave their homes and lands until the Jews had been eliminated, after which they were promised they could return.  In solidarity, the State of Israel subsequently granted full Israeli citizenship to these Arabs and to other minority groups that had not abandoned it or sought its annihilation.  Other loyal native ethnic groups, such as Arameans, also became Israeli citizens.<br/><br/>The Arabs, however, who took the advice of their conspiring and genocidal leaders and left the land became the original 720,000 refugees, known since the 1960s, as Palestinian refugees.  It is important to understand and yet it is omitted from the report, that prior to 1964, the Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza were not designated Palestinians.  Those who call themselves Palestinians today are non-distinguishable in culture and language from other Arabs.  The strategic designation was devised and applied by the terrorist leader, Yasser Arafat, when he formed the militant Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, in 1964.<br/><br/>This report has ignored the historical context in which the conflict is embedded.  Amnesty International has proven that it is neither interested in history nor in truth and it is certainly not interested in the reconciliation of the groups in question.  There are those who seek peace and reconciliation, such as Fr. Gabriel Naddaf, who boldly declares that Israel is a shining example of human rights in the Middle East.  Fr. Naddaf is a native Aramean Israeli who encourages young Israeli Arabs to join the Israel Defense Forces.<br/><br/>One can read the testimonies and quotations of numerous Arab Israelis, Palestinians and many other brave advocates of Israel in my book, <i>Hey Ireland! Israel's On The Line: Are We Prepared For A Potential Holocaust?</i>Muintir na h&Eacute;ireann, will we turn a blind eye, as Amnesty has, and be on the wrong side of history?  To quote Fr. Naddaf, &quot;end ... [the] witch hunt of [Israel] the only free country in the region&quot;.</p></speech>

I very much welcome their contributions to a debate that is a frequent agenda item on our committee.  I reject any criticism of this committee.  While criticism might be reserved for individual members of this committee, we are always keen to give every opportunity to groups such as the Ireland Israel Alliance to make their submission and attend our hearings.</p> <p>  Our witnesses will be aware of the fact that since the Amnesty report was published earlier this year, Amnesty had an opportunity to brief senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>The issue was the subject of a D&aacute;il debate.  The report was the subject of an extensive Seanad debate, and Amnesty International sought an opportunity to present the findings of the report before this committee.  I along with other members of this committee are very keen to ensure balance in the context of our deliberations.  This is why following the submission of Amnesty International to our committee, the members and I, as Chairman, felt it only appropriate that the Ireland-Israel Alliance would have an opportunity to join us this afternoon in order to, in the words of Ms Goodall, refute aspects of the report or, perhaps, even the report in its entirety.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that the committee should be the subject of criticism such as that which we have just heard.  I am pleased to go to members for their questions.</p></speech>

I reject the notion of apartheid straight off.  I do not take any side in the conflict.  It is deeply distressing to see some of the TV pictures coming back.  The issue of the disputed territories needs to be resolved quickly.</p> <p>  I am a bit concerned about the direction in which the debate has moved in Ireland over recent years, especially in recent months.  The story has become one-sided instead of two-sided.  I do not live in a city or a village that would be likely to be attacked by rockets at any time of the day or night.  I defend Israel's right to have hardware that would allow it to take rockets down as they come in.  I do not for one moment defend some of the, shall we say, rather brutal approaches taken by the Israeli defence forces.  I think it is a pity.  I wore a uniform and I know how easy it is to probably be more brutal than you should be when you are afraid and under pressure.</p> <p>  Maybe I am outside the majority on this, but what can we do to change the narrative about the region - not about Israel the state but about the region?  The story is becoming very one-sided.  I do not accept that it is a one-sided issue.  Mr. Shatter referred to 40 years experience in this country.  I was on the receiving end of it myself for a period.  There are no right sides in a conflict; there are just different sides.  My concern is that for some reason or other in this country, one side is getting much higher-profile recognition than the other.  I want you guys to tell us what we need to do to assist a peace process.  Some of my colleagues might disagree with this, but we got a peace process here in Ireland in the late 1990s, sat back and clapped ourselves on the back and said "Job done, let's forget about it".  Peace needs to be worked at all day, every day.  We need to figure out what it is we have to do to get that peace.</p> <p>  I was really impressed by Mr. Haddad's presentation because I know there are Arabs who want to work in Israel, live side by side and engage on a regular basis.  I know there are many hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who work and live in Israel and live their lives normally.  It is very hard not to take the side of the lesser - the Palestinian group.  I have criticised Israel openly and have been quite vociferous in that criticism in the past.  I recall an incident in Brussels where they laid out the shoes of children who had been killed as a result of Israeli attacks on the West Bank and Gaza.  I was critical of Israel at that time.  Since then, I have spent a lot more time looking at the conflict.  I am convinced there is no right side here.  There are two sides that need to find a way to come together.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending.  It is not easy to come in here and face people who have been extremely critical of the state the witnesses love.  If the witnesses were Palestinians, I would say the same thing to them.  I really want to know what we can do to build relationships.  I also want to know what damage we have done with some of the things that have been said in our Parliament.</p></speech>

I agree with the Chairman that the committee is doing its best throughout the process to be on the side of truth and objectivity.  I certainly know the Chairman is doing his best in this regard.  I would like to think that we, as members, are or should be.</p> <p>  At the outset, a few things need to be said because I want to get to the substantive things in the Amnesty International report.</p><p>While they have not been made today, suggestions that people who are critical of Israel are in some way anti-Semites could not be further from the truth.  I can assure our guests of that.  I can also assure them that, as the distinguished Chairman is aware, I studied history in college and enjoyed it.  I am painfully and tragically aware of the history of the Jewish people.  There is no escaping that one.  It is the reality.  Obviously, it has been an issue and might have prevented straight talking in the past and still does because nobody wants to deny that history.<br/><br/>I refer to the essence of the points made in the Amnesty report.  I accept the point that, for Israeli people living in it, Israel is a model of democracy and a very progressive modern state with liberal values and so on.  The real point here is that Amnesty says there is a distinction in the context of how Arabs within the Israeli state are dealt with and that it is not quite as draconian there, although the report refers to the displacement of the Bedouin Palestinians in the Negev or al-Naqab area.  It cites that as an example of an internal issue.  The real issue is not Israel itself but, rather, the occupied territories.  That is what we are discussing.  First, we are discussing the recent allegation that there was discrimination in the context of the provision of vaccines to 5 million Palestinians, which would be in breach of UN laws for occupied territories.  It is alleged that a distinction was made in that context.<br/><br/>There is the issue of dispossession and resettlements in that area and a suggestion that those dispossessions and resettlements are making it impossible to have a two-state solution.  Due to the way they are situated across the occupied territories, one could not smoothly create a two-state solution unless the people who have settled there were resettled back into Israel, which would be a difficult situation.  It has been suggested that the purpose of that is almost to prevent a two-state solution and that we may have to come up with another solution.<br/><br/>The Amnesty report suggests, as does the recent report of Michael Lynk, the UN special rapporteur, that there are problems with water supply, natural resources, electricity and services such as garbage collection and so on in the occupied territories.  It suggests there is a discriminatory set-up there, with military rule, with checkpoints, dispossession and a whole discriminatory process.  Gaza has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world.  It is sort of a completely different economic zone.  It is all these differences in the human rights and administrative regimes, as well as services, along with the dispossession of people, that leads to the charge of apartheid.  Amnesty suggests this is being done on three levels.  It is supported by the UN report.<br/><br/>I hope our guests will be the first to say that the present situation cannot continue.  I know that one of the points they make relates to violence emanating from the occupied territories.  Nobody supports such violence but, at the same time, the response is totally over the top and it is nearly providing a blanket situation for discrimination.  Those are some my initial points to our guests.  I am interested in their responses.  The committee is genuinely in the business of finding out the truth and we are listening carefully to what they say.  I had a very good meeting with the previous Israeli ambassador.  I have no problem with anything like that.  This is not about the demonisation of any race of people.  As Senator Craughwell stated, it is about getting the right thing done.  It is not in the interests of Israel or humanity to retain the <i>status quo</i>and the kind of regime and conditions that exist in the context of the 2 million people in Gaza, or on the West Bank or in Jerusalem.  It is not in the interests of humanity for that to continue.  Ultimately, as we know only too well from this island, such situations result in constant flare-ups.  I ask our guests to address those issues.</p></speech>

It is important that when a report such as the Amnesty report is sent to the committee and we hold hearings on it, we also have balance.  That is the purpose of this meeting - to listen to the other side and give it an opportunity to refute some of the issues put forward.  I want to move on from the report, although I know we are here to discuss it.  Last week, Professor Lynk appeared before the committee.  I described his presentation as amounting to grim reading.  I am interested to hear what Ms Goodall has to say in respect of that report.  It may not be appropriate for her to comment on it today but she may be able to do so another day or in writing.  The report of the special rapporteur makes strong allegations that apartheid does exist in the occupied territories.  He refers to officers of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights being refused visas to visit the occupied Palestinian territories.  Why is that the case?  He cites people such as Ban Ki-moon, Desmond Tutu and a former Attorney General of Israel mentioning apartheid.  His report is very strong.  It contains three recommendations.  He refers to the UN re-establishing a special committee against apartheid to investigate all and any practices of systematic discrimination or oppression purportedly amounting to apartheid anywhere in the world, including in the occupied Palestinian territories or disputed territory.  He recommends that the international community accept and adopt the findings of Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organisations that apartheid is being practised by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory and beyond.  It is a hard-hitting report.  In the interests of balance and fairness, I would be very interested to hear what Ms Goodall has to say about that report and, if she can, to refute each of the points it makes.  If she cannot do so today, I ask that she do so in writing.</p></speech>

I do not normally attend committees of which I am not a member.  I welcome the delegation to the committee.  I am not one bit surprised that our guests sought to come before the committee to give an alternative view to the one that seems to be most propagated in these Houses.  I am not referring to this committee <i>per se</i>.  The committee has its work to do and the Chairman does a great job.  There is a remarkable pro-Palestine lobby in these Houses.  I use the word &quot;remarkable&quot; because human rights offences are being committed across the globe, such as in the eastern bloc countries, China, Russia and Cuba, but none of those things ever seem to come up before us on such a regular basis.  My view is that there is an obsession with this issue in these Houses.  I do not know if that is reflected in the community.  It is certainly not reflected in the community in which I live.  I am proud to come from a town that has possibly the only Holocaust memorial outside Dublin or the east of the country.  It was opened many years ago by a predecessor of the Chairman, former Deputy Mervyn Taylor, who was Minister at the time.  I chaired the Seanad last week in the absence of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I listened to two speakers challenging and attacking the Israeli position on certain issues.  As I was in the Chair, my hands were tied and I was unable to contribute.  On the same day, however, it was announced that a sizeable number of Israeli citizens had been massacred.</p><p>It was weird and surreal to listen to that.</p><p> I refer to what I call the obsession with Israel or being anti-Israel in these Houses.  To the witnesses' knowledge, is that replicated in other parliaments around Europe and across the western world in general?  Is there such a movement elsewhere?  If so or if not, what is the reason for that?  Why are we an outlier in this?  It would appear that anything Israel does that is in any way contentious will be highlighted but things which are done to the Israeli community and public seem to be ignored.  I had the great pleasure of listening to Mr. Haddad when he came here.  I am delighted to see him again on the screen.  He made a compelling case and anyone who went to see him was very impressed.  We need more of that.  The Chairman will join me in welcoming, in prospect at any rate, the establishment of an Ireland-Israel parliamentary friendship group, which is being headed up by Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  I would encourage members to get involved in that.  I am slightly disappointed at some of the more vocal members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, not necessarily members of the committee, have chosen not to be here today when there are people who are very competent to give them the answers that I cannot give.</p><p> I am grateful to be here, and those are my few words.  I would like to see balance in this debate in Ireland.  We are an outlier on this and it has become politicised and associated with a particular type of political campaign.  I am not sure how sincere a lot of the pro-Palestinian people are.  Are they concerned about the Palestinians or is it a movement which helps them get together, organise politically and get a profile?  Some of these things are fronts in many ways.  I am not saying all the pro-Palestinian groups are fronts by any manner or means, but there is an overlap in political behaviour there that I find objectionable.</p></speech>

There are a number of questions on a diverse range of issues so Ms Goodall has the unenviable task of dispersing the questions among her panellists.  I will allow her full discretion to try to get through as many questions as she can.  I suspect that Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; would wish to come back in again.  I hope we will have time to allow for that.</p></speech>

I want to reiterate that we are happy that we have been able to come here to discuss this matter.  There were a lot of questions, as the Chairman pointed out, and I thank the Deputies for their interest.  I will answer one of the questions from Senator Craughwell, who is not here anymore as he had to leave.  He asked what we can do to change the narrative about this region in Ireland.  As I said before, we started up the organisation in 2018 and things looked pretty dire at that time.  That happened as a direct result of ordinary Irish citizens thinking and saying that the narrative was far too biased against Israel.  I have seen some improvements.  As Senator O'Sullivan has correctly pointed out, a new friendship group has formed and we are pleased about that.  We were pleased to invite Mr. Haddad to speak to the Oireachtas two months ago.  Things are moving in the right direction but a lot still needs to be done.</p> <p>  I do not want to waste this opportunity with Mr. Haddad coming in from New York.  He is an Israeli Arab and knows a lot more about the reality on the ground than any of us here.  I would like Mr. Haddad to have the opportunity to address some of the questions that have been asked this afternoon as he sees fit.  Mr. Shatter would also like to answer a number of questions.  If there is anything Ms Griffin would like to add I would like her to have that opportunity as well.  If we could start with Mr. Haddad that would be wonderful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Yoseph Haddad" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022040500002#H00400"><p>I am more than delighted to be here and to have the opportunity to speak.  I am even more than delighted to hear that the members of this committee want to hear the full picture and not only one side.  I am an Arab-Israeli and I live in Israel; I am just visiting New York.  I ask members not to get the impression that I am from New York or something like that.  From the questions and from some of the data I have been hearing I understand how much of a job we have in order for us to give the full picture.<br/><br/>I would like to start by talking about the occupied territories, which is how they are defined according to the law.  We need to understand one thing about the territory on the West Bank and in Gaza.  Way before the current situation, which was agreed on at the Oslo Accords by the Palestinian Authority and the State of Israel, the West Bank was occupied by Jordan and Gaza was occupied by Egypt, not Palestine.  It was never Palestine.  Palestinian passports and identity came about during the British Mandate of Palestine, when Jews and Arabs held the same documents.  If one thinks about the Palestine pound it was inscribed with the words <i>Aleph Yud</i>, Israeli land.  If you search the Internet for a soccer game between Palestine and Australia you will see the Star of David on the t-shirts of the players because the Palestine team was Maccabi Tel-Aviv and it was made up of all Jewish players.  More than that, if you look at the passports, our first and only female Prime Minister, Golda Meir, addressed that and said she held a Palestinian passport just like any other.  To come and talk about an existing country and to say the Palestinians were ruling these territories is twisting the facts and the history.  I have never heard anyone talking about why Jordan never gave away the lands and created Palestine or why Egypt never did that with Gaza.  Israel did that with Gaza and withdrew from every inch of it.  What did we get because of that?  We go thousands of rockets that are harming us and that have been shot at Arabs and Jews in Israel.  Even more than that, during the last conflict, Operation Guardian of the Walls in May 2021, it was the Israeli Iron Dome missile defence system that saved Arabs and Jews in Jerusalem when Hamas fired rockets towards Jerusalem.  Some of them were even meant to land close to al-Aqsa Mosque and east Jerusalem.  The Iron Dome saved the lives of Arabs and Jews.  Please do not understand that I am a fan of Muammar al-Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, but he said that he blamed all the Arabs as they ruled those territories.  He asked why they never gave the Palestinians a country or gave them the territories.  This is a very important question.<br/><br/>Then there is the question of why Israel is there.  I am telling the committee simply, as an Arab who lives in Israel and who is subjected to terrorist attacks, just like every other Israeli, that we are there because we do not have any choice.</p><p>Israel has proven itself capable of doing a lot of things in order to promote peace.  We gave up the Sinai Peninsula in 1979 just to have peace with Egypt.  It was the same thing with Jordan.  We did something like this in Gaza, we did it in Amona and a number of settlements just to have peace.  The only reason we are in this <i>status quo</i>is because it being said everywhere and everybody is chanting &quot;From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free&quot; and &quot;We don't want two states, we want all of it&quot;.  This is what is going on.  If members are asking if right now the IDF is where it is to keep security of its citizens, both Arab and Jews, and if I have a problem with that, I say proudly &quot;No&quot;.  I do not have a problem with that because it is for the security of the Israeli State as a Jewish and democratic state and of the Arab citizens who are subject to terror attacks from Palestinians.  It is happening; it is fact.  Just check it.<br/><br/>History does not end with Jordan or Egypt.  Going back before the Ottomans and further, back to the beginning, there were Jews in Jerusalem.  If members want to go back to the history, that is the history.  That is the first thing I needed to address regarding the terms &quot;occupied territories&quot; or &quot;disputed territories&quot;.<br/><br/>There was another claim about the Amnesty International report.  From what I heard and based on a couple of comments from the honourable Deputies, they agree there is no apartheid in Israel, but there is apartheid in the West Bank and in Gaza.  According to the Amnesty International report, there is apartheid in Israel.  That means, as I think members agree, that they lied.  Let us start from there.  Knowing that, I will tell members the truth about how they based their report when it comes to Israeli Arabs.  They are lying because in the committee that Amnesty hosted, they said, and it is recorded, that they focused on the Negev area, which an honourable Deputy mentioned.  They focused on that area of 100,000 Israeli Arabs, which is 5% of the Israeli-Arab population.  Amnesty International took 5% of the population to get the answers it was seeking and came to the Parliament and represented it as if it represented 100% of the population.<br/><br/>Are there discrimination and problems in the Negev?  I tell members that 100% that there are, but look at what happened in the past year.  I always say it needs two to tango.  As a proud Israeli-Arab citizen living in a democratic state, I criticise my country, but I also criticise my society and the Arab political leaders in that society that, until last year, refused to sit in the coalition and be part of the Government.  That was until Mansour Abbas, head of the Islamic movement in Israel, came.  As absolute proof of how Israel wants to help and be partners with Israeli-Arab society, in the last year we managed to get a 53 billion shekel budget to the Israeli-Arab society.  More than that, recently Israel declared it would declare three towns in the Negev area and make sure they become official villages, cities and towns in Israel.  That means it is possible.  If it is not and Israel is an apartheid state, then 100% they would say &quot;No&quot;.  We could not be in the parliament or in any aspect of life.  We need to understand this.  <br/><br/>I will address what is going on in Gaza and the West Bank.  I have many Palestinian friends in Gaza.  They are brothers.  I have many friends in the West Bank.  Let us start with Gaza.  Israel withdrew from Gaza and we got only terror attacks from them.  Not only that, but Gaza has a border with Egypt and, because of the terror activity, Egypt closed that border a number of times.  Has anybody called to ask why Egypt is doing this?  Has anybody asked why nobody wants to deal with the existing leadership in Gaza?  It is simply because it is a terrorist organisation.  <br/><br/>We are talking about the situation of the Palestinians who live in Gaza and forgetting that they get hundreds of millions of dollars, some of it coming from Europe.  What do they do with it?  They build terror tunnels.  They put it in their own pockets.  They send the young people of Gaza to the border with Israel knowing that, in the event of any violation or attack on the border, they will get shot because Israel needs to protect its border.  Do members know what they will never do?  They will never send their children.  Ismail Haniyeh's children learn in London.  The kids of those terrorist leaders are not in Gaza.  If they are, they will never go to the borders because they know it is dangerous but they are sending other kids and using them.  This is the reality.  In May last year, when Hamas celebrated the win over the IDF, I got a call from my friends in Gaza and they said: &quot;Yusuf, they are forcing us to go out and celebrate.  What are we celebrating about?  Gaza is half destroyed, but we have to go out and play it like we are celebrating a victory just to present it to the world.&quot;  That is the harsh reality of dealing with a terrorist organisation.  They are building rockets instead of using that money for the benefit of their people.<br/><br/>I will shock members with some unbelievable information concerning the politics of Fatah, which is the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, to understand why we have problems in Gaza when it comes to water and electricity.  It is simply because they refuse to work together.  Fatah, the Palestinian Authority, will never recognise Hamas as a legitimate leader of the Palestinian people.  In fact, they hate each other more than they hate Israel.  What that report did not say was that in order to have better infrastructure for electricity and water pipelines, they need to pay money.  The Palestinian Authority refuses to pay that money because Hamas is controlling Gaza.  Then the easiest thing is to blame Israel.  The Palestinian Authority refuses to pay fuel, gas and other costs and the picture drawn for everybody is that the Palestinians are suffering because of Israel.  A number of times, Israel has tried to help.  If Israel wants, even behind the scenes, to speak with Hamas, the Palestinian Authority denies it the opportunity because it would make them legitimate leaders and representatives of the Palestinian Authority.  Has anyone thought about the inside politics of the Palestinian Authority?<br/><br/>When it comes to the West Bank, there are many things to talk about.  It is physically impossible, because the water pipelines are connected, to say that because of the settlements the Palestinians are not getting water supply or better infrastructure.  They are the same pipelines.  It is not being supported or not supported because of settlements but every time there is a new settlement or they expand them and build new pipelines, it is helping because it is the same system.<br/><br/>Another thing they did not say is that in the pipeline going from Jenin all the way to Hebron and Ramallah, villages in the West Bank are piratising this, digging holes in it and taking water illegally in order not to pay.</p><p>On the general treatment of Palestinians, Israel is granting permits to tens of thousands of Palestinians and allowing them to come from the West Bank to work in Israel.  Those Palestinians can earn more than twice or three times the salary they can earn under the Palestinian Authority.  Not only that but Israel has established seven different checkpoints across the West Bank to ease the process for Palestinians entering Israel.  In terms of roadblocks, if one is travelling from Jenin to Ramallah in the West Bank, one might only be interrupted by one border and that is for security reasons.  We have seen what has gone on in the past week.  Palestinian terrorists are using holes in the fence to come and carry out terror attacks.  We are seeing that time after time.<br/><br/>There has also been unbelievable talk about vaccines.  It is false information.  Under the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority is responsible for the healthcare of Palestinians.  It has a ministry for healthcare.  The Palestinians are responsible for providing the vaccines yet Israel vaccinated many Palestinians.  Magen David Adom has come into east Jerusalem and into the West Bank to help with vaccinations.  Some people have even spoken about the fact that Israeli Arabs were not getting the vaccine because they want to add fuel to the flame.  The bottom line is that there have been many lies.  I am obviously not calling any Deputies liars but there has been misinformation about what is going on and this is my opportunity to reveal that information.  There is a wrong understanding of the fact that the Palestinian Authority has its own healthcare system.  Israel did help with vaccination more than once.  This is something we also need to address.<br/><br/>I wrote down some comments when the questions were being asked because this is an opportunity for me to give the committee all the information that I know.  When it comes to what we can do and how every honourable Member of the Irish Parliament can help, we first must understand that this conflict must come to an end.  We must understand that we are all human beings.  We also need to understand that Israel has sought peace more than once.  We saw it in 1946 and 1947 when the partition plan was rejected.  We have seen in the course of history that time after time, peace agreements have been rejected.  There is a saying that is unfortunately true.  We say that the Palestinians never miss a chance to miss a chance.  Unfortunately, I feel the cost of that in myself and in my community.  We have seen this happen.  <br/><br/>People are asking why there has been an escalation.  Look at what is happening in the Middle East.  We call it the new era.  Morocco, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and more Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, are joining forces and entering partnerships with Israel to do something different for the betterment of the people of the region.  That is making the extremists very angry and dissatisfied.  The escalation we are seeing now is a result of the fact that Arab countries are welcoming Israel as a part of the Middle East.  I can honestly say I am a proud Arab and Israeli.  I am proud to live in Israel because it is a country that gives me opportunities.  Look at me.  I can criticise my country here.  I can say whatever I want.  In fact, some members of the Knesset speak harshly of Israel but are allowed to do so because they live in a democracy.  If we keep saying that Israel is an apartheid state, not only is that inflammatory and a twisting of the facts but by doing so we are only helping extremists to accomplish their mission.  We are not helping the vast majority with a silent voice who are afraid of the extremist minorities on both sides.  We must not allow that to happen.  Calls such as &quot;From the river to the sea, Palestinian will be free&quot; only help the extremists.  Saying that one does not want the two-state solution but instead wants all of the land helps only the extremists.  Join the silent voice.  Help us to make this possible.  It is already happening in Israel.  More and more Arab Israelis are living in what we call in Arabic <i>shiraka</i>, which means partnership.  We live in partnership.  We see it day to day.  I am living proof of that partnership.  I am proud to be living proof of it.  <br/><br/>I will be at the service of the committee to answer any questions its members wish to ask at any time.  If there is anything they would like to ask me about the reality of what is going on, I will be more than glad to help, both at this meeting and later.  I thank the committee from the bottom of my heart for the opportunity to speak aloud.  I am excited.  I always speak from the bottom of my heart on these matters.  I thank the committee for listening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Shatter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022040500002#K00300"><p>I will try to be brief because Mr. Haddad has covered a lot of ground.  There are some specific things I wish to address.  I will start where Mr. Haddad finished.  It comes back to a question that was asked earlier.  What can this committee, the Parliament and the Irish Government do to change the current reality and to end conflict?  There are two things that can be done.  We can avoid pandering to extremism and we can use the lessons of our own peace process.  What is going on between Israelis and Palestinians is different but the lessons from our peace process are clear.  If we genuinely want to see conflict resolved, as opposed to engaging in political point-scoring or running the narrative of one side or the other, we must encourage Israelis and Palestinians to engage in dialogue; encourage them to engage in normalising their relationships; and encourage them to discourage terrorism.  On the Palestinian side, speak truth.  We must tell them that when people were getting blown up and were dying on this island, it created greater division between communities, apart from the inhumanity of the atrocities that were committed.  End the terrorism.  End the sorts of events that took place in Israel in the past three weeks that not one member of this committee has yet referenced.  Young mothers, a young Rabbi and two 19-year-old police officers were murdered on the streets.  Tell the Palestinian Hamas leadership to stop celebrating death and destruction.  Sweets were handed out in Gaza and the West Bank to applaud the knifing to death of three women.  They were so happy about it they filmed the handing out of the sweets.  Those videos are available to everyone on social media.  Encourage them to stop celebrating death and encourage people to live.  Encourage dialogue.</p> <p>  What is happening here, and I make no apology for saying it, is that there are Members of this Parliament, not only on this committee, who discourage the normalisation of relationships.  They advocate the boycotting and demonisation of Israel.  They damage the jobs of Palestinians created by joint Israeli-Palestinian companies.  They foment discord and create obstacles to people engaging.</p><p>Having learnt from Ireland's peace process, let us encourage the Palestinian Authority to engage constructively with the Israeli side.  Let us recognise reality.  I never hear members of the committee address the issue of the granting of permits that Mr. Haddad has just addressed, which I will not raise again.  I never hear members of the committee address the problem of Hamas in Gaza.  The dreadful tragedies played out in Gaza are always depicted as caused by Israel.  I have probably visited Gaza more frequently than some members of the committee.  I have probably talked to more senior Palestinian leaders than some members of the committee.  A terrorist organisation, Hamas, controls Gaza.  It has no interest in a two-state solution.  In Ireland we ignore that for 14.5 years there has not been a single Palestinian governed entity.  There are two separate entities, one in Gaza and one in the West Bank and, as Mr. Haddad depicted, they are effectively at war with each other.  The Fatah Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas, deprives Gaza of resources because he does not want resources to be used by Hamas.  The tragedy of Gaza is created by Hamas.</p><p> I was one of the Members of the D&aacute;il who, in my many visits to Israel and in meeting Palestinian leaders, pre-2005, had meetings and discussions with Israeli Government ministers encouraging Israel, as a first step towards a two-state solution, to withdraw from Gaza to allow it to develop its own independent economy and to create an atmosphere for future engagement.  A section regarded as the Israeli right wing opposed that.  It said no, that doing that would be a disaster.  Many other European political leaders made the same statement to Israeli leaders, and the Israelis withdrew from Gaza.</p><p> Gaza is a disaster in certain places.  It is very well developed in some areas, which members of the committee do not realise.  The disaster that is Gaza, for many of the people living in Gaza, derives from one thing and one thing only, that is, that Hamas denies the legitimacy of the Israeli state, feels free to fire rockets at it when it so chooses, has created a series of different wars and, instead of using the massive international aid it has received to develop Gaza, has spent multiple mullions of euro and dollars on constructing tunnels.</p><p> I think some members of the committee do not realise that things said on occasion in the committee do not reflect even mainstream Palestinian views.  The Palestinians have some legitimate issues over which to criticise Israel, and I have personally voiced those criticisms in the past to Israeli ministers.  What members of the committee do not realise, however, is the first obstruction and blockage to conflict resolution and to addressing the issues Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised.  He said the occupation has been going on for 50-odd years.  I would probably be a year out if I were to repeat the number, but he said the occupation has been going on for a very long time.  The occupation of Gaza ended in 2005, and then Gaza was taken over by a group that the entirety of the European Union recognises as a terrorist group, which then proceeded on a nihilistic journey down the route of continuing wars with Israelis, arbitrarily and indiscriminately firing not just rockets into Israel, killing civilians, but also a series of incendiary devices that, environmentally, have destroyed thousands of acres of Israeli afforestation.  The committee never discusses that.  If Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is serious about his interest in this issue, I would love to hear members of the committee say we should have reconciliation between the warring Palestinian groups and have the first election held in the Palestinian territories since 2006.  Mahmoud Abbas was elected for a period of five years in 2005 and he is still there in 2022.  Let us have constructive engagement to improve economic development in both Gaza and the West Bank.</p><p> What could Ireland do?  Every Member in this room is familiar with the multiple millions of dollars that went into the Ireland Funds from the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom, contributed by this Government and donated.  The Ireland Funds made a huge contribution to economic development in Northern Ireland and to bringing Northern Irish communities together.  A replica of the Ireland Funds was created by the United States Congress approximately 18 months to two years ago, with $250 million put into it for joint Israeli-Palestinian ventures to encourage intercommunity dialogue and engagement and to create economic development.  When that fund was created, like our own funds, it laid down a foundation to enable other countries across the world to join into it.  It is not a fund solely governed or administered by the American Government.  We in this country could engage with that fund to encourage dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.  That is just some of what we can do.  I plead with members of the committee not to be in denial.  Yes, there are things the Israeli Government has got wrong over the years - I readily admit that - but not all the difficulties and faults lay on the Israeli side.</p><p> When I was Minister for Justice and Equality, visiting the West Bank and Gaza, one of the great problems was the multiplicity of police forces, the lack of training of police forces and the lack of functioning civil institutions.  Shortly before I ceased to be Minister, when visiting the West Bank and meeting the Palestinian Minister of Justice, I arranged that 50 Palestinian policemen would come to be trained in Dublin by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with civil issues.  I do not know whether they ever came because I ceased to be Minister.  Those are practical things.  I refer to institution-building within the West Bank.  The courts there are not independent.  People are being tortured by their fellow Palestinians.  Women are being assaulted.  Individuals are being murdered within the Palestinian Authority territory.  No one in the Irish Parliament ever speaks on their behalf.</p><p> Interestingly, there is a very interesting, very recently published Amnesty International report on the plight of Palestinians in 2021 in Gaza and the West Bank and the failures and corruption of the Administrations in both the West Bank and Gaza.  Practically none of that information is contained in the Amnesty report that came before the committee.  Why is that?  Because the reports are prepared by different groups within Amnesty.</p></speech>

I thank them for their contributions.  Maybe they will be back.</p> <p>  Since I have interrupted you, Mr. Shatter, may I ask you a question?  In October of last year the Israeli Defense Minister, Benny Gantz, announced the designation of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations.  They included organisations in receipt of funding from Irish Aid.  Do you agree with the Israeli Defense Minister in his designation of NGOs in receipt of funding from Irish Aid?

I do know as a fact that one of those groups has also been banned by the Dutch Government because it is concerned about misuse of funds, but I am not in a position to comment on that.</p> <p>  Finally, and this will be only four sentences, I wish to address the issue of vaccines.  I am chairman of the Irish branch of Magen David Adom, which is the emergency medical response group in Israel.</p><p>Any suggestion the Israeli Government deprived Palestinians of the Covid-19 vaccine is complete nonsense.  At an early stage, the Israeli Government offered vaccines.  The Palestinian National Authority turned them down having initially said it would accept them.  Then, when months passed and the Palestinian National Authority had not yet acquired vaccines, the organisation I represent in Ireland, Magen David Adom, vaccinated 120,000 Palestinians on the border between the West Bank and Israel proper.  Interestingly, one of the issues raised in the separate Amnesty International report on the Palestinian territory is that "The health ministry in the West Bank [this is the Palestinian National Authority health ministry] confirmed on 2 March [2021] that it had distributed about 1,200 Covid-19 vaccines to high-ranking officials rather than to health workers."  That is just one of the difficulties that arises in dealing with issues within the Palestinian territories.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Yoseph Haddad" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022040500002#M00400"><p>Basically, it is very simple.  Those NGOs were involved in terror activities.  Some of them were also convicted terrorists.  Further to that, some of the money they used was for terror activities within Israel and the West Bank and Gaza.  The question everyone asks, or that we need to ask, is, if Israel categorises them as terrorist organisations or identifies them as supporting terrorism and how it allows this to happen to a human rights organisation, do we or does anybody know how many anti-Israel NGOs there are that are not categorised as terrorist organisations?  So many organisations that are completely against Israel say so out loud, yet Israel never categorises them as terrorists.  The simple reason is they are allowed to be an NGO, say what they want and carry out any activity they want as long as they do not approach carrying out terrorist activities.  Further to that, we are seeing NGOs within Israel speak out against Israel.  This is only another piece of evidence for how Israel is not an apartheid state.  If Israel was an apartheid state, there is no way it would have allowed NGOs within Israel to speak and work against the state.  Knowing the fact that many NGOs are not categorised as terrorist organisations and work against Israel is the only evidence everyone needs.  If Israel categorises them as terrorist organisations, it means they are carrying out illegal activities and terror activities.  That is my answer to that question.</p></speech>

We will go back to Deputy Stanton followed by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Ms Goodall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022040500002#M00600"><p>I will make a few points.  First, obviously, it is very welcome that work is going on to normalise relations between Israel and certain Arab states, which has been mentioned.  We always welcome that and look for more of it to happen, if possible.  Second, it possibly goes without saying but it might need to be said that we reject violence from every side.  Something we have always done in this committee is reject violence as a means to an end.</p> <p>  I asked a question with respect to the report by Professor Michael Lynk.  We may not have time to go into it now; it is quite detailed.  It does seem to back up the Amnesty International report, however.  Professor Lynk is a special rapporteur appointed by the UN and his report would carry a lot of weight.  Perhaps not today but maybe another time we might get some kind of response from the Ireland Israel Alliance on that.  The report is quite detailed and we spent quite an amount of time on it here last week.  It is grim reading and Professor Lynk is quite clear in what he said.  I would be very interested in getting a written report on that later from the Ireland Israel Alliance.  It would be useful for balance to make that happen.</p> <p>  I believe we have learned much today.  It is important to have this kind of dialogue in order that we can learn and give all sides an opportunity to put forward their case and points of view, especially from the witnesses' colleague in New York.  It has been very enlightening and informative.  I thank the witnesses for being with us today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022040500002#M00700"><p>There has obviously been a considerable amount of conversation with regard to Israel and its security.  My argument or contention is that security can only be delivered if people can share a land and they will only get that when they have a deal with those with whom they share that land.  The fact is people do not necessarily pick the leadership they deal with.  Yes, there are huge issues with the Palestinian leadership and a split leadership does not really help anybody.</p> <p>  I will go back to some of the questions.  At the end of the day, we are dealing with people who are living under military occupation.  There is a huge power differential; that is it.  Israel is a nuclear power with a huge military capacity.  One can make arguments as to why that is the case but those are the facts.  How do people make peace at a time when Israel is increasing the settlements and taking land from Palestinians, even if we leave every other issue out of it?  The argument that will be made is that the Oslo Accords were to a degree - I am not saying they were but that argument was put out there - almost a cover that gave a facility whereby the reality on the ground could be changed literally by putting people in place.  I am not stating that is the case.  I believe it was probably a lost opportunity in the 1990s.  We are where we are now, however.  I do not hear or see anything, particularly from an Israeli Government point of view or in politics within Israel at this point, that looks anything like it will move towards any sort of accommodation that can end this or that serves anybody in that particular part of the world and beyond.  Nobody wants to make political points about Palestine.  We want to see a situation where it is de-escalated and people can have their rights.  The fact is they must be given human rights and an element of legal rights.  They cannot believe they are absolute second-class citizens in the land they were born.  That is very difficult when people are under military occupation, especially the occupation they are under at this time.</p> <p>  I particularly want an answer to the question on the annexation of lands.  It is very difficult to see how they can get a settlement as this happens.  It is very difficult to see it as anything other than Israel taking as much ground as it possibly can, which changes the reality for whenever a deal is done and maybe changes the nature of the deal.  Many people believe the two-state settlement is gone.  I cannot make a determination in that regard but that is just because of the size of the settlements.  I do not think us having a conversation serves any purpose with regard to who the Palestinian people are and whether they are Arabs and not Palestinians.  The fact is a sufficient number of people in Palestine see themselves as Palestinians, so that is the reality.  We can all go back and throw facts from before and after 1948 or any which way we want; it will not serve any purpose.</p></speech>

There are people speaking out against the human rights situation the Palestinians are suffering.  There is no doubt that the Palestinians are suffering from some human rights violations.  The question is at whom we direct the accusation.  Is it really truly at Israel?  I was at a church meeting some weeks ago sharing about the book.  Afterwards, I saw a Middle Eastern person walking up to me and I was wondering how this conversation was going to go and what he was going to say.  He said he was Iraqi and that all Christians - I happen to be a Christian - should be pro-Israel.  That is not to say they are not pro-Palestinian, because I am pro-Palestinian, but all Christians should be pro-Israel.  He said if people only knew how much Israel has done for the Iraqi people and other Arab peoples in the Middle East, it could make a difference.</p> <p>  The Deputy said there is a huge power differential.  I would like to zoom in on the power struggle in Gaza.  We could look at so many other power struggles in the Palestinian authority under Abbas but we will just look at Gaza.  According to Israeli and Palestinian estimates, approximately 20% of Gaza's annual budget is spent on the preparation and execution of attacks against the Jewish nation.  That is a whopping $100 million.  The $4 million home of Ismail Haniyeh, the Prime Minister of Gaza, covers an area of 27,000 sq. ft and overlooks the beautiful Mediterranean sea.  The affluence enjoyed by his henchmen is sure to disillusion any honest and hard-working Palestinian.  Hundreds of the terror groups' bosses have become millionaires by commanding a shadowy smuggling industry and depriving their own people of the chance to prosper.  To enjoy access to 24-7 electricity from Gaza's sole power plant, one must be a Hamas leader.  The rest of the populace tolerates a mere four-hour supply a day.  While the 2 million citizens of Gaza are subjected to substandard and insufficient medical services, wounded Isis fighters from the Sinai Peninsula receive medical treatment in Gaza hospitals.  I could go on.  There is so much more to say.  It is important to look at the human rights issue but we must also ask ourselves who is really to blame.  That has come out in so many ways today and it is important to underline it again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.408" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Shatter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022040500002#N00800"><p>I will come back to one issue Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised.  There could be multiple meetings talking about the history of this region and this conflict.  I would share a view the Deputy expressed, which is that we are where we are.  There is a Palestinian people who self-identify as Palestinians.  They are as entitled to self-determination as the Jewish people.  There is only one viable solution to this conflict and it is the solution the United Nations, as I referenced, attempted in 1947.  It has been attempted on multiple occasions since.  President Clinton, who was of huge assistance to this country and everyone in Northern Ireland in bringing to an end the conflict there, had a meeting at Camp David in 2000 involving Yasser Arafat and the then Israeli Prime Minister.  A deal was about to be signed that would have resulted in Israel vacating 95% of the totality of the territory that then fell within the Palestinian authority area - in other words, the West Bank and Gaza.  In Clinton's autobiography, he says the only reason that did not happen was because Arafat said "No".  As to how we bring this conflict to an end, we have to get people to engage.  We have to get people to stop killing each other.  We have to get all the resources that go into the West Bank and Gaza to be used for housing construction, economic development and hospital construction.</p> <p>  The settlement issue is enormously straightforward.  Settlements occupy about 5% of the total area of the West Bank.  A lot of them are contiguous to Jerusalem.  The odd thing about the settlements is, although occupied largely by Jewish people, a lot of the Jewish people who live in the settlements work with local Palestinians and a lot of the Palestinians work with the local Jewish people.  I know that because I have been there to see it.  There are joint Palestinian-Israeli industrial parks on the West Bank.  The apartheid appellation is ludicrous because in some of those parks, some of the Jewish workers are under the management of Palestinian managers and owners.  I have been to date farms where Palestinians and Israelis engage in agriculture together and pick dates.  The Palestinians attend the bar mitzvahs of the Israelis' 13-year-old children and the Israelis attend the weddings of the Palestinian daughters.  This is not apartheid.  It is nuts to talk about it that way.  The settlements are not the obstacle to a resolution of all of this.  The obstacle is the incapacity of people on the Palestinian side to constructively engage in conversation, and the right-wing politicians in Israel who do not want to engage because they saw what happened as a result of the Gaza engagement and Israel moving out of Gaza.  They lack confidence and trust in any Palestinians they can engage with.  Finally, Hamas does not want to engage at all.</p> <p>  I was in Israel some years ago having breakfast in the kitchen of one of the then Palestinian negotiators with the Israeli side.  He was very well known but I want to keep confidence as to who it was.  At that moment, he was optimistically of the view that there would be some resolution, at least between Fatah, the Palestinian authority and the Israelis, even though Hamas would not engage.  He said to me that he was optimistic but if the deal that he thought possible was done - and tragically, ultimately, it did not prove possible - he would be dead in ten weeks.  He said they would assassinate him.  The people he was talking about were Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</p><p>This was a man who remained in a position in the Palestinian leadership for a number of years after we had met and talked.  He and I had met on a number of occasions.  This is the problem; we have to change the narrative.  Sadly, and unfortunately in this country, we have occasionally copperfastened that narrative.</p><p> My apologies.  I said I would mention settlements and I will say one thing about them.  These series of meetings commenced with a discussion about Israeli apartheid.  As Mr. Haddad so well illustrated, Israel has a population of just over 9 million people, 2 million of whom are Arabs, with a variety of other people, approximately 300,000, of other backgrounds, who live in what is a multi-ethnic melded state where everybody does everything with each other and engages.  I do not understand why there should be objection to Jewish people living on the West Bank.  If the suggestion is that Jewish people living on the West Bank is completely inappropriate, that is advocating apartheid on the West Bank.  What we need to do is encourage Christians, Muslims, Jews, Israelis and Palestinians to engage, build confidence, work together, socialise together and share schooling together, as happens with a school in the centre of Jerusalem which has both Israeli-Arab children and Israeli-Jewish children attending.  Do not drive them apart.  Encourage them and do not make the settlements the barrier to reconciliation because I can tell the committee that they are not if one visits them.  </p><p> Ariel University, which was created on the West Bank, has a large number of Palestinian students getting third level education together with Israeli students who live on the West Bank.  Not only is that not apartheid but it is advancing these students into third level education and giving them great opportunities they would not otherwise have in an atmosphere - I will finish on this, Chairman - of communal engagement between young Israelis and young Palestinians who get on with each other.  That is what we need to be encouraging, not separation, division or pillory.  </p><p> Of course, we do not want extremism on any side, whether that is Palestinian or Israeli extremism.  There is a problem of a small group of extreme Israelis in the West Bank who make life very difficult for the Palestinian side.  That is an issue but it is not the major issue as to why we do not have conflict resolution.</p></speech>

He has given his answer and I am not exactly buying it.  The issue is greater.  I agree with him in the sense that engagement obviously works but we are only going to get to that level of engagement when we can take the sting out of the situation and when there is a proper settlement.</p> <p>  The other issue I was going to raise, to which Mr. Shatter alluded, was a change in Israeli politics and the rightward move that makes things rather difficult.  The argument as to whether Israelis or Jews can live on the West Bank could bring us into a conversation on the right of return and so forth.  None of us will agree on this.  I am happy enough to leave the discussion at that on the basis that there needs to be a settlement and this needs to end.  I contend that the taking of land is a problem and the increase in settlements does not help.  It is very difficult to see it as anything other than a ploy in the long-term game of creating a greater Israel, for want of a better term.  I am not expecting Mr. Shatter to agree with me on that.</p></speech>

Members have been circulated with draft copies of the minutes of the meetings of 17 January 2022, 8 February 2022, 8 March 2022, 22 March 2022 and 25 March 2022.  Are those minutes agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The committee will today complete its pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the mental health (amendment) Bill 2021.  Today's meeting will be split into two sessions.  I welcome our first set of witnesses from Shine and the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI.  From Shine, I welcome Ms Nicola Byrne, chief executive officer, and Ms Estella Vidal, advocacy officer, while from the PSI, I welcome Dr. Anne Kehoe, president-elect, and Dr. Michael Drumm, council member. </p> <p>  Before we hear opening statements, all members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, I will direct that the remarks be discontinued.  It is imperative that any such direction be complied with.  </p> <p>  I now call Ms Nicola Byrne to make her opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.424" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  Shine is a national organisation which provides information and support to people affected by mental health difficulties, through individual and group work and recovery education and training.  Originally called the Schizophrenia Association of Ireland, SAI, we were established in south Dublin in 1979 by a group of family members and professionals.  In 2009, we changed our name to Shine to reflect how we had developed to offer supports to everyone affected by mental health difficulties and their families.  We are the only national mental health organisation specifically founded to support all family members.</p> <p>  Shine has two national stigma reduction programmes aimed at promoting change in the societal perception of mental illness.  These are See Change and Headline.  Some of our projects of the committee may be aware include: the Green Ribbon campaign, which will celebrate its tenth anniversary in 2022, and the national mental health media awards.  We acknowledge the hard work and commitment of all involved in progressing this legislation to this stage and we broadly welcome the provisions of the Bill, as outlined in these draft heads currently under consideration.</p><p>We believe these changes will improve mental health services and give an amplified voice to service users.  Our analysis of the heads of Bill is influenced first and foremost by the voices, personal testimonies and lived experiences of the people we work with.  It is also informed by the human rights analysis and is framed under key relevant articles from both the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Shine welcomes the shift in paradigm from one of best interests to one of guiding principles.  A lot has been done in this regard but there is still a long road ahead of us.  Based on the voices of the people that we work with and quoting the UN special rapporteur, we advocate for a shift that moves away from paternalism, a "paradigm shift that is recovery and community-based, promotes social inclusion and offers a range of rights-based treatments and psychosocial support at primary and specialized care levels".  </p><p> We emphasise and are keen to discuss in more detail, with testimonies, the following points.  The first relates to the family and supporters.  People do not exist in isolation.  It is vitally important that family members and supporters have supports available to them through the mental health services, independent of any supports being provided to their loved one.  With regard to advocates, we believe the role of advocates and advocacy services is not given enough consideration in the heads of Bill and should be further highlighted and elaborated on as it is key if people are to fully exercise their legal capacity.  </p><p> On seclusion and restraints, these practices are not consistent with the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.  The guidelines from the UNCRPD support eliminating these practices to protect the security and personal integrity of persons with disabilities who are deprived of their liberty.  </p><p> With regard to early intervention and community services, it is evident that the promotion of community support mechanisms at the local level can prevent difficulties from becoming more complex.  We support the recommendation to include a provision for the right to community mental health services in the amended legislation as this will contribute to a reduction in the number of cases that evolve into more complex mental health difficulties.  </p><p> On information and knowledge, we strongly believe that information is power.  When asked about some of the amendments being put forward in the heads of Bill and the key gaps, a significant number of people told us they were not aware that such a process was taking place.  We would therefore like to encourage the development of an awareness raising campaign to provide the Irish public with key information on the upcoming Mental Health (Amendment) Bill and the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.   </p><p> With regard to voice and participation, the voice of the service user should be at the core of all planning, both in care and embedded in mental health service delivery.  Advocates should participate in the development of the care plan and plans should be developed in a format and language that the person can understand.</p><p> With regard to stigma and discrimination, we welcome replacements already made in the heads of Bill such as the replacement of "patient" with "person" and "tribunal" with "review board".  However, the people we work with question the use of the term "mental health disorder" to describe their difficulties.  There is consensus that the term is degrading, stigmatising and not aligned with human rights principles. </p><p> Other areas that we would welcome discussion on include: treatment and consent; the importance of privacy and the impact of the physical environment on recovery; an independent complaints mechanism; culture change and resources; and examples of good care and practice in mental health services.  Finally, we note that it was confirmed in an earlier session that the guiding principles that state &ldquo;the provision of mental health services is subject to the availability of resources&rdquo; would be removed.  These are laid out in the proposed section 84(4) in the context of children and the proposed section 4(9) in the context of adults.  However, we ask that this removal form a specific recommendation of the committee.  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak today.  We are happy to discuss these matters in more detail and to answer members' questions.</p></speech>

I am the president-elect of the PSI.  In representing the PSI, I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Michael Drumm, PSI council member and former president of the society.  The PSI is the learned and professional body for psychology in the Republic of Ireland.  It was founded in 1970 and currently has more than 4,000 members.</p> <p>  In March 2021, the PSI made a formal submission with regard to the review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  The submission was guided by the report of the expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 and the 165 recommendations contained within.</p><p>Since the enactment of the Act more than 20 years ago there have been significant changes both to mental health policy and direction in Ireland, starting with the Vision for Change in 2006 and most recently in Sharing the Vision, a mental health policy for everyone in 2020.  This amendment is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve mental healthcare in Ireland and to move away from a medicalised or illness model of mental health to a mental health Act that is in line with international best practice, and moves to a model that holds the person at the centre, is trauma informed and recovery focused from start to finish and that will be fit for purpose for all those it serves in this generation and beyond.  This requires changes in the current service delivery model so that social and psychological interventions are the first line of treatment considered when a person presents with psychological distress or mental health difficulties.  </p><p> I wish to highlight some of the recommendations from the formal submission made by the PSI.  Recent focus on the provision of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, has highlighted the need for change in regard to clinical leadership.  The model of leadership by a single profession, a consultant psychiatrist, is considered now to be limited in that it does not give full access to the skills of the range of multidisciplinary team members.  In the UK, CAMHS teams are led by a range of appropriately qualified, capable and competent mental health professionals.  Good clinical governance allows for a model of clinical responsibility which recognises that each individual clinician carries clinical autonomy and responsibility with regard to his or her own specific treatment and intervention.  The Mental Health Commission document, Teamwork within Mental Health Services in Ireland 2010, articulates this well and its principles should be incorporated into the revised Act.  The commission document proposes a distributed model of responsibility whereby clinical responsibility is distributed among the involved team members according to their role and contribution.  Such a shared model of mental health service will lead to a more effective and accessible service for families that is consistent with client-centred recovery oriented models of practice with people who use mental health services.  </p><p> The PSI recommends that the role of clinical lead and clinical director in all community mental health services be expanded to include qualified, experienced mental health professionals in line with international best practice.  The PSI also has a number of recommendations in regard to mental health provision for children that are supported by the report of the Mental Health Act expert review group.  The PSI recommends that to emphasise the specific rights and responsibilities towards children that provision related to children should be included in the stand-alone part of the Act.  There should also be a set of guiding principles that apply to children under the amended Act.  Children aged 16 and 17 should be presumed to have capacity to consent or to refuse admission and treatment, to address this anomaly whereby mental health consent is treated differently from general health consent.  For those under 16 years a parent or equivalent must consent to the voluntary admission and the views of the child should be taken into account by all and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.  </p><p> The PSI recommends that the same provisions in as far as possible apply to children as to adults in regard to the criteria for involuntary detention, specifically that admissions orders be for 14 days and that it is mandated that fellow mental healthcare professionals along with the consultant psychiatrist be required to provide a report when an order of detention is extended for children.  The PSI is supportive of the recommendation of the expert review group that a mental health professional from a different discipline would consult with a consultant psychiatrist and would also complete an assessment prior to making an admission order, as well as at the point of a renewal order.  Additionally, it is recommended that a psychosocial report should be carried out by a member of the multidisciplinary team and provided to the tribunal to assist in its decision-making. </p><p> I thank members for this opportunity to speak today.  We are happy to take any questions in regard to this opening statement or on any of the recommendation made by the PSI in its formal written submission in regard to the proposed amendments to the Act.</p></speech>

This is such an important piece of work.  We have had many sessions on it now.  I really value the opening statements.  There might be some questions that hark back to other opening statements.  As somebody who is not expert in this area, I am trying to join the dots and make it make sense.  I will turn to Shine first to ask about the role of family and how they interact with a human rights based model.  That model places the person at the centre.  One of the things we heard from some other groups is a concern around people's insight into their own situation.  That might be the best way of saying it.  As a group that works not just with people who are experiencing issues themselves but also their families, could Shine outline how it sees that delicate balance being achieved within the context of this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.430" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#D00200"><p>While the right to confidentiality and privacy of the patient must be protected at all times, it is vitally important that family members and supporters have guidance and support mechanisms available to them through the mental health services.  These mechanisms should be established to provide ongoing supports to family members and supporters both before and after admission, as family members and supporters can feel particularly isolated and vulnerable at these critical times.  Family members and supporters could access information and share opinions and concerns via an allocated key worker, we would suggest, who could then communicate with the multidisciplinary team where appropriate, and particularly where concerns regarding risk to self or others are raised.<br/><br/>We also welcome the allocation of advocacy services that support family members and supporters.  Family members and supporters are often the only primary care that people can access yet they are left outside the door in all of the planning, interventions and decisions.  There is a need to move to the &quot;shift left&quot; concept identified in Sl&aacute;intecare and plan for appropriate inclusion of those who support people with lived experience, not just in crisis but in recovery and wellness.  The role of the authorised officer is very important to enable families to stay in their role and to continue beyond admission to have a positive relationship with their loved one.  This needs significant investment and buy-in.  For example, in a survey we did this week we found that 74% of respondents were not aware of the authorised officer role under the Mental Health Act.<br/><br/>Here are some of the testimonials shared by people who use Shine's services in respect of the engagement of family members and supporters in care, treatment and recovery plans.  One person said that better family involvement and representation is required and indeed necessary for the care of the patient.  It is unacceptable that there is no provision for family attendance or representation at hearings that review patient retention in hospital under the Mental Health Act.  This needs to be amended to include family members in such reviews and hearings.  The person says that families should be heard at such forums.  Another person said that as a family, they found it hard at times because they could be left out or not informed about their loved one's care.  The person understands that because of patient confidentiality, families are not told everything but when the loved one had to come home while still suffering with psychosis, those times were hard.  The person really thinks there should be more support for families and they should be kept better informed about their loved one's status during their care.  Another person said that more family involvement in patient care is vital to the patient treatment and care plan and asked how care in the community is to progress without the family involvement and support.  Better balance is required between patient confidentiality and the family's or next-of-kin's knowledge and understanding of treatment plans.  Next-of-kin should be updated on treatment plans and should assist in discharges from hospitals.  Another person said it is extremely important that the family knows what is going on as it is a huge part of the person's life.  Essentially family should be kept more up to date when any problems are seen.  The process should be more collaborative all round.<br/><br/>Article 14 of the UNCRPD, liberty and security of the person, provides: </p> <blockquote> 	1. States Parties shall ensure that persons with disabilities, on an equal basis with others:  	a) Enjoy the right to liberty and security of person;<br /><br />b) Are not deprived of their liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily, and that any deprivation of liberty is in conformity with the law, and that the existence of a disability shall in no case justify a deprivation of liberty. 2. States Parties shall ensure that if persons with disabilities are deprived of their liberty through any process, they are, on an equal basis with others, entitled to guarantees in accordance with international human rights law and shall be treated in compliance with the objectives and principles of the present Convention, including by provision of reasonable accommodation. </blockquote> <p>Article 15, freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, provides:</p> <blockquote> 	1.

In Shine, as Ms Byrne mentioned, we have extended the family definition to include supporters because we are aware that not everyone has a family member.  Some people experience bad relationships or they might not be in a position to select a family member, so we have extended the definition to &ldquo;family members and supporters&rdquo;.  We are in line with how the UNCRPD describes the role, although we would say &ldquo;family and supporters&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;family&rdquo;.  The UNCRPD states: &ldquo;Family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State, and that persons with disabilities and their family members should receive the necessary protection and assistance to enable families to contribute towards the full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities.&rdquo;</p></speech>

That is fantastic because Ms Vidal has slightly covered one of the issues that I wanted to follow up on with Shine.  I want to come back to the issue of allocated key workers with Shine and some of the other witnesses.  To stick on that family aspect, I have two follow-up questions.  First, Ms Vidal has somewhat covered the issue of the definition of the family and she said Shine has broadened it out to include supporters.  In terms of accessing services and getting medical professionals to engage with a supporter or family member, who decides or signs off on the definition?  Is it the person at the centre who decides &ldquo;This person is considered my family or my supporter&rdquo;?  Does Shine envisage that there might be some problem or difficulty with medical professionals accepting somebody as an advocate or supporter in that context?</p> <p>  The second question is a more practical one.  I am trying to get in my head what that kind of family engagement or support would look like.  For example, in the creation or development of a care plan where somebody is probably on the road to recovery and is well able to become involved in the development of that, in a practical way, what would Shine envisage as the family level of engagement in terms of understanding what the road ahead looks like for people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.433" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#E00300"><p>I will take the second question first.  It is important that we respect that the family is going to be the one, or the supporters, because people often have family who are not biological or genetic.  It is very important that their opinion is taken into account, not in a way that breaches confidentiality but in such a way that they support the person to live their best life.  They know the person best and they might have other parts of the story that help the professional to make an assessment on what the needs of the person are.  We would envisage that we would have a contact person on the network disability team, NDT.  That would be similar to the arrangements that happen in, say, foster care, where a social worker would be allocated to the child and a social worker is allocated separately to the foster family.  There would be someone on the NDT who represents the family&rsquo;s needs, rather than the family being left outside the door and getting a phone call to say, &ldquo;I am coming home&rdquo;.  That may just mean they are able to leave in bread and milk for somebody when they come home from hospital and be part of the planning process.  We do not expect to know all of the information on the loved one but we do expect that they are part of the conversation and that they can be part of the plan, so people can successfully leave hospital or that the level of treatment they get is at the right level and things can be planned for.  Family is very much part of people's success.  We do not operate in isolation and we need to be enabled to support people when they are in the need of care.</p> <p>  Will the Deputy repeat the first question?</p></speech>

I completely agree that while there is blood family, sometimes your best supporters are the people you choose rather than the people you are related to.</p><p>However, it strikes me that this broad definition might not always be recognised by medical professionals and that there might be concern over who is invited into the room.  I wonder whether the delegates have considered this if supporters are being included in the definition of family.</p></speech>

The individual should be at the core of all planning.  If we take that position, everything else will fall naturally into place from it and there will not be an issue.  Often we are prescriptive in the way services are delivered but it is more important to have a person-centred approach.  In care planning and recovery planning, it is really about individuals stating who works for them, who they trust and their supporters.</p></speech>

In talking about family engagement, we would really like to take the opportunity to highlight the importance of the role of the advocate support service to families.  This role is not considered enough in the heads of Bill.  It is key to exercising the legal capacity of the individual.  Families have a really important role here.</p> <p>  We would like to highlight some international best practice.  For example, the Scottish Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 provides a right of access to an independent advocate.  In this regard, I would like to refer to two passages from the testimony of a person who uses our services.  In the first, the individual states it was not explained that other people could attend the meetings or that a peer support person could help, adding that it was not until two years later that they discovered such a person existed.  The second point is that an independent advocacy service is paramount for the person who has lived experience of mental ill health and that there are no statutory advocacy services attached to mental health services.  That latter, according to the testimony, is something that would need to be addressed so the person with lived experience has support to make decisions as to their will and preference.</p></speech>

I agree with all that the Shine representatives have said.  The Deputy's point is on how we legislate for that.  It is very hard to write it into an Act but it can go very well in guiding principles.  It is about a collaborative model.  What is required can be put into a care plan, and rules and regulations can be made through the Mental Health Commission in that regard.  Once all users of mental health services are familiar with what has been provided for, they can insist on it.  It is a question of guiding principles and regulation through the Mental Health Commission rather than putting a particular point into the legislation.  It is through the guiding principles at the start.</p></speech>

It was really helpful.</p> <p>  I now want to turn to the issue of authorised officers.  There is a lot to be considered by a layperson like me coming to this.  There is the allocated key worker and there are the advocacy services, but I just want to deal with the issue of authorised officers because concern arose in previous debates over the role of authorised officers in the Bill and whether it might result in delays in patients accessing treatments.  There is concern that we do not have enough authorised officers.  The best way to build legislation might not be on the basis of the failings of our service.  I would like both sets of witnesses to comment on whether they have concerns over the specification of authorised officers in the legislation.  Do they believe it will make things more difficult from a professional point of view?  Will it have an impact on the role of families in applications?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#G00100"><p>The role of the authorised officer is very important.  When we surveyed our people this week, most of them did not know what an authorised officer was.  At present, too many people are experiencing admission and deprivation of their liberties through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or family members have to sign them in if they have the opportunity.  Often, they bang on multiple doors and never get that.  What we are not talking about is the people who do not get admitted.  I am sure the committee is aware that lots of people present at emergency departments or to teams every day and say they need help, but they do not get an admission.  An authorised officer is a very helpful, independent vehicle to support both the person who is mentally unwell and, at the same time, family members so they can maintain their position as carers.</p> <p>  A great deal of work was put into the authorised officer role when it was started, and where authorised officers worked they worked very well.  The difference is that under the last Mental Health Act the investment did not follow the authorised officer role, so we never got a chance to explore its potential.  If it is rolled out properly, it has significant potential to make a big difference in how people experience care whereby they do not have blue lights at their door and they are able to be admitted in a planned way.  Often authorised officers work to agree a plan with the individuals so they may not need to be admitted or signed in through an order but may actually go in voluntarily.  We never had the potential to tap into the experience of authorised officers and how that might work in this country, but it is a very important role and we urge that investment is made in the role of the authorised officer.</p></speech>

It is welcomed on both sides of the door of approved centres because I believe it will be seen as a resource and a help, but it involves resourcing.  It dramatically changes the way the system works.  It means that the officer will be the support person for the person who is struggling with mental health.  It stops that person ending up in a Garda station.  The person ends up in an appropriate approved centre with a clear plan from the get-go, as opposed to just arriving under blue lights or being detained in a Garda station, which is totally inappropriate.  It is really important, but it is a resource issue.</p></speech>

To follow on from that, one of the discussions we have had over multiple meetings is on the issue of multidisciplinary teams, how they operate and where the lines of responsibility are.  From a psychologist's point of view, does Dr. Drumm take a view on that or is it something that is of concern to him in the new Bill?</p></speech>

We advocated for that in our submission, particularly that there should be parity of esteem across the multidisciplinary team.  Team lead should be based on one's skills and competence, not on privilege of one profession over another.  It gives a sense that all are in the boat together.  That is international best practice, and it was part of our opening statement.  It is transformative of mental health services.  Others will have different opinions on that but, from my perspective, if somebody is the most competent person to lead the team, there is nothing to fear from that and it should not be judged.</p></speech>

We welcome the role of the authorised officer.  We believe it is contributing towards what we are bringing forward today, which is a human rights approach.  From Shine's perspective, and I am sure from other perspectives as well, we wish to emphasise two points.  One is that we strongly believe that role must be complemented by the independent role of the advocacy person.  We also wish to emphasise the importance of information and knowledge.  While we agree the role of the authorised officer is very important, as Ms Byrne mentioned, 74% of the respondents to the survey that we did in preparation for this meeting did not know what that was or that it existed.  We suggest that the committee, if possible, consider the possibility of launching an awareness campaign when this process is finished to give the public the highlights of the new revised Mental Health Act, and that this goes together with highlights from the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, so that people are aware that this is new and this is coming.</p></speech>

I also want to touch on the issue of the new language in respect of the grounds for detention.  There is to be a slight change in that, rather than referring to the presence of risk, detention will have to be immediately necessary for the protection of the life of the person, the protection of his or her health from serious threat or for the protection of others.  Some of the groups we have spoken to, particularly the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, had fairly significant concerns in that regard.  They felt it might increase the risk to patients and families and that it would reduce the agency of medical professionals in recommending detention.  I am interested in hearing the views of both witness groups on that perspective.</p></speech>

That should always be the case.  It is changing.  Going back many years, the expert review group, the Mental Health Commission and many others have recommended that it should change.  I do not agree that this presents a risk or that people will not get the treatment they need.  The assessment is based on what treatment they need and, if they need to be involuntarily detained to get that treatment, that can be done.  It is not about risk but about treatment.  It is really important that this be maintained.  Otherwise, people are being deprived of their liberty based on something that has not happened but that potentially could and that is not right or fair.</p></speech>

I refer to the use of the term "mental disorder".  There is no better way for me to explain what we think about this than to share with the committee a few testimonies.  The person who provided one such testimony tells us that they think the term "mental disorder" is deeply damaging and disempowering to the person who is going through mental health difficulties or illness.  They believe that this label does not allow autonomy with regard to a person's care needs.  They had to do a Google search for the word and found the following definitions: "a state of confusion", "the breakdown of peaceful and law-abiding public behaviour" and "an illness or condition that disrupts normal physical or mental functions".  This person does not believe that any of these definitions are helpful to them.  They also feel that the label of a mental health diagnosis can be damaging and disempowering, that mental health recovery has to be person-centred and that the language around such recovery needs to be inclusive of the person rather than damaging to their needs.</p> <p>  Another person's testimony says that calling a person with mental ill-health someone who has a mental disorder shows poor judgment and that it can be very damaging to be given such a label.  They believe the word "disorder" should be removed and that it is like the word "lunacy".  They say the word is very aged and should be discarded immediately.</p></speech>

What we are really looking for in this Bill is parity of esteem with physical health.  We certainly do not refer to people as physically disordered.  That would be offensive and it is the same for mental health.  This is very simple and needs to be enshrined in the amended Act.  There is no risk in involuntarily detaining a person who is suffering with significant severe mental health difficulties such as schizophrenia.  The Act allows for that and the risk element does not need to be included to do that.  It is nonsense to say that it is needed, that there is a risk such people will not get treatment or that they will be a danger to themselves and others.  That is the case with regard to life-saving treatment relating to physical health and it should be the same for mental health.  There is nothing about that in legislation on physical health.  It is just in general law.  It should be the same.</p></speech>

We advocate to eliminate language practices, as well as opinions and labels, that undermine the dignity of the person.  We welcome the replacements already made in the heads of Bill, such as "patient" by "person" and "tribunal" by "review board".  However, the people with whom we work question the use of the term "mental health disorder".  There is consensus that it is degrading.  There is a need to bring it in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, Article 3 of which refers to non-discrimination, while Article 4 places an obligation on states: "To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against persons with disabilities".  This issue is also addressed in Article 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights, ECHR, relating to the prohibition of discrimination.</p></speech>

I welcome the speakers from Shine and the Psychological Society of Ireland.  We are near the end of this phase of pre-legislative scrutiny and the committee has heard from many witnesses in recent months, some of whom have contradictory opinions on certain aspects of the Mental Health Act.  At our most recent meeting, we were joined by representatives of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland who informed us clearly that it was important for the committee not to make general statements that the use of restraints and seclusion is bad.  They are against the prohibition of those practices in the Bill.  In its written submission, Shine stated: "These practices are not consistent with the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment."  Should a ban on the use of restraints and seclusion be legislated for in the Bill?  What are the reasons for that?</p></speech>

Seclusion and restraint are not consistent with the principles of the UNCRPD or the prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.  The guidelines given by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are to eliminate seclusion and restraints.  We understand the Mental Health Act was not designed to abolish these practices but, in the transition to eliminating them, we recommend a change in the language used in order to reflect, first, that these practices should be a very last resort, second, that they are only used in rare and exceptional circumstances and, third, that they are only used for the amount of time strictly necessary.  We recommend the inclusion of definitions of "rare and exceptional" and "strictly necessary" in the Bill.  I refer to Articles 14 and 15 of the UNCRPD.  I will not read them out in the interests of time but Article 14 talks about liberty and security of the person and Article 15 talks about freedom from torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.</p></speech>

From the perspective of the PSI, we are recommending that the Mental Health Commission develop regulations and codes in respect of seclusion and that breach of those would be an offence subject to a fine or conviction.  If one wants to change the legislation to make it effective, that is what needs to be done.  Section 69(1) of the Act governs the use of bodily restraint and seclusion.  There is probably a need for seclusion and physical, medical and mechanical restraint but there needs to be clear definitions, rules and codes attached to those.  They need to be used only as a last resort.  In truth, the research mostly suggests their usage is usually due to the environment rather than the person.  If the person has his or her own room or suite, it is a place to which he or she can go.  It should be a calm and relaxing place to which he or she can go rather than being flagged as a punishment.  That transforms the way it is seen and done.  If there are rules and regulations attached to the usage, that makes sure it is done appropriately and not excessively.</p></speech>

I will read another quote on this point.</p> <blockquote> 	They don't listen.  They don't understand a person's situation.  They think medication is the solution.  But they don't understand the effects on a person.  Weight gain, loss of drive for life and thoughts of suicide.  I have been dragged from my home, put in a padded cell and not allowed use the toilet.  I have been forcibly pinned down and injected against my will.  They terrified me. </blockquote></speech>

How do they feel their voices were heard in this process?  We have heard that some people feel they were excluded from the process through the use of language or through not getting notification that the process was happening.</p></speech>

It was very interesting to see the lack of awareness and understanding of the process and what is going on.  After all, this will be an historic piece of legislation that will change the way people experience mental health services into the future.  We would not need to address some of these issues if we talked about early intervention and community services.  With the discontinuation of day services that were previously provided in the community by the HSE it is now vital that community and voluntary sector organisations are funded in a manner that enables them to provide a wider much-needed range of services.  Funding and additional backing should also be provided for things like the early intervention in psychosis initiative to improve the long-term outcomes for people with experience of psychotic illness.<br/><br/>In Shine, following our work and experience, we believe the promotion of community support mechanisms at a local level can prevent mental health difficulties from becoming more complex.  In this regard, we support the recommendation to include a provision for the right to community mental health services in the amended legislation.  Based on the experiences shared with us by people who use our services, this would provide alternatives to inpatient facilities.  It will also contribute to reducing the number of cases that evolve into more complex mental health difficulties.  This is also raised in Article 26 of the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities regarding habilitation and rehabilitation.<br/><br/>To quote some of our service users: </p> <blockquote> 	It is very important that addressing and educating all members of the community in ASIST, safeTALK and Understanding of Self Harm, that these tools may help someone who is ... vulnerable and unsafe and that the person who has the techniques and information can help and assist this person and be there as a trustworthy and kind person to listen...   </blockquote> <p>Another person said, </p> <blockquote> 	The most significant finding I have always maintained is that there are a lot of instances where there is a specific benefit of treatment under the relevant health care scheme in cases where there is a breakdown in family relationships.  For example, following a bereavement or in the case of an attempt to prevent the incidence of loss of life or the incidence of harm to an individual or individuals.  In these cases, support in the community from a multi-disciplinary team is always a good idea. </blockquote> <p>Finally, somebody else said:  &quot;I want to impress on the government how effective community care is to individuals with mental health conditions and hope these services will be made available to all who need it.&quot;</p></speech>

We have seen recently that CAMHS in South Kerry seemed to rely on an ungoverned medical model because of the lack of resources - not just psychological services but also, as we have mentioned, multidisciplinary teams.  That does not just apply in South Kerry CAMHS but seems to be endemic across the system.  I agree that the move to social and psychosocial interventions is key.</p><p>What barriers might stop this happening?  I met the witnesses and members of this society before about the lack of training resources for trainee psychologists and particularly educational and counselling psychologists.  If they elaborate on that, it would be perfect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Drumm" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#L00200"><p>I am very happy to answer that question.  We have a colleague in another room nearby articulating that at the education committee meeting.  There is a need for mental health resources, and not just psychology, across the entire country.  It is difficult to recruit and it is very hard to get resources and posts.  We need more of them.</p> <p>  In the past there was predominantly a medical model for mental health but that evolved into a medical and psychological and then a social model.  That was considered a triangle, with the medical element at the top, and over time it became a flatter line, with medical at one part of the line, the psychological element at another and the social element at another part.  In fairness, it is now an upside down triangle, with the medical and psychology on one line and the social element at the top of the triangle.  It may even be a line with medical at the bottom, psychology is in the middle and the social element is at the top.</p> <p>  On the question of mental health and effective intervention, the Psychological Society of Ireland believes that social and psychological interventions must be provided first.  It is what the World Health Organization and the NICE guidelines for excellence recommend.  This must be done as a first line of action.  There must be parity across the elements for the process to work.</p> <p>  The south Kerry look-back review was terrible and really concerning.  We all read that with shock and disappointment but we were not surprised.  The problem is likely to be much wider and greater than what has happened in south Kerry.  Even the helpline phone calls came from well outside south Kerry in that regard.</p></speech>

It was a governance issue relating to psychiatry but it was also a governance issue relating to the team and the wider service in south Kerry.  The point of our opening statement was to allow that governance to be shared so everybody is in the boat together and everyone is responsible.  Everyone is responsible for their role and it should be clear what people are supposed to do.  People must be held accountable rather than only one person being held accountable for someone else, which is not practical and would not stand up in legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#L00500"><p>I do not wish to pit one group of psychologists against another.  I would not do that.  There seems to be a discrepancy in the amount of resources for clinical trainee psychologists and educational and counselling psychologists.  Is there a way of bringing them in line so both can have parity and the same chance of getting qualified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.472" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Drumm" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#L00600"><p>Our psychological society has advocated for many years now that there would be parity between educational counselling and clinical psychology.  The professionally trained psychologists who work should have parity.  There is one group that is funded and supported to train but the other is not, which is not fair or right.  We have a significant resource issue in psychology and we need as many psychologists as we can get.  We have always conceded that there are never enough psychologists in the country and there never will be enough to provide for all the psychological needs of the population.  However, it does not have to be all about psychology; we are very generous and happy to share.  This can involve clinical nurse specialists, family therapy-trained social workers, play therapists or other nurses.  It can involve occupational therapists and social workers, as they all play a part in the intervention for mental health difficulties.  It is the same with our colleagues trained in educational and counselling psychology.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.473" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anne Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#L00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for highlighting that difficulty around parity of funding for training.  As Dr. Drumm states, the Psychological Society of Ireland has advocated for a long time on that and we hope to see a big change in future with funding for educational and counselling psychologists, given the amount of service that is needed.</p> <p>  There is the idea that 24-7 mental health services are required in the community and the nature of the service provided has to be considered carefully.  Currently, most out-of-hours crisis care is provided in the medical model by medical staff, including psychiatry, nursing and GPs.</p><p>That really perpetuates the medical model for anyone presenting in a crisis out of hours, whether it is at night, at the weekend or in the early hours of the morning.  Really, people should first have access to psychological support that is appropriate and central in their care delivery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#M00200"><p>On that point, Dr. Kehoe is preaching to the converted.  One of the big gaps in service is the lack of 24-7 emergency access to mental health treatment.  There are a couple of pilot projects being run in County Galway at the moment.  They seem to be working well, which is welcome.  I know that a pilot will also be launched in Limerick later this year that involves An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Teams will meet people in the area who are having a mental health crisis and, hopefully, triage, treat and refer them on to the appropriate services.  I agree with Dr. Kehoe completely on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.476" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#M00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today.  I welcome that they have talked about moving away from a medical model.  I firmly believe that is right.  The witnesses have all touched on the issue of funding.  I believe that a number of years ago around &euro;10 million was going into psychological services and therapies and whatever, and over &euro;400 million was being spent on medicines.  There was definitely an issue with that.</p> <p>  I want to touch on two issues.  One is that of advocacy, which plays a huge part.  I do not think there is enough publicity around it.  From personal experience over the years, when somebody is in crisis - I suppose this is a clich&eacute; but we are a very reactive society rather than a proactive one - we panic, and families do the same.  As the witnesses mentioned, garda&iacute; are then unfortunately the first to be called.  Again, we are reactive in that.  It is very traumatic for the patient or individual involved, and it escalates the problem.  Each and every one of us sees such incidents every day.  Mental health issues are going to get even worse coming out of the pandemic and given what is happening at the moment.  Many people are going to be very disturbed and unwell, given the events in Ukraine as well.</p> <p>  Looking at the Irish model, advocacy would be my number one priority.  I agree with the witnesses that members of the public complain.  However, it is about trying to get the model into legislation to make it part of the pot.  As I said, there should be no competition between psychology services and the clinical lead.  All services should be part of a team, but it does not seem to be that way.  That is what makes it very frustrating.  I had the honour of sitting on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care a number of years ago.  It was a cross-party committee and members signed off on an agreement eventually.  It may not have been perfect, but it was moving in the right direction.  I am back here listening to the witnesses today.  I actually wrote down the following question.  Even if the Bill passes in its entirety, with 99.9% of what people advocated for, how confident are the witnesses that it will actually be enforced?  I am saying nothing now.  I am using the word "enforced" because somebody is going to have to be accountable and take responsibility for it.  If this Bill is passed in its entirety, who is going to enforce it?</p> <p>  There are also issues with how services will be staffed, because there will be multidisciplinary teams.  In a few committee meetings it has been mentioned that if there was a premier league of CAMHS teams, there would probably be three matches a year, out of a total of 25 teams.  That is a fact, because the teams are not resourced.  There could be 11 players on one team, seven on another and nine on a different team.  When I hear about this whole-time equivalent, it drives me mad.</p> <p>  I also want to touch on the issue of early intervention and community services.  That is why I asked the witnesses about whether they have confidence in this Bill.  The Chairman will be very aware of what I am about to raise.  At present, in my area there is a mental healthcare centre that has long-term respite and short-term respite beds.  It is in the community.  The majority of its residents are long-term patients.  They are totally integrated into the town.  In my opinion, because the building is not suitable, the HSE has decided that it is easier to shut the whole lot down and move all these people out.  We are being told that we will not need these services again.  That is why I asked the witnesses about how confident they will be if the Bill is passed.  We have a centre with a model that has worked for years.  It serves a huge population and there is a wonderful team of staff in it.</p><p>Yet, because of failings within the HSE, which did not maintain the building, it is easier for it to shut down services.  Mentally, it is still systemic within society that if people try to change something, there is resistance to it.  Regardless of whether or not something is working, people have no power to say that something is inappropriate, is against European law or is a human rights issue.</p><p> First, if this Bill were passed in its entirety, and even if it were perfect, how confident are the witnesses that it would be actually enforced?  Second, I am very interested in the independent complaints mechanism.  As was said, most people in these scenarios do not have a voice and do not realise what their rights are.  Restraint was mentioned.  Should there be a separate paragraph on that stating the rules to be followed, what must be done first and that there must be an independent group that can assist the patient and the family?  Nobody knows what is going on.  There is the over-reliance on medication as a form of sedation or restraint.  We are talking about all these issues but the first thing we will hear when we leave this room is that we have a problem with recruitment and retention.  I am a firm believer that we have one of the best educational systems in the world.  The Irish people are very empathetic and passionate about what jobs they go into.  The majority of these people went into these jobs because they wanted to do something and to make a difference in society.</p><p> I wish to ask about getting proper funding.  The witnesses all mentioned funding, funding, funding.  I remember that in 2018, I think, we asked the CHOs how much was spent on mental health services.  It was over &euro;1 billion, yet they could not tell us where they spent it.  Then what happened?  They shut down the Owenacurra centre when we wanted accountability.  That was handy.  I will not dwell on that too much.</p><p> I am very interested in the model of early intervention community services.  That works and is being supported yet there are failings from one entity to another.  How can they be made responsible and accountable for their failings so patients do not suffer?  I go back to my first question.  If the Bill were passed in its entirety tomorrow, would the witnesses have confidence in it actually being pushed forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.478" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nicola Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#N00200"><p>To quote Einstein, if you always do what you always did, you will always get what you always got.  If we do not have this in legislation, we will not bring about the culture change that is needed at this time.  We have ratified the UNCRPD and we need to be compliant with it, embedding that way of thinking.</p> <p>  To talk to the Deputy about culture change and resources, the original recommendations from the review of the Mental Health Act appear to promote a more recovery-oriented approach to treatment.  That coincided with the development of Advancing Recovery in Ireland, which subsequently evolved into Mental Health Engagement and Recovery.  It is important that the objectives of these initiatives are embraced throughout the mental health services and that the current model of care is developed to endorse a more recovery-orientated approach to treatment and service delivery.  As mentioned in our opening statement, Shine welcomes the paradigm shift from best interest to guiding principles.  A lot has been done, but there is a long road ahead of us.  Our service users say that mental ill-health is very misunderstood and that it takes time and compassion to treat.  They stress need, not medication-only treatments.  One of our service users said he thought the heads of Bill were more progressive and more in keeping with the rights and preferences of the individual but asked whether mental health services would be sufficiently funded and resourced and how they would operate.  As for resources, another service user said there were staff shortages in his mental health hospital and a very heavy emphasis on clozapine, which did not suit him and caused other physical issues, for which he required treatment.</p><p>Another service user said that the number of beds in a public psychiatric unit are so limited that clients end up being released from hospital even when they are not fully recovered in a bid to free up a bed for someone else.  It can look a bit like a conveyor belt in a psychiatric unit where the staff are completely overworked and as a result cannot offer more individual time with clients.  </p><p> Deputy Buckley mentioned individual complaint mechanisms.  People who access the mental health services should be provided with the opportunity to express their views and opinions in a manner that is constructive and accountable, with appropriate follow-up and responses.  Evidence shows that the Your Service, Your Say complaints mechanism has not been fully satisfactory.  Shine welcomes the new provision for a dedicated independent complaints mechanism in a format and language that the person can understand.  This mechanism must be separate from and independent of those already in place by the HSE. </p></speech>

I remain hopeful that it will make a difference.  Looking back at the 2001 Act, it was an improvement and, in fairness, made a significant positive impact but it is just not good enough and it needs to be changed.</p> <p>  Legislation is the benign dictator that shapes behaviour in a way that is appropriate and one hopes that resources follow.  That is so much better.  We have had A Vision for Change and we have had Change for the future &ndash; A Vision for Change &lsquo;refresh&rsquo; in 2020 with an expert review group looking at it.  We also have a team working document which the Mental Health Commission produced in 2010 which does not have the same clout, influence or ability to shift or nudge services in the right direction.  This legislation does that.  I remain exceptionally hopeful that that is exactly what it will do.  We have to do that.  It is about changing the culture and that legislation does that in a way that nothing else does.</p></speech>

There are accountability mechanisms from both directions.  We work with and provide spaces for people to place their demands, emotions, their suggestions and their recommendations.  It is not only us but there are many civil society organisations across Ireland who provide that space and there are great networks there.  There is Mental Health Reform and Mental Health Ireland who are doing ongoing work on this.  They have been doing consultations all along since this process started.</p> <p>  These spaces are key because we are hoping that when this information channel is up and running and this piece of legislation is passed, these groups are not going to stop.  That kind of monitoring work will be ongoing.  We cannot forget that which will also come from the top.  We cannot stress enough today how important the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is and the commitments that come with that ratification.  These are setting the basis for a number of the changes that have already been suggested in these amendments.  We cannot emphasise enough the human rights approach of mental health services.

This is my gripe and it has been for years.</p></speech>

This is why I asked Ms Vidal to begin with a comment on this Bill, by asking her whether that optional protocol has to come in.  There are major issues there because as we discuss a mental health Act here, the simple act of a county council putting down footpaths will mean that they will have to be wheelchair accessible, because it is rights-based.  If we were to strengthen this legislation now, would she be mentioning this aspect?  The minute that this Bill is passed and enacted, does the optional protocol have to be signed and adopted?</p></speech>

I will return to what we were discussing earlier on and the different opinions of witnesses who have appeared before the committee, and even such differences between the Minister of State, in fairness to her, and the HSE.  I wish to discuss the issue of the reappointment of a national director for mental health.  Have our witnesses an opinion as to whether that post should be reinstated or do they think what is there already is working?</p></speech>

I think it was exceptionally helpful.  Who one picks is important, but that is not within my gift.  It is very important because someone who has worked on the front line is able to advise.  It makes a huge difference.  However, we need to be careful that we do not privilege one profession over any other.  There needs to be parity of esteem.  I agree it should be reinstated but the nature of it, who is appointed and the job description - what the person is expected to do and who he or she is supposed to link in with and represent - are very important.</p></speech>

However, everyone is aiming towards zero use of control and restraint.  The guiding concept is that we move towards zero.  All efforts should be made not to have to use it.  It should not be seen as an option on a menu but as a practice of last resort.  How do we get there?  That is the more important question in that, in the vast majority of cases, we should never have to use it.  If we had proper early intervention services and properly resourced community services, and if people and their family members were part of a conversation, we would not be in a situation where so many people rely on involuntary admission and control and restraint.</p></speech>

It involves approximately ten years of college.  The person does a primary degree in psychology.  The average person would then do a master's degree, probably for two years.  After that, one might work as an assistant psychologist in a front-line service which is now, thankfully, paid.  It is a small amount but there are posts such as that.  One then applies to do a doctorate in professional psychology.  The doctorate would be in clinical, educational or counselling psychology.  That is a three-year course where one works in six placements in different areas of the HSE.  One would certainly do so for a doctorate in clinical psychology.  Some applicants might have a PhD and others might have worked for ten years as a social worker.  We have a wide range of people.  We welcome people from diverse backgrounds or those who have significant life experience because it is a very powerful and important job.  We make a difference in many people's lives.  People need to be up for that on the front line.  One then completes a doctorate in one of those training courses.  As Deputy Ward was saying earlier, one of those is funded.  The doctorate in clinical psychology is funded nationally and the other two are not.</p><p>People pay to do that professional doctorate.  This means they are often paying to work for free, for three years, at the front line of the health service, delivering interventions to people who have significant, mild, moderate or severe mental health problems or difficulties.  They then qualify with their doctorate in a professional area of psychology and take up a role in a range of different settings, such as schools, the health service and private practice.</p></speech>

There is a huge bottleneck and hundreds and hundreds of applicants across the country.  We have five clinical psychology courses, two educational psychology courses and one counselling course.  There is a massive bottleneck.  The same is mirrored in services for young people and families and adults trying to access interventions at the level of clinical psychologist.</p> <p>  That is not to say that everybody needs to see a clinical psychologist.  Many people are very happy with other levels of intervention.  However, the number waiting to see clinical psychologists is absolutely shameful.  That someone in a moderate to severe mental health presentation has to wait two years to see a clinical psychologist is wholly unacceptable.</p> <p>  We need more funding for all of those training courses, for some of them in the first instance and more for the others, so that we have more professionals trained who can deliver those interventions and supervise other kinds of professions and other disciplines to deliver similar interventions.</p></speech>

There are major changes taking place at that level to change basic awareness at undergraduate level.  This is being done through visibility, by highlighting people with those diverse aspects in the profession and showing them front and centre.  We need that.  Professional psychologists deliver for the people they work with.  If you do not see yourself represented at that level, then why would you come?  We have many issues and we are working very hard on them.  Lots of colleges are making major changes and reforming their interview practices and application criteria.  I am delighted to see that.  I think more change will come.</p></speech>

We try to do it as best we can.  It is on selection criteria and interview and it is encouraged.  Psychology is probably one of the top three undergraduate courses applied for among leaving certificate students.  The points are astronomically high for the course.  The places dictate that, not the stuff that might be needed to get it done.  That is a bottleneck and, as Dr. Kehoe said, there is also a bottleneck at the professional level.  People might do a master&rsquo;s degree, work as an assistant psychologist or apply for a doctorate in counselling psychology in Trinity College where there might be 150 applicants.  Those who get an interview bring that number down to 50 and the number of second round interviews might drop as low as 28.  The university will offer 12 places.  As such, we can see where the bottleneck is just getting tighter.</p> <p>  We get many overseas applicants from the UK and all over Europe.  They come in and get a statement of equivalence to work here from the Department of Education.  That is a significant part of our work and our workforce as well.</p> <p>  We need to increase places and funding so that it is equitable.  That funding does not need to come exclusively from health; it needs to come from education, justice or wherever those people will ultimately work.  There needs to be a shared cross-departmental solution to that.  The burden cannot fall to health to do that.</p></speech>

In small places, close to home &ndash; so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world.  Yet they are the world of the individual person... </blockquote> <p>I am looking forward to a culture shift where we talk about and live person-centred care.  The content of the legislation and the job members have are a huge responsibility.</p><p>We ask members to bear in mind the people at the end of it who will experience this, and that could be me or members.  It is important to keep it at that level, to realise there is not an otherness to this opportunity.  This is about us, how we are viewed and how we experience our world.</p></speech>

I would be excited to see a much stronger focus on human rights in the new legislation.  We are aware there have been many different narratives at this table and now the committee has the hard work of making sense of all of them.  The truth and the best approach always lies in between all of that.  The committee has the hard work of selecting what to bring forward and what to leave behind.  A very strong message from Shine and from the people who use our services is the importance of that human rights base because it protects their rights as persons.</p> <p>  To give an example of that, we had a powerful testimony from a person who spent quite some time in treatment in an inpatient facility.  She said when she was in that facility she was not feeling well.  Patients' self-esteem is low, they do not have their stuff, they do not have their friends, and then they are asked to be in a queue to collect their medication.  She said how different it would have been had somebody come to her in a private space to bring her that medication.  That is what this is about, that change in the approach to the person.  That is going to happen in the little things and of course in the bigger things such as legislation.  That is what I am excited about.</p></speech>

I like the idea of guiding principles within the Act that allow for a clarity to be provided to help with its interpretation and enactment.  That is a helpful way of getting around some of the very difficult situations and the conflicting advice the committee has received.  It is probably the nicest way of doing it.  It is not moving away from the medical model; it is bringing in the psycho and the social.  It incorporates that into it rather than it being predominantly an illness or medical approach.  We know that if a person is in crisis and is seen, then automatically, straight away there is relief.  We know that even with physical health, the moment a person is seen, even if he or she is in great pain while waiting to be seen, that person automatically starts to feel a little better.  We want to make sure that is available to allow that to happen in a way that is helpful.  I remain exceptionally hopeful the Act will do that but it needs to be a bit brave.  We need to make decisions then, and while not everyone is going to be happy and we do not expect to happy about it, as long as the decisions are made in regard to the individual who is using the service, everything else naturally falls out of that.  As long as there are guiding principles based on human rights, everything else is okay.</p></speech>

Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the speaker will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.

I thank the Chair for inviting us and for the introduction.</p> <p>  Mental Health Reform is Ireland&rsquo;s leading national coalition on mental health, with over 75 member organisations working for progressive reform of mental health services and supports in Ireland.  We are appreciative of the opportunity to appear before the sub-committee again on behalf of our member organisations.  We take this opportunity to reiterate the historic importance of this once in a generation opportunity for positive change in our mental health legislation.  We thank members of the sub-committee, sub-committee staff, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, her officials and all who have engaged with the comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny process to date.</p><p>We would like to highlight three priority areas that have been discussed over the months of pre-legislative scrutiny.  Regarding Part 8 and children and assisted decision-making, in particular under 18-year-olds admitted to adult inpatient units, head 128, section 108, which deals with the admission of a child to an adult approved inpatient facility, allows for the admission of those aged under 18 to adult facilities.  In its 2020 annual report, our colleagues in the Mental Health Commission showed that there were 27 admissions to nine adult units during that year.  The commission also reported that there was 0% compliance with the code of practice of admission of children to approved centres.  The committee has heard some arguments as to why this provision should be kept.  We again state that such a provision is contrary to our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, under which the State will be reviewed later this year.  The reasons for keeping this provision are unacceptable to our members and we again call for the prohibition of this practice.</p><p> Regarding assisted decision-making, we have extensively highlighted a lacuna between the heads of the Bill and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  We appeared before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth during its two-day pre-legislative scrutiny session on the updating of that Act.  The provisions of the Act must be extended to 16- and 17-year olds and also must be extended those involuntarily detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act and the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act.  The report of that committee is, I understand, currently being finalised.  We urge committee members to liaise with their counterparts on that committee and relevant Department officials to ensure there is congruence between these important and interlinked pieces of legislation.</p><p> The second area I would like to highlight is Part 6 regarding coercive or restrictive practices, on which there has already been some discussion.  Recommendation 92 of Sharing the Vision, our national mental health policy, makes a clear commitment towards a zero restraint and zero seclusion action plan.  We fully support the move away from coercive practices.  The evidence is clear that this can be done, including through improved training in de-escalation techniques and having more trauma-informed care.  Article 14 of the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, specifically states that disabled people, including those with psychosocial disabilities, shall not be deprived of their liberty.  However the State, when ratifying the UNCRPD in 2018, made a declaration on this article and a reservation to continue to allow compulsory care.  We ask the committee to recommend that this reservation should be removed and the true spirit of Article 14 be respected and upheld.  We also ask the committee to examine the lacuna around the deprivation of liberty safeguards, which would be vital to the legislation.</p><p> Regarding an independent complaints mechanism, since 2014 Mental Health Reform has highlighted the need for an independent complaints mechanism.  We note that the expert group did not recommend an independent group for making a complaint in the 2015 report.  Decision support services, which are stand-alone services located within the Mental Health Commission, provide support on decision-making and investigate complaints on decision-making for people with mental health difficulties under the 2015 Act.  However, this is narrow in remit and solely applies to complaints around decision-making, which may limit the scope of the sort of complaints that can and will be investigated on behalf of service users.  As mentioned, the 2015 Act does not provide for those detained involuntarily or detained under the Criminal Law Act or those aged 16 and 17.  This is a worrying lacuna, and is discriminatory and must be remedied.</p><p> In contributions to our ten-year anniversary conference last week, the need for an independent complaints mechanism was highlighted by a number of speakers.  We reiterate this important call and ask for this to be included as a recommendation in the committee's report.  We also ask that the committee call for the ratification of the optional protocol of the UNCRPD.</p><p> In conclusion, in the 1940s one in every four people in Ireland was living in an institution.</p><p>That is not very far back in our past and the implications of that dark history remain embedded in our society and culture today.  The stigmatisation and siloing of mental health difficulties, and severe and enduring mental health difficulties, in particular, continues to permeate throughout the services.</p><p> This process and the insight of the committee members are warmly welcomed in stepping towards the future.  To bring about real change for people who access our mental health services, we need a cultural shift as well as legislative reform.  The time is now and the opportunity lies with the committee members.  We very much look forward to the discussions today and, once more, go raibh maith agaibh for the committee's time.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Gary Kiernan, director of regulation, and Orla Keane, general counsel for the commission.  The commission is an independent statutory body with the principal functions to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.  The remit of the commission was extended by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides for the establishment of the Decision Support Service, DSS, for adults with capacity difficulties.</p> <p>  The commission adopted a practical, person-centred and rights-based approach when reviewing the heads of Bill and making its submissions to the Department of Health and this committee.  The commission seeks to ensure parity for persons with mental health issues and believes this general scheme seeks to do that in a number of respects.  The commission also wishes to ensure we have a primary focus on care and treatment, not on risk and coercion.</p> <p>  The commission acknowledges and agrees with the arguments made by several parties that the proposed amendments shall require additional time and resources, but we reject this argument as a reason for not making the changes.  Mental health services have not been given the priority that they require.  The time for change is now and we hope a recommendation can be made that significant investment is required at all levels of mental health services to ensure a fundamental change in how these services operate and benefit those who receive care and treatment.</p> <p>  I want to touch on what we perceive are some of the key issues raised during the pre-legislative scrutiny to date, the first being the proposed new criteria for involuntary detention.  The commission wishes to note that this is a very complex issue and it needs to be considered in the context of various other sections of the general scheme, and we can speak to that if required.  The commission notes the issues raised by various other parties, to include the medical practitioners, and we are happy to support and-or advise the Department, where required, in regard to discussions with these parties to ensure clarity and understanding and to ascertain if there is a way forward that works for the person at the centre of the process and the related parties.</p> <p>  The commission remains strongly opposed to any proposal to introduce an intermediate category of patient.  We believe this proposal would infringe the rights of service users.  These provisions were suggested by the expert review group to fill a gap that existed prior to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act but as that Act hopefully comes into force and will address the issue of capacity, these requirements no longer need to be addressed in the 2001 Act.  In fact, we believe these new provisions would undermine both the 2001 Act and 2015 Act and fundamentally change what is the intention of both pieces of legislation.  The inclusion of these provisions goes against the objective of what we are trying to achieve as a country in terms of parity for people with mental health issues.</p> <p>  With regard to the extension of the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s remit to deal with complaints, this matter was considered by the executive and the board of the commission and, following this, we communicated with the Department of Health and this committee.  We do not believe the commission should take on the role of a complaints body, given its key functions as the regulator of mental health services and the administration of the mental health tribunals.  In fact, we query why there is a need for a different process for dealing with complaints relating to treatment of mental health issues as opposed to treatment of general health issues.  This would appear to go against the principle of parity which both the commission and the Department are seeking to attain.  The commission is conscious that anything that seeks to differentiate those with mental health issues could be seen as a regressive step.</p> <p>  Currently, each approved centre actually has a complaints procedure.  In the HSE there is the &ldquo;Your Service, Your Say&rdquo; mechanism and there is also a mechanism to seek a review of the care and treatment, where required.</p><p>If a person is not satisfied with the process provided by the services, he or she can refer certain matters to the Ombudsman.  Consideration might be given to extending the Ombudsman&rsquo;s powers to deal with matters concerning clinical issues.  The commission understands that there have been discussions between the HSE, the Department and the Office of the Ombudsman on this matter.  Furthermore, issues relating to staff are either dealt with by the approved centres&rsquo; own policies and procedures, regarding obligations and duties by way of their contract, in respect of the code of conduct, etc., or people could be referred to their professional bodies.  It is important to understand that under regulation 21 of the approved centre regulations, the inspectorate team examines whether complaints are being dealt with appropriately, and if there is a concern this is addressed with the approved centre.  The centres are required in law to be in compliance with the regulations.  This process could be strengthened through revision and expansion of regulation 21, and, more generally, through a review of the approved centre regulations.</p><p> Turning to applications for involuntary detention to be made by authorised officers, the commission agrees with the recommendations in the expert group&rsquo;s report and the Department's proposal, as contained in the general scheme.  We have raised concerns that up to 30% of applications are being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  People suffering the distress of significant mental health issues should not be met by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but by appropriately trained and skilled personnel.  The expert group consulted with various parties to include the HSE in 2013 and 2014, and was told by the HSE that it proposed to increase the number of authorised officers.  The commission reviewed this aspect in 2021 and we noted this increase does not appear to have happened.</p><p> In its submission to the Department, we stated that to ensure that this amending legislation works, funding will be required for the HSE to ensure that a 24-7 service, 365 days a year is available throughout the country.  The service must also be available for all approved inpatient facilities, public and private.   The current regulations relating to authorised officers will need to be amended to redefine the professional requirements for someone to be appointed an authorised officer and to specify the assessment tool criteria to be applied by the authorised officer when making an application.  Consideration must also be given as to whether the commission should be able to audit or inspect this part of the service to ensure that it is in fact vindicating and safeguarding the rights of persons.  The commission rejects the resources  argument made by some parties for not proceeding with the amendment.  The commission welcomes and wishes to reiterate that the substantial changes proposed with regard to children should be  pursued and introduced as the current provisions are hopelessly inadequate.  I thank the members of the committee for listening and we are happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

As they are probably aware, we are at the end of this phase of our pre-legislative scrutiny and of hearing from witnesses.  During this process, we have received many different and contradictory opinions.  Having these witnesses at the same meeting is a good development, because they have different opinions on various aspects of this proposed legislation.</p> <p>  On that note, I wish to tease out some of those differences.  Taking the last statement made by Mr Farelly, in respect of the commission wishing "to reiterate that the substantial changes proposed with regard to children should be pursued and introduced as the current provisions are hopelessly inadequate", I ask him to expand on that and explain to us what changes should be introduced.  Would these include the prohibition on admitting children into adult facilities?  Regarding mental health reform, what safeguards could be put in place to stop this practice occurring?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.529" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#W00500"><p>The first point to make is that there is a new Part.  Equally, the commission made several recommendations in this context.  My colleague, Mr. Kiernan dealt with the issue of having children only detained in child centres.  This, however, comes back to the resourcing argument.  If the proper facilities were available, then children would not need to go into adult facilities.  Therefore, the key issue is that more funding is required to ensure there is true parity in the mental health services.</p><p>The new Parts in the legislation include things like separate provisions for children under 16, and 16 or 17 year olds with mental health issues being treated in parity with 16 and 17 year olds with general health issues.  It is also very important that statutorily required information be given to children who are 16 and 17, which is not in the Act, and that the provisions for mental health be separated from the childcare legislation.  Currently, it is a quagmire going through section 25 of the Act and trying to cross-reference all the various sections of the childcare legislation.  Everything should be included in the mental health Act, with everything a parent or guardian needs to look at clearly set out.  There should be specific codes of practice about user guides that must be provided by approved centres.  In all section 25 applications for involuntary detention, children should have the right to access to legal representation.  That will be a new provision.  We set out a number of these provisions in our previous statement to the committee in November.  I will ask Mr. Kiernan to respond on the specific issue of children being detained in adult centres.</p></speech>

It used to be hundreds of children every year and, as has been pointed out, it was 29 last year.  Of course, everyone wants children to be appropriately admitted to a children's centre with the appropriately skilled staff, arrangements and resources in place.  What we see in the Mental Health Commission is that these admissions tend to be at weekends when resources and children's emergency admission units are not available.  This is the recourse people have out of hours and at weekends when they are in desperate situations.  As far as the regulator is concerned, we follow up on each and every admission of a child to an adult unit to understand the circumstances of why that occurred and what could have been done differently, and to ensure the appropriate supports are in place to reduce and prevent further recurrence.  As a regulator, we would highlight that these instances have dramatically reduced in recent years and the figure has been at the same level for the last three or four years.</p></speech>

The expansion into community services over the next ten years is key.  We need to do that in Ireland.  Children are going into units, being detained, being at risk and all these things are happening because we do not have early intervention services in place 24-7.  I am not sure everyone realises how much work we have to do.  I like this Bill because it sets out that we will be regulating community services and over the next ten years will put them in place to stop this constant sharp edge of people being admitted into units.</p></speech>

Mental Health Reform acknowledges that there has been huge progress in this area.  It is fair to say that everyone agrees this should not happen, and we are moving towards a situation where it should not happen.  We urge the Government to be ambitious with this legislation.  By having this provision specifically within the Bill, there would be an additional legal duty on the Government to ensure the resources are available and so we as a State can say this is no longer acceptable and should not happen under any circumstances.  If we really believe we are moving towards a model where it will not happen, we should enshrine that within this legislation.</p> <p>  We support the current processes for the reviews that take place and the data that are regularly published by the Mental Health Commission.  Separately, we call for additional resources and recognise that this is very much a resource issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#Y00100"><p>I have a follow-up question on that for Mr. Farrelly.  I agree that legislation should not be led by resources.  Legislation should be put in place and resources should follow to make sure the legislation is properly implemented.  On that note, does Mr. Farrelly believe a prohibition on placing children in adult facilities should be enshrined in this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#Y00200"><p>I will give the Deputy another angle on it.  There could be unintended outcomes from that.  If we step back and look, for example, at our general hospitals, there are large numbers of children in our general hospitals who need to be admitted to mental health facilities.  I would also worry that young adults, those aged between 15 and 17, would suffer by not having any facility at all.  I would rather see people treated in some facility than receiving no treatment at all.  The bottom line is that we do not have the facilities to treat them so by enshrining that in the legislation, we could have unintended outcomes.  The children who need care will end up in general hospitals, potentially, and I would worry about that.  The counter argument, of course, is that if we enshrine it that will force the State to put the facilities in place.  That is the balance that we have to think about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.536" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ber Grogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#Y00300"><p>On that point, the numbers have been reducing but it is an obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that we stop the practice of admitting children to adult units.  We are due to appear before the UN committee on the Convention on the Rights of the Child this year.  The State has to report back on what it is doing.  The State's draft report from last year does speak about the reform of the Mental Health Act as the legislation that is being brought forward to remedy this, so we are either remedying it or we are not.  Mr. Kiernan spoke about an ideal world and this is our opportunity to legislate for an ideal mental health service.  This is the once-in-a-generation, historic opportunity to put the legislation in place and then the State has to meet its obligations with the resources.</p> <p>  The Mental Health Commission's reports are so detailed and there is a huge amount of information there.  Kerry hospital was the one with the highest number of patients under 18 admitted to the adult unit.  Sharing the Vision discusses the move from children's mental health services to adult mental health services for those aged between 16 and 25.  Now we have an opportunity to say that there must be age-appropriate facilities for young people, children and adolescents, when they are in crisis.  If we specifically prohibit it now in this legislation, the State will have to do something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#Y00400"><p>I agree with that.  I do not think legislation is a panacea for everything.  Only last week we heard about the children who were failed because they could not get an assessment of needs within six months, as per the Disability Act.  There is legislation in place for that but it did not happen.  That said, including it in the legislation will put pressure on the Government to make sure provision is made.  I agree with Ms Grogan on that.</p> <p>  I feel like I am starting rows here today because my next question is on an issue about which the witnesses are contradicting each other.  Mr. Farrelly spoke about the independent complaints mechanism at a previous committee meeting and referred to it again today.  He said that he did not think it was warranted in relation to mental health treatment.  However, in its opening statement, Mental Health Reform refers to the fact that it has been highlighting the need for an independent complaints mechanism since 2014.  As I said, there are contradictory opinions on this.  I ask both groups, starting with the Mental Health Commission, to explain the rationale for their stance on an independent complaints mechanism.  I also ask the representatives from Mental Health Reform to touch on whether it goes against the principle of parity between physical and mental health.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#Y00500"><p>The Mental Health Commission is the statutory body required to oversee mental health services on behalf of the Sate while Mental Health Reform is an advocacy group.  We come from different positions.  My position would be that we should not establish something that accidentally makes one group look unique and in need of extra in comparison with everyone else.</p><p>The bottom line is that there are independent complaints processes.  If you go into a general hospital and something happens, you complain.  The core issue is that people are worried.  They obviously do not seem to have confidence in the HSE complaints process.  As we set out in our approach, there are lots of mechanisms to complain about people as a profession if you are not happy with how they do it, or there is the complaints process in the HSE, and then on top of that, the regulator.  Something that the committee could do is strengthen the regulations so that we scrutinise how the complaints happen.  That would mean that in a number of years time we would have data to inform another decision.</p><p> The third point relates to the Ombudsman.  If people make complaints in a certain area and they are not happy with how something is done, that could go to the Ombudsman, who could examine it.  To be honest, I do not really understand why an independent complaints process is needed.  If that is the case, we would bring it in for all health services across the board and not just mental health.  They are the main reasons.  I understand that when someone is in an institution, he or she is on his or her own and unwell, and he or she can be vulnerable.  There is a large amount of power and authority on behalf of the people who are keeping them there.  I absolutely understand that and I agree that we must invest more in advocacy services to support people and address the core issues.  However, I do not think enshrining in law a process that would not apply to the rest of the health service and would be just for mental health would stand up to scrutiny.  It sounds as though we are disagreeing - we are - but I understand that underneath the idea that people feel they want to be heard more.  They are potentially more vulnerable than in a general hospital, but for the reasons set out, I am not sure that we would agree that it is needed.</p></speech>

When we take a step back, we very much advocate for parity of esteem and that mental health needs the same prioritisation and investment that we see in the physical healthcare services and structures, but we must also have to the forefront the fact that there are key differences and those relate to the human rights of individuals.  In mental health, under law, people are deprived of their liberty for their own health journey, but that does not happen in a physical healthcare setting.  In physical healthcare, people cannot be treated without their consent in the vast majority of cases.  For us, that is where the core difference is.  When we look at other areas of Irish legislation that can deprive people of their liberty, for example, the powers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has, there is an independent complaints mechanism because it is viewed as being a core human rights safeguarding that needs to be there.  What we also look at is the optional protocol.  We have made the point to the Government again and again that it has not been ratified.  That is a key option for people who do want to make their voices heard.</p> <p>  I would like to bring in my colleague, Ms Grogan, because what would be most powerful at this juncture is that through our various pieces of research we have heard from people themselves.  Perhaps if she would like to come in, she would bring across some of the voices of the service users in this debate.</p></speech>

It is amazing when we think of this big piece of legislation with 120 heads that there is only a small number of things that we are all looking to be tweaked.</p><p>We always learn from Mr. Farrelly and his colleagues.  The Deputy would have heard from us before about our My Voice Matters piece.  In 2019, it was the largest piece of research done on people using mental health services and their family members, friends and carers.  It looked at their experiences with the system.</p><p> There were 786 participants in the family, friends, carers and supporters piece.  Some 81.8% of those said they had not been made aware of the complaints process.  Even though there are complaints processes within the HSE and within services, more than 81% of the family members were not aware of them while the person was in crisis and being treated.  They are getting that information.  Almost half of them agreed that the hospital expected them to be responsible for the recovery of the person.  Significant pressure was put on the family, friends, carers and supporters.  We completely agree with Mr. Farrelly's point on advocacy.</p><p> There are two reports on service users.  We have My Voice Matters for people using the services and a separate one for the family members.  Of the people using services, there were 1,188 participants and 41% of them reported a poor experience with the mental health services.  </p><p> Many positive things are happening such as national clinical programmes.  However, in the studies we have done and the engagement we have had with our grassroots forum and people with lived experience, the need for the independent complaints mechanism has been highlighted to us consistently, as has the need for increased independent advocacy services.  I have loads of statistics and percentages.</p><p> At our conference last week, Mr. Farrelly was one of the speakers at one of the sessions.  Of the contributions from the floor, a couple of people spoke about advocacy and complaints mechanisms.  These are people who are coming at this from lived experience, whether it is their family members or themselves.</p></speech>

Its representatives mentioned that the Mental Health Commission should develop codes and practices around the use of restraints and seclusion.

The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 puts restrictive practices in its place.  It is not a treatment; it is a restriction on someone's liberty, body, etc.  The Bill 2021 puts that in place.  In that context, we will review the codes and ensure they have an appropriate place.</p> <p>  I understand the professionals in terms of there being a huge cultural movement happening here.  The professionals understand that at certain times, in the least restrictive way, we may have to use these things.  However, they are not a treatment; they are coercion.  They have to be used in a very limited way.</p> <p>  A cultural shift is happening here and some professionals may be afraid that they would be liable for a change or that something could happen, as we traverse.  It needs to be done well.  I will hand over to my colleague, director of regulation, Mr. Kiernan, because we have significant research on this that may help.</p></speech>

The commission has provisions and powers to make rules for restrictive practices.  We welcome the amendments in the general scheme, which strengthen those and which, as Mr. Farrelly highlights, emphasise that these restrictive practices are not therapeutic and do not have a therapeutic effect and that a lot of the international evidence is that they can be harmful so they should be treated with extreme caution and used in the most exceptional circumstances.  We have already conducted a body of research to support this process and strengthen the rules on seclusion and mechanical, physical, chemical or pharmacological restraint.  We welcome the amendments that create a provision for all categories of restrictive practice.  </p><p> It is important that there is emphasis on this area.  There continues to be a large number of seclusions every year.  There are in the region of 1,800 episodes of seclusion and more than 3,000 episodes of physical restraint every year so these practices go on in mental health services that we want to continue to regulate.  We will bring out revised rules to govern these practices and make sure they are used in the most exceptional circumstances.  We welcome the provisions that are there under section 69.  We wrote to the Department last September requesting that further amendments be made with regard to chemical restraint, that this would be further clarified and that equal status would be given to all those category of restraint - chemical, physical, mechanical and seclusion.  </p></speech>

Dr. Morrissey and Dr. Charles O'Mahony undertook our human rights analysis on the heads of Bill.  Dr. Morrissey does a lot of work with the WHO on rights training.  In preparation for today and throughout the whole process, I have been looking more at this.  The WHO will publish new legal guidance at the end of this year relating to coercive practices.  The Council of Europe compendium of good practice on voluntary measures in mental health has examples of best practice internationally so there are loads of really good examples of how we can move away from coercive practices.</p> <p>  It is really welcome to hear Mr. Kiernan make those points.  According to the WHO, the value attached to coercive practices such as seclusion and restraint and the need for involuntary treatment in general is influenced by beliefs and habits rather than empirical evidence.  The really important point here is that evidence is showing that it can be harmful.  We need to move towards trauma-informed recovery-oriented care that respects the person's dignity and human rights.  </p></speech>

I will catch up with my colleagues and review this subsequently.  I know the Mental Health Commission is indicating that it is very opposed to the intermediate category of patient and believes it would infringe on the rights of service users.  If the witnesses from the commission have already commented on this, could they let me know and I will review their earlier comments?  There are obviously reasons why this is being reviewed so could they comment on it if they have not already done so?</p></speech>

We are hopeful that we will implement this Act later this year so <i>de facto </i>there is no need for the intermediate category.  We just need to be mindful that people with mental illness or a mental condition are not treated differently from everyone else in the mental health service.  We do not believe it is needed anymore.  I will hand over to our general counsel, Orla Keane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#CC00100"><p>I am also involved with the mental health tribunals and the intermediate category of person has been inserted into the section relating to the involuntary detention of people.  If you look at the general scheme, it provides that people can be detained on the basis of capacity but they do not have to meet the criteria set out in section 8.  In effect it is creating a new category under which a person can be detained.  Somebody is being detained on capacity grounds, not on the mental disorder requirement or the need to be detained for care and treatment which cannot be provided elsewhere and which will ameliorate their condition.  Why would someone just be detained on the grounds of capacity?  That seems to fly in the face of the Mental Health Act 2001 and it also seems to impinge on and potentially cause difficulties with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which deals with capacity.</p> <p>  When we originally received the heads of Bill in 2019, the intermediate category was not even in the Bill.  It was inserted later and we understand that was done because somebody was seeking to address some of the recommendations in the expert review group's report.  As Mr. Farrelly has said, that had been addressed by the 2015 Act.  Our basic concern is that the Bill is allowing somebody to be detained because of a capacity issue and not because of the basic criteria for detention, mental disorder or mental illness.  That is a concern for us because capacity is being dealt with under a separate Bill.  Sections 8 and 14 on the definitions of mental disorder and treatment, and Part 4; sections 56, 57, 60 and 66, all need to be read in conjunction with one another to understand how all the sections work.  It is difficult to look at any particular section in isolation because they are all so interlinked with each other.  I hope that assists.</p></speech>

Deputy Ward is gone and the committee is working on the report but members should be aware that the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill 2021 excludes people who are involuntarily detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 and those who are involuntarily detained under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  It is a lacuna we have been highlighting since we got our human rights analysis last October.  We have sent it into the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The officials working on the amendment Bill would like sections 136 and 85(7) of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to be amended in that Bill.  We have been speaking to those people but we are afraid that people who are involuntarily detained will fall through the gaps with the way things stand.</p></speech>

This is something the commission has flagged in the 2015 Act from the beginning because there has to be parity.  Our understanding from a week ago is that both of those sections will be amended.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Keane for that update.  I want to thank the groups.  A mammoth amount of work has been done and our Chairman has taken the lead in bringing our groups together and in providing the time for this legislation in particular.  I want to pay tribute to the team working with the Chairman as well.

I want to stick to two matters because a lot of this has been covered.  Ms Coyle mentioned that the Government should be ambitious with this Bill.  Mental Health Reform mentioned the optional protocol and I brought it up in a previous meeting.  That is what makes this Bill ambitious if we can get it in.  Everything would have to be based on the needs of a person.  One can go through any section of any Bill and it can be tweaked but I will go back to previous Governments and former Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  He fought hard for this to be ratified in the Disabilities Act 2005 but unfortunately it was not.  Should there be a line in this legislation that demands that the ratification of the optional protocol should happen on the day the Bill is passed?  Would that give strength to the optional protocol?  My fear is that it will not be supported because this Government and past Governments have not had the capability to provide the services that follow on from that protocol.</p><p>Mr. Farrelly mentioned advocacy, which we spoke about.  Mental Health Reform mentioned the complaints mechanism and the experiences users had.  That is important because people do not know.  I said in the last meeting that we are a reactive society instead of being proactive and when people are at their worst ebb the last thing they want is to be handcuffed by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because we do not have proper services.  As well as that, family members do not get the information on what will happen, what the protocol is, what the rules are or where the mechanisms for complaining are.  Mr. Farrelly also mentioned the expansion of community services and I have a fear there.  The Mental Health Commission has done work on recent reports and it is doing its job as it should but others are failing to step up to the mark.  I would have here the optional protocol in this Bill but should there be anything more on the likes of advocacy?  Should that be strengthened?  That is about it.  Everything else has been covered.  I am worried that the Bill will not be the <i>cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me</i>if that optional protocol is not part of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#DD00200"><p>We would welcome a recommendation by the committee on the ratification of the optional protocol.  Much of what is in the Bill is to be welcomed and brings us more in line with the UNCRPD but we would welcome that recommendation if it came from the committee.  The Deputy made an important point on advocacy because Mental Health Reform has been advocating and lobbying for a long time on the right to advocacy services and the current Bill does not provide that right.  The need to provide advocacy services has been a long-term policy goal going back to 2006 and A Vision for Change, which acknowledged that the person experiencing a period of emotional distress may not have the resources to advocate for himself or herself.  That advocacy should be available to all service users and mental health services as a right.  A Vision for Change also recommended moving to a peer support model.  There has been some progress and we have seen the Mental Health Engagement and Recovery Office established, but it is fair to say that we are still far away from a model of advocacy in the mental health services that people need and deserve.</p><p>There is scope to put that on a statutory footing within this legislation.  We have been calling for this for a long time.  People need supports to navigate the often complex mental health services and systems.  It is fundamental to the work of mental health reform.  We hear the need for it on a daily basis from those we work with.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.559" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#EE00200"><p>As for the Mental Health Commission, I cannot overstate the movement to community mental health services.  I do not mean residential services in the community.  That will happen.  Part of the Act will be regulating the residential centres in the community.  The phase after that, where there will be proper community services such that a young man or women in any town in Cork or someone who needs a service can walk out his or her door and get that in the community.  If such people become unwell, they will not need to be hospitalised because we will have the services.  They are about now.  St. Patrick's did them very well during Covid-19.  Full mental health services were provided to people in their own home, with the option of admission.  We have a long way to go.</p> <p>  In terms of advocacy, it does not always have to be in the legislation because the regulations can become more discreet and prescribe more specifically some of the things that would be required of service providers.  It may be that a person would have access to advocacy as required.  There are many ways outside of the Act to do this.  In regard to a protocol, that is a political issue.  We support anything that would help to improve our mental health services.  </p> <p>  I wish to emphasise the point that this is ambitious legislation.  If this legislation is enacted, we will be changing the mental health services in Ireland for good.  We will get to regulate these community services.  We will be able to look at them and assist everyone to make sure that the services are up to scratch.  The first thing we will do is work with everyone to produce standards and documents to know what a service should look like.  There is a great deal in this legislation  </p></speech>

As far as I know it is in the programme for Government and is being looked at, but to move that along.  It was in our opening statement that there are reservations on Articles 12 and 14 of the UNCRPD that the State put forward at time of ratification.  They water down our obligations under those articles.  It would be important in the true spirit of the Act to have those reservations removed from Articles 12 and 14.  Mr. Farrelly has just reminded me of the ambition and the change.  Shine did an amazing job before us of bringing the voice of people with lived experience.  I am well-versed in the UNCRPD at this stage.  Under Article 4.3, we are obliged to involve people in the making of policy as well, such as people with psychosocial disabilities.  It is not about us having these conversations without their input.  It is about bringing that conversation to people with lived experience, getting their input at the start, rather than handing them the new and improved mental health services.  If we do not have that input from the beginning - the committee has done a good job of making sure voices have been heard - we must keep that in mind for the whole process as we go through the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the Committee Stages.</p></speech>

I would be remiss if I did not mention this, even while we are talking about legislation to improve things - I want to refer to the Mental Health Commission's report, it can be anyone aged 16 onwards - we are still facing the prospect of closing mental health beds in community settings.  They are doing it in my town of Midleton.  It is ludicrous that we are being told that these services, once the numbers are gone that these services will never be needed again.  I keep going back to this optional protocol, because those people have rights and this is a rights-based issue.</p><p>If a place is not appropriate, then some other place that is appropriate should be found or the one that they are in should be improved.  Would that solve that problem without making any legislation complicated? </p></speech>

Everyone agrees that the HSE needs to be reformed.  We are on the record as saying the Health Service Executive needs to be reformed and that the governance needs to be better to roll out the Sharing the Vision policy.  The idea that a place is not well looked after or neglected for 20 years and then the person who suffers is the most vulnerable person, is not a correct way of doing business.  The Mental Health Commission does not have powers to regulate parts of the community where we could do an integrated approach.  There is no doubt but that people are suffering because of the governance and management in the Health Service Executive in certain areas.  It is unfortunate.  There is nothing we can do about that because we do not have the powers to do anything about it.  This legislation, if enacted, would give us more powers to have an integrated regulatory approach.</p></speech>

I want to come back to the complaints mechanism.  I will aim this at the representatives of Mental Health Reform.  Will they say a bit more about where they think the complaints mechanism should be located?  Where do they think that should happen?</p></speech>

There are complaints mechanisms in the HSE.  The heads of Bill before us provide for the approved centres to inform people about their complaints mechanisms but to us that is not workable.  That is not improving services and enshrining their rights.  It needs to be independent from the service providers.  For example in Sweden there is a personal ombudsman so if you have severe and enduring mental health difficulties and you do not have many supports, the personal ombudsman will work with you for years.  There are examples of supports throughout Europe and in other places.  Independent is the main thing, and for the under-18s, we are looking at everything from children in services, adults in services and the family members, friends and supporters.</p></speech>

Is Ms Grogan saying that children should be separate?  Should there be two separate mechanisms?</p></speech>

As Ms Coyle mentioned, there is the Policing Authority and the Garda has separate mechanisms for people to make complaints and have those complaints investigated.  We always have to keep the power imbalance piece at the forefront of our minds.  We can give people the information but until that culture change and until everything shifts and people feel empowered and listened to, we have to make sure there is a safe way for people to complain and that there are no repercussions or perceived repercussions on speaking out.  Niall Muldoon was in before the committee - he does amazing work with children - and it is about not putting the barriers of bureaucracy in place.  As Mr. Farrelly said, someone can go to the Ombudsman now but they must have exhausted all other avenues of complaints.  If you are not well, you are exhausted and you are using all your energy to recover and get through life day by day.  The last thing you want to do is take on complaints mechanisms. forms and fighting about having your complaint heard.</p></speech>

Dr. Fiona Morrissey sent it to me the other day and it is great.  It contains a map of Europe and you can click on each country to see some of the examples.  The UK has the No Force First initiative, Finland has a workbook of hospitals and wards and across Europe, there is an intervention called Safewards.  There are also some community-based interventions, such as the personal ombudsman in Sweden, which has been going since 1995.  There are mental health mobile units in Greece that go around the community and there are also hybrid approaches combining community and inpatient settings.  There are many places that are either trialling things or have been doing them for a very long time.  As Ms Coyle said, it requires the ambition and drive to move away from seclusion and restraint.  I have other examples that I can email to members after the meeting.</p></speech>

We have established an expert advisory group and have completed an evidence review in this area.  As Mental Health Reform has pointed out, some jurisdictions are trialling restraint-free environments.  For example, health trusts and health organisations in parts of Australia and New Zealand have tried to bring this in and are on the journey to bringing in restraint-free environments.  There is very much a move towards reduction and elimination.  At present, we are promoting use of the least restrictive interventions and that these are only used in the most exceptional circumstances.  The provisions in the new part of the Act that relate to restrictive practices, which the commission advocated for, are now much stronger in the sense of how they allow us to make rules to govern these areas to ensure there is constant scrutiny of them, in addition to a constant effort and focus on reducing and eliminating them.  The commission intends to publish its evidence review highlighting international best practice in this area.</p></speech>

We all want environments where staff and residents feel safe.  We want patients and residents to be cared for by people who feel safe in their working environment and who have the best possible chance of giving the best possible care.  Work environments needs to be safe for everybody but the primary concern needs to be that people's rights are not infringed.  There needs to be a mindset change in the way we look at restrictive practices.  They have to be only after every other possible alternative has been looked at.</p></speech>

What are their thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-05a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022040500002#GG00600"><p>We can speak to that.  We welcome anything.  We worry about this concept of a pilot so late in the day but we also welcome it.  If we look underneath, it comes back to the idea of resources being allocated for this to happen and to become integrated in the community.  It is just that these issues do not tend to be prioritised until something happens on the ground and they are raised in that context.  We hope the pilot will be expedited and rolled out throughout the country and that we have a pilot that works.  We do not need to have 27 other pilots in 27 other areas.  We should agree this is the methodology.  If we were regulating it under this Act, for example, we could use that information to set standards, we could roll it out and we could help monitor it.</p> <p>  I have noticed one thing.  I know there is a need for Government and opposition, but there is now a cross-party emphasis on mental health that I hope we can tap into this time.  I welcome it but there were also proposals for this a number of years ago.  I would like to see it actually implemented.</p></speech>

We very much support new approaches and new initiatives that bring together a multi-stakeholder approach.  While we note the HSE is important in the delivery of mental health care it is not, and nor should it be, the only actor.  We need responsibility for mental health to go across Departments and different agencies.  In saying that, at times we do very well in Ireland in having pockets of brilliant initiatives and brilliant projects across the country.  We never seem to be able to scale them up to a level that no matter where somebody is, whether it is north-west Donegal or Waterford, there is access to the same services and supports.  We always ask for a costed implementation plan to be rolled out for anything that is evidence-based, reviewed and seen to be positive to see how something that is positive and evidence-based will be scaled up.</p></speech>

I also emphasise that we have a collaborative group of people in Ireland who are acting in good faith.  I know that sometimes during these committee meetings it can look as though there are diverse opinions and a crash-bang, but that is not how it is.  Essentially, we have significantly good clinicians in Ireland who are making points, for example, about involuntary admission.  We respect that and we will work with them.  We have a lovely, high-intensity voluntary sector that I admire for the work it does.  Our health service is also trying to do well.  As a regulator, we try to be impartial but we very rarely get the opportunity to say that it is nice to be part of a process in this country where we can discuss things like this in a respectful way.  I thank the committee for that opportunity.  I wish it well with its report.</p></speech>

I thank everyone who has been involved in this process to date.  We have before us ambitious and transformative legislation.  The process included every conversation that has happened over the past six months, and even goes back to the work the expert group put in all those years ago, but if we are to deliver on this legislation it will take more than words.  It requires a cultural shift and for that to happen we need to have honest and frank conversations.  It has been wonderful to see over the weeks of deliberations a huge commitment to putting in place person-centred and human rights-compliant mental health services.  While we may have differing views on some of the detail, a clear narrative of support for the aspiration, vision and principles has come out of these meetings and out of the work various actors have done since 2014 and 2015.</p> <p>  The opportunity is now.  Mental Health Reform always pushes for all legislation to go as far as it can, to be as ambitious as possible and to enshrine what we can in legislation, because that enables us in the work we do in advocating for service users and for our member organisations.  It gives us a stronger platform to do that.  I say a big "thank you" for all the work that has been done to date.  I hope this is the beginning of a new chapter in our mental health services in line with the other conversations that are happening down the corridor around the assisted decision-making Act.  We can fundamentally change how people with mental health difficulties or psycho-social disabilities are viewed and engaged with in this country.

It has been wonderful to see that across the board, that the Cathaoirleach of this subcommittee has support across Government and across parties, as well as the support the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her officials have for the work they have done.

Unfortunately we have received apologies from Mr. Les Carberry from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications who cannot be with us today.  Members have been circulated with the briefing document opening statements.  I will shortly ask witnesses for their opening statements and then members will be invited to address their questions to them.  I ask them to please remember to confine their questions to five minutes at first.  If possible, we will come back to them at the end.</p> <p>  Before we begin, may I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with this direction.</p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary privilege practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements have been submitted to the committee and will be published on its website after this meeting.  I invite Mr. Declan Meally from the SEAI to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleague Ms Orla Coyle, programme manager, public sector and regulatory programmes.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to make my opening statement.</p> <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is at the forefront of delivering a low carbon economy through measures and activities focussed on the transition to a smarter and more sustainable energy future.  The SEAI is funded by the Government of Ireland, through its parent Department, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and the Department of Transport.  In 2022 our budget allocation is more than &euro;440 million.</p> <p>  The SEAI puts citizens, communities, suppliers, and other stakeholders at the heart of everything it delivers.  We focus on developing collaborative partnerships, strong engagement, and smooth customer journeys for the public we serve.  At the SEAI, we are acutely aware that the energy transition must be a just transition.  This is carefully considered across our programmes of delivery, our research, and our policy advice.</p> <p>  We provide expert advice to drive positive change through our analysis, modelling and support for policymaking.  We are catalysts for action through grant and incentive programmes we deliver and through our capacity-building processes with citizens, communities and the business and public sectors.  Pursuing our mission, we collaborate closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including Departments, State agencies, and the private sector.  We have had a major and transformative impact on the Irish economy.  In the past decade, our actions have underpinned more than &euro;1.2 billion in energy savings.</p> <p>  Ireland now has even more ambitious targets and we have been scaling up our operations to meet the challenge.  The SEAI is at the heart of delivering the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2021.  The plan sets ambitious goals for the built environment to 2030, including: the installation of 600,000 heat pumps; 500,000 B2 home upgrades; large emission reductions in our public services and enterprise sectors; and increased investment in research and innovation.</p> <p>  In terms of carbon budgets, every sector will have its own targets to achieve and will be held to account for allocations which are being defined in 2022.  Buildings contribute to 36% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, with the European Commission targeting that our building stock be zero emissions by 2050.  This target is the subject of European policy directives currently under stakeholder consultation.  The SEAI is working with our colleagues in the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Environment, Climate, and Communications in preparation for the changes to the energy performance of buildings and energy efficiency directives.</p> <p>These will include the following high-level requirements.  All new buildings are to be zero emission from 2027 for public buildings and 2030 for all others.  The whole life cycle greenhouse gas emissions will be calculated for all new, large buildings greater than 2, 000 sq. m from 2027 and all other buildings from 2030.  Minimum energy standards will be required on all buildings.</p><p>There is a requirement for whole lifecycle carbon assessments of buildings as part of green public procurement, and inclusion of lifecycle global warming potential resulting from construction for sustainable financing for buildings greater than 5000 sq. m.</p><p> We welcome the ambition emerging in these directives.  As highlighted through national and international research, as we reduce our operational carbon in our new building and the retrofit of existing building stock, the influence of carbon from materials increases over time.  SEAI has recently commissioned a research study investigating lifecycle carbon impact of new and renovated buildings.  It is hoped that some of the outputs of this research, including the development of lifecycle assessment methodologies and tools, will assist those in the construction industry.  In addition, SEAI has been tasked with the development of a standard calculation methodology under the climate action plan.  SEAI considers that there is also a significant role for green public procurement to assist in the task of reducing embodied carbon.  The public sector can play a role, setting an example, requesting lower embodied carbon solutions in any buildings and services procured in the future.</p><p> The way in which we live must change, but it will be a change for the better.  This change will mean our buildings will be warm, comfortable and not heated by oil or gas; our communities will be leading the generation of renewable energy; and our transport fleet will be electrified, charged by a renewable energy powered electricity system.  Sustainable energy needs to be the norm.  The quicker we achieve this, the sooner the broad range of benefits will flow to Irish citizens and businesses in the form of cheaper-to-run, warmer and healthier buildings, improved air quality, increased competitiveness, improved security of energy supply and many others.</p><p> The benefits of the sustainable energy transition far outweigh the costs, particularly when the multiple benefits, namely, financial, economic, employment, health, security of supply and environmental, are considered.  We passionately believe the clean energy transition must happen urgently and we stand ready to support all of Irish society on this journey.  Our approach is based on insights, research and expertise from two decades of programme delivery.  The challenges ahead require us to work at pace and to deliver even greater results, learning and improvements in collaboration with key stakeholders.</p><p> In concluding, I thank our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport for their ongoing support, particularly in the context of the actions assigned to SEAI under the Climate Action Plan 2021 and the national development plan.  I also thank the officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for their continued support to SEAI.  I welcome discussion with the committee and I am happy to answer any questions that members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

We are at a slight disadvantage, because the idea of these two sessions today and the session next week was in the context of what we are soon going to learn will be the sectoral emissions reduction targets that are relevant to this committee.  The idea was that we could have an informed conversation around not only how we reduce the operational emissions through the retrofit programme and other related matters, but crucially, the embodied carbon, because it is one of the bits of the emissions reduction debates that does not happen publically enough.  It is less controversial than some of the other areas, such as car usage or the national herd.  I think many of us in the committee wanted to be able to try an inform that public debate.  Obviously, SEAI's contribution is crucial to that.  We might try and see if it is possible to get representatives of the Department in at a later stage.</p> <p>  Irish Green Building Council produced an important report at the end of last year, as the witnesses are aware, on foot of some research it commissioned from the UCD School of Architecture.  If all the Government's targets and the work of SEAI and the retrofit programme works out according to plan, we will see very significant year-on-year reductions in the operational emissions from the built environment.  However, one of the concerning findings of the report is that because we are way behind the curve in terms of implementing new building processes and materials in the built environment to reduce embodied carbon, as the national development plan infrastructural development increases, there could be an upward swing in embodied carbon in the built environment.  We are particularly concerned about the area of housing.  We want to see as much housing being built as possible, but we would also like to ensure that the housing is built with the lowest possible emissions.</p> <p>  First, are the witnesses in a position to give us any information about SEAI's work with the Department and the Department's work with local authorities or the private sector to give us a little bit of a flavour of where those conversations are at?  It is a question that I would have asked the representatives of the Department, but they are not here.  I am hoping the representatives of SEAI have some information on that.  Halfway through his opening statement, Mr. Meally spoke about how the Government has some high-level requirements.  He stated that "All new buildings are to be zero-emission from 2027 for public buildings, and 2030 for all others".  Am I right in saying that refers to operational emissions rather than the embodied carbon?  I am trying to return the conversation to what it is, in the SEAI's view, as a society that we need to be doing to ensure that as we are building more homes, and the more the better, they are built with the lowest possible level of emissions.  For example, I looked at new residential developments sponsored by local authorities in London, and they are negative carbon.  They are not net-zero, or zero.  The overall embodied carbon and operational carbon are so low, with offsets provided, mean they are going in the other direction.  Are there discussions or conversations ongoing, or is there anything the witnesses can share with us in the committee around that?</p> <p>  Finally, it is the intention of the committee to produce some kind of report, making some recommendations to Government as to what we would like to see it do.  There are many members on both sides of the House who are keen to do that.  The specific areas of responsibility that fall under this committee include issues around public procurement.  Mr. Meally briefly mentioned green procurement earlier in relation to planning and planning law and public house building and the materials and standards we use.  If SEAI had a wish list, what would be on that wish list, specifically in terms of how we accelerate the move towards zero-carbon buildings, particularly with respect to embodied carbon?</p></speech>

I thank him for the opportunity, insofar as I can give him our own thoughts and discussions on some of the work that is ongoing.  My colleague, Ms Coyle, can talk about some of the work that is being done.  We are very conscious of the Irish Green Building Council report and the work with UCD.  We are also funding some other work with them this year.  The Deputy will know the phrase "what gets measured gets done".  The key thing for us, from an SEAI point of view and nationally, is really how we are going to account for this and what the accounting methodology is in relation to embodied carbon.  The task that has been set to us is helping to co-ordinate that over 2022 and to have a methodology at the beginning of 2023 in terms of how the embodied carbon is going to be carried out.  We have commissioned some research to follow on from that study with the Irish Green Building Council.  Hopefully, we will see the outputs of that coming to the fore towards the end of this year, in terms of starting to see what the methodologies will be.  A lot of work has been done and there are a lot of discussions internationally in relation to that.  I will refer to Ms Coyle on that.</p> <p>  I will skip to the Deputy's third question on the wish list.  I think the Deputy hit the nail on the head in respect of where the biggest opportunity is.  We feel that through green public procurement, there are tools there that can be brought in.  Again, a good concerted effort is being made across the public sector, under the green public procurement working groups, to look at how we can do some of this work.  We have a working group across the public sector where we started that debate.  We are sharing knowledge across that group.  It it about ensuring that it is not a greenwashing within a procurement exercise.  We must ensure that there are actually meaningful clauses within the procurements and the documents to say that this is what we are looking for when we are procuring our new buildings, and that the embodied carbon is a factor that is taken into account and probably scored as part of the procurement rules on it.</p><p>Ms Coyle will reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the targets.  It is on the operational side, but she might outline some of the work that is ongoing internationally.</p></speech>

Zero-emissions buildings, which relate to the operational side, are defined as very highly energy-efficient, with no carbon produced on site, so no fossil fuels, whether gas or oil, can be burned.  All the energy is supplied by some form of renewable.  That is the definition as set out in the energy performance and buildings directive.  As I said, this is under discussion with all the member states and the conversation is ongoing.</p> <p>  On top of that, there is an embodied carbon requirement, that is, a calculation of the embodied carbon associated with any new building, as part of the EU directive.  That is the second part.  The zero-emissions building aspect relates to the operational side and there is an embodied carbon calculation associated with that.</p> <p>   As for the conversations we have been having and some of the research - the Deputy referred to the IGBC report - we have seen at a European level suggests the retrofit work being carried out, such as the installation of heat pumps and the targets we have set for retrofitting 500,000 homes, is the best in terms of the overall carbon associated with building when the embodied energy and the operational energy are both taken into account.  As Mr. Meally said, we have commissioned additional research, which is ongoing, that will, we hope, be more Ireland-specific, so we will be able to take some learnings from that.  We also have a number of other projects ongoing as part of our national retrofit package that will allow us to get the right balance in what we are trying to achieve.  We are looking at when is the best time to install heat pumps in the context of the level of fabric upgrades that will need to be applied to the building.  There are ongoing discussions seeking to get the best out of the retrofit market.</p></speech>

The better energy homes scheme is probably one of the most popular schemes in my office, and I have some questions about the scheme and how it will operate.  What work has SEAI done with the Department and local authorities to ensure that near-zero, or negative, carbon approach is being taken to the new stock being provided, whether through AHBs or local authorities?</p></speech>

Over the years, for example, we have tested new housing designs and so on as we were proving building regulations and as they were catching up.  We are also involved in the building energy rating of homes and the energy performance of buildings.  There are ongoing discussions with SEAI.</p> <p>  As for the setting of the standards of new housing, we feed into that and understand what is there.  Part of our focus will be to try to ensure that as much of the retrofitting as possible will be carried out, because that will then use the housing stock that has the carbon embodied within it.</p> <p>  The other part of this, which both I and we as an organisation will be pushing for, relates to town centre revival and using streetscapes and areas above shops that are vacant and could be developed and turned into residential areas.  Again, there are opportunities in that regard where carbon is embodied within that.  That will involve refurbishment but it will bring on another form of housing stock and opportunities to create the living space within towns and to see that taking off.</p> <p>  In short, we are continually engaging, but the new housing stock is within the gift of the Department and its function under Housing for All.</p></speech>

Certainly in my view, there should be no fossil fuel-based heating systems in any new homes that are built.  There is no point in us having a retrofitting programme if we are building homes that, ultimately, will have to be retrofitted a second time.</p> <p>  To return to the better energy homes scheme, given it is SEAI that is appearing before the committee, it is an incredibly popular scheme.  The number of applicants in Dublin has increased from 177 to 400 a month.  Will the authority be able to reach those targets?  The timeline of waiting times for people to avail of the scheme has drifted a little, and now homes that previously had attic insulation are entitled to wraparound where previously they would have been excluded.  SEAI has a lot on its plate.  Has it identified the challenges relating to this?  There is also a programme whereby local authorities are carrying out very similar work.  It is often the case that SEAI's contractors will be working in one area while local authority contractors are working in another, and we might be better off marrying the two objectives in order that an entire road could be completed at once rather than having to wait for all the local authority houses to be done before moving on to the private homes, many of which are bought-out council houses.</p></speech>

Although it is not my specific area, I can give a general outline.  This year, more than 4,000 homes are scheduled and a budget has been given to us to address that number of homes.  It is recognised there is a challenge within the supply chain to increase the scale and ensure that can be addressed.  Nevertheless, on the basis of what we have with a panel of procured contractors as well as contractors working on other schemes, the challenge is that they were procured in 2019 and price increases have kicked in since then.  There is work to be done, therefore, and there remains the affordability aspect in regard to the price for what they can do.  It is full tilt regarding the budget allocated and the targets that have been set for SEAI, and we are on track to achieve them.</p></speech>

A project that began last year and is due to conclude later this year termed it the midlands project.  The idea was to examine housing estates as a group.  Some of those housing estates are owned by the local authority and populated by local authority residents, while others have been bought and still others comprise private renters, who may be in fuel poverty.  The idea is to get those estates into a group and, as the Deputy suggested, to take a terrace or a street together.  It is difficult because there are different forms of ownership but, from our early learnings through working with local authorities in the midlands, we have seen there are opportunities to build on that.</p><p>We must encourage work through communities.

We have heard about a situation where the climate gets warmer so we need more comfortable homes and offices that are better for the environment.  We have increased competition from a business perspective and improved security of energy supply.  That is the Ireland in which I want to live.  They have captured so well what we all aspire to, and what so much of the retrofitting grants and all of the different schemes that we are all working towards aspire to achieve.</p> <p>  I was interested in the comment: "Buildings contribute to 36% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, with the European Commission targeting that our building stock will be zero emissions by 2050."  Can Mr. Meally say what is best practice within the EU at the moment?  Is Ireland reducing energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the energy performance of buildings and complying with energy efficiency directives?</p> <p>  An issue that was alluded to here - it is, unfortunately, something we talk about regularly at the committee - is the price of inflation and its impact on the price of housebuilding and on the end product from the perspective of consumers.  Is there any estimate as to whether these regulations will increase the price of homes for consumers?</p> <p>  Mr. Meally clearly stated that the benefits of these measures far outweigh the costs and I completely agree.  I am interested in hearing the SEAI's perspective on how we should convey to the wider public that the benefits outweigh the cost?  I ask because we want to bring the public on this journey.</p> <p>  Interestingly, Mr. Meally said about tenders that we need "meaningful clauses within the procurements and the documents", especially in State contracts.  I agree with what Deputy McAuliffe said about the better energy warmer homes scheme.  Such a scheme goes down well with the communities that I represent, such as those in Clondalkin and Lucan, and in the context of one-off rural houses.  These homes will were built a number of decades ago and their inhabitants really see the benefit of the scheme.  They feel the benefit physically in terms of having warmer homes but they also see it in reduced electricity and-or home heating bills.</p> <p>  Mr. Meally spoke about a panel of procurement contractors.  It is slightly concerning to think how dramatically things have changed from a trader's perspective in a few years.  I would welcome his thoughts on how we can ensure that we have a really strong pipeline of construction workers to make those grants happen for the 4,000 people who are currently on the scheme.</p> <p>  Mr. Meally also referred to creating living spaces in towns by renovating spaces located over the shop.  The committee has talked a great deal about tackling vacancy and dereliction.  I wish to put on the record that there is a huge benefit for us to create these spaces, and also in the context of retrofitting.</p> <p>  I would like answers to my questions on energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and the EU and Ireland perspectives.  What are the potential additional costs to the end buyer because of the energy efficiency directives?  How does Mr. Meally feel we should sell this to the public?</p></speech>

Across the board, from an energy point of view, we are looking at renewables and energy efficiency.  In terms of how we fair with that and, in terms of renewables, there is renewable heat and renewable electricity.  On renewable electricity, we are at an average of over 40% in terms of the amount of energy that is generated from electricity.  That is one of the highest in the world.  Denmark and one or two other countries, in terms of where they are going, on average are higher but we are still well up there in terms of our rate of renewable electricity.  Our target by 2030 is to get to 80% on average every day.  On a day with high winds over 80% of our electricity is generated from wind and many people realise that.  We are well up there on the energy renewable side for renewable electricity.  We do not do as well with renewable heat, and the rate is quite low.  Other countries such as Denmark and the Scandinavian countries have district heating whereby they feed in biomass or woodchips so they have local supplies.  That technology is a big opportunity for this country in terms of retrofitting, and putting into larger cities and towns the opportunity for district heating, the heating of public buildings and using heating networks.  That is one opportunity.</p></speech>

Again, when one gets heat that is generated by the data centre and an opportunity to feed into the district heating system and local homes, it is a perfect symbiosis in terms of the two of them working together.  Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council have worked on district heating networks and Codema.  They have looked at these opportunities and are developing energy master plans for those areas.  These are ideal opportunities because there is a density of homes, businesses, etc., that can use the energy.  That is the idea in terms of planning forward.  We must ask ourselves can we have heat sources beside homes.  In terms of the future, we are not doing so well on heating but there are opportunities for us in terms of the way to go.</p> <p>  On efficiencies, we are doing very well in terms of the fact that we have set our public targets and energy efficiency.  We were the first country to set up an energy management standard.  That became a European standard and it is now a world standard.  I refer to the ISO 50001, which was developed by the SEAI in 2006.  It has become a European standard.  We are leading areas.</p> <p>  The CEO of the SEAI made a presentation at the International Energy Agency about our retrofit plans, which are seen as leading.  Other countries want to understand how we do this.  I mean how have we done 400,000 homes already.  Ireland is doing quite well.  We still have a good bit of catching up to do on the emissions side and reducing emissions but we have huge opportunities and have set leads in particular areas.  I hope that I have given a flavour of where matters stand.</p> <p>  In terms of how can we sell this to the consumer, the Deputy said it herself when she referred to the fact that the people in Tallaght and Clondalkin say the scheme is fantastic.  People sell the idea to each other.  The SEAI sees the best way is peer to peer or selling the idea to each other through community groups.  We have 600 sustainable energy communities who are teaching and lead the way.  They have shown the lead to local authorities by taking action themselves and saying this is the way to go.  It is about finding a way to say: "Listen, this is what we have done as a community group.  Come and see my house.  Look at the heat pump.  There is no mystery.  My house is so much warmer."  A resident said to me that they no longer wear an overcoat in bed.  It is the telling of those stories to the people and the neighbours and conveying that this way of life is a no-brainer and the way things should be.  We also have national campaigns but conveying the message by word of mouth is the way to go.  We can use our community networks and get the message out there.  That is how we should go about it.</p></speech>

I have read their statements.  How will the State implement the embodied carbon targets going forward and is there a plan for doing so?  I am glad to welcome all the witnesses here today.  I am a little disappointed that the Department official could not make it.</p><p>However as members know and it may have been discussed - I am sorry I missed the first part of this session - buildings are currently responsible for 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions according to the number I have to hand.  Of that, 28% is from operational emissions, that is, the energy needed to heat, cool, light and power them and the remaining 11%, according to my research, is from embodied carbon of materials both globally and here.  Embodied carbon emissions come from materials in the following way, initially by extraction through to manufacture, fabrication, construction, maintenance and end-of-life disassembly.  Moreover, it is important to note that the material at whatever stage of its life cycle has to be transported between all of the aforementioned processes. which adds to the embodied carbon load of any particular material.  From my research over the past number of years and in particular from meeting with various stakeholders throughout the country, Ireland definitely lags behind other EU jurisdictions when it comes to reducing our emissions in the built environment and in particular CO2 emissions.  While we have done really well with Part L and that end of it, the Dutch, the Danes, the French, the Finns and the Swedes are all in the process of preparing life-cycle carbon targets.  The term describes operational and embodied emissions combined.  It is that combined effort.  The UK is storming ahead with its London energy transformation initiative.  It is an amazing document and I recommend it to anybody to read.  There is an embodied carbon primer that goes with it.  It is a comprehensive protocol that aligns with the Irish Green Building Council&rsquo;s thinking on how we set targets on procurement methodologies to reduce embodied carbon.  </p><p> A transition plan is required and the best route, from my understanding of the construction procurement system, is through clear carbon targets.  This should be somewhat akin to the Part L energy conservation guidelines where we use the building energy rating, BER, code.  That is where we need to get to at some stage; I am not sure when that will happen.  </p><p> I had two questions for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications but I have changed them slightly so there are now three questions for the SEAI.   Has the Department engaged with the SEAI to begin the process of establishing embodied carbon targets?  Are the representatives from the SEAI aware whether legislatively these targets can be introduced by way of ministerial regulation?  In its opening statement, the SEAI noted it received &euro;440 million in budget 2022.  How much of this budget is allocated towards embodied carbon research and funding for pilot projects endeavouring to exercise construction methodologies and materials that reduce embodied carbon? </p></speech>

These are all good points.  I take his point on a transition plan being required in related to how it is going.  That is the way it is.  At the moment much of the work we are doing now, as I explained to the Deputies earlier, is understanding how to actually calculate the targets and understand what is it in terms of the embodied carbon.  I will let my colleague, Ms Coyle, talk a bit about that as well.  In regard to the embodied carbon research I do not have a figure in terms of how much would be directly related to it.  The research budget is between &euro;15 million and &euro;20 million of our &euro;440 million.  Some of that is going now to embodied carbon research, to the Irish Green Building Council, to do calculations in regard to the transition plan, on what we need and how are we going to get outputs from that to help us develop a methodology.  Ms Coyle can talk about some of the work she mentioned earlier that we are doing internationally and linking in because it is a European-wide issue.</p></speech>

It does not want to go ahead with that change in the construction product regulation as to how the embodied carbon associated with materials is reported at an EU level and then develop something in Ireland that might be ahead of the game.  We are in those discussions and we are involved with the Department.</p> <p>  In regard to the research that Mr. Meally highlighted, as he said we are starting to look at that process.  There are international standards around the calculation methodology.  We are trying to understand the implications and we have a research project that we commissioned this year looking at the impact of embodied carbon both on new-build and on retrofit and looking at sustainable materials and the impact they have.  It has been updated.  The Deputy talked about the 11%, we can bring that into the Irish context and develop the approach from that side.  We do not have a specific target as yet in terms of what level you have to achieve to proceed with construction.  That will be part of the research that is being carried out. </p></speech>

It would be the same calculation as is used in levels.</p></speech>

This is not a question for the Chair but it would be interesting to get an indication on how the Department sees these actions being enforced to ensure there is across-the-board compliance in the construction sector.  Does the Department think we need legislation to be effective beyond the Waste Management Act and Minerals Development Act?  I would be grateful if the Chair could ask the Department.

As I was late I was unaware of that.  I have a question for the SEAI.  There is a research study investigating lifestyle carbon impact on new and renovated buildings to be published.  Can I have an indication from the SEAI on when it envisages this report will be published?  The carbon intensity of new-builds and what we see in many of the developments coming through is that we have perfectly acceptable buildings with perfectly acceptable materials being torn down and new buildings being put in place.  For example Deputy &Oacute; Broin has done work on this.  Can I have an indication on when this is proposed to be published?  The proposed changes to the energy performance of buildings and energy efficiency directives provide that all new buildings are to be zero emissions from 2030 and public buildings from 2027.  In light of the IPCC report yesterday does the SEAI think it is too late at that stage to do that?  How does it propose we can move something like that along more quickly?</p> <p>  Buildings contribute to about 36% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions.  With the European Commission targeting their stock will be zero emissions by 2050, do we think that is soon enough?</p><p>Can anything else be done to bring that forward in terms of the intensity of the construction sector and buildings?</p></speech>

The report stated that we are in last-chance territory in regard to actions to be taken on it.  It is down to all of us as to how quickly we can react and as to programmes.  My colleague was explaining earlier that, even in terms of the embodied carbon, this is something that we are trying to collectively get our heads around at a European level, understand the methodology on it and how this can be taken into account.  I totally agree, and said it earlier, that where we can provide energy upgrades using the existing building stock, using the embodied carbon that is already in place, that is preferable to building new units on green field sites.  All of that should be something we can look at.  I think the Department is doing that anyway and working with local authorities.  There is an ambition to have decarbonisation zones.  These could be seen as exemplary in order to help fast-track how we can do things with different local authorities.  There is an opportunity to look at those areas to see if we can move things forward on it.</p> <p>  The targets that have been set are ambitious.  There is an ambition of reaching the 2027 target.  Everybody is working to so that we can move as quickly as possible.  On that research and the discussions at European level, we can move as fast as the data comes to us in the context of setting standards.  We have set a lead on that before with what we have done in Ireland.  Under the energy performance of buildings directive, EPBD, we were one of the first countries out of the blocks in getting building energy ratings.  There are always opportunities to try to speed it up but we have to work with our European colleagues so that everybody is on the same page rather than trying to rush ahead.</p></speech>

On the building regulations and the move to zero-emission buildings, a question was raised earlier about where Ireland stands.  Ireland is at the forefront in Europe in our building regulations and the targets we have for new buildings.  One can see from the building energy rating, BER, database that the majority of homes being built are using heat pumps or renewable technologies, and are highly energy efficient.</p></speech>

As others mentioned, some 11% of global emissions come from or are associated with upfront embodied carbon emissions from new construction, therefore, this area is hugely important.  Exactly as Senator Moynihan mentioned, I frequently see perfectly good buildings near where I live being fully demolished only to be replaced, quite ironically, with a building that is good in terms future emissions but, due to the construction and demolition, has been an environmental disaster.  Perfectly good buildings are being demolished along with all the embodied carbon and waste generated from that.</p> <p>  As to the statement that Ireland is at the forefront in terms of building regulations in this area, what is the situation with embodied carbon and building regulations in Ireland?  Is embodied carbon covered under building regulations?</p></speech>

Other European countries have building regulations in this area, such as France and Holland, and, as we heard earlier, many countries are speeding ahead in putting regulations in place.  It is probably not true, in terms of embodied carbon, that Ireland is at the forefront.  Would it be fair to say that we are actually behind other European countries in that regard?</p></speech>

We do not have a particular time limit or definite commitments.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about another area that relates to a written submission the committee received, which is public knowledge, so I am sure it is fine to reference it.  In the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022, there is provision for a new levy on waste recovery activities, a levy on materials being incinerated or sent to landfill, in order to create a cost associated with that.  We know that a huge issue around carbon and emissions in the context of construction is the waste of sending good materials that could be reused to landfill sites and not using them in a circular way.  The Government has committed to not applying a levy, for the time being, on construction and demolition waste.  As Deputy Duffy mentioned, if one looks at the transport costs due to demolition waste, let alone the embodied carbon, it is hugely significant.</p> <p>  The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was very clear in how stark the situation is.  It stated that this was the last possible chance to take decisive action on this.  My view is that there should be decisive action taken against people who demolish perfectly good buildings with lots of embodied carbon in them rather than renovating and retrofitting them.  If there is not a good justification for demolition, it should not be legal.  If the building is good, it should be retrofitted, renovated and extended where possible.  Is it correct that there is no disincentive, apart from the costs people privately incur, or policy that disincentivises the full demolition of buildings or construction waste going to landfill or being incinerated?  I would love to hear if the SEAI has any views on that whole area.</p></speech>

It is not within the gift of the SEAI in terms of the energy piece.  I would not even attempt to comment on the waste piece.</p><p>Obviously we are dealing with the public sector and also commercial sectors with regard to energy retrofits and energy upgrades.  Increasingly, the organisations we are dealing with and the investment community on the private side are looking at the investment case in respect of taking into account the embodied energy within a building rather just saying they will knock it and build from scratch because they can get X, Y and Z into it, be it extra floors or whatever.</p><p> We had our energy show last week and there was a specific area looking at this in the commercial sector, so it is getting much more focus.  We are certainly getting a sense that there are many more cases of looking at retrofitting rather than knocking and building.  We look at that across the board with regard to the programmes we have and in terms of encouraging it, to see if there is an easier way to decarbonise the building rather than knock it and build again.  It appears that the business case is coming more towards retrofit than knocking it when that is taken into account.  Institutional investment funds will take into account whether one is getting rid of embodied carbon and adding to a carbon budget one does not have if one is going to knock it and build it new.  It has become very much front and centre in terms of any of the large estate management companies looking at this from an Ireland point of view, and that is becoming an international trend as well.</p></speech>

Rather than just knocking and building a new set of commercial offices, can they do it easier?  It is taking all matters into account.  Do they change the facade of the building or do they keep the building even as it is?  They may have a higher running temperature but they will run a heat pump in it because they will be able to decarbonise the energy piece.  All of that is becoming very much front and centre in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if there is a plan.  There are actions within the climate action plan and actions that sit with us in terms of the methodology to be ready for next year.  That is part of the reason we are doing the research on that part of it.  It is not just with the SEAI.  Obviously, we will be working with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and others in tying that into it as well.  I hope that addresses the point.</p></speech>

When I was elected to the county council I brought up the carbon footprint for county councils when they are doing their works for the year and budgeting their works for the year.  They ask people their carbon footprint when they are building a house, yet our government bodies do not look at it when they are doing the budgets for the roads.  They often take the yearly budgets and might use a quarry 30 miles away when there is a quarry in the works they are doing.  If they use the carbon footprint, it would make sense that they use a local quarry that would have the certified stone.  However, they look at the bottom line, an accounting line.  They will say they are paying &euro;6 per tonne there for stone and it would cost &euro;6.50 for it from the local person, so the government does not do its own work either on its carbon footprint.  I have watched budgets being given by a local authority and the Government to quarries 30, 40 and 50 miles away from the project.  It comes back to "do as I say, but not as I do".  We can make all the regulations in the world, but if the Government and the local authorities do not look at themselves first why would one look at somebody else and try to enforce something that is not being enforced in the Government?  That is the fact.  I see it in every budget from the county council and in my own building.</p> <p>  I am still building every day, thank God.  It keeps me on the ground.  It keeps me up on a first-day basis with the price increases and transport costs across the country.  I see it at first hand each week.  I am a lover of older buildings if they can be saved.  If buildings are beyond repair, I am also for people building new sections onto the back of old buildings and keeping as much of the old structure as they can.  I also support materials that come from buildings being recycled and reused, but under the current licensing laws any infill that comes from sites must go to a licensed infill.  Much of this infill can be reused.  There are blocks, limestone and sandstone from buildings that are being taken down, but the criteria of the planning mean one must take them to a licensed infill.  That material is costing so much more to make on the other side, whereas it can be re-crushed and used on roads and for rebuilding stone buildings.  We can do a great deal of work with buildings that are being taken down, but the laws in place for the councils and for planning permission do not allow for this.  To me, it is common sense.  In addition, if, for example, someone wants the limestone from a property that is being taken down and that person moves the limestone to the other property, they will be in trouble with the county council because they are in receipt of imported goods from another site.  Again, this is perfectly reusable material that can be used on another site.</p> <p>  This is where I see it going around in circles.  I have experience of doing anything from extensions to hotel renovations such as Dromoland Castle and Adare Manor - I was involved in those projects - as well as industrial commercial projects.  I can see what one hand is saying and what the other hand is doing.  I would like to see the local authorities take a direction that it is not just down to price in their budgets when they are doing their roads or their retrofit building.  It is down to a certified quality material within the area where the work is being done and then it can budget out from that.  It might cost more locally, but there is less carbon footprint than in bringing stone 30 or 40 miles over already inadequate roads to get to a road that is being replaced.  I have raised this issue many times.  What can the SEAI do to bring that type of legislation for local authorities whereby they have to use the carbon footprint?</p></speech>

As I explained in responding to the last question, the waste area in the circular economy is under the EPA as opposed to the SEAI.  However, I see that coming increasingly to the fore.  Where it is coming more to the fore, and it is an area that is directly related to the SEAI, is through green public procurement.  I mentioned it in response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin earlier and we talked about it in terms of the opportunities that it is bringing.  Our remit with local authorities relates to the energy they use, but increasingly many of the discussions we are having with them are about the energy they influence.  That is the communities and others that are outside the boundary.  We have focused on their own emissions and the local authorities have been doing very well in the public sector in meeting their targets to 2020.</p> <p>  On the green procurement opportunity, the discussions started a number of years ago.  We feed into the green public procurement working group, in which the local authorities and public sector organisations are an active part.  They are trying to get their heads around how they score the likes of embodied carbon and carbon footprints in the contracts they are awarding.  That is an evolving body of knowledge within those organisations.  It is also something that is being driven directly because the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications also has the EPA in its remit, and the environment side of the house has a principal officer directly involved on the circular economy itself.  That is coming increasingly to the fore in driving the behaviours of local authorities and telling them what they will have to have as part of their green public procurement.  It will not be just green procurement but standard public procurement that they will have to look at this and take those areas into it.</p><p>That is where the influence will come.  In the case of the SEAI, the network we have created and the knowledge we are sharing through the public bodies, the public sector, local authorities and so on are intended to make them aware there is an impact other than just the financial one.  It is not just about the value for money and the bottom line.  We work with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, as part of this in the context of green public procurement to see how it can be scored in, valued and related in that regard.  It is a big lever that the local authorities-----</p></speech>

Going back in time, 20 or 30 years ago, the management and collection of waste function was given up by all local authorities but that is an important space for them to get back into, not least in the context of the circular economy, which is very important at the moment.  The vast majority of counties have no opportunity to upcycle paint waste, most of which is poured either down the toilet or directly into sewers.  We need to stop that, and the only way of doing so is to have a dedicated circular economy facility within every two counties, if not within each county.  The Employment, Development and Information, EDI, Centre, Longford is enthusiastic about this and has ambitious plans for it, but it is important local authorities be mandated to come on board and to support it with enthusiasm.  The Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022 is very important work, and while there is more to be done on it, it is breakthrough legislation that will, I hope, come to fruition later this year.</p> <p>  I am delighted to have our guests from SEAI in attendance, and in particular Mr. Meally, given we like to see Longford people in key positions.  Only last week, Ms Caron McCaffrey appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice.  Coincidentally, if Mr. Meally&rsquo;s parents look out their window, they can see Caron's office in the Irish Prison Service, so it is great to have him here.  We are very proud of the work Mr. Meally has done with SEAI.  He and his staff have put in Herculean shifts.  We are very much in the avant-garde compared with what is being done in Europe, and that came across during his presentation.  We are leading the way in many respects in this area.  Of course, we will always look for more, and we are here to challenge the SEAI to do more.</p> <p>  Turning to a couple of issues on the periphery, there is a backlog of getting applications and so on through the SEAI.  Will our guests speak to the measures they have taken to address that?  Can they give me any comfort in regard to what I can say when Mrs. Duignan rings me next week to complain about the length of time she has been waiting?</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here with the committee and, as he said, it is good to see Longford represented.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's initial comments, as I explained, the circular economy and waste and recycling are issues for the EPA but the Deputy may recall that a number of years ago, we sponsored a national competition for communities, Get Involved, and one of the winners was the upcycling centre in Longford, which was excellent in showing what can be done with the recycling of beds and other types of furniture.  It is great to see the centre go from strength to strength.</p> <p>  As for the backlog and the waiting list, I presume the Deputy is referring to the better energy, warmer homes scheme in particular.  Within that scheme, we have had a doubling of budget this year to allow us to address the backlog.  The recent changes to the scheme have seen an increase in the number of applications, but work has been ongoing, as my colleagues addressed in one of the earlier committee meetings, regarding the retrofit and the warmer homes scheme.  Much of the work we have been doing has involved working with the contractors to ensure they are getting back into action given, obviously, we were impacted by the Covid over the past two years, which added to the list.  In the context of the procurement we carried out, because contractors have been impacted by the price increases, we have done a lot of work within the SEAI to ensure the contractors themselves are geared up and that the maximum number of contractors are out there.  We will go through reprocurements and so on as well to ensure we can bring even more of them on board.   Much work has been focused specifically on that.  More than half of the retrofit budget, or over &euro;100 million, has been given towards the warmer homes scheme.  It is a major focus within the organisation, from the CEO down.</p> <p>  The other issue relates to the numbers.  We were processing 180 per month last year and have increased that to 400 a month this year in order to tackle the waiting lists.  That work is ongoing.</p></speech>

There is a strong focus on the retrofitting of local authority houses and the SEAI deals with contractors daily.  The anecdotal feedback we are getting suggests the average cost of the retrofitting of a local authority house is in the order of &euro;7,000 above what the local authorities have been approved by the Department.  Is the authority bringing pressure to bear on the Department in that regard, or does it have any involvement at that level?</p></speech>

As I said earlier in response to another Deputy, what we see as the Holy Grail is being able to work with local authorities such that we will deal with private homes and local authority homes in the same housing estate and try to get an entire street done.  We see that as an opportunity to reduce prices.  It is an area on which we are in ongoing discussions, both with the local authorities in order to sense-check their own prices in terms of what is coming back through the schemes, and through working closely with them to ensure we can get better economies of scale.</p></speech>

Within the market on the one-stop shop pilot last year, there were about 19 one-stop shop organisations.  They are now going through re-registration, but it is not that they have stopped taking on homes.  Four will have been formally registered on the website by next week and more and more will come on stream after they go through the formal registration process.  That has not prevented them from taking homes onto their books and developing their pipeline.  The formal announcement of the first batch of one-stop shops will be appear on our website next week.</p></speech>

I will start off on a positive note.  The constituency I represent, Cork North-Central, has seen a couple of retrofitting projects over recent years, in Wolfe Tone Street, Allen Square and Harbour View Road, where my father lives and where I come from, in Knocknaheeny, as part of the regeneration plan.  People who live in Wolfe Tone Street and Allen Square have stated they have seen a 50% reduction in their energy bills, with a much better quality of life, better heating, constant hot water and solar panels on the roofs.  There has been overwhelming positivity from the retrofitting.  In the case of my father's house, in Harbour View Road, the entire road was retrofitted.  This ties in to the point that was made earlier about joined-up thinking.  The majority of the houses in this Knocknaheeny social housing estate, or about 60%, are privately owned.</p><p>They were able to manage both the social and private housing together so that virtually everyone was done.  One or two decided not to do it, which was their choice.  It was a real success story.  The problem I have is that there are 10,500 social houses in Cork city alone.  At the rate that retrofitting is going on in Cork, it will be decades before the houses are retrofitted.</p><p> What we have now is a retrofitting plan that seems to work.  Originally, the first set of retrofitting was done in Knocknaheeny under the regeneration plan perhaps ten or 15 years ago.  Those houses need to be retrofitted again because the quality and standard of the work was just not up to scratch.  At least we have something now that we know is working.  However, from a funding point of view, two years ago, Churchfield, an area in my constituency of Cork, was to be retrofitted.  It is to be done now this year.  I know Covid has caused delays, but it has passed three years.  It got the go-ahead three years ago.  It takes too much time to get these up and running.  I have serious concerns whether the resources are in place.  There are many promises around retrofitting.  I do not believe the Government is delivering the funding to the SEAI or the local authorities to deliver the amount of retrofitting that needs to be done.  That is just the first part.  I will come in again.  Does Mr. Meally have any thoughts on that?</p></speech>

The scheme the Deputy mentioned in terms of doing the private and social homes has been excellent and one that we see as ideally to be modelled and reused in other locations by other local authorities.  It has been very good and successful in relation to efficiency as well as the end delivery, which we get from the residents themselves.</p> <p>  We understand there is a hill to climb with retrofit.  The supply chain is a big issue.  It has been identified countless times, and it was reported to the Committee on Environment and Climate Action this morning by my colleagues who are responsible for the retrofit that this area of the supply chain and getting the numbers of contractors and all that on board is an issue.  We need 20 or 30 of these organisations, similar to what Cork has, doing that kind of work.  The great thing is that are good examples such as that, showing this is how it can work and how it can work on a-----</p></speech>

The ask from the industry was to tell it that there is money there.  The Government commitment through the NDP and the national retrofit plan is that this is what we will do and it is here for the next eight to ten years in relation to an opportunity for local businesses and contractors to get involved in the retrofit game and show they can actually be part of it.  They may not be a one-stop shop, but they might be part of one.  The plumbers, electricians, plasterers that work under the umbrella of a one-stop shop can come in and work as part of that.  We work with the local authorities together on it.  The money is there in relation to the signal and under the NDP.  The supply chain growth is definitely, without doubt, a challenge.  That-----</p></speech>

I believe it is about 120 houses.  However, that is only a quarter of the estate.  Allen Square and Wolfe Tone Street were done, but Mary Aikenhead next door was not.  Now there are neighbours with half the energy bills, much better heating and much better quality of life living next to people who do not have it and might not have it for years.  We say it is not a funding issue, but if it is not a funding issue, why is the whole of Churchfield not going to be done?  There are so many more areas.  I am hearing on the ground that Cork City Council has done some very good projects, but there are 10,500 social houses, and that is without even getting into the SEAI scheme.</p> <p>  What I believe and I am seeing on the ground, and I was a councillor for 12 years before I was elected to the D&aacute;il, is that we have been talking retrofitting while there have been people who would have been on me to get their homes retrofitted who are no longer with us.  Unfortunately, there are people I am dealing with now who, by the time their houses get done, will probably be no longer with us either.  That is not right.  The Government needs to be much more supportive and there needs to be more funding for the local authorities.</p> <p>  Then there is the question of it all being contracts.  A decision was taken over the lifetime of recent governments to privatise work that local authorities are doing.  We should have our own local authority plumbers, carpenters and masons.  We should have our own people to do solar panels, retrofitting and insulations.  Relying on contractors is an issue.  I came from a working-class area and I know loads of guys who can earn more money without being involved in these schemes, and instead work on new constructions, whether it is building new houses or extensions.  Therefore, if we are waiting on contractors, we are in the height of trouble.</p></speech>

By the time they would be involved and trained up, however, perhaps a number of years would be lost.</p> <p>  The local authority budget comes from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and is not something that is funded through us.  Going back to the example the Deputy gave where we are doing private homes alongside local authority homes with combined budgets, that is definitely a solution and a way to go forward.  It is a challenge.  I understand the numbers of homes the Deputy is saying we have to address, which is a national challenge.  However, there are opportunities for us to grow on that, and that is what we have seen and certainly encouraged.  Even with the grants that were launched recently, there is a large number of people who want to get involved.  Word of mouth has spread that this is a very good opportunity to go for.</p></speech>

My other question arises from the briefing I had from the Department of Housing, Government and Local Heritage.  I know it is not fully Mr. Meally&rsquo;s bailiwick, so I am asking his opinion in the context of levels and the EU implementing the carbon targets and whether they will be A- or B-rated.  I know that is out there because I am working on buildings where we are trying to do a proof of concept building to find out where it is.  While it will be difficult to get it A-rated, we think we can.  In that, the message I got from the Department was that it will not be doing anything until 2025.</p> <p>  I am actually working on a building where we have a mechanical and engineering company that is processing the embodied carbon of the building through levels, through a software package called One Click LCA, which brings in all of the environmental product declarations, EPD, data and we are able to cost that environmentally.  What I find odd and what I do not understand is why the State is not doing anything.</p><p>I know it is not SEAI's remit but why are we not moving forward like other countries?  I heard that one pilot is happening.  I was not aware of it.  I have been arguing for quite a few years that the State should pilot building because from the research I have done, I know that if you do not know how to build it, people will not experiment.  You are lucky if you have a client who wants to experiment.  Is there any reason why we are waiting?  That is three years away.  I would often promote the fact that Ireland probably has the best operational energy regulations on the planet.  We are very close to having the best.  Is there any reason for our stalling?</p></speech>

We have been tasked with developing that calculation methodology or the associated software, which is where 2025 comes in because that is the timeline set out in the climate action plan for SEAI.  A possible reason for the delay is the fact that under EU legislation, the construction product database is being reviewed.  As part of that construction product database, there is talk of including an environmental certificate associated with it.  The concern is that if Europe goes with a different certification scheme from the one we will use - I know a number of voluntary schemes are in place for carrying out life cycle assessments and embodied carbon calculations - and we developed something that was counter-intuitive to what was done in Europe, it could have an impact.  We are waiting to see what is coming down the tracks in terms of the construction product database because we want harmonisation across Europe.  We have had similar issues with the BER scheme where you might have a product that previously would not have been accounted for under the directive.  We are looking for the test certificate that is in compliance with the eco-design directive.  You get people who are then trying to sell their product in Ireland and we are saying we cannot take it because we want it as per the European directive, so we need to get that harmonisation right.  This is why there has been a delay.  We are trying to see what happens with the construction product database and what the regulatory changes will be.</p></speech>

We take that information.  I am not 100% familiar with the construction product database.  For example, in the case of a heat pump, someone would have come to us and said he or she wanted to use it in a BER assessment.  What happens in that case is that we will ask it whether it has been tested to the eco-design.  In one case, the answer was "No" because it was slightly different from the heat pumps that are tested to the eco-design but we must still have them on a level playing field with all the other heat pumps sold in the country.  We must then get them to try to achieve the same level or standard or an equivalent standard.  When somebody with a product on sale in Europe comes into Ireland, we get it to test to a completely different standard.  It is about trying to get that harmonisation in the standards to which the construction product will be tested.</p></speech>

I am feeling slightly awkward because some of my questions are probably more for the Department, which is not represented.  I do not want to ask the witnesses from SEAI questions about matters that are outside its remit but I also do not want to ask questions that repeat what their colleagues have told our colleagues in the other committee today.  I will run through some of these questions and ask the witnesses to share whatever knowledge they have with us.  For those of us who have been on this committee for long time, tackling the housing crisis was our big priority for a number of years.  It was all about the number of units.  Thankfully, most of us have shifted and it is no longer just about the number of units but the quality, energy efficiency and carbon output of the units.</p> <p>  Since we have not been involved in the finer details of the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action, some of us are still trying to work out what sectoral carbon budgets would look like in real life.  Are the witnesses in a position to give the committee any insight?  I do not really want to know what the targets are going to be.  They will be decided by Government, which will announce them on the basis of advice from many organisations, including SEAI.  Could the witnesses from the SEAI explain what this new process will look like in plain English for regular folks like us?  I am of the view that it will fundamentally change the way people like us have been doing our work up to now and the better we understand that process, the more we can be properly informed.  If there is any information the witnesses from the SEAI can share with us, it would be really helpful.</p> <p>  I understand fully the need for European-wide consistency, particularly given that so many of our construction industry inputs are produced here.  That makes complete sense.  There are some really simple things.  We know there are new technologies to produce lower carbon cement, concrete and brick.  We know that it costs roughly the same amount of money and that concrete producers in Ireland have technologies to do both.  In the same way that we had a phase-out of gas boilers in houses from 2025 under nearly zero energy building, NZEB, we need to start having public conversations on the fact that we have the technology for lower carbon cement and concrete in this country and it costs the same.  Given that fact, should we not be looking for an accelerated phase-out of higher carbon concrete?  Is this part of the discussions in which SEAI is involved or the witnesses from SEAI are hearing from colleagues in terms of embodied carbon?  The reason I ask is that I agree it would be much better to use as many of the existing buildings as possible and repurpose, refurbish and retrofit and, where that is not possible, to re-use materials.</p> <p>  We also know what the Government's targets are.  The Government's housing plan talks about around 2,500 vacant and derelict units being brought back into stock through compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, by local authorities over the next four to five years.  There is talk of using another mechanism called Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns to get access to some vacant units but there is no real target yet.  On the basis of the targets in front of us, there will be nowhere near as many repurposed vacant and derelict properties as SEAI or many members would like.  For this reason, whatever the number of new builds, we need to try to reduce the embodied carbon in them.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on the issues around cement and phasing out higher carbon concrete and cement?  </p> <p>  Likewise with timber, Deputy Duffy, who has a master's degree in architecture and timber construction, and I have had a lot of conversations.  For five or six years, the Government has spoken about promoting new construction technologies and modern methods of construction.  A small number of companies produce very high-quality products here with embedded and NZEB passive and passive plus products but despite all the talk and hard work of a small number of people in industry, very little has been done on scale.  Again, I invite the witnesses from SEAI to express their views, concerns and frustrations about any of that if they are in a position to do so.</p> <p>  I have a particular, some would say obsessive, interest in building control.  We must have really good building regulations.  Our problem concerns monitoring and enforcing them.  The NZEB regulations came in for public and private buildings but I am still very confused as to how we are adequately monitoring them.  There is ping-pong between the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on which one is monitoring them.  Of course, we were told it would be a matter for assigned certifiers and building control.  Is anybody keeping an eye on the NZEB portion in terms of compliance separate from ordinary building control?</p><p>Is anybody looking at that?  Is it all going fine?  Are there concerns, etc?  </p><p> Last, on the targets, a recent parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications asked the number of successful applicants to the warmer homes scheme who have been waiting more than two years.  I have heard everything the SEAI has said on the increased budgets and the work they are doing do with contractors, which is welcome.  Obviously, there will be a clearing of the backlog and then there will be the new entrants to the scheme.  Can the witnesses give us a little bit more detail about how they hope to clear that backlog of 7,000 applicants?  This is if the SEAI has that information to hand.  If they do not, I can take it from the minutes of the other relevant committee.  We are all keen to see that work happen as speedily as possible.  Therefore, it is not just about meeting this year's targets, but last year&rsquo;s, and the years before that fell short.  Can we meet and then accelerate the targets, so that we can catch up over a couple of years?  Does that make sense as a question?  </p></speech>

Insofar as I can, I will address some of the general points.  I might let Ms Coyle take the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, piece.</p> <p>  First, the Deputy is speaking about the sectoral targets and the processes.  We collect the energy data from the top down from both public sector and large industry.  We feed it into our Energy in Ireland report each year.  We feed that into the EPA, whose staff will then compile the emissions.  They will then work with the Department to look at the sectoral budgets.  Our big focus straight away is the energy emissions in transport and heating systems in residences.  That is why electric cars and home retrofits are the big focus.  </p> <p>  Below that, then we are getting into smaller users of energy.  Obviously, we will look at the decarbonisation of the public sector and the commercial side of it.  One of the smallest energy users is agriculture.  Yet, its emissions in other areas will be looked at.  </p> <p>  We feed in the energy projections and the energy information.  That will go into the Department to look at how that works and how that will feed into the overall carbon budgets.  The Deputy is right.  It will fundamentally change how the people will appreciate it when we talk about &ldquo;a budget&rdquo;.  It will change how they look at things and how they consider, &ldquo;What is my budget?&rdquo;, as well as whether the budget is in the enterprise sector or in the public sector.   It will give a whole new focus to the area.  As I said, in our space, we are feeding the energy projections into that and working on them.</p></speech>

It is not even about the individual sectoral targets.  For many of us who do not spend the vast majority of our working time dealing with, for example, climate and emissions reductions, when we hear words such as &ldquo;budget&rdquo;, we think of financial budgets.  We think of the allocation of money and how that money is divvied out among a set of State agencies, who then spend it.</p> <p>  My question is more to try to conceptually understand how there will be a macro target.  There will be sectoral targets.  How will they then relate to the work of Government, Departments, agencies like the SEAI, and other third actors, public or private?  It is just trying to understand that, even without reference to any particular sector.  An agency like the SEAI, which is involved in this every day, probably has a better conceptual understanding of how that will be shaped or what it will look like.</p></speech>

We do have any of the details on some of the ongoing discussions.  That will be part of the work over this year and over the next couple of months in talking it through.  I do not have the visibility below that.  As I said, we are feeding in on how we would work through it.  They will be allocated their budget and will have to work to that.  Is it a five-year budget?  Is it a three-year budget?  Those kinds of things obviously have to be worked out.  Is it by the overall sector or is it by individual organisation?  Those things will be worked out generally.  In the public sector I think it will be one budget overall.  Then it will be divvied out over time.  However, it is a work in progress, so I do not have any more detail than that.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s next part on the opportunities around cement and concrete, there are a number of opportunities.  There is low-emissions cement and lower-emissions cement.  These can be considered in specific construction areas.  There are also case studies where there could be too much cement used.  There may be better ways and tighter specifications on cement and concrete being used there.  This goes back to the education of those who are creating specifications through green procurement, and for procurement that sets out those parameters.  As the Deputy said, in some cases, there is an opportunity where a lower-emissions cement can be used, because of the opportunities around it.  There could be brittleness, etc.  There are different characteristics.  However, there is no doubt that it can be brought into the procurement piece and specifically specified in respect of new buildings.  However, again, our piece will still be to push for as much retrofit as possible.  </p> <p> The Deputy talks about the use of timber in promoting the modern methods of construction.  A group has been chaired and brought together under the Department of Expenditure and Reform-----</p></speech>

However, we have worked with our colleagues in the national building control office how to demonstrate NZEB through the calculation methodology used for a BER assessment.  We have strengthened the report that gets published from the BER process so that it is watermarked and is linked to a BER assessment.  This is so that the building control officer can say, &ldquo;Yes, that is a published BER&rdquo;.  Then, when we link that back to the BER side we have a rigorous group quality assurance, QA, process on our BERs.  We go out to the homes or to the buildings and make sure that all the inputs are accurate and that they reflect what is happening.  We have that link.</p> <p>  We improved the output from the BER software so that the building control officer could link it back to a BER assessment and so that they now know that that is a published BER.  It is then audited as a separate side.</p></speech>

When they get the report, they will get a printout.  When someone is submitting a compliance report they can ask for report that is printed out from the BER assessment.  They will be able to say that that is a published BER.  What we found previously in our conversations with the office's staff is that they were getting reports that might not have related to a BER that was published.  Therefore, then there was no check on that BER.  We had additional step.  That was the work we do with the national building control office.</p></speech>

Our colleagues this morning provided quite a comprehensive piece.  As I responded to Deputy Flaherty, we were on 180 homes per month last year.  It has gone up to 400 homes per month that we are dealing with this year.  This is getting through the backlog.  I defer to the work that they have been doing.  There is much work that has been going on behind the scenes.  They gave much more detail to the committee on that.</p></speech>

One would never get 100% CEM III; one would only ever get 20%.  We could probably get more because we are a small country, but in this context one is locked in.  It is about reducing the use of concrete and using other methodologies of construction.</p> <p>  I refer to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's remarks on post-occupancy testing.  There is a system in Australia under which the rating is done one year after occupancy.  Many of the corporates are pushing in that regard.  It is a six-star system.</p></speech>

We will be looking at it on a building level so that we will know the exact energy for each public sector building rather than as an entity.  At the moment, we have some building-level data but much of it is at a sectoral or departmental level.

There was a building on Baggot Street that was famous for its energy per square metre.  As architects, we were told to have a look at the rating because it was massive.  It was 600 kWh or 700 kWh per sq. m.  It was through the roof.  The rating was seen as a bit of a joke but that level of energy consumption does exist.</p></speech>

There were two separate budgets.  A road on a housing estate was resurfaced, with speed ramps to be installed there 12 months later.  I refer to the carbon footprint that is being caused by the initial resurfacing and doing jobs twice.  All Departments and local authorities must be responsible and not waste resources on double-jobbing, with the consequent impact that has on the environment and our carbon footprint.</p> <p>  That came to mind when Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to the fact that there are between 70,000 and 98,000 vacant properties in the State.  The Government missed an opportunity to tackle this problem when it dealt with vacancy recently.  There are vacant buildings all over my constituency.  Mr. Meally referred to this earlier.  Local authorities should go in to retrofit those properties and turn them around so that they can be used for housing, or funding should be provided to housing agencies so they can do so.  We are talking about our carbon footprint and carbon budgets but there are between 70,000 and 98,000 vacant properties.  The census carried out last Sunday will provide a lot of good data.  We know this is an issue in every village, town and city in every constituency.  Mr. Meally referred to vacant properties and shops and what have you.  We have been talking about it for ten years.  Cork City Council was talking about it 15 years ago.  Here we are now.  There are people talking about problems with insurance, deeds and fire safety certificates.</p> <p>  Mr. Meally stated that in some ways Ireland is leading the way and that we are leaders in terms of some of the work we are doing here.  In the context of the report published yesterday on global warming and where we are in the context of climate change, if Ireland is leading the way, the world is in big trouble.  That is putting it politely.  From where I am sitting, Ireland is not leading the way.  We might have a couple of good ideas and projects but on the greater scale of things and in the context of delivery, we have a housing crisis and a climate crisis.  If we sort out derelict buildings and vacant properties, that will help to solve the housing crisis.  It is a win for everyone.  I have been raising this for two years here with the Minister and the Department.  I raised it for 13 years before that as a councillor.  In 2009, I made my maiden speech on Cork City Council on the issue of the housing crisis and I was laughed at.  We are now in 2022, 13 years later, and the crisis is much worse.  Mr. Meally referred to vacant properties.  I do not believe enough is being done.   I attend the meetings here and I do work on the ground.  I do not see enough being done in respect of vacancy, trying to retrofit vacant properties and providing funding for local authorities to issue compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, for these properties and then retrofit them.  The Government recently published a Bill.  To me, that Bill was not alone a missed opportunity; it was a disaster for both the climate and housing.</p></speech>

That is evident from the report to which he referred that was published today.  I refer to there being three years in terms of whether we do something in respect of moving.  We have to fundamentally rethink how we live and operate and how we use energy across the board, including how we heat our homes, move around and generate electricity.  We have reached a point where we have to put every shoulder to the wheel to understand how we are actually going to do this.</p> <p>  I am totally behind what the Deputy has said in respect of vacant properties and using town centres.  Having people living in town centres brings life in those communities and cuts down on people's need to use cars to move around as they can walk to schools and all that.  It will not happen overnight but we now know clearly that we are running out of time for what we need to do.  We cannot just keep doing things the way we have been doing them.  I totally agree with the points made by the Deputy.  Everybody, including local authorities and others, will have to start thinking together and joining the dots.  As he stated, there should be no double-jobbing.  We should not be looking at creating urban sprawl and building more out further so that more cars are needed and services have to be run to those places.  We have to change our thinking right across the board.  There is a significant opportunity, in the context of embodied carbon if nothing else, to get people living in towns and villages, particularly with the advent of working from home.</p><p>That is a fundamental opportunity.  It will challenge our thinking in the context of those who want a house on their own plot out in the countryside.  We will have to rethink what we are doing.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Miriam Hughes, chairperson designate of Bus &Eacute;ireann, who is appearing remotely.  She is very welcome and I thank her for her forbearance.  We are having difficulties with the connection to Mr. Gary Owens, chairperson designate of Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath.  We hope he will be able to join us at some stage during the meeting.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member participating via MS Teams prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members and all those in attendance in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I now call Ms Hughes to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I have been asked by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to accept this position and it is my privilege to attend the committee as chairperson designate of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I look forward to sharing perspectives with the committee on how we can continue to grow and widen access to public transport for all in Ireland.</p> <p>  I will begin by telling the committee a little about myself.  I was appointed to the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2019.  Since I joined I have, in addition to my normal duties, served as a member of the audit and risk committee, been chair of the safety and accessibility committee and been a member of the sustainability committee and the overall strategy committee.  Prior to this, I was CEO of DDFH&amp;B, which is Ireland's largest communications group.  Over 17 years, I led this business through significant growth and transformation and radical business changes.  Until recently I was chair of Barnardos Ireland.  I am a mentor on the Enterprise Ireland panel.  I am a non-executive director of Eir and a non-executive director at Pluto, which is a creative agency.  I am a graduate of UCD with a B.Comm and an MBS in marketing.  I have served as president of the Marketing Institute of Ireland.  I was a member of the Dublin Chamber council and the Irish Management Institute council, and I was chair of the Association of Advertisers in Ireland.  These experiences have all been very beneficial.  They provide me with a strong background to build on Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s great heritage and work to make it more progressive and customer-focused, delivering real value for the State.</p> <p>  Members are all very familiar with Bus &Eacute;ireann but for completeness I will provide a brief overview of the company.  Bus &Eacute;ireann was established in 1987 as Ireland's national bus company.  The company operates city services for Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, town services for Athlone, Balbriggan, Drogheda, Dundalk, Navan and Sligo, and rural and regional services.  These are all under contract with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Despite changes in commuting and travel patterns arising from Covid-19, with the numbers badly affected, we anticipate future growth given the NTA's transformative strategies, including Connecting Ireland and BusConnects in Cork, with Galway, Limerick and Waterford to follow.</p> <p>  It is encouraging to note that many of our PSO services in regional cities and towns have already recovered.  We are probably up to approximately 80% of pre-pandemic passenger numbers.  Overall, I am optimistic about passenger growth.  Bus &Eacute;ireann will have to compete for many of its contracts but fundamentally I believe these plans will radically improve public transport provision throughout the country and can be achieved within a comparatively short and cost-effective implementation phase. </p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann also runs a commercial business, Expressway, on 14 intercity and interregional routes.  Notwithstanding the collapse in passenger numbers that occurred during the pandemic, and in recognition of its essential service for essential workers who in the main had no alternative form of transport, we continued to operate Expressway routes throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>This commitment by the board significantly impacted the reserves of the company, but following approval of a new plan, we are now implementing actions to ensure these 14 routes are sustainable.  Our focus now is on rebuilding this business and increasing customer confidence.  Major markets, such as third level education and airport travel, diminished significantly over the past two years, but thanks to Government support for commercial operators, granted through the National Transport Authority, NTA, Expressway has survived and customers are returning.  We have probably reached about 75% of pre-pandemic levels.</p><p> Last, but by no means least, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department of Education, a commitment dating to the scheme's inception in 1967.  This is the largest school transport scheme in Europe, with 122,000 children being brought to and from school every day.  Many members will be acutely aware of just how vital this service is, especially in rural Ireland, and of the important role it plays in reducing car journeys, congestion and facilitating workforce participation for parents.  The school transport scheme is just as relevant to society today as it was in 1967, though for different reasons.  We look forward to contributing positively to the Department of Education's review of the scheme currently under way and to bringing this scheme to many others.</p><p> What does all this mean?  Putting all the elements together, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the most extensive and varied public transport network in the country.  In 2019, we facilitated 89 million passenger journeys.  We covered 82 million km directly and subcontracted a further 110 million km, and these journeys were delivered by our 2,700 valued employees.  It is appropriate to take a moment to commend especially our customer-facing staff for the commitment they displayed throughout the Covid-19 pandemic in maintaining the availability of transport to so many.  This is a great responsibility.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has set itself the goal of being the most customer-focused and sustainable public transport company in Ireland.  Real transformation is under way in every part of this company, as well as a modal shift in how we provide transport for Ireland.</p><p> There could not be a more exciting time to be in public transport.  Positive change is coming on many fronts, and public transport offers solutions to some of Ireland's most urgent and critical priorities.  These include the climate action plan and Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the national development plan objectives, including compact growth, enhanced regional accessibility, strengthened rural economies and communities, sustainable mobility, the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient society and access to quality childcare, education and healthcare; improving air quality in cities and towns; and, not least, improving well-being and quality of life for people throughout Ireland.</p><p> Technological innovation is a major agenda for us.  This will see us move from a fleet of vehicles with diesel-fuelled internal combustion engines to a fleet of zero and low emission vehicles powered by electric, hydrogen and hybrid engines.  This will require new training for 300 craftworkers and a major reconfiguration at our depots, as well as more sophisticated management information systems.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is also working in a focused way to make up for years of underinvestment in information technology.  A large-scale new booking system has been rolled out on Expressway routes, major transformation projects, funded by the NTA, are under way, and we see enormous opportunities flowing from the introduction of new ticketing technology to our vehicles, particularly in the context of the school transport scheme.</p><p> There are always challenges to be faced.  As a bus operator, our vehicles must share the roads safely with other users, including cyclists, pedestrians, scooter users and private cars.  Congestion is a major challenge for us operationally, especially the lack of enforcement of laws to prevent people parking at bus stops.  Additionally, there are only 30 km of bus lanes outside Dublin.  Attitudes and behaviours must shift to enable buses to offer ultra-reliable, frequent and punctual services.  This, in turn, will help people to choose to use the bus in preference to their cars.  Fuel prices are a concern as well, bringing greater impetus to our transition to a zero and low emission fleet.  While Bus &Eacute;ireann was fortunate to have hedging in place for part of our fleet, we are extremely conscious of the impact of higher fuel prices on the general economy.  Cost-of-living pressures are a major challenge.  We also hope, however, to bring a focus in this context to public transport as being a practical, reliable and genuine alternative to owning a car, especially in regional cities and towns.</p><p> As chairperson of Bus &Eacute;ireann, I will mainly focus on three things.  The first is achieving financial stability and ensuring the company can plan for and invest in the future.  To a great extent, Bus &Eacute;ireann is a purpose-led organisation, but providing best-in-class customer experience, safety and sustainability requires continual investment and a longer time horizon to allow resource planning and investment in our fleet and facilities.  Second, we will support the NTA's ambitious plans for BusConnects in the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, as well as in transforming rural public transport through the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan.  These are step changes in the delivery of public transport, and Bus &Eacute;ireann will be ready with the people, technology and systems to bring them into operation as smoothly and quickly as possible.  Finally, we commit to delivering on Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s 2030 sustainability goals.  These are broad, including climate action, a continuing focus on being a great place to work, having a strong customer focus, improving diversity and inclusion and increasing the accessibility of our services to people with disabilities, as well as, of course, developing the organisation and maintaining our corporate governance standards.</p><p> I am honoured to have been chosen for this role.  Public transport matters more than ever.  Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s services, and our people who deliver them, can make an enormous impact on communities throughout the country.  I look forward to working with all our stakeholders to deliver high standards of excellence throughout our business and to expand our network to meet our future needs.</p></speech>

There are different stages of development in this context.  We have reached about 75% of potential capacity now and we are constantly reviewing this.  Equally, we have received commercial bus operators direct award contract, CBO DAC, support from the Government until the end of June.  All these routes have been constantly appraised.  Our intention, though, is to get all those routes back to full viability.</p></speech>

The commercial viability of all these routes was estimated on that basis.  The support from the Government is very welcome because we are now operating at only 75% of those estimates.  It is allowing us to continue on this basis, but we are reassessing this situation continually.  We also have a new three-year plan, but that relies on passenger numbers recovering.</p></speech>

It has been recognised that the numbers are still working their way back up.  Ideally, to the end of this year at least.  Obviously, things such as third level education have not come back to full capacity and nor have airports.  Those would have been two big contributors to passenger numbers.

We are closely linking with the Department on it.  Currently, we are at 75% but we would have been back at 50% at one stage.  There is some recovery evident.  We are at 80% on some of the PSO services, or between 80% and 85%.  So we are encouraged that numbers are coming back.  With travel over the summer and, ideally, universities coming back into play, we would like to think that there will be a greater recovery in passenger numbers.  We are working very closely with the Department of Transport on the matter and linking in with it every month in respect of numbers.  I would like to think that will be a continued engagement.  It is likely that we would seek further support, certainly into September-October.</p></speech>

Does Ms Hughes see fare increases or that they would be maintained at the current rate?</p></speech>

We would like to think that has been extended to us.  Our information would say that it is.  It is the next period after that which will have to be taken into account.  For the short term, it is at least helping us with stability and understanding the sustainable level that we have on finances.  It gives us some security.  I am very conscious that our school bus drivers, the contractors, do not necessarily have the same certainty behind them with fuel.  We have been talking to the Department of Education about that and how we ensure that they remain supported.</p></speech>

There is a situation where Bus &Eacute;ireann will run some of the routes.  There are quite a lot of school bus services out of Limerick.  The staff are excellent.  We deal with them virtually daily.  They are always trying to be accommodating.  There might be a school bus that is driven by a Bus &Eacute;ireann driver and yet a private bus could be running side-by-side covering neighbouring routes and one is much more exposed to fuel costs than the other.  Is Bus &Eacute;ireann is looking at some way to, say, share fuel supplies for that period?</p></speech>

We are in constant negotiation and conversation with the Department of Education because we run that service on its behalf.  We are working closely with the Department to try to see what support, if any, is possible.  That is an ongoing conversation and as we get into the return of the school year it will become heightened for those contracted drivers.</p></speech>

Guests from the Irish Coach Drivers Association were witnesses to the committee.  They are struggling badly with school bus runs and they were looking at particular measures that could be brought in.  It is something we are following up on with the Minister.  Is there active engagement between Bus &Eacute;ireann, the bus drivers and the Department?</p></speech>

There is active engagement.  Some 90% of these routes are run by contractors and they are important to the delivery of the service so we take it seriously.  The Department of Education has a lot of sympathy and it is conscious of this impact.  It is an ongoing conversation and one we are actively engaged in.</p></speech>

I know Bus &Eacute;ireann is administering it apart from the Department of Education.  Maybe it is something Bus &Eacute;ireann could look into.  One aspect would be to see if some benefit from hedging could be given to the private school bus operators and more particularly that some mechanism could be put in place with the Department of Education to compensate in some way for the increases in fuel costs, which are quite extreme as Ms Hughes will appreciate.  Are the fuel prices hedged at a pretty good rate?</p></speech>

Not all have the opportunity to come into the depots but it is a good point and one we would actively engage with again to see what the potential of it is.  It is also based around the fact that the fuel is delivered through our depots.</p></speech>
