    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121800002#F00200"><p>I am at the back end of having had 'flu so if my voice begins to break members will understand the reason for it.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this opportunity to address them.   As they will be aware, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment telephoned me a few weeks ago and asked if I would be willing to act in the capacity of a just transition commissioner in regard to the midlands.  Up to that, I was not altogether very much aware of the debate that had gone on in terms of just transition in its wider sense but I was aware of what was happening in the midlands regarding both the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, as the two major State companies involved in the area.  Since that telephone call, I started some of the preliminary work that I consider necessary to do.  That has been limited in scope because of the time available but I have managed to begin to meet most of the main players involved, namely, the Minister, and his departmental officials.  I have further meetings arranged with them early in the new year and also with the cross-departmental team in the Department of An Taoiseach.  I have had a meeting with the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, regarding the research being undertaken by it on the issue of just transition both on what is required in terms of Irish climate change policy and on what may be happening, particularly in Europe, and the projects and policies being adopted in Europe.  I have received voluminous documentation from them, which I hope to read at some stage over Christmas.  I have just dipped in and out of it in terms of the technology, scope, policy, direction and the issues not only in Ireland but in Europe.</p> <p>  My first belief on getting this role was on the need to begin to meet the main players involved.  I had a long meeting with the chief executive of Bord na M&oacute;na and his senior management team on their plans and what they were doing in response to the decision of the ESB and other ongoing issues with respect to plans they had in anticipation of decisions further down the line towards 2027, which now need to be brought forward with a greater degree of urgency.</p> <p>  I had a discussion with the chief executive of the ESB.  We have not been able to arrange a meeting but are scheduling one for the first week of January with his senior management team to get their view on their decision, their continuing existence in the midlands, the industries that continue to operate there and what potential exists there.</p> <p>  I have also been in contact with and have received correspondence from the group of unions represented by Willie Noone, whom I would have known  in a previous capacity when I was director general of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and Patricia King.  Even though industrial relations are not directly within my remit or terms of reference, I see it as being important to meet the workers and their representatives in the context of what is happening there.</p> <p>  One of the big issues I raised with the Minister when I met with him was the type of support I would get for this project to immediately start running with this.  My view was that I needed some support around secretariat arrangements and meetings but, more importantly, around people on the ground both in the Department and in the local midlands region.  I am in the process of sorting that out but a number of decisions I have agreed with the Department and the midland transition team is that the office would be based in the midlands.  It would not be a Dublin office transferring to the midlands.  There would be an office available in Tullamore in Offaly County Council and its chief executive, Anna Marie Delaney, and particularly, Sarah Morgan, the major person involved in the transition team who is doing most of the work for the regional transition team, will be available.  Michael Goodwin from the Department will be seconded for a period over the next number of months to assist me in meeting the parties and establishing a number of issues around the funding.  We are designated funding for this of &euro;6 million from the Government directly in the context of the immediacy of the issues plus &euro;5 million to come from the ESB.  I am still finalising this and I am nearly there but my view is that this would a fund in the region, in escrow, under the auspices of the local authorities in the region that would readily available once we recognise which projects need to be given some seed money, development money or go-ahead money.  I am very keen that would be in place and that we would not have to go through a bureaucratic multi-layered procedure to seek approvals and the inevitability of that taking weeks and months when people are looking for money to commence, initiate or continue with projects.</p> <p>  I had a meeting with the regional development team in Tullamore on 29 November.  My impression from that meeting is that an enormous body of work is being done on the ground already.  That regional team, including the regional business transition team whose members I have yet to meet, has been up and running for some time.  A great deal of work has been done on the ground in the context of the original timescale but some of that will now have to be truncated in light of the ESB's decision.  </p> <p>  The Minister indicated he would like me to give him a report by the first quarter.  I see that very much as being the end of March or earlier if we can move matters forward.  </p> <p>  As I stated in my submission, I see myself largely conducting this transition commissioner posting very much on the ground.  I have been through this in the role I had relating to urban renewal in the north inner city.  When I did that report, I learned it is of vital importance to meet people in their own locality and circumstances where they can outline their concerns, ideas, proposals and hopes for what can be done in their region.  I also learned the importance of meeting the local authorities.  There is some discussion about how many local authorities are involved but the central ones are Longford, Westmeath, Offaly, Laois, Roscommon and north Tipperary and this may extend to Kildare.  Immediately, a number of local authorities are involved.  I met the chief executives of some of them recently.  I will involve myself in meeting the local authorities directly and then meeting the public representatives, both at Oireachtas level and at local level, who are a vital component of representation of their constituencies in the region with respect to the effects this will have upon them.  </p> <p>  In the context of the terms of reference and having an-inclusive approach, it is important to meet the State agencies regarding employment issues.  I refer not only to Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB or other local employers in the region but to what the local enterprise offices, LEOs, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are planning or envisage will be planned for the regions and what issues are involved in placing either industry, services, call centres or whatever it may be in the region.  A strong point put to me during a meeting was the constant and continuous migration from the club close to the Shannon but also east of the Shannon towards the Dublin region, with such migration thereby not sustaining the population, services and industries in the region.</p><p>I will place a big emphasis on employment creation, development, sustainability and retention.</p><p> On the day in Tullamore, the education and training boards, ETBs, Skillnet and the Springboard programme made presentations regarding identifying the skills among the current workforce, in particular Bord na M&oacute;na's, and how they might be adapted to new industries in the area, including Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s incubation industries.  It was also about identifying what needed to be done in respect of those Bord na M&oacute;na employees who wished to take up further skills training or educational opportunities.  The bodies are mapping that issue actively, not only in survey form but through one-to-one interviews with employees.  This will also involve the Athlone Institute of Technology, the board of which I was on for a number of years, and Maynooth University.</p><p> There is significant tourism potential in the region.  It is a sector that needs to be explored.  There is extraordinary interest among young people in climate change.  They are leading the agenda and the fight.  As part of that, it is important to use some of Bord na M&oacute;na's utilities as an information area.  Bord na M&oacute;na is identifying one or two locations, not just in the midlands, but perhaps across the rest of Ireland, for visitor centres for the sole purpose of identifying climate change actions.</p><p> I am conscious that community groups of all descriptions are the backbone of any community.  The appropriate groups in this circumstance are those that are involved in leisure, sporting and specific community activities.  As such, it is important that they be included in whatever discussions take place.  I am also arranging for visits in January, weather permitting, to all of the sites that Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB have in the region.  As part of that, I hope to meet local industries that employ reasonable or sizeable parts of the local population.</p><p> Overlaying all of this is the constant education that I will undertake in respect of climate change itself and how it affects the region.  In particular, this will look at the regeneration of the wetland bogs and Bord na M&oacute;na's programme to restore them to their natural condition, etc.</p><p> It is a large-level programme.  Between now and the end of March, I plan to listen to what is being proposed by the regional transition group and other groups in the area, their concerns, proposals and ideas, and will try to put it all together in various segments in a co-ordinated way with a view to determining what can be funded from the Central Fund.  A midlands-wide activity is being undertaken.  It is not centred in any particular area or on a particular level of activity.  In the meantime, I have arranged another session with the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Department of the Taoiseach on Government proposals in respect of climate policy.  I am conscious that the EU's secretariat technical assistance to regions in transition, START, coal initiative group visited the region recently.  I will try to ascertain what came of that visit.  It has the potential to unleash a considerable level of European funds, not only for this kind of climate change transition, but for the regeneration and transition of our regions that have been relying exclusively on these carbon fuel-based industries.</p><p> To date, I have undertaken a number of meetings.  I am trying to finish work and ensure there is movement.  The first three months of next year will be very active in terms getting a number of projects off the ground and assessing who can apply and receive funds from the grants that have been allocated or transferred to this fund.</p><p> I reiterate this work is midlands-based in terms of operation, the secretariat and the fund being available in the region.</p></speech>

I come from the midlands and I would like his opinion on the following.  Is he well enough resourced?  Is his brief correct by virtue of the fact that the goalposts have been brought forward from 2027?  Based on his report here today, his work ethic and on what he has planned, he is ideally positioned to have things in place for what was meant to be 2027.  How does he feel now that the target has been brought forward due to recent events?  I apologise for having to leave but I must attend a vote but I will pick up Mr. Mulvey's answer afterwards.</p></speech>

I will not wait until the end of March.  If there are projects ready, and I am reassured by the support of the local community and by the Department that it is ready to move, then I do not see a reason not to start funding these straight away.</p><p>It is important that we have early wins that are substantial, sustainable and rational.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Mulvey feel that there could, or should, be further scope to broaden the terms of reference to include and reflect some of those concerns?  Mr. Mulvey mentioned Willie Noone who was one of the people who reflected that position in his submission to the committee.</p></speech>

I am clearly of the view that there must be engagement with the workers on the wider strategic and operational issues that will affect the midlands and the existing and future employment of those workers.  That does not include getting into pay, terms and conditions because if I got into those issues, I would never get out of them, in my experience.  One would be negotiating for months when other, well-established institutions exist to do that.</p></speech>

I wish Mr. Mulvey well in his role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121800002#H00500"><p>I will continue in the same vein by wishing Mr. Mulvey well.  He has certainly demonstrated the capacity to work with people in everything he has done and I am encouraged by the importance he has placed on the need for boots on the ground and understanding the potential in the various regions.</p> <p>  I am disappointed by the terms of reference, and while that is not Mr. Mulvey's issue, I would like him to comment on it and to see how those might broaden.  While the need for an initial focus on the significant impact to the midlands is well recognised, there will also be significant impacts in other areas.  I speak in particular of the west Clare area and the decision by the ESB to reduce activity at Moneypoint.  As Mr. Mulvey knows, the proposal was that the burning of coal at Moneypoint would end by 2025 and communities, politicians and leaders generally were working towards that.  There is more renewable energy on the grid now so the ESB does not need to generate the same amount of electricity at Moneypoint, and that has accelerated the reduction in staffing.  Some 100 ESB employees will be affected, as will the many contractors, subcontractors and maintenance people who are often forgotten about, without at all minimising the impact on ESB workers.  There are smaller, self-employed people who will be impacted in much greater numbers.  The decision to reduce activity is having a significant negative impact in the greater west Clare area where there is not much potential for other employment.  The county council and local businesses have set up a committee to engage with the Government.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has indicated a willingness to talk about matters and to look at making further funds available to the whole just transition process.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Mulvey see the role of a just transition commissioner as being only about the midlands?  Has he had any discussion with the Government about broadening the role?  The just transition commissioner will have a bigger role than the one envisaged and a bigger secretariat and more staff will be required.  We are talking about ending the extraction of turf and burning of peat for fuel generation today which touches on the coal industry in west Clare, but there are many other elements of our economy that will have to change significantly over the coming years if we are to meet our targets, including the distribution of fuel and moving away from using home heating oil and gas.  That will impact on many places and sectors.  I hope that Mr. Mulvey can put his stamp on this role and establish an appropriate institution to assist in the change that is required.</p></speech>

I have always been of the view that reality is different from a term of reference and sometimes we need to expand the walls, as it were.  If another issue is of the same nature and impact, maybe some of the lessons that are being developed could simultaneously be informed to other communities.  Terms of reference are not about establishing a barrier outside which one shall not go.  I have been reading documentation from the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which sees the issue of climate change as a nationwide, not just a regional, issue.</p> <p>  I will be talking at length to the ESB about its facilities in the midlands, some of which can be further utilised for the community.  The ESB has top level offices, well-stocked facilities, car parks and the usual paraphernalia.  It would be terrible to see those things go to rack and ruin without seeing whether there are chances to put incubation industries, call centres, delivery centres or whatever in their places.  I have not had that discussion with the ESB but I will bring it up with its representatives.</p></speech>

I understand that Mr. Mulvey is at the initial phase of his work, in a reconnaissance stage of formulating a plan for where his role will go.  He is turning over stones all the time to see what is there.  He mentioned education, identifying skills, how workers can adapt and that there are one-on-one interviews.  I have, in the past, raised the issue of older workers who have been in a job for 20, 25 or 30 years in more traditional industries.  They will face challenges if they want to continue in the workforce because of changes in the required skills and the psychological changes involved.  The types of industries from which those people are coming often offered a job for life.  I would like Mr. Mulvey's thoughts or comments about that.</p> <p>  Will there be a lead local authority?  Mr. Mulvey mentioned a number of local authorities.  What is the general mood about this initiative from the people he has spoken to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121800002#H00800"><p>Bord na M&oacute;na is still going through its analysis of how many workers will be retained in renewing the wetlands because that will require staff for a period of time and there is talk of re-employing approximately 100 workers in that area.  Bord na M&oacute;na is also doing a number of incubator industries that are coming near market stage or that are still being piloted that are particular to the boglands of Ireland.  It is doing good initiatives in that area, some of them around the horticultural industry.</p> <p>  The big issue about retraining workers to get them into skill areas they have not been used to is how they can utilise their existing skills in a new industry.  That is where the education and training boards, Springboard, Skillnet and third level institutions will be vital.  There will be a particular issue around those workers of an age profile who expect another ten years of full-time employment before their pensions kick in.  The difficulty is how to identify for them whether they want to depart the company entirely or retrain.</p> <p>  The other issue that was raised is around new retrofitting initiatives in the area, particularly for Bord na M&oacute;na built accommodation in the midlands with which we are all familiar.  That sounds marvellous but refitting is a costly and highly skilled process.</p></speech>

The challenge, however, also is in identifying opportunities for that cohort.  It can be difficult to identify those opportunities in the normal jobs market and we as a market are failing this cohort of people.  People of 55, 56 or 57 years old walk into my office regularly and state that no one will hire them because they are too old.  Those people could and want to work for another ten years at least.  I have mentioned a few times the covert discrimination that exists regarding people close to retirement and decisions being made to not hire them.  That is a particular challenge.</p></speech>

I have been through that aspect and other things during my lifetime when there were redundancies in or closures of manufacturing industries.

It is not so much a lead local authority, but the lead will be the office in Tullamore.  Offaly County Council has offered to do that and Ms Sarah Morgan has been leading the regional team there.  All the regional CEOs sit on that body, as well as local and national politicians.  I am not going to replace something that already works.  I want to work with something that is clearly active on the ground and has the requisite support, knowledge, experience and contacts.  I will be also keen to meet each of the local authority CEOs and chairmen to get their points of view.  Some of them are slightly concerned that they might get lost in the definition of the "midlands".</p></speech>

It was my first engagement and I probably operate by instinct most of the time.  I have found great engagement and support and a great level of activity.  Many ideas are floating around and I almost asked at one stage what they need me for.  Many ideas were being brought forward in the midlands region and I found Bord na M&oacute;na, in particular, proactive.  I will need more engagement from the ESB.  It is also a matter of getting out to those companies already in the region that are sizeable employers and seeing what opportunities might be there.  It will be also necessary to create more positivity.  In addition, I will have to get information from the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  Not every call centre, online centre or depot has to be placed in Dublin.</p></speech>

We have a good road network, so why are we draining people from the area and putting them into a metropolis that cannot house them and to where it takes people two hours to get to work in the morning and two hours to get home in the evening?

I welcome Mr. Mulvey.  His reputation speaks for itself, as well as his experience.  There is no issue in that respect.  He mentioned in his opening statement that he had done some work for the Government in various areas as well.  I am aware of some of that.  There are different opinions regarding where the just transition is at the moment.  I do not know if Mr. Mulvey saw the exchanges between committee members and representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  They were critical of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Mr. Mulvey just said that Bord na M&oacute;na is proactive, while the representatives from ICTU had a polar opposite view and they represent that workforce.

One of those was its main supplier, Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am well aware of the normal interaction between unions and employers.  I was referring only to what I saw on the day regarding Bord na M&oacute;na's presentation of how it was trying to adjust to this situation.  I was not getting into the industrial relations aspect or how it was trying to create alternative industries and the kinds of numbers that could be involved in that process.</p></speech>

We are talking about saving jobs and supporting workers.  The trade unions were clearly and starkly stating to us that there was a refusal, in their view, by Bord na M&oacute;na to engage seriously with the union.  As the union saw it, the company was engaged in the process of deunionising the workforce.  It is not for this committee to take sides, but it is our responsibility to probe the questions being put to us.  If we have ICTU and its leader saying this to us, then this is not just the cut and thrust of union versus company interaction, of which I am well aware.  It is a different situation when the leader of ICTU is stating the just transition has got off to a poor start and that, in her view, Bord na M&oacute;na was operating to a strategy of deunionising the workforce.  That is a strong statement.</p> <p>  I am looking at Mr. Mulvey's opening statement.  I know he has only just been given the terms of reference, but many meetings have taken place with the Department, the company and others.  That is all good work.  The union's view, however, is that the just transition has got off to a poor start because much of the scoping work being done regarding the terms of reference should already have been put in place.  Does Mr. Mulvey accept that ICTU's views are not just the normal cut and thrust of exchanges between a company and trade unions?  The union has a serious concern about the level of engagement with Bord na M&oacute;na, and the Government by the way, not just regarding industrial relations issues but with all of the so-called supports the union was told would be put in place for workers.  Does Mr. Mulvey accept that there is a great deal of work to be done to convince the workers and the trade unions that the Government is serious about a just transition and that Mr. Mulvey has a clear role in making sure that happens?  </p></speech>

That is what I was referring to regarding the perception of those  on the front line whose jobs are the ones we need to protect and those we need to convince that climate action will be done in a fair and just way.  Everything I am hearing from Mr. Mulvey today, including his opening statement, reaffirms the view being given to us by others that we are off to a poor start.  Mr. Mulvey has no physical office and no support staff.  He has had a series of meetings, which is great, but that is it so far.  Is Mr. Mulvey's job simply to pull together the various strands of what the Government has said it will do in the budget?  I refer to the &euro;11 million.  Is that essentially Mr. Mulvey's role?</p></speech>

I see it as going down on the ground in the midlands, through the body that is already established there, and working with it to meet the community groups and all the vested interests, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and coming back with ideas from them that we can support and develop.</p></speech>

It is &euro;11 million that was allocated for certain purposes, which is why I am saying that, if Mr. Mulvey does not have additional funding, he himself may have ideas and he may consult, but that is all they are.

The committee felt strongly that there should be a just transition commissioner.  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, would have argued for it to be established on a permanent basis and resourced.  Deputy Cullinane covered that and I will not go back over it.</p> <p>  We are trying to conduct a ten-year catch-up of what is happening and there are a few things I wanted to say to Mr. Mulvey.  The issue of the unions has been laid on strong.  I have met the management of Bord na M&oacute;na on a number of occasions on this.  I met the management team for two and a half hours recently on this issue and I am aware that it is trying to do a number of things.  However, there is that view - I put it to them - about the unionising of the company.  Unfortunately, the evidence of what has happened with some of the subsidiaries that they have set up would indicate that.  However, I welcome the fact that they are trying to diversify.  They have a history of diversifying into waste management and into a number of other areas.  At one stage, they even made septic tanks.</p> <p>  There are a number of big semi-State companies here.  There is Coillte, Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB.  The point I am trying to communicate to Mr. Mulvey is that the three of these have a significant role.  I am a former employee of Bord na M&oacute;na.  All my family worked in Bord na M&oacute;na for a number of generations.</p> <p>  The midlands have been the power generation hub of the country for a long time.  They can be again with renewable energy.  They needs biomass.  We are bringing it from South America and Mr. Tom Donnellan told me the last day I was with him that there is even some coming from Russia.  We need biomass.  We need to move into biogas.  We need to move into solar.  We need to move into the full range of renewables.  We have the sites.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulvey mentioned already about the sites, and he is correct.  There are sites.  I do not want to see jackdaws flying in and out of them and bushes and thistles growing up around and within the car parks of the sites that are there.  Along with the landmass and the bogs, these can be used for carbon sequestration.  I wanted to emphasise that point to Mr. Mulvey.  However, that means Government action now in terms of getting a biomass supply chain in place.  That involves Coillte.  It involves the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It involves Bord na M&oacute;na cutaway bogs.  It involves the ESB.  There needs to be buy-in.  My sense of it is that the ESB has not yet entered this game.  It is a bigger company.  The ESB has more resources than Bord na M&oacute;na, but from meeting the different management groups, it has not yet entered this game.</p> <p>  On the just transition, the just transition team is in Tullamore in Offaly.  Offaly will be part of the constituency after the election and I have a considerable interest in it.  I deal with people from Offaly every day of the week.  Laois has lost 300 Bord na M&oacute;na jobs gradually.  There was no just transition there.  There are large sites in Laois belonging to Bord na M&oacute;na.  There is the C&uacute;il na M&oacute;na plant sitting on the crossroads of the M7-N80 and the main railway line.  In fact, a branch of the railway line goes into the old C&uacute;il na M&oacute;na factory.  That is why it was built on that site.  There has been nothing done there in terms of a just transition or replacement jobs.  What I am saying strongly to Mr. Mulvey, and I have said to the Minister and his predecessors, is that Laois must be included in the just transition.  I recognise that this is a double whammy for Offaly.  It is a considerable hit for Offaly.  Laois has been transitioning out of it over the past 20 years.  I realise that the impact is not as great but it has had an impact.  Mountrath has one of the lowest incomes per head of population in the country because many people there used to work in Bord na M&oacute;na, and the effects of that going have been seen there.</p> <p>  The other point I wanted to make to Mr. Mulvey is about training.  We have a good education and training board, Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board, under Mr. Joe Cunningham.  I am not arguing with that.  Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB turned out good apprenticeships over the years.  Mr. Mulvey mentioned that we need the skills for retrofitting.  We also need skills for generating new energy and the new technology there.  With Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB, there is a history that needs to be utilised.  I suggest the centre at Mount Lucas in Offaly, which is already being used as a training centre, be made a national training centre for renewable energy, retrofitting and energy conservation technology.</p></speech>

I will start with the broader meaning of just transition and how it is interpreted.  I had a look at the International Labour Organization standards of what that means and a look at the Paris Agreement, and when I then read the just transition terms of reference that Mr. Mulvey has been handed I thought they are very narrow.  Would Mr. Mulvey comment on that?</p> <p>  I also see quite a big gap in Mr. Mulvey's terms of reference.  They state that the commissioner will engage with all relevant stakeholders, the first of which on the list are Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB, and quite rightly so, because they are the first to decarbonise and the industries will be affected considerably.</p><p>No. vii explicitly states: "The Commissioner will not have a direct role in relation to industrial relations matters in Bord na Mona who will continue to work with the Joint Industrial Relations Council established under the Workplace Relations Commission."  Why does Mr. Mulvey believe the ESB has been excluded from that given that it also has internal industrial relations machinery for normal day-to-day issues?  Why does Mr. Mulvey believe the ESB is not mentioned in No. vii whereas it is explicitly mentioned in the list of stakeholders with which Mr. Mulvey must engage?  He might answer those questions first.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121800002#L00300"><p>The ESB is excluded from the part that states the just transition commissioner cannot have an industrial relations role whereas Bord na M&oacute;na is explicitly included.  I believe the reason is that Bord na M&oacute;na management had an input in framing these terms of reference.  It was obvious when we had the discussion with its representatives when they came before the committee that they did not want anything to do with the Workplace Relations Commission and they did not want Mr. Mulvey to have anything to do with a just transition in respect of internal industrial relations issues.  This comes down to the definition of a just transition.  Upskilling, replacing the jobs, greening the community and all the rest of it are important, and one will see that in the ILO definition.  However, the way workers are treated when they are losing their jobs matters also.  That was very much a feature of what happened in the Spanish coal industry where more than &euro;150 million was provided for the workers in a similar size workforce.</p><p>I say all of that because I honestly believe that what is going on with the Bord na M&oacute;na workers will sow the seeds of bitterness and discord among the workers and their families for a long time unless it is addressed.  In an email I got from a relatively young employee of Bord na M&oacute;na he stated that he had to look hard at his options for the past 12 months and decided there was a real opportunity to be part of the change that the company and the country need.  He is very positive about that.  He further stated that he firmly believes now that the understanding of the Government of the word &quot;just&quot; in just transition is closer to the sports brand Nike slogan than it is to the word &quot;justice&quot; enshrined in our Constitution since the foundation of the State.  There is no justice in a just transition as we know it.  That is the direct experience of the workers.  This is not one of the workers we described earlier who has ten years left and might want to work out his time.  This is a relatively young worker starting out whose opportunities may be enhanced because of his age.  As Mr. Mulvey can hear from the tone of the email, he is already embittered by the attitude to just transition.  If Mr. Mulvey, as a just transition commissioner, is excluded from that discussion and has no role to play in what happens to workers in terms of the actual experience of losing their jobs rather than their experience of upskilling and so on, I believe we have a problem.  That is an important point.</p><p>Mr. Mulvey stated he is not bound by the terms of reference and that he believes they could be broadened.  I hope he could play a role in that regard because it could not have been clearer that the Bord na M&oacute;na management was hostile to the idea of going to the WRC.  It was equally clear from the ICTU representatives that there was no other way around dealing with issues such as redundancies, pensions, etc.  I hope I have made myself clear on that.  Mr. Mulvey might speak to it.</p><p>From the point of view of the workers, it also important to raise the issue of pensions.  There are two defined benefit pension schemes in Bord na M&oacute;na.  One is already in deficit and the other is barely above water, so to speak.  Is there anything Mr. Mulvey can do to ensure that the pensions of all Bord na M&oacute;na workers and retired workers are secure as the pressure comes on workers to leave the company and for peat production to cease?  This process has been pushed forward very quickly.  It should have happened more slowly.</p><p>In that regard, Mr. Mulvey stated in his briefing document that he had a long briefing session with the chief executive of Bord na M&oacute;na and senior management.  Will he expand on the nature of that engagement?  Did it include job creation, upskilling, pensions, redundancies, etc.?  I imagine it did not but I would like to hear Mr. Mulvey's response.</p><p>I have a note indicating that workers feel very strongly about the current level of training.  That is an issue that is within Mr. Mulvey's remit.  They say training is basic, <i>ad hoc</i>, inadequate for their needs and appears to be nothing more than a box-ticking exercise.  Mr. Mulvey will find it reasonable for workers to want to have a just transition into jobs that are not precarious or minimum wage and that instead have some degree of permanency.  They have had all of the benefits of being in a permanent, pensionable, good job for long periods but it appears now that they will be pushed into precarious, low paid and temporary employment.  I seem to have mislaid my note detailing a case I raised with the head of Bord na M&oacute;na when he was here.</p></speech>

I have not come to a firm view one way or the other but I believe the genesis of just transition is about what happened in the coal and steel communities in Europe, the devastating effect of the closure of coal mines and various other mines the length and breadth of Europe, and the ability and capacity in those areas.  I recall when I was going over as a union representative to the European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC, in the 1970s and 1980s hearing about the devastating effect of the closure of mines on Li&egrave;ge and Asturias.  Where it has been decided under either international, European or national policy that we have taken a particular stance on the production and usage of fossil fuels, that requires the industries that produce them to close.  A transition period is normally given for that but there is a rapidity about it now.  Part of that justice argument is that those who are affected by it should not get thrown on the same slag heap as the product they were producing.</p></speech>

They state: "... focusing initially on communities and workers affected by the ending of peat harvesting ...".  I take that in a broad sense.  How are the workers affected?  What are their immediate concerns?  What is their livelihood and what will it be?  What alternatives exist for them?</p> <p>  On my meeting with Bord na M&oacute;na, by and large, it was a briefing for me on what the company was doing, its their plans, etc.  I did not get into the issue of industrial relations because I did not believe it would be productive at that stage.  That does not preclude me from getting into it at a future stage.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulvey described it very well.  The reference I was looking for was the Bord na M&oacute;na workers in Mountdillon.  In an exchange with the CEO of Bord na M&oacute;na, he informed me that the only people made redundant in Mountdillon were seasonal workers.  In fact, 75 seasonal workers were let go but 75 permanent employees were put on seven days' notice.  That was only revoked when a large demonstration took place and following trade union intervention.</p> <p>  I have a final question.  No. ix of the terms of reference states the process "will be reviewed after two years to see if it fulfils the aim of ensuring a Just Transition for the Midlands."</p><p>Does Mr. Mulvey believe this timescale is too late for the Bord na M&oacute;na workers, whose industry is shutting down much quicker, and could he argue for a review within a much shorter space of time - something more like six or nine months?  </p></speech>

Two years seems an awful long time away.  I actively hope to move after I have had sufficient briefing on the issues and engagement.  I think I said at the meeting that I do not see this being two years.  There is a rapidity about this that requires an earlier judgment or judgment call about supporting alternative arrangements around sustainability of employment, creation of employment, sustainability of communities and looking at alternatives.</p></speech>

We had a broad discussion about largely the plan of action or the development in the same way as it had been asked to look at national and international practice.  The point I made to it was that there was no point in me doing or proposing things that were directly in contravention with what it was saying.  Second, I also said that I did not necessarily see anything it might be doing as preventing me from practically putting in place measures.  The role of the NESC involves having a policy oversight not just of what might be happening in the midlands but what might also have a national effect in other areas of the country where there are specific challenges around this.</p></speech>

I do not mean to in any way question Mr. Mulvey's credentials.  I am just saying that the Department and the Government's approach here is not commensurate with what we have heard from other international experience.  The best examples of just transition in other countries involve a whole infrastructure helping in this process.  Mr. Mulvey has been given an almost impossible task.  Regarding the idea that there is a concern about the movement of all economic activity to Dublin, which is true, and Mr. Mulvey's role in addressing that and using this opportunity to redress the whole economic development of the midlands, which is what we need to do, I do not think it can be done under the terms of reference and structures and support systems Mr. Mulvey has been given.</p></speech>

I assume it might emerge six months into this that there is a need for a new bigger effort around it.  My view largely is that if this is required, I will certainly say it.  I will not be behind the door and not say it.  If I find after three months that I cannot deal or cope with all of it or that it needs a greater input, I will have no hesitation in saying that.  I do not want and will not allow drift.  One creates an expectation and if one does not deliver it, it is worse than if one had never started at all.</p></speech>

A six-month review makes sense.  It will include the reality that we are probably looking at stopping the extraction of peat for horticultural production and 50,000 houses being retrofitted per year in our climate action plan when we are only retrofitting a couple of hundred at the moment.  We need 20,000 workers for that.  We probably need a similar number of people to work on the re-wetting of bogs.  I could go on.  All of these things have material input into a proper just transition plan for the midlands.  What Mr. Mulvey will find in the next six months is that it is almost impossible for us to be able to do that justice with the resources and timelines he has.  I wish him well.  I am not being personally critical but I do think the approach taken by the Government has put him in a very difficult position.</p></speech>

Probably some of my questions will be duplications of others given that so many people have spoken before me.  I want to tease out some points.  Mr. Mulvey said he will meet the unions in the new year.  What is the role of the unions?  Will they be as important as Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB in terms of their response and what they can bring forward?  It has been my experience that the unions probably have been one of the best in terms of what a just transition would look like and what it could involve.  What is Mr. Mulvey's view on this?</p></speech>

Unions have made a valuable contribution to change in many places in which I have been involved which would never change in a month of Sundays, where there was then a crisis and a real change.  I expect that the individuals here and the people who have been working in the bogs over the years know as much about how to run the company as the corporate management who have been given a specific responsibility.  It is also a matter of trying to maximise their capacity, especially those who wish to stay on working in the region and in the industry, and to determine how best that can be done so that their skills, knowledge and memory are utilised to the maximum.  To me, they are an invaluable component of what change may take place.</p></speech>

When Bord na M&oacute;na was at the committee previously, it said that would not be part of its remit or anything that it would consider.  If that comes out of the discussions that Mr. Mulvey has had, how will that be implemented?  Bord na M&oacute;na seems to be the corporate body that should have the responsibility, in my mind, to do that, but how will that develop and work?  How that develops will be very important for the success of the project.</p></speech>

To engage in a programme of retrofitting dwelling houses in the midlands is a substantial investment that will require highly skilled companies and workers to carry it out, because the whole concept of retrofitting has changed significantly from the outer cladding of houses to inner insulation, to the roof, panels and everything else.  Many specialist companies operate in retrofitting, though not necessarily in Ireland.  I do not think that this is an easy solution or that it is easy to reskill to become a worker in that industry.  We then have to establish what companies are likely to be engaged to do this and what social contract we put them into to engage local employment.  It is a bigger issue than people anticipate it to be.  There is also a question of how one undertakes the contracts.  Does one go from estate to estate?  How does one procure the company that will do it?  If houses are retrofitted, is there an obligation on those whose homes are retrofitted to actually stay in them and not sell them the following week?  These are all considerations that will have to be addressed.  That is a little beyond my expertise.</p></speech>

We need to look at it independently to see if it is feasible anyway and that is where this has come from.  Just transition in the midlands is obviously very important.  It is the first of quite a few that may develop in this country in the coming years.  One that I would think of is not so much with regard to companies but how households would transition from using fossil fuels to renewable energy and how that would be managed.  That will be very important.  How will Mr. Mulvey make sure that the lessons from this will come together to improve the next project, and that each step will be an improvement, since this project will not be perfect?</p></speech>

The midlands is a different type of project but the principles are the same.  How does one lay out a plan that highlights and segments the particular priorities and how they would be done over a period of time?  I do not know whether the issue the Deputy raised will be in that or not.  This will be well documented.  It will be tested.  I am sure that some will succeed and others may fall by the wayside.  It will have to be documented because others will have to learn from either the successes or the failures.  Hopefully there are no failures but at least we will document what works and what does not work.  I imagine that when we come to lay out the planning, we will detail the projects that may be undertaken and why others were not accepted.</p></speech>

Does he agree that the kind of change we are seeing with companies such as Bord na M&oacute;na, which is effectively planning to cease it main activity, is not a normal operational or day-to-day moment for the company but relates to strategic direction for that company?</p></speech>

It has significant implications.  It had a market for a product and we now accept that we should not be putting up smokestacks.  It is a significant change, such as trying to change the Titanic a mile from the iceberg.  It is close to it but it has an opportunity to change.  I have heard that it is making a good effort to change and to look at viable enterprise propositions, including having to rehabilitate the wetlands and peatlands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121800002#N00800"><p>There is a delicate nuance here about what is operational in the normal day-to-day and what is actually strategic and major.  From our perspective, looking in as a committee, and from some of our earlier discussions, this is not a normal matter.  There is a question of what are industrial relations in the normal sense and what is just transition.  It is not simply whether Mr. Mulvey values unions, since I have no doubt he does, and it is in his remit to discuss with unions.  What matters are discussed will be important because when there is change on this scale, there is a question of what issues become industrial relations or not.  When ICTU spoke to us, it was specifically about some of the concerns, with deunionisation being mentioned.  There was an issue of moving to redeployment versus voluntary redundancy, for example.  There is the issue of those being redeployed, or voluntary redundancy and who is able to access it.  Where there is change on a major scale, those industrial relations issues can become just transition issues.</p> <p>  I want to look at two specific aspects of Mr. Mulvey's mandate.  It states that he does not have a direct role in industrial relations matters in Bord na M&oacute;na, though it interestingly does not rule him out from them in the ESB.  Perhaps he might have a more hands-on role with ESB.  It states that he can recommend optimal structures or processes for the co-ordinated and effective delivery of just transition in the midlands.  I know Mr. Mulvey mentioned established bodies.  I presume he is referring to the regional transition team.  He has the remit to suggest other processes.  A process that was specifically put forward here and recommended by ICTU and others was the involvement of the Workplace Relations Commission, not in a role of resolving disputes, but chairing an examination of work and industrial relations issues in the broadest sense and workers' rights issues in the context of just transition.  Under the Silesia declaration, the Government and many other Governments have committed to participatory and representative processes of social dialogue as one of the principles for any just transition and work in this area.  That is not simply a question of whether workers have good ideas and if they can give us some good input.  It is about their entitlement to have representatives in some structure of social dialogue.  The Silesia declaration talks about decent work and quality jobs.</p><p>I recognise Mr. Mulvey is looking to good practice, and I hope we can contribute to good practice by what we do in Ireland.  Mr. Mulvey mentioned warehouses and call centres.  It is worth noting that the state of coalfields report in the UK found that call centres which replaced coal jobs with poor quality employment and poor quality contracts had terrible results in terms of pay, conditions and morale in that area.  This was in contrast to the Ruhr valley coal companies, where workers looked to redeployment into new industries of equivalent standing and status. </p></speech>

If I do that, I will have no time left to do the bigger job.  That is why I am being cautious on this.  The second thing is that the ESB has always prided itself on, and has been very strong on, the independence of its own industrial tribunal.  The commission used to supply the chair of that over the years but I know, because I wear the scars on my back, how independent both the ESB workers and management are about their own processes and non-third-party interference.<br/><br/>It has not been similarly the case with Bord na M&oacute;na.  Over the years, Bord na M&oacute;na did not enjoy the best industrial relations.  There were different disputes and issues over the years, such as issues over the closure of plants, seasonal working, harvesting and the whole lot.  While I am aware of all of this, there are processes and procedures to resolve these.  The Irish Congress of Trade Union has made the point that it perceives, believes or has actually experienced - I do not know which and I am not going to make a judgment on it - a resistance from the management in Bord na M&oacute;na to get back down into this kind of negotiation.  There is an advisory service at the Labour Relations Commission which was established to create harmony where it does not exist, particularly after bad industrial dispute situations.  It is a mechanism by which an officer of the commission can sit with the parties and resolve the issues.<br/><br/>In fairness to the regional group I met recently, and I made this point earlier in my presentation, we sometimes need to separate fact from fiction.  This is where I believe the one-to-ones are important in the context of Bord na M&oacute;na.  There is no point forcing a worker who does not want to do something, and would prefer to retire or take a package, into reskilling as a retrofitter if that is not what the worker wants to do.  That exercise is ongoing to find out what is the desire of workers and what they want, and that is going to be an important part of the exercise.<br/><br/>I am very conscious, and it is one of the concerns of the unions, that when alternative employment is set up, particularly by Bord na M&oacute;na, it has not reduced or diminished terms or conditions of employment.  That is understandable.<br/><br/>In regard to other industries that might be established, or people going into other industries, we will have to decide on this.  From what I know from the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, they are not exactly queuing up to establish industries in the midlands.  We are going to have to incentivise this in some way around the regional funding that happened in the countries the Senator mentioned in order to say, &quot;This is where we want you to go and this is what we are prepared to provide and to supply you with.&quot;  When I talk about call centres, I am not necessarily talking about call centres <i>per se</i>.  There are distribution warehouses and there are other areas where goods are coming in.  An Post on Black Friday had 1 million parcels going through the system.  There are other areas where we could have distribution for what is a changing economy.  The important thing is quality, sustainable jobs to keep the community in the community. </p></speech>

It is not the first time I have met him as he was in Offaly for a very engaging afternoon.  It was a great opportunity for him to see at first hand what is going on there with the regional transition team led by Offaly County Council.  I very much welcome the fact his office is going to be based there and it is great he is getting the support from Ms Sarah Morgan and all of the team there.</p> <p>  In thinking about the just transition, the important thing is looking at how the midlands is going to transition from being a centre for energy generation using fossil fuels to being a centre for energy generation using renewable energies.  I would be interested in us thinking a little about the brown to green strategy that Bord na M&oacute;na has for its wind farm projects, a couple of which are already up and running.  There is also a lot of interest in the development of solar farms and some local businesses are very proactive in terms of energy storage, battery storage and all of that.  Again, there are local people with plenty of ideas so there is opportunity.</p> <p>  One thing we can welcome is the fact Bord na M&oacute;na has decided to diversify rather than just shut up shop, which it could easily do because its main function was to harvest peat for energy generation.  When its main client, the ESB, is gone, the question is what it is going to do, so I welcome very much the fact it is looking at new business.  I would, of course, support Senator Higgins in regard to the need for good, well paying jobs, which is what we want.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Mulvey be engaging with the START secretariat?  As he knows, the European Commission has the platform for coal regions in transition and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, asked that we be considered as part of that.  We have been accepted and the START team came to the midlands to meet all of the local authorities and other stakeholders at the beginning of this month.  Will Mr. Mulvey meet with START representatives and liaise with them because it would be crucial to do so? </p></speech>

I will be engaging with the START team.

I gather they are the people I need to talk to on that.</p> <p>  On the structures, I will have to make an assessment as to how that liaison works.  I have a view that we might need one or two sub-committees.  In particular, I would like to put the education people together and put the enterprise people together, and bring them all together as one entity and talk for maybe half a day or a day about what is happening, what could be happening, what potentially is in the pipeline and what the opportunities are for creating and sustaining employment and retraining workers.

I have been listening to him for a while and I appreciate someone who talks straight and calls it like it is.  I will give it to him straight.  In my opinion this has come out of the blue for Deputies and the workers.  I shall give Mr. Mulvey the background.  We were brought in one year ago and told of this just transition over seven or eight years to 2025 or 2027.  Currently there is mistrust by the workers and many politicians with what has gone on.  This has come like a bolt from the blue and has been brought forward by five or six years.  Mr. Mulvey spoke about Bord na M&oacute;na, which is looking at a fish project and herbs and so on, but these are six or seven years away to be quite frank.  Some 300 to 400 Bord na M&oacute;na workers have been already thrown on the scrap heap and have been given redundancy.  The coal yards in Galway and Sligo are where the people also have mistrust.  They took the redundancy as they had no other choice.</p> <p>  Going back to Se&aacute;n Lemass's time and Shannon Airport, is Mr. Mulvey prepared to look for something in those areas that would give a tax incentive to try to bring in businesses to set up?  Is Mr. Mulvey prepared to look for that?  Can Mr. Mulvey get agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to have a person strategically positioned who will deal with the areas?  In my tally, while Galway and Roscommon gave the peat across to the stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, I believe that eight counties will be affected by this.  Mr. Mulvey referred to a fund but I ask him to write down one name.</p> <p>  I have fought with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, over the years but there are people in the service who have done re-wetting such as Jack McCauley.  Mr. Mulvey referred to re-wetting giving X amount of jobs, and we would have been involved with the NPWS on this previously.  The fund of &euro;5 million will cover about 17 diggers for 240 days, along with the people who need to do the drawings and the engineers.  Figures are being kicked out there at the moment.  I am aware that Mr. Mulvey is just starting to look into it.  He has spoken also of retrofitting and he rightly pointed out that people must first get trained in retrofitting.  If I am a sub-contractor in Donegal or in Cork, however, and if I am keener than anybody else for the work then I will get that job.  There is also a question mark over Bord na M&oacute;na's &euro;5 million.  Has that work to go out to public tender?  If so, then I and my one digger - for example - would be more efficient.  Does Mr. Mulvey understand this, or else there is no point in saying that this fund would be available?</p></speech>

I am conscious of the mistrust among the unions being articulated a number of times.   I will just have to meet with them and hear that at first hand.</p> <p>  On the incentivising, I will have to check to see is the State's liberty to incentivise.  I would have thought, given what was addressed earlier and mentioned at the start, that there would be empathy in Europe for those regions undergoing this change, and that the state-aid rule would be relaxed with regard to incentivising or subsidising industry.  We would just have to say that we cannot have a situation whereby an area of a country has a vital economic activity up to now and it suddenly disappears.  We must get alternatives in, and renewable energy and so on.  It will depend; I must be briefed and informed about that.  I believe there is always a national imperative to break down the centralisation of the provision of industries and services in our cities, and particularly in Dublin.  It is creating all kinds of problems, including around housing, traffic and transport arteries.  The centralisation of offices and the distribution of industry in Dublin especially creates a myriad of problems.</p> <p>  I have only recently found out that the National Parks and Wildlife Service owns some 80% of the bogs in the State.  It owns more bogs than Bord na M&oacute;na, and they are spread out over the State.  It is one of the biggest landowners.  It is all about the tracks and trails now and it is trying to get new industry support and new outdoor activities and so on.  I will meet with the NPWS to get its view and experience.  I have heard about the NPWS experience of wetlands replenishing the bogs.</p> <p>  On the issue of procurement and the industry, there is no point in creating a separate system for retrofitting - or any other system.  If this goes to procurement and if it is above a certain threshold, companies from the UK, for example, who probably have more experience in Europe, can come in and - they must be awarded the contract.  Where is the sense in that?  We need to measure and plan it well.</p></speech>

I see a problem around the workload involved.  There is a huge job of work to be done here, which involves a massive amount of consultation and interaction with many groups.  I feel it is necessary for the Government.  I can see Mr. Mulvey's initial role in terms of leadership and guidance in bringing together the various organisations and community groups, interstate agencies and inter-departmental groups.  I cannot see this going any further with regard to a comprehensive plan or a plan that can be implemented to assist.</p> <p>  I want to be parochial in that the just transition is all about the midlands, but Littleton in Tipperary, which I represent, was always part of the Bord na M&oacute;na family.  Our problem is that the peat briquette plant closed with the loss of 120 jobs, but we have not had a just transition.  We seem to have been completely and totally left out of the loop.  Nobody from Tipperary or from the county council is represented at the regional meetings Mr. Mulvey has had.  I see from the list of meetings that there has been no contact with anybody about Tipperary or about Littleton.  I want to make it clear that this is not just about the people who have lost their jobs in Littleton.  We sat down, the unions played a leadership role, and we came to a conclusion around redundancy.  We had 90% agreement and everyone was reasonably happy, but the issue is not just about the jobs that were lost, it is also about the future of the communities where Bord na M&oacute;na exists.  Littleton in Thurles employed 120 people.  It was the central and integral part of the local economy.  The community was built around the factory, and suddenly we have devastation and we have no alternatives.</p> <p>  There is massive infrastructure there such as the 10,000 acres of bogland between Littleton and the Laois border.  There is a vast number of buildings and infrastructure such as water and sewerage, energy etc. in that area.   We have a lot to attract alternative industry there.  Somebody needs to sit down to look at the options, come up with a formula and devise a plan for it.  We have not been included in the just transition up to now.  Will Mr. Mulvey please ensure that Littleton is included in the overall plan?  Will he offer to meet with our county council as the lead body?  We have a community action group established.  Perhaps Mr. Mulvey could meet with the group and with the Oireachtas representatives from Tipperary.  I want to be realistic.  There are people who think this implies there would be jobs on the horizon immediately.</p><p>Others have been led to believe they will receive a retrofit grant because they worked at Bord na M&oacute;na.  I accept that we are a long way from detailing what might be available, but I ask that Littleton not be forgotten and that it be included in Mr. Mulvey's deliberations.  I ask that we be consulted and be part of whatever proposals are made.  There was a closure but there has not been a transition.</p></speech>

Like the Chairman, I have been intensely engaged with the issue that is presented before us today as to the challenges facing our childcare sector.</p> <p>  I have the utmost respect for those who work day in and day out to look after our children.  I know that for many this is indeed a vocation.  They are significant people in the lives of children and also in the lives of parents.  Placing their child in the care of someone else is a huge decision for parents.  First and foremost they want their child to be safe and happy.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, that is also my priority.  All my decisions on childcare are determined by what is best for children.  I accept that sometimes these decisions do not suit everyone but the rationale is, and always will be, to have children at the heart.  It is important in the context of what we are discussing today to take stock of where we are.</p> <p>  In the past five years there has been a 110% increase in capacity.  The number of childcare places has more than doubled from 104,000 to 218,000.  Investment in childcare has increased by 141% and it is almost one and a half times what it was in 2015 when &euro;260 million was invested compared to &euro;638 million in 2020.  We have gone from one free preschool year to two free preschool years.  We opened the national childcare scheme, NCS, four weeks ago tomorrow.  In these four short weeks, the parents of more than 20,000 children will have received childcare subsidies for the first time, or significantly higher subsidies than a month ago.  To put this in perspective, if one takes the life of a four year old child who is currently in an Early Childhood Care and Education, ECCE scheme the world of childcare has changed beyond recognition since the day he or she was born.  This is good and positive progress but I am the first person to say that more needs to be done.</p> <p>  We can all be proud of the achievements and Irish people can be assured that their money has been well spent by the State in starting to address years of under-investment in childcare.  I have repeatedly said that in order to change from one of the most expensive countries in the world to one of the best for childcare we need to at least maintain and possibly intensify this rate of investment.  Through the national childcare scheme it is open to any future Minister or Government to increase the subsidies paid to parents.  The NCS is built for the future.</p> <p>  With this progress comes challenges.  The doubling of capacity and the stronger regulation requires more inspections.  Those working in the childcare sector have to achieve certain educational qualifications.  The doubling of capacity has led to a significant growth in the workforce and associated difficulties in getting suitably qualified childcare workers.  The introduction of necessary regulations requires childcare providers to undertake additional responsibilities, including additional administrative work, to demonstrate compliance.  Some childcare providers choose not to continue every year.  For example in 2018, 78 providers closed their doors.  However, 153 new childcare providers opened new services.  This led to an increase of 2,200 childcare places that year and there were many other new places resulting from other measures.  The average size of services has grown from 33 in 2015 to 47 in 2019.</p> <p>  This year, 2019, was a particularly onerous year for childcare providers due to a number of developments.  Some 4,300 of them had to re-register with Tusla in order to stay on the register and operate as childcare providers in 2020 and beyond.  While this was flagged from 2016, it still represented significant work.  I am pleased that the CEO of Tusla confirmed that almost 100% of childcare providers submitted their applications for re-registration by the due date.  He has also confirmed that it is processing applications received after 12 December.  </p> <p>  I would like to particularly acknowledge the pressures services have faced in 2019 and to acknowledge the pressure and stress that deadlines bring.  I hear this clearly from the sector.  My Department, Pobal and Tusla will try to address this in a meaningful way in 2020 and to simplify and streamline procedures so that those in the sector are not over-burdened with administration.  </p> <p>  To recognise how difficult this has been I have approved an additional, once-off programme support payment to all providers which will be made in the coming days, that is in December 2019.  This is in addition to the programme support payment already given to providers this year.  We value those who work in our childcare sector and perhaps they do not always feel our appreciation, but I would like to assure them on behalf of the Government that we do not take them for granted.</p> <p>  There are also challenges that have not yet been addressed.  Our childcare workers are significant people in the lives of children, parents and families and significant also in keeping our economy working.  They are poorly paid.  I have given my support for a sectoral employment order.  I have made provision in budget 2020 for a sectoral employment order support fund.  Paying childcare workers a decent wage is important for them as individual workers, for our children, for maintaining consistency of care in the lives of children, and for the quality of our childcare services.  I hope that sufficient numbers of workers join a union and make this a reality.  It is a key piece of the unfinished business.</p> <p>  I will address now a key issue affecting the childcare sector that has received much media attention in the past few days, which relates to media reports and some commentary around internal risk rating documents from Tusla.  I know that the CEO of Tusla has clarified that the risk ratings are used for the purpose of prioritising and scheduling more than 4,300 services for inspection.  It is a risk-based, internal, profiling system which is in line with a recommendation by the OECD.  I am aware that Tusla has circulated the committee members with his response to "RT&Eacute; Investigates" on this matter.  I do not want to rehearse again what he has outlined except to say that the chief social worker in my Department has confirmed that in using the term risk register in order to schedule inspections, Tusla is identifying a risk to itself, namely to ensure that Tusla implements an inspection regime that is fit for purpose and provides most assurance across the sector.</p><p>The chief social worker notes:</p><blockquote>	Regulatory bodies, in general, have two functions.  The first is to register all centres for compliance purposes &ndash; this provides public assurance.<br /><br />The second function is to use its inspection resource proportionally to ensure inspectors are attending to those services which may have performance issues.<br /><br />To do so the regulatory body uses the information available to it intelligently to prioritise its inspection schedule. </blockquote><p>A service may have been profiled as red simply because it has not been inspected recently and should be prioritised for one.  It may be a very good service.  I hope members of the committee find this further clarification by the chief social worker helpful.<br/><br/>I want to make a few points on insurance and the current state of play.  Over the course of the past year to date, there were three parliamentary questions, out of 1,500, tabled to my Department on insurance.  I understand Deputy Rabbitte referred to a press statement she issued in April 2019 during her election campaign for the European Parliament elections.  I do not know how many press statements she issued during her campaign but I confess I did not read all of her election material.  I am aware there were some representations made, including from Deputy Funchion at the end of last month.  The latter was responded to on Tuesday.<br/><br/>The cost of insurance for the childcare sector came into strong focus only in the past few weeks.  This has arisen following the withdrawal of an insurance provider from the Irish market and the confirmation that another could not be found.  It is undoubtedly causing distress to providers and worry to parents.  I acknowledge there are many providers who are facing increased insurance costs.  I am receiving representations from them also.<br/><br/>Until recently, there were two insurance underwriters offering insurance to the childcare sector in Ireland.  On 6 December, one of these, Ironshore, notified its 1,300 clients that it would be withdrawing from the market.On 17 December, Mr. Padraic Smith, the broker who had provided the Ironshore underwriting services, informed the customers that the company had failed to get a new underwriter to take over their client base.  This leaves only one underwriter currently offering insurance to the sector.  That, as we know, is Allianz. <br/><br/>The Government is limited in what it can do in this situation.  It cannot compel a private business to remain in the market, nor can it directly intervene in the pricing of insurance offered to childcare providers.  However, officials in my Department are working hard to find a way to support those services that have been impacted.  We have engaged with Allianz, which I understand has confirmed that it will offer quotes to all but the most high-risk services.Allianz, through the broker Arachas, is willing to consider quotes for all affected services.  Quotes are being processed within 24 hours in the vast majority of cases.Some 1,100 quotes had been issued by midday today to previous Ironshore clients.  This leaves 200 providers who have not yet received quotes.  I will receive an update on this tomorrow.  There may be a very small number of very high-risk services that will not receive quotations.<br/><br/>The press has reported that some providers are reporting significant increases in premiums.  I understand the premiums charged by Ironshore were considerably lower than the market average, and this is leading to the increases.<br/><br/>I understand that the average cost of Allianz insurance for full-time childcare is &euro;60 per year per child.  The average cost for sessional services, such as ECCE, is &euro;25 per year per child.  This equates to 0.5% to 0.75% of the turnover of a service.  I understand that the increase is causing difficulties for providers.<br/><br/>My Department and the city and county childcare committees are offering a number of supports for providers, including a case management system for services experiencing sustainability difficulties. <br/><br/>For community providers, who are one in four of all childcare providers, financial supports can be made available after an assessment through a process managed by the childcare committees and Pobal.  I would encourage services to contact their local childcare committee to access a range of supports, including advice or business planning. <br/><br/>With regard to the issue of insurance, I am liaising with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to consider a review of insurance in the childcare sector as part of my ongoing independent review of costs in the sector.  We need to make the market more attractive to both existing insurers and new entrants in order to increase competition, which in turn should lead to a reduction in pricing and an increase in capacity.<br/><br/>For the childcare sector, this includes compliance with regulations.  Compliance helps to manage risk.  Managing risk is important for children and should also make childcare facilities safer places.<br/><br/>I agree with the CEO of Tusla when he says that the childcare sector is largely compliant.  In my experience, we are lucky, or blessed, to have caring, compassionate champions for children working in our childcare sector.  They need and deserve our support.  They have had a very tough year. <br/><br/>Exposure of bad practice in any sector affects all of those working in it.  The impact of exposure can cause stress, disappointment and pressure.  The impacts are necessary to root out the small number who should not be caring for our children.  The majority, however, work hard and diligently in the best interest of children.I am glad that I am in a position to make a once-off payment averaging &euro;1,500 to providers to reflect their commitment.  This is under the programme support payment I established in 2017 to recognise the administrative burden on providers.  This support will come from existing resources available to me in 2019, and payments will be made by 28 December.  The range of payments will be from small amounts right up to &euro;26,000, for the very large providers, depending on the number of children being cared for.<br/><br/>This is a fast-moving situation but I am committed to supporting the sector appropriately, and, above all, to protecting children.</p></speech>

I understand she has to be in the D&aacute;il Chamber in an hour.  I presume all the members wish to make a contribution, as do I.  Time, therefore, should be limited to five or six minutes each.  If we have time for a second round, we will have it.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's announcement that there will be a once-off payment of approximately &euro;1,500 to the providers in the industry.  She mentioned the distress and worry caused among parents and providers in the run-up to Christmas.  I recognise this is not the responsibility of the Minister.  It is a matter for the Department of Finance, particularly its Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, in the sense that his role covers the insurance industry.  What efforts are being made to attract another provider to the market?  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs mentioned on two occasions that all but the most high-risk providers will get quotes.  The Taoiseach mentioned it this afternoon.  How many high-risk providers are there in the category?  What are they to do to comply with the rule requiring them to have insurance?  There are committee members from all over the country and more than one of us will end up representing a facility that may not be able to get insurance.  Clearly, that will be a major issue for them over the next couple of days if they learn they cannot get a quote from Allianz.  Could the Minister comment on that?  Those are my prefacing questions for her.  She might answer them, after which Deputy Sherlock will lead members' questions.</p></speech>

I would answer that in two ways.  My Department has been in regular contact with the broker that was handling the negotiations and we understand some of the issues with which he has been working.  Even as the days pass, other information arises and we are in direct contact with one or two providers that may have access to another insurance operator.  We are having those conversations.  We will examine information specific to the childcare sector in other jurisdictions.  We will consider the question of attracting other operators with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and their officials, given that that is where this issue large resides.  We will provide input based on what we know.  We will also get more information from our providers regarding their 2020 insurance costs.  No one knows all of that information, so we will be asking that question.  The public sector profile, which I launched yesterday or the day before, will be included.  We have a great deal of information on 2018 from the independent review of costs.  We are gathering relevant information and will be working with the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked what would happen to the highest risk providers if they could not get insurance.  That is an excellent question.  I would ask them to get in touch with Pobal and us in order to determine what may be the reasons for that and the ways we might be able to support them.  Some of the reasons might be beyond our control, but we will find ways to ascertain that.</p></speech>

I am seeking a greater degree of clarity around the programme support payment of &euro;1,500.  I wish to show the Minister examples whereby, notwithstanding the process that providers have been through, in particular providers of long standing who have always been compliant and whose risk profiles have not increased, providers who are today able to get insurance are being told that the cost will increase twofold in one instance, fourfold in another and sixfold in another with which I am familiar.  Notwithstanding everything that the Minister is saying and the exit from the market of a certain insurance operator, even where providers' risk profiles have not increased because they have always been compliant as per Child and Family Agency and HSE regulations, their premia costs are increasing.  One is left with the impression that the insurance companies are taking advantage of the lacuna in the market by stepping in to profit from the challenge facing providers.</p> <p>  How will the programme support payment be divided?  Is it a one-off payment for every provider?  What formula will be used?  Under what heading will it be done?  Will it be deemed a supplementary payment to meet the cost of overheads?  Will it be a direct grant just by dint of the fact that someone is a provider?  Is it the case that providers can benefit without having to go through a rigorous process?  The Minister will be conscious of the fact that many providers will benefit from the time extension, but as public representatives, we are all conscious that the capital costs incurred by providers to become compliant and continue their operations have put them into debt.</p></speech>

I am pleased to attend the committee at short notice.  It is not that doing so was not a challenge, but this is the appropriate place to interrogate the issues.  I thank the Deputy for acknowledging our efforts.  They will not solve everything, but I hope that they can be solutions in the short term and identify a path towards a mid-term solution.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the programme support payment.  I have decided to offer it from within existing resources.  The cost totals approximately &euro;7 million, which will be spread across the sector.</p> <p>  Based on the representations by those we meet and hear from via email, we are aware of the pressure and stress that the sector has been placed under by two major elements this year - going through the re-registration process and getting ready for and becoming part of the national childcare scheme.  I originally initiated the programme support payment to acknowledge and support the additional administrative burdens, and this situation is effectively within that category.  We are fairly confident about how we have decided how much people should get.  The average is &euro;1,500, and the formula is tried and trusted.  We have used it for the programme support payment previously.  It largely has to do with the number of children that a provider has and whether they are cared for part time or full time.  There are a couple of other details, but that is generally how it is determined.  In light of that, there is a range of supports from small to very large.  In addition, if providers still find themselves in grave difficulty, we have in place a case management system that considers sustainability issues.  Pobal also works with providers on a case-by-case basis.  Providers should go to Pobal and let it know.  It will work through their business models.  There is also the possibility of additional finances for not-for-profit providers.  Providers do not have to go through any onerous process in respect of the payment.  Instead, we are doing the calculating, after which the payment is made by 28 December.</p></speech>

I am asking these questions myself and we are working through them.  It is important to give a little more fact and detail to help answer them.  Some 3,000 of the 4,600 providers are being covered by the existing insurer and 2,600 of these are part of the insurance scheme organised by Early Childhood Ireland, ECI.  We understand that the great majority of these providers face premia increases of approximately 10% in 2020.  It is important to put this on the record.  I am aware of the significant percentage of increase for some cr&egrave;ches, which the Deputy has referred to and which I will come to in a moment, but it is important to mention the other cr&egrave;ches too.  Some 2,600 of those cr&egrave;ches with the ECI face 10% increases.  Of the other 400 that are insured currently through Allianz, I am informed that they will have an increase in the region of 30%.</p></speech>

I understand that the other providers that were insured through Ironshore Europe will face increased in the region of 100%.  We have all received representations that some people are getting quoted more than that.  In general, the latter is the information we have been given.  That is extremely unfortunate.  The information we have is that the issue arises because the policies they had previously been on are not considered to be sustainable and that no insurer can take on a loss-making premium.  Just a few hours ago, I was informed that Allianz has quoted for the 1,015 providers of those who were with Ironshore Europe and is working to offer quotations to virtually all of the other providers.</p> <p>  I want to make this a little more concrete and then I will address those larger percentage increases.  We must look at the overall context.  The policies now being offered through the ECI scheme will, for example, typically cost providers between 0.5% and 0.75% of their total turnover.  I will give an example of a cr&egrave;che with 40 children.  If it pays insurance of &euro;60 per child per year, an insurance premium would be in the region of &euro;2,520.  This example is a provider which may not have paid that much before.  If the provider charges an average fee of &euro;800 per month per child it gives the provider a turnover of &euro;384,000, of which the insurance premium represents just 0.65%.  This compares favourably with other sectors.  These numbers demonstrate that the average of the standing insurer is a certain and relatively small percentage of overall turnover.  This is the way the insurance industry operates.  I was also quoted an example of one larger provider, which caters for 800 children, whose premium has risen significantly from &euro;20,000 to &euro;32,000.  Even in this case, however, the cost per child insured has risen from &euro;25 per year to &euro;40 per year.  While this is a significant rise, at 0.26% to 0.4% it is still a small proportion of the provider's turnover.  Having said all of this and while it is important to put it on the record, this is what is happening across the sector.  Clearly, there are cases where the increases are substantially more.  We know this and we hear this.</p></speech>

There are lots of things we could say but we must stay focused on the solutions.  Deputy Sherlock asked many of the questions I was going to ask had regarding the programme support payment.  People will get this payment automatically by the 28 December.  They will not have to go and fill in forms or make phone calls.  In the context of those providers for whom this payment is not sufficient, one can find that sometimes people are told to contact Pobal or the city or county childcare committee, but when they do they will not necessarily get the answers that even the Department think they might get.  We even find this with Tusla's helpline whereby people do not get anywhere with it.  Is there an entity or a person that providers can contact if they are having difficulties?</p></speech>

There is total panic this week.  It always seems to land on the shoulders of the workers and providers in the early years and childcare areas.  They always seem to get the wrong end of everything.  They had to panic about the re-registration and now we hear that Tusla will accept people after the deadline.  This causes stress and worry for people.  There are many examples.  One provider in Donegal has a premium going up from &euro;1,800 to &euro;4,275, which is a huge increase.  In Kilkenny a provider has had a &euro;2,200 increase.  A provider in Tallaght has had a &euro;1,000 increase.  While I welcome the payment support of &euro;1,500, it will be a help for some people but not for others.  We need to know where we can point people if the &euro;1,500 will not cut it.  Otherwise, services will close.  This does not just mean that children will be left without the place they rely on, it also affects parents trying to get to work and it affects the workers working in the area, and especially in rural areas where the local childcare provider may be one of the main employers.  This is very important.  It appears to me that once again the early years and childcare sector is getting the raw end of the stick.  I welcome this meeting and that the Minister came in to us at short notice.  At least it gives some recognition to these people that they are an extremely important sector.  These are my main questions.  I could say much more but we must try to focus on the solutions.</p></speech>

It is important to state that it is an average payment, in light of some of the Deputy's comments.  I am trying to be explicit in responding to what she is saying.  This has been very difficult for people, with incredible stress and lots of pressure.  A substantial portion of it comes from the additional administrative burden.  People accept that the re-registration has to be done but it is the first time re-registration has happened and some aspects of it have changed.  The introduction of the new national childcare scheme is a one-off, hopefully.  That is the reason for the payment support.  It is not to pay insurance, <i>per se</i>, it is effectively to acknowledge the pressures and stresses around what has to be done in the year, and especially in an administrative capacity.</p><p>The Deputy referred to the figure of &euro;1,500 perhaps not being sufficient.  I suppose it does not really meet all of the increased costs but there are at least two ways in which we offer support.  There is the one-off programme support payment.  If a provider is in an unsustainable position - and I have checked this with my official Ms McNally - then it must contact the local city and county childcare committee or Pobal in the first instance and if it cannot get through to contact us.  If the provider contacts the Department about the matter, we will know it is urgent.  We will ask and we will be back in touch with them because it is an important issue for them.</p><p> Going back to the questions on the increase of 300% or even more, if it is causing a sustainability concern or issue, we need to hear from the provider.  I am also indicating that I want immediately to begin to collect the information about the percentages of increase, the data, so that we better understand what is going on and what changes are now needed in respect of the sector, particularly because there is only one insurer at the moment, even though we hope that changes.  I am trying to go back to some of the questions Deputy Sherlock raised.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on something that Deputy Sherlock raised.  The Minister has answered other questions and I am not going to repeat them.  I want to pick up on the services that received the extension to next June, which was based on planning permission and fire certification.  They have that extension with Tusla as part of the re-registration.  What will happen to those 540 services regarding insurance?  Will they still be able to seek insurance cover despite the fact that they do not have fire certificates?</p></speech>

When they applied, they had to include proof of insurance for the current year, 2019, which they all had.  Some of them may have provided all the information while others will wait until next June to submit the balance.  Our understanding from the insurers is that it is not an issue and they will be given insurance quotes.  That is confirmed by the fact that as of lunchtime, we understand that all but 200 services across the country have been offered a quote by Allianz.  As the Minister said, we have looked for a further update tomorrow.  We expect that number will have significantly reduced by this evening and again by tomorrow evening.  The vast majority of services will have received quotes.</p></speech>

The 540 services that have looked for an extension to meet the deadline will also fall under the bracket of getting insurance.</p></speech>

Tusla has made it very clear that as long as service providers have submitted the documentation that was needed by 12 December, they will be on the register.  Tusla is writing to providers this week to say that they are on the register.  They will have to provide some supporting documentation in the first six months of next year but they are on the register.  That means there should be no obstacle in that regard to getting insurance.</p></speech>

There is a 10% increase in the rate for members of ECI that fall in under that group of 3,000.  For the other 1,600, this is where Deputy Sherlock talks about the twofold, threefold or fourfold increase in insurance because they are not members of ECI.  They have chosen not to be and may be members of a different organisation.  Where is this conversation over and back between now and the end of December?  They are the ones who are going to have a significant insurance increase.  A percentage of them are going to be quite high.  They are the ones that go from January to January and that are on the various radio programmes.  Will the Minister put an Oireachtas helpline in place so those providers can get on to her directly to get an answer?  Some of them are saying they cannot afford to go from &euro;3,000 to &euro;9,000.  The woman the other night on Mary Wilson's "Drive Time" show was very clear.  There was a woman on yesterday evening whose insurance cost has gone from &euro;1,500 to &euro;4,500.  They are not members of ECI.  They are the ones who are experiencing the large increase.  In this case we are talking about an increase of 200%.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.  I am aware of those cases as well.  What I am going to say is maybe to try to refashion what I am already putting out there.  I quoted the numbers of those who are not part of Early Childhood Ireland, the ones who were with Ironshore Europe.  They are the ones that are going to face the increase.  I also put on the record based on the information we have that generally a number of them are in the order of a 100% increase, which is still substantial but it is not 300% or 400%.  That is important.  What about the ones, then, for which there is this exceptional level of increase?  I have two comments  First, in terms of the overall administrative supports that we want to offer in general and in light of the pressure and so on, there will be some money there for them.  If that is &euro;3,000 to &euro;9,000, although I do not know this for a fact, I think that it is a larger childcare provider.  If it is larger, it has larger numbers of children and will get more support from us in terms of the programme support payment.  Second, if there is a major sustainability issue that they have to combat to come in to the Pobal city or county childcare committee, CCC, and if not to come to us.  I will examine whether that means providing a dedicated person to get on to, that is a technical issue and we will sort that out.</p></speech>

I wanted to address one other issue that the Minister mentioned.  It was not the personal comments about my press releases; it is to do with the comments on the critical, high, medium and low categorisation with Tusla, which she brought up in her opening statement.  She said it is a compliance level for themselves as regards reaching the bar and so on.  I have a response from Tusla dated 8 October.  I asked for a definition of the terms "critical", "high", "medium" and "low".  It is not the risk ratings, which I also have in my hand.  Risk ratings are where a service has not been reviewed or there are risk notifications taking place.  It is important just to have it noted.  A service that is categorised as "critical" has been escalated to the national registrations and enforcement panel, which is the process to remove an unauthorised service.  A service categorised as "high" is under deliberation on the management by the panel, which has not advanced to the commencement to removal or prosecution.  We are using these conversation pieces at the moment in respect of critical and high and risk ratings.  That is the barometer for how Tusla the regulator is managing up and down.  It is a fluid system and I take totally on board what Mr. Lee said.  At the same time, they have to have a barometer and that is how they are defining it.  That is my understanding as to what it is about.</p></speech>

There is enforcement escalation and the designation of risk in respect of that process; and then the internal risk register that has to do with profiling and the way they profile internally how they schedule their inspections.  Those are two separate lists or documents.  What Tusla was referring to in its correspondence with the Deputy was the enforcement escalation process, not the other, which is what I was referring to in my opening remarks.</p></speech>

I just wanted clarity on that.</p> <p>  I would like to educate myself about insurance provision.  The existing clients of the remaining underwriter will be charged between 10% and 30% more, while new clients will face an increase of 100% or possibly more, as quoted here, in insurance premiums.  This is based on what they paid in the past, relatively speaking.  Is the underwriter quoting these directly or through the channel as well as directly?  Have alternative products been priced or put on the market for these providers?</p></speech>

There are two ways that customers, childcare providers, can access them.  The first is with the ECI group scheme through Arachas, which is the broker the ECI uses.  Any provider not in the ECI can also go directly to Arachas which will get it a policy with Allianz.  A provider can also go to any insurance broker which can then contact Allianz about cover.</p></speech>

Overall, the sector has been challenging for workers and owners over the last period.  The uncertainty at this time of the year is very stressful.  We all accept that and I am grateful that the Minister agreed to meet us today.</p> <p>  On the regulation that was introduced recently, we have given greater powers to Tusla and there has been greater regulation for approximately three years.  Is there a correlation between the increase in insurance prices and the fact that the sector is more highly regulated?  I was asked that question today.</p> <p>  The State Claims Agency deals mainly with public services, primarily medical but also some others.  Is there a possibility that in extreme cases some of the liability could be passed on to the State Claims Agency?  In the past, private sector obstetricians could get cover in that way.  It would be worth exploring that for a worst case scenario. </p> <p>  As a solicitor, I often deal with insurance defence work so I am very familiar with how insurance companies operate.  Surely the insurance company could offer the same discount to all childcare providers.  I do not see why providers should be precluded from receiving the discount available to members of Early Childhood Ireland.  I do not know how many providers are members of the Early Childhood Ireland.  I know this facility exists in other sectors like the restaurant sector.  Lobby groups are providing a very good service to members by securing such deals.  I cannot get my head around the idea that the insurance companies would not afford the same discount to other providers. </p> <p>  To return to a point raised by Deputy Neville, there are numerous insurers and insurance is a very complicated business.  Most of the companies in Ireland operate out of London.  As Ms Corrigan said, the reason the broker system exists is to deal with the nuances and complexities that exist in certain areas.  We should focus on getting more companies to write business in this area because where there is only one provider, that company will hold a huge amount of power.  It is obvious that when brokers deal with these types of businesses on a regular basis they will develop a relationship with a particular insurance company.  This facilitates insurance contracts being executed quickly, etc., but it also leaves the business completely vulnerable, no more than a solicitor's office with one client has all its eggs in one basket.  One must diversify one's business base.  A core issue must be to try to get more insurance companies to write business in the area.</p></speech>

That is largely the job of officials, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy.  In general, they have been looking at this issue.  I described the kinds of data that we are trying to pull together to help support that search.  That is what needs to be done.  That is particularly appropriate in the context of the work in the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  As the Senator probably knows, 80% of the services are already members of Early Childhood Ireland.</p></speech>

If risk is reduced, then costs should also reduce as well.  Clearly, poor services may have high claims.  I have no doubt that services that are closed due to poor standards will scare insurers.  That is why our effort to link the regulation aspect with insurance is important.</p></speech>

I received two calls from parents in my constituency while walking from the D&aacute;il Chamber to this committee room.  I know all Members will have received emails.</p> <p>  I welcome the additional programme support payment and hope that will go some way towards making it a little easier for the firms that the Minister has mentioned are facing an increase of approximately 100% on the premia they were paying.  One of the biggest and most important components of this industry, when we compare what is being done across the board, is the maintenance of databases and the provision of clear information.  It would be very helpful to the Department, Pobal and others to have a central database of premia for the childcare industry.  It would allow those firms compare themselves with others that are of a similar size.  I do not trust the insurance industry.  I do not think anybody in this room does.  It has been telling us porky pies for quite some time.  That is clear from the Central Bank report and other reports.  It would help the childcare industry to have a transparent way of determining what other service providers are paying because there is no existing way for them to do that other than calling and assuming they will get the correct answer.</p> <p>  Tusla is doing its job on the regulatory side in ensuring that service providers are up to date.  To go back to one of our previous meetings about the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" programme and the standards and the reports in the public domain, this emphasises the importance of Tusla's ensuring that those reports are online and available to parents, the public and the insurers.  As we well know, if we give them any excuse, they will up the premium.  In an industry with only one service provider, we have to recognise that we must do everything we can to reduce the excuses that the insurance industry provides.</p></speech>

The Minister has not yet been able to quantify the number of high-risk providers.  As the broker or insurance provider is signalling that there will be a problem with high levels of risk, there is an awareness that a number of people will be in this category.  If that were not the case, this issue would not have been raised in the course of the deliberations.  I am concerned that no concrete solutions are being proposed as part of the Minister's efforts to address this issue.  I do not doubt that most parents make great efforts to ensure the childcare providers they entrust to look after their children on a daily basis meet all the relevant standards.  I would have thought that when the State spends tax resources on a childcare centre, it requires the provider to have public liability insurance.</p></speech>

Before I respond to the high-risk issue raised by the Deputy, I would like to say I understand from Tusla that as of 12 December last, almost all the providers had been registered.  They had insurance certificates at that time, but those certificates do not necessarily mean that providers are covered from January onwards.  Tusla needs to know whether every service is insured.</p></speech>

The quickest way for them to find out is to ask providers whether they have sorted their insurance for January.  Most of them have sorted it, or are about to sort it in the next few hours and days.  That is the quickest way for parents to be assured about the insurance status of childcare providers and be able to enjoy Christmas thereafter.  A parent who is told by a provider that it does not have insurance, but is working on it and hoping to have it sorted in the near future, will get an update in due course.  We hope that the number of cases in which difficult situations will have to be faced in January will be tiny.  The numbers could be very tiny.</p></speech>

Virtually all of the providers, but not quite all of them, are registered.  In order for those that are registered to have been accepted in the first instance, they will have had to submit some initial documents that are not very hard to provide, one of which is an insurance certificate.  Tusla inspectors have information on how long each insurance certificate lasts.</p></speech>

I am conscious that we are running short on time.  I asked the Minister about meeting the company that withdrew in the context of the need to collect much-needed information.  What was the reason or rationale for its withdrawal?  Do we know whether it related to claims?  Why did the provider in question withdraw?  What needs to change to encourage and incentivise other people into the industry?  I would like to pick up on a comment that the Minister made.  When there is a monopoly, it is a real worry.  People inside the ECI structure are already getting more favourable insurance premiums than people outside that structure.  Where there is a monopoly, there is no competition and there is an opportunity to overcharge.</p> <p>  The Minister has said that "Over the course of the past year to date, there were three parliamentary questions .... tabled to my Department on insurance".  The dogs on the street have known for the past two years that insurance is crippling business across every sector.  It is at the Minister's door now.  Unfortunately, I do not believe the momentum is there to bring in the necessary reforms.  The Minister will have to ensure the necessary reforms are introduced to incentivise more people into the market.  Although the announcement that has been made today is welcome, it will be no more than a sticking plaster if we do not address this issue by incentivising more providers to enter the market and to bring insurance premiums down.  We should not have to be using tax resources to supplement the insurance industry, but that is what is happening now.</p></speech>

As I indicated earlier, I have information to suggest that increases in the region of 100% represent one of the reasons for certain companies deciding to move or leave.  I have not met them directly, but that is the information I have received from them.  We know from other sources that increases can be higher than that.  We have been told that such increases have arisen because the previous policies were not considered to be sustainable.  The insurer was taking on a loss-making premium.  That is the information we have already received with regard to the insurer that has left.  I think it is correct.</p> <p>  I have indicated some of the ways in which we will contribute to the reform work that is being done in the Department of Finance to ensure insurance is available to facilitate the services we need to deliver.  For example, we have information and data from a childcare perspective.  We also know that the seriousness of the issue has not been evident in the childcare sector up to now.  I think this is the case.  We have the information and we are moving forward in this area.  Ironshore was bought out.  There is information to suggest that costs reduced by 40% when it entered the market, although this has yet to be verified.  That may not have been sustainable.  We have some information.  I remind members of the committee that the programme support payment is made to recognise the administrative burden on providers with regard to registration under the national childcare scheme, etc.  I take the points that have been made about what we need to do to move forward.  We have some information.  We have had some engagement.  We need to have that engagement.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to engage with it on the findings of our review.  I am joined today by Dr. Patrick Walker, deputy lead assessor of the RCOG review.  We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the women or their next of kin who consented to participate in this review.  We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the cytology laboratory at University Hospital Monklands in Scotland and other consultant cytopathologists, the members of the expert panel, including our two lay representatives, and our project manager at the RCOG for assistance throughout this process.</p> <p>  After a complex and demanding exercise, the college had met the objectives defined in the terms of reference with the completion of 1,308 individual reports for women or next of kin by October 2019 and the publication of our aggregate report on December 3 2019.  The timing of the final report was dictated by the requirement to ensure that all the women or next of kin had received their individual report prior to the aggregate report being published.  At this point we wish to state how acutely aware we are of the impact that screening failures have had on the lives of affected women and their families.  We would also like to recognise the 103 women in our review who have died, and will neither be able to read their individual reports nor the final RCOG report.  We hope the individual reports will provide some service to next of kin.  </p> <p>  The primary purpose of the individual reports was to provide consenting women or next of kin with a transparent and independent analysis of their CervicalCheck cytology slides prior to their diagnosis of cancer, along with an explanation of the findings and an independent conclusion regarding the clinical implications of any discordant result.  Throughout this process, we felt it was of the utmost importance to obtain input from participating women with regard to the content, tone and style of letter that would convey their individual reports.  In May 2019, we met a group of women and one next of kin to discuss our proposed style of letter.  We received broad approval and suggestions, which we adopted.  The group also conveyed a strong message that any women who so wish should have access to an appointment with a health professional to receive their reports.  We were in full agreement and immediately conveyed this to the HSE.  </p> <p>  The primary purpose of the final report was to aggregate the findings of the cytology slide review that directly compared the RCOG readings of 1,659 slides with those of CervicalCheck.  By way of background, the slide review panel was comprised of screeners from the University Hospital Monklands cytology centre in Scotland as well as consultant staff actively working in the English NHS cervical screening programme.  The role of the screeners was to identify those slides considered to be negative, that is, showing no abnormality.  All slides considered to show any abnormal results were reviewed by a consultant.  If there was disagreement with the CervicalCheck result, a second consultant read the slides.  If there was disagreement between the first and second consultants, the slides would be viewed by a consensus panel over a multiheaded microscope to arrive at a final result. </p> <p>  With regard to process, those reading the slides were always blind to the CervicalCheck result.  However, for reasons laid out in the report, seeding the slides blindly among routine day-to-day laboratory work would have been impracticable.  We believe our methods were thorough and produced reliable results.  In both the report and in explanatory notes to each participant, we have acknowledged that in a slide review of this type the detection of abnormalities will be enhanced.  Our role was not to assess the performance of the CervicalCheck laboratories but to inform women whether or not the review had found that abnormal cells had been missed.  In those cases where there was discordance between the CervicalCheck and the RCOG review, the college sought to determine whether this had impacted on the clinical outcome in terms of failure to prevent cancer or diagnose it at an earlier stage.</p><p>This was done by the expert panel determining the likely quantum of delay in the diagnosis of cancer engendered by missing abnormal cells, or undercalling cells in terms of grade, and applying this quantum to a set protocol of time intervals and stage diagnosis.</p><p> The RCOG expert panel felt the individual letters should include not only the results of the slide review but also the effect any discordant reading had on a delay in diagnosis.  In the majority of cases, the expert panel considered there was no such effect but in half of the discordant cases the panel concluded there had been a missed opportunity to prevent or diagnose at an earlier stage.  We applied scrutiny to those cases where prolonged colposcopy management was identified and found that in a quarter of such cases colposcopy management was suboptimal, sometimes further complicated by discordant cytology and sometimes not.</p><p> The slide review formed the basis of providing women with individual reports.  The thoroughness and quality of the review combined with full disclosure of the findings means women can have confidence in their individual reports.  The expert panel made it absolutely clear that these reports are not a judgment with respect to medical negligence and that such a matter would require others to determine.  An explanatory note to this effect was included with the individual reports.  This compilation of individual reports disclosing the findings and implications, together with an aggregate report based on a point in time slide review of more than 1,000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer, is, as far as the authors can determine, unique in scale and scope.  It represents a transparent approach that others can reference and with which future comparison can be made.</p><p> We chose to compare our slide review findings with the English audit, which is the only other published large-scale slide review conducted as part of a national cervical screening protocol.  Both involved slides of liquid-based cytology and both involved the slides being reviewed in the knowledge that cancer had been the outcome.  The intention was to determine whether the findings of the RCOG review represented an outlier or was in line with what might be expected.  In the event, it was the latter.  The findings of the RCOG review were striking in the sense that a high proportion of discordant readings were found, many with significant implications.  However, this was not unexpected, not only because similar discordant rates were found in the English NHS cervical cancer audit but also because the natural history of cervical cancer indicates that it is highly probable the cervix would have shed abnormal cells for a number of years prior to the diagnosis of cancer, whether it was screen detected or not.</p><p> Our review, therefore, illustrates the limitations of cervical cytology rather than pointing to a screening service that falls below what might be expected.  Data published by National Cancer Registry Ireland shows falling incidence and deaths from cervical cancer since CervicalCheck was established in 2008.  These endpoints are the cardinal signs of effective cervical screening.  The findings of our review back this up, with a high proportion of early-stage cancer identified in the review cohort, which indicates that screening undoubtedly saved the lives of many women in the review.</p><p> To address concerns expressed regarding the verification process of finalising individual reports, we have submitted a detailed statement to the committee.  When these concerns were initially raised with us in October, we offered to meet participants and patient representatives and came to Dublin to outline the process in detail and answer any questions.  In a complex and demanding exercise involving more than 1,000 women and 20,000 individual data items, including 3,300 smear results, we acknowledge there is capacity for error.  As we note in the statement, in a very small number of cases, totalling fewer than five, it has been necessary to issue supplementary reports because new information came to light, and in two of these cases the conclusion was updated.  While these isolated incidents are regrettable they in no way impact the overall conclusions or recommendations laid out in our aggregate report.</p><p> We would be concerned if unfounded criticism of our evidence-based report undermined trust in our findings and confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.  This could have the effect of diminishing coverage, which could only place more lives at risk.  It is very important that the benefits of cervical screening in the existing programme are accurately portrayed in terms of public health.  Vaccination against human papilloma virus was introduced in Ireland for early adolescent girls in 2010 and for adolescent boys this year.  As already demonstrated in Australia and Scotland, where screening begins at 20, with high coverage this could reduce considerably the incidence of abnormal smears and, therefore, pre-cancer in young women and will result in a further reduction in deaths from cervical cancer.</p><p> We believe the RCOG review has provided all eligible women with open disclosure of their slide review and has provided an aggregate picture of the overall result.  Our conclusion that the CervicalCheck programme is working in terms of effectiveness, cytology and colposcopy is supported by incidents in mortality data published by National Cancer Registry Ireland, which demonstrates year-on-year falls since 2010 following the establishment of the CervicalCheck programme.  The premier objectives in cervical screening are being met and our report should restore trust in cervical screening in Ireland.  With high coverage, the CervicalCheck programme, which will soon incorporate primary HPV testing, combined with the impact of high coverage vaccination, should ensure that cervical cancer prevention in Ireland will become as good as it can be and cervical cancer deaths should eventually decline to the point where they become a rarity.</p><p> We were privileged to have been tasked with undertaking this important piece of work, which we hope will have benefited the women who participated in the review.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it this morning.  I am pleased to update it on the outcome of the independent expert panel review of CervicalCheck, and we have just heard some of the details, which we established last year following the Government's decision of May, and the current position on the national screening programme as it pertains.  I am joined by Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary, Dr. Ronan Glynn, the deputy chief medical officer and Ms Celeste O'Callaghan, principal officer.<br/><br/>As we know, the failure to disclose the results of the CervicalCheck retrospective audit to women and families, which emerged in April last year, resulted in widespread concern about the programme.  Since then, the Department's overriding priority has been to ensure the viability and sustainability of our national cervical screening programme so it can continue to save lives and improve outcomes for cervical cancer.<br/><br/>Neither screening nor HPV vaccination alone are enough and we need both to work together in tandem if we are to make cervical cancer a rare disease in Ireland, which is our policy objective.  In pursuit of this goal, the Department has engaged very closely with the HSE and, in particular, the national screening service on the implementation of the various Government decisions and the range of very difficult strategic and operational issues faced by the programme.<br/><br/>It is important to recognise, however, that this work has involved multiple other stakeholders coming together and working collectively through the many challenges that arise, as well as those who continue to deliver the service in a hugely pressurised environment.  This includes patient advocates, patient representatives and clinicians.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the commitment, input and expertise of each of them.  Most particularly, I thank the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which, at our request, agreed to undertake what has been an enormously complex and challenging task to give individual women in the first instance, or their next of kin, the opportunity to have the benefit of expert independent assurance with regard to their individual cases.<br/><br/>Over the past 18 months, we have moved from a period of crisis to an emerging more stable environment.  The necessary laboratory capacity has been secured to ensure continuation of the programme following complex negotiations led by the HSE.  Recruitment for key posts that will strengthen the governance of the screening service has been undertaken and investment is ongoing in the development of national laboratory capacity, colposcopy services and the introduction of HPV primary immunisation, to add to the introduction of HPV immunisation for boys during the course of 2019.<br/><br/>From the perspective of women and families involved in this issue, an <i>ex gratia</i>scheme to address the issue of non-disclosure was put in place as well as a package of health and social care supports.</p><p>In the past 18 months, we have had two independent reviews of the programme: the scoping inquiry initially led by Dr. Scally, which concluded earlier this year, and now the independent expert panel review led by RCOG, which concluded two weeks ago.  Dr. Scally provided the final report in September of last year and a supplementary report in May of this year.  He found no evidence of deficiencies in screening quality but he did identify a significant number of management and governance issues and made a total of 58 recommendations to address these.  A comprehensive implementation plan was developed in late 2018 for these actions with approximately 170 actions across the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland.  Significant progress has been made overall with in excess of two thirds of these actions now completed.  That is in the oversight of the CervicalCheck steering group.  Quarterly progress reports on this are published on the website of the Department of Health.  </p><p> Patient representatives make a significant contribution on an ongoing basis to the work of the Department, the HSE and health agencies, and the patient voice has been central to our work, not just in respect of CervicalCheck but all of our work in the past 18 months.  Patient representatives have been active participants in the CervicalCheck steering committee chaired by the Department and contributed significant time also to working with the HSE in regard to the many operational issues arising over the past year and a half that the executive is grappling with.  </p><p> Ms Lorraine Walsh resigned from her work on the steering committee and with individuals and committees in the HSE and CervicalCheck at the end of October.  The Minister has thanked her for all of her work.  Her significant input to the work of the steering committee since its inception was acknowledged at its November meeting.  We have the opportunity now to acknowledge that and thank her for the work she has done with us during the course of that committee.  The Department is examining how best to provide necessary structures that will allow for appropriate selection and compensation policies to be put in place to ensure that patient representatives are appropriately recognised and remunerated for their work and contribution to health service design and reform.  International models of patient representation are being examined as part of this work, which is at an advanced stage.  </p><p> On 3 December, the aggregate report of the international clinical panel review was published following the Government decision taken that day.  The first key objective of the review was to provide women, or their next of kin, with independent clinical assurance about the timing of their diagnosis and treatment.  In total, 1,038 women chose to participate in the review and this was a very welcome number, which allowed robust and comprehensive analysis of the programme.  The process of communicating individual reports to women or their next of kin commenced in late September.  All of those who wished to do so have now received a report at an individual level setting out the reports findings.  We were keen to ensure that individuals in the first instance have the opportunity to hear from their individual clinician before any aggregate report could be published.  </p><p> There is no doubt that this has been a difficult process for many women or their next of kin particularly where, sadly, a woman may have died.  The Department has engaged closely through this process with the HSE in its planning for a communication process that is as sensitive and supportively delivered as possible.  We recognise the significant work that has been undertaken by the HSE, including the clinical need for the national women and infants programme and the engagement of colposcopists in particular on whom we are enormously dependent to support this process around the country. </p><p> The second key objective of the review was to publish the aggregate report, which includes recommendations, where appropriate, that have the aim of improving care for women.  In that context, the concern that first arose in April of last year was an important dimension of the work of the independent panel and adds to the work undertaken by the separate scoping inquiry reported on by Dr. Scally.  Based on its overall findings the expert panel has stated, and it is important to reiterate, that it is not an understatement to say for many women who participated in this review screening undoubtedly has saved their lives; that there is no doubt that the programme has been successful and has worked effectively; that women can have confidence in the CervicalCheck programme; and that their findings at a population level are in line with those seen in the English cervical screening programme and should not be viewed as a cause for concern with respect to the population overall.  We regard these conclusions as very welcome given the importance of cervical screening from a public health point of view.  We know it saves lives and it is vital, therefore, that women have confidence in the programme.  The public can be reassured that the programme is operating effectively now.  As we know, the panel has made ten recommendations, which generally align with the work being undertaken in both organisations, the HSE, and the Department, including in regard to the recommendations of Dr. Scally.  The Minister has written to the HSE and the National Cancer Registry in respect of the implementation of those recommendations.  The independent panel's report also concluded that many of the women who participated in the review are alive today because of CervicalCheck.  That conclusion underlines once again the crucial importance of ensuring a strong, viable and sustainable cervical screening programme while working to ensure that cervical cancer becomes a rare disease in Ireland, an objective we all share.  </p><p> The expert panel and Dr. Scally said that through a combination of screening and vaccination together with good uptake of both we can achieve this goal.  The extension of the HPV vaccine to boys in September of this year and the introduction of HPV primary screening in quarter 1 next year are key steps towards that goal.  Funding for both was provided in 2019.  We will continue to engage closely with the HSE on its continued roll-out and implementation.  </p><p> In addition, the focus remains on the continued implementation of the recommendations of the scoping inquiry and the implementation of the ten recommendations contained in the RCOG report.  Through the combined effects of all these elements, we will have the opportunity to ensure that Ireland has a world class cervical cancer screening programme that will enable us to make cervical cancer a rare disease within a generation.</p></speech>

I am joined by Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer in the HSE, Dr. Lorraine Doherty, clinical director for CervicalCheck, Ms Celine Fitzgerald,  interim CEO for the national screening service and Dr. Peter McKenna, the clinical director for the women and infants programme.  We continue to address and manage all issues that have arisen in the programme since April 2018.  The briefing submitted in advance of the meeting to the committee updates it on these key areas of priority.</p> <p>  Our information line and client services unit continues to provide information to women and their families.  We also support women and their families in the provision of access to their records and ensuring women get their slides from laboratories where required for legal review.  The client services unit continues to support this process and we have provided healthcare records to 665 women and slides to 388 women, families or their representatives.  We continue to support the 221+ group through our community liaison officers who support women and their families with the provision of the support packages following the Government decision of May 2018.  We also work closely with the 221+ patient representatives across a wide range of areas and are very grateful for their guidance and input to the screening programmes.  It is helping to make a real difference.  We have just completed a patient and public inclusion plan for screening services.  This was developed in conjunction with our patient representatives and was recently launched.  We are very grateful to the three lead patient representatives who are part of the team.  Some key actions within the plan include appointment of a full-time patient inclusion officer, extension of the screening patient panel, patients on key committees and a model for patient inclusion.  We also have patient representatives on the HSE steering group for screening, Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh, and would like to acknowledge the work of Lorraine Walsh, who recently stepped down from the HSE steering group.  Despite her own difficult illness, Lorraine has been an invaluable and supportive patient advocate and has been key in making the changes necessary to sustain cervical screening in this country.  The HSE would like to formally thank her and wish her well in the future.  </p> <p>  The HSE has contributed significantly to the development of an implementation plan in collaboration with other State agencies in response to the Scally scoping inquiry recommendations.  An oversight group was established in the HSE with a senior manager appointed to support and ensure continued implementation of the Scally report.  At the end of November, a total of 95 actions have been completed by the HSE from a total of 116 within the overall plan with the remainder in progress.  Examples of progress to date include key appointments, governance improvements in the national screening service and CervicalCheck, an organisational review of risk management structures has been completed and a report setting out a revised approach to risk management across the organisation has been approved by the HSE board.  A review of the HSE's healthcare record management policy is also due to conclude shortly.</p> <p>  One of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations included setting out the future approach to interval cancer audit.  The HSE established an oversight group for this project with expert groups.  The expert groups are independently chaired and comprise patients, patient advocates, patient ethicists, screening clinicians and international experts.  The expert groups have considered international best practice as part of the scope and the work continues to be progressed with a target to complete early in 2020.  The recommendations of the RCOG aggregate report in relation to interval cancer audit will now be incorporated in this work.  An interim revision of the HSE open disclosure policy was published in June 2019 and the HSE remains committed to ensuring the operation of open disclosure throughout the organisation by continuing to roll out its national training programme through the national open disclosure office.  An open disclosure governance steering group chaired by the national director for quality improvement continues to provide the governance and the oversight to the operation of open disclosure throughout the HSE.  The governance framework in the group will provide leadership for the evaluation of the audit of compliance with the policy.</p><p>All recommendations for procurement have now been implemented and the HSE also continues to work with medical training bodies in developing an open disclosure in communication skills training programme.  <br/><br/>Turnaround times for the reporting of results are now running at an average of six weeks.  We hope to sustain the turnaround times at this level going forward.  This will ensure that women and their GPs get their results in a reasonable time period, which is one of the key performance indicators for the programme.<br/><br/>The key risk to enable cervical screening to continue in Ireland was the extension of the laboratory contracts.  The HSE reached agreement with both the Coombe and Quest to enable continuity of the programme.  The development of the national cervical screening laboratory was included in our recent HSE capital plan and will enable a better balance between public and private laboratory capacity provision.  A project steering group and team are now in place with building and workforce plans developed.  Additional support has been procured to enable the project to be accelerated as much as possible.  The new laboratory is already at the planning stage.  While we are planning for a rapid build programme, it will still take a number of years to implement, primarily due to the challenge of retaining and recruiting suitably qualified staff.  This challenge cannot be underestimated in our environment. <br/><br/>Hospital colposcopy services remain under pressure with increased referrals and the requirement for increased consultation time.  The HSE women and infants programme has recently completed an impact assessment on hospital colposcopy services that identified some immediate resource requirements.  Funding was included in the 2019 national service plan and this was rolled out to the clinics to support additional service sessions, to increase capacity and improve waiting times.  We continue to work with the hospital colposcopy clinics and a joint working group between the national women and infants programme, acute hospitals and CervicalCheck has been established to support this process. <br/><br/>The programme, after a long search, has just appointed a national colposcopy adviser.  While we have secured support from our hospital colposcopy services on particular projects, this has been a significant gap over the last year. <br/><br/><b></b>We are continuing to implement our plan to introduce HPV primary screening.  A project team has been in place since last year and there are seven work streams involved in the project.  We remain committed to implementing HPV primary screening, with the target for implementation in the first quarter of 2020. <br/><br/>Since we last appeared before the committee, we have reduced some of the major risks to the project through the reduction in the backlog and securing laboratory providers who can provide the testing service.  The implementation project, however, remains complex, with a number of risks which we continue to actively manage including IT system changes, laboratory preparedness and to ensure sufficient availability of colposcopy services to address future demand from HPV primary screening. <br/><br/>The introduction of the HPV vaccine for boys in September 2019 combined with the existing uptake of the HPV vaccine by girls will help reduce incidences of cervical cancer and other cancers.  Evidence from elsewhere in the world shows that this combination of HPV vaccine and HPV primary screening will have the impact of eliminating cervical cancer over the next two to three decades and in the shorter term, ensuring that women present with earlier disease and are much less likely to progress to cancer.<br/><br/>While recruitment and retention of staff remains a challenge for our screening services, we have made significant progress.  We have completed a review of the organisational design of the national screening service and one of the key actions was the appointment of a permanent CEO.  The permanent CEO position within the national screening service has been advertised and an interim CEO for screening services is in place while we recruit a permanent CEO for the service. <br/><br/>In addition, we have appointed a permanent quality and risk manager for screening services and have filled additional new posts in quality and risk management.  A deputy laboratory co-ordinator is now in place to strengthen the laboratory capacity in the programme. <br/><br/>We have recently appointed a CervicalCheck programme manager and are concluding the recruitment of a deputy CervicalCheck programme manager.  A CervicalCheck colposcopy adviser has just been appointed and we are continuing to progress the recruitment of a CervicalCheck primary care adviser and colposcopy nurse, which will further strengthen the clinical input to the programme.  We have also recruited a permanent director of public health for the screening service and continue to make efforts in recruiting public health specialists to support the work of the director.  This will strengthen the public health input to the programme.  Posts in communications and HR have also been advertised, in addition to a number of other programme support roles.  We will ensure that the recruitment of all posts from the service workforce plan continues to be prioritised. <br/><br/><b></b>The HSE provided support to the independent international expert panel review undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, RCOG, which was established by the Minister for Health, following a Government decision for women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HSE supported the consent process, established a national help desk, developed an eligible data set with the national cancer registry, implemented a client management system to support RCOG, co-ordinating the release of slides and medical records to RCOG and supported the provision of individual reports to women.  <br/><br/>The HSE put a verification process in place to ensure that an anonymised report went to the correct woman for whom the HSE held her name and address.  This was an administrative process to ensure that the right report went to the right woman.  All women, or their next of kin, who wished to do so have now received their individual report.  Throughout the process of communicating individual reports, the HSE&rsquo;s focus has been on ensuring this is done as appropriately and sensitively as possible.  <br/><br/>The aggregate report was published following the Government meeting of Tuesday, 3 December and provided further assurance about the quality of the cervical screening programme.  It contained ten recommendations which are being incorporated into our existing overall implementation plan.  The report&rsquo;s key findings included that there was as expected a high proportion of very early screen detected cancer, which has saved many lives and concluded that the CervicalCheck programme was working effectively. <br/><br/>The review did find for a number of women a discordance with their original CervicalCheck results and RCOG set out the reasons for this in their aggregate report.  We are conscious of how difficult it has been for many women and their families who were part of the review.  The HSE will continue to provide meetings where required and an information line for those women and families who were part of the review.  We will continue to provide this support for people impacted by the review. <br/><br/>Overall, the conclusion of the RCOG review is another milestone for the programme.  It completes a major programme of operational support and provides welcome assurance about screening quality as we continue to stabilise and strengthen our screening services.  I want to assure members that the HSE is absolutely focused on ensuring these important public health programmes continue to save lives.  All possible resources are being directed at this challenge.</p></speech>

I have a lot to get through.  I want to say to our guests from RCOG, the Department of Health and the HSE that we have a serious issue when the lady who commenced all of this, Vicky Phelan, says she has no confidence in this report.  The two patient advocates who were before the committee last night also said they have no confidence in this report.  That is their opinion and they aired it intensely and publicly and that is before all of the information that they have has been made public.  Those people cannot put some of that information out into the public forum because there are individual cases involved etc., but that is deeply worrying.  </p> <p>  The testimony of Lorraine Walsh yesterday was also deeply worrying.  I will not get into it, but I would like the representatives of the Department of Health to reflect on what she said before the committee.  I want to get the best for everyone out of this and am, and will continue to be, as big an advocate as anyone for improving our screening programme.  The harrowing testimony we heard yesterday was upsetting.  It is something I will reflect on, in whatever role I have, in the future.</p> <p>  Professor Kitchener referred to unfounded criticism in his opening statement and I thought that an unfortunate choice of phrase because the criticism that has been forthcoming, particularly from Ms Walsh, has been fully documented and sent to us.  While Professor Kitchener may not believe that there are overt issues, there is certainly validity in, and direct evidence of, some of those criticisms.  I have correspondence from Professor Kitchener in which he apologised for failings.</p> <p>  We only received Dr. Holohan's opening statement this morning.  That is a tactic used by a number of individuals - not necessarily Dr. Holohan - of which I am getting tired.  I was taken by the fact that Dr. Holohan's statement did not reflect that, although progress has been made and I have no doubt about that, we have also had major issues.  I ask our guests to read the statement of Stephen Teap yesterday because, in about three paragraphs, he summed up all the issues.  The Taoiseach has apologised on behalf of the people of Ireland for what happened.</p><p>Even Dr. Scally's recommendations have not all been implemented.  It is not all rosy in the garden.  Dr. Holohan's opening statement did not proportionately reflect that we still have a range of issues, which is of concern.<br/><br/>These are the terms of reference for RCOG.  Terms of reference are very important.  We are here to discuss RCOG.  These were individual reports for all the women.  We have had the first and second Scally reports.  We know what we need to do and we know the recommendations.  We needed an aggregated report statistically from RCOG, as is listed here - nothing more and nothing less.  Some people have jumped to take certain findings out of that which were not part of this and I am not sure are helpful.<br/><br/>Professor Kitchener said today that some people have an issue with the credibility of the reporting.  Let me say this straight: I agree with many people.  I have no issue with RCOG's clinical analysis.  My issues relate to the reporting and statistical management - how all those data have been managed.  I also have an issue with the process by which data have been shared, the reporting mechanism and whether the crosschecking of databases has been accurate.  Professor Kitchener said that among all these women there have been fewer than five supplementary reports and two cases where the conclusion has been updated.<br/><br/>Let us start at the beginning.  On 21 November, Professor Kitchener said:</p><blockquote>	Following last Friday's alert regarding a partial report [I will get back to the phrase &quot;partial report&quot; in a while] we conducted an investigation to ensure all of the results had been uploaded on our database.  I am writing to confirm there was no other valid slide result from batch 35 or indeed any other batch that has not been uploaded on to our database. </blockquote><p>Therefore, there was one issue on 21 November.  Following on from that Damien McCallion, who was complimented extensively by those who appeared yesterday evening, as was the HSE - I want to acknowledge that, wrote to Lorraine Walsh on 3 December and stated:</p><blockquote>	I want to make you aware that I know that RCOG have confirmed that no other women were affected by the issue which affected your initial report last Friday, which you have spoken about quite publicly and that that came in yesterday. </blockquote><p>Therefore, we have confirmation again on 3 December.<br/><br/>Lorraine Walsh appeared on &quot;Prime Time&quot; on 3 December and an unsolicited email came into the programme.  The unsolicited email was from Emma Gilgunn-Jones who is director of media and public relations for RCOG.  It stated:</p><blockquote>	In order to ensure the correct letter was sent to the correct patient using the standard format ...  For three women, supplementary reports were issued because new information came to light.  In only one of these cases was the conclusion updated. </blockquote><p>Therefore, we have now gone from one to three where only one case was updated.  Today we have five supplementary reports and two cases where it was updated.  The pattern is increasing all the time.  Statistically I know the number of women involved.  However, why was this information not available initially?  Why has this been updated again today?  It is a cause of concern. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121800002#F00300"><p>I have just one supplementary question.  In the report regarding Lorraine Walsh's issue, which is public which is why we talk about it, it stated that as part of this process there was verification.  We all know there was a whole range of reports done by RCOG which had to be sent by the HSE back to all the women.  At one phase maybe 40% were sent through.  All the databases were checked and in the case of Lorraine Walsh, her slide had been reviewed.  If she had not come back - in fairness to Damien McCallion and others in the HSE - to this day we would not have got a second report.  That is where the issue is here.  It was only because she knew what she was talking about that the HSE was in a position to send two fantastic ladies down to her 24 hours later.  It was only that she knew what she was talking about and she knew there had to be a problem.  If it is in that case, how do we know it is not so in other cases?  Today Professor Kitchener has told us there are five reviews and now there is a second case.  That is my first question.</p></speech>

I am aware that some people have expressed no confidence.  I want to be clear that we, as the Department, in terms of how we received this report, how we have briefed Government, how we have briefed the Minister and how we have articulated in public, express full confidence in the findings and recommendations in the report and the processes.  I want to be clear about that.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to some of the evidence that was offered to the committee last night.  We are aware of that and, of course, we will reflect on it.  I want to make clear that we see as an organisation the role of patient representatives involving them in committees and processes as we do deliberately as a very important one that enhances all of the work and did so in this case.  I pay tribute to the individuals who appeared last night and the other patients who have played an important role in ensuring that we have made progress on the implementation of as many recommendations as we have.</p> <p>  I do not wish to come across in any sense as suggesting that we are complacent or that we do not think that there is further work to be done.  Even when we get to the point of full implementation of the recommendations from the Scally report, there will still be further work to be done and oversight needed to ensure that we continue to achieve progress in terms of incidence of mortality around cervical cancer.  I want to be absolutely clear and unequivocal about that.</p></speech>

I used that expression because the context here is that there are well over 1,000 letters.

I will move on to the mislabelling of slides.  As Professor Kitchener will understand, there is grave concern about this.  I have read the explanations and considered the validity of them.  Lorraine Walsh is one of the two patient advocates who were part of the process themselves and, in fairness, she put herself forward as advocate.  Vicky Phelan was the other person who was part of the process.  Three sets of slides were mislabelled and two of them happened to belong to those two women.  The third lady remains anonymous.  Statistically, that is incredible and gives cause for public concern.  We are to understand that in the case of Vicky and Lorraine, their labels were taken off and put on incorrectly, Vicky's on Lorraine's set and <i>vice versa</i>.  How could that happen, statistically, to two of the three women, out of a total of 1,038 cases reviewed?</p></speech>

He might take notes and then respond.  I want his opinions on these three questions; I am not trying to catch him out.  First, I do not understand how we did not have three categories of slides and, on reflection and having read the report, the panel really would have been better off if that had been the case.  The idea that where slides were not available - reports were issued to women to say that they were concordant - is an error.  The panel should reflect on that, and I say so genuinely.  I can see why the reviewers did what they did, but there should have been three categories, namely, concordant, discordant and unknown or whatever other name the panel might wish to give it.  When a slide is not available, one cannot give an assurance to women that it is concordant.  Based on the date and information, that is the conclusion to which the reviewers came, but, in reality, the slide was not available.  For future reference, and in this scenario, I am arguing that this was an error.  I say that genuinely because several people have come to me and made that argument and a lot us who have reflected on the matter would agree with it.  I am interested in Professor Kitchener's opinion in this regard.</p> <p>  I do not have the answers to my other questions.  Again, I am seeking Professor Kitchener's opinions on these points.  My second question relates to the cervical screening programme in Britain.  The quality statement in respect of the 2018-2019 programme, which was published on 21 November 2019, states: "There is generally no accepted or expected level of false negative in the NHS Cervical Screening Programme."  On page 11 of the RCOG report it is stated that a 30% false negative rate is an international standard.  For the public watching and for confidence levels generally, how do we extrapolate and correlate those two statements?  I am asking this question because it seems to be a real issue for people.</p> <p>  My final question is a follow-up to my second question.  Ms Marie Culliton, a past president of the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine has stated her view that if some slides which are unavailable for review are classified as concordant, then the 30% rate for negative readings subsequently reclassified as showing high-grade changes has to be incorrect.  In other words, the percentage is possibly higher.  Does Professor Kitchener agree or disagree with Ms Culliton?</p></speech>

We all will be reflecting on what we have said and written.  I see the logic behind Deputy Kelly's suggestion and, while considering these matters since the report, I have wondered about the categories.  However, I have one or two points to make in this regard.  The number of patients the Deputy is talking about amounts to fewer than 2% of the entire cohort.</p></speech>

They are very important as individuals.  That is my point - that what we were doing was writing an individual letter to an individual woman about her individual circumstances.  Those women who came under the partial report category do not form a homogeneous group.  There were cases where a report was unavailable because it could not be shipped over.  Some of those reports later became available, as we know.  There were cases where the slides were missing and could not be located by the laboratories to be sent over.  I would have to check the data but I think I am right in saying in three cases designated as partial, it was because the report was "inadequate" or smear-reporting category P1.  This was not a homogeneous group where one could say that all the cases could be put in one basket.  However, I take the Deputy's point.</p> <p>  With regard to the concordant issue, there may be a slight misunderstanding.  Some women had multiple slides in the review.  So, a woman could have an unavailable or missing slide and we would never make any comment on whether that slide was in agreement or disagreement.  However, if she had another slide that reviewed as showing high-grade changes, that smear was concordant.  In writing the individual letter to the woman, those terms were explained in the narrative, but there would not be a circumstance that an unavailable or missing slide was categorised as concordant or discordant.  A letter would outline information in that regard if a concordant slide had been reported and was part of the patient's entire history.  I understand the force of the Deputy's concern-----</p></speech>

The 30% figure is derived from a paper we cited in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>which compared women who had been screened with women who had not been screened.  It is clear that screening affords a very high level of protection, and that level of protection happens to be a little higher in older women than in younger women.  All in all, there is a figure of around 30% for where screening fails to prevent cancer.</p><p>The reference Deputy Kelly makes to the proportion of false negative smears that might be expected is a different question and a very difficult one to address, because to evaluate the proportion of false negative smears, one would have to undertake a thorough examination of a large number of women with varying smear results, colposcope them to establish the actual state of the cervix, and determine in what proportion the smears had been false negative.  That would be perhaps an important figure to know but an extremely difficult figure to arrive at reliably.</p><p> It is important that the public does not conflate a 30% inability of cervical screening to prevent cervical cancer in a population and any suggestion of 30% false negatives in routine cervical screening.</p></speech>

The Deputy also asked about the 30% that we reclassified, I think on behalf of someone, as high grade among our negatives.  Among our negatives, just over half are reviewed as negative.  That is very close to the figure that was identified in the English audit - just over 50%.  Out of the remaining half, approximately one third were classified as low-grade abnormalities and two thirds as high-grade abnormalities.  Therefore, the majority of non-negative smears on review were, in fact, high-grade and as a proportion of the total happen to be 30%, an entirely different 30% from the two sets of 30% we have just discussed.</p></speech>

There are so many campaigners on this who have given of their own time.  As I stated yesterday, they gave up their time with their families to do that work.  Has Dr. Holohan any comment as to why not all of the campaigners now have either confidence in this report or will continue with this process?  Will that undermine the work that everyone here is trying to get done?  It is unfortunate.  I would be interested to hear Dr. Holohan's comments on that.  It is a grave and serious matter and I wonder if Dr. Holohan shares those sentiments.</p></speech>

I heard them.  I stated earlier that we regard the input and the role of patient representatives as important to the work that we do in the Department in particular relating to the work that we have done as part of this committee.  I have seen the comments that have been made.</p> <p>  I am aware that people are not in a position to express confidence and they have said so publicly in relation to the findings.  I do not want to discuss individual cases but if I was in a situation where two separate errors in respect of myself had been made in a review, if I am honest, I would find it difficult to express any level of confidence in that report as an individual and as it relates to me, and that is no criticism of the RCOG process.  It is a different matter entirely for me to conclude then, or to advise Government or advise anybody, that the remainder of the report is something that I have a doubt about in terms of confidence, even if I can fully understand how that might feel for an individual who has been the subject of those errors.  I have enormous sympathy for that.  I took the opportunity earlier on to pay tribute to the individuals, who were with the committee last night and who gave evidence, for the work that they have done over the past 18 months with us and with the HSE to make the progress that we have made, and we are not all the way down the road that we want to be in terms of implementation of the findings of Scally, or indeed the other reports that we now have in front of us.</p></speech>

We have supported the publication of statements in both Houses and the various committee rooms in which we have had to give account and we will continue to do that.  We have no difficulty whatsoever in doing that.</p></speech>

We all know what we are talking about.  I was quite shocked - I must be frank with Dr. Holohan - by some of the commentary.  I am sure Dr. Holohan was as well.  I am wondering, arising out of that, if there is any specific action Dr. Holohan will take or, as Dr. Holohan said, if it will be what he has been doing all along.</p></speech>

We are at an advanced stage in considering a policy piece of work that we have been working on for some months on patient involvement to recognise both the time and financial effort that is involved for individuals to participate.  As I have said, we regard the input of patients as being important in all of the work we do, not only in this but in the development of policy and the oversight of implementation of policy, and we want to support people better in doing that.</p> <p>  We had a management board discussion as an organisation on an advanced draft that we hope to be in a position in early 2020 to present to the Minister for approval and ultimately for publication following consideration by Government.  We take that very seriously.  That is a piece of work that will be fully informed by all that the committee heard here last night.</p></speech>

I say that because I would find that a considerable challenge.</p> <p>  With regard to what the gentleman from RCOG referred to as the "remarkable coincidence", and it really is, would Dr. Holohan use that word?  I will ask Mr. McCallion and Dr. Holohan if they would use that to describe what happened, in terms of the two most prominent campaigners happening to be the women where the error was made.  The words "remarkable coincidence" was used.  Would Dr. Holohan agree with those words?</p></speech>

It is surprising.  Yes, of course, it is surprising.  My understanding, although I will check with my colleagues in RCOG, is that the identity of any of the individuals as to who they were as individuals was not known to RCOG.</p></speech>

We then made contact with the women and explained the circumstances in letters to each of the three women affected.  As the royal college has said, it did not know to whom the set of slides related.  It is a very unfortunate set of circumstances.  People in the HSE made contact with the people on the matter.  The college has said that, thankfully, this did not have an impact on the individual's review, which was positive.  It is certainly not something anyone wanted to happen.</p></speech>

The circumstances are a little bit more complex.  There are a number of labels involved.  Temporary labels are applied to the slides and later removed.  That was a factor.  As the letter is a number of pages long, that is the short version.  The college may wish to speak to the process.  Some of the labs had permanent labels.  That contributed to the confusion.  When this was spotted and pointed out, it was then corrected.</p></speech>

It was in the process of removing this material that some of the original labels were removed.  This labelling issue arose in respect of four slides.  Again, it absolutely arose after the completion of the review.</p></speech>

I have had something on my mind.  I gave an answer to Deputy Kelly when we were talking about concordant and discordant slide reports.  I said that we did not ascribe concordant or discordant if there was no slide result, such as cases designated unavailable or missing.  I misspoke when I included the word "mislabelling" in that sentence.  I used it because we had been talking about that issue.  I emphasise that it was an error when I said it, because the mislabelling issue had nothing whatever to do with the reporting of the slides which had been completed or with any of our individual reports.  If one was to read the sentence as I spoke it, it could be misleading.  I would just like to correct that.</p></speech>

This was nothing to do with mislabelling.  That was a separate issue.</p></speech>

We then have the remarkable coincidence of that happening to prominent campaigners.  That is definitely a remarkable coincidence and even that is a massive understatement.  Mr. McCallion referred to difficulties with recruiting and retaining staff.  He said that this remains a challenge.  We have had some discussion on this.  Mr. McCallion will know my view, from this and other forums, with regard to the outsourcing.  I have raised the issue consistently.  Indeed, I raised it ten or 11 years ago.  Obviously, some of those labs do not exist any more but I have been trying to get some kind of information about whether there is a quality issue with regard to some of the labs used.  I have been told I can get it but it seems very difficult to do so, considering that Dr. Scally could not and that some of these labs have closed down.</p> <p>  I am firmly of the view that the best way to proceed is to do all of the testing on this island.  That is my own view and the view of my party.  I have expressed it on many occasions.  I understand that moves are being made to repatriate this work.  Notwithstanding the fact that recruitment remains a challenge - which is again a very nice way of putting it and I would say that it is extremely difficult to recruit and retain people - what work is being done to upskill people?  One cannot just flick a switch and get qualified staff.  They need to be in training now.  I am not convinced there is a plan in place to repatriate this work but, if there is, students will be studying at the moment to take up these positions.  Young people at home will be looking at their CAO forms with a view to taking up a new course or an additional course.  What is the position in that regard?  What consultation has the HSE had with colleges?  What preparations have been made?</p></speech>

That has gone to planning.  It will comprise screening, research and education facilities.  We have put up to ten positions in place in the Coombe.  Many of these are still unfilled.  There are challenges with regard to recruiting into that environment, as the Deputy has said.</p></speech>

A small number, two to three, are filled.  I can confirm the exact numbers.  Interviews have been held as recently as yesterday.  Small numbers have come through.  They are a combination of medical scientist posts.  In growing the capacity of the Coombe, bearing in mind that capacity is very small, logistics, IT and so on are very important.  It is much more than the building.  In this instance, the building is the easier part.  We have a joint steering group with the Coombe.  There are a number of elements to that.  It deals with workforce issues.  There is a workforce plan as to what is needed and how to develop in the short and long terms.</p> <p>  With regard to recruiting medical scientists, which is one of the challenges, there has been a global shortage of cytologists.  With the move to HPV testing, there are fewer career opportunities and people are less interested in doing it.  That is one of the challenges that compounds our environmental factors.  With regard to medical consultants, we have one permanent consultant.  To grow the service to the extent we hope to, we will need to recruit into it.  We have had interviews.  We have had some success in attracting candidates to at least the interview stage.  We will have to see, as it is with medical consultants, whether we can bring those home with the Coombe.  We are more hopeful with regard to support roles such as laboratory aides and administrative staff.  We can attract people for these roles but there are big challenges on the medical and medical scientist side.  We have really struggled.</p> <p>  Retention of staff is equally important.  We have to consider the age profile of the existing staff.  It is a small team which works very hard and which has worked very hard over recent years, which have been difficult for the team due to the volume of work and targets to be met.  The Coombe has an arrangement with an institute of technology.  It provides basic undergraduate training for medical scientists to train them in cytopathology.  We have managed to attract two people into the programme for next year.  It has been quite difficult.  There are attractive opportunities for medical scientists in both private and public environments.  The Coombe has done work with the institutes of technology in that regard.  We will be starting small.  If we can get more people, we will seek to grow but it is quite challenging to attract people from the third level sector into that medical scientist area.  </p> <p>  Separately, we are recruiting internationally.  We are trying to attract people from the UK as its health service moves from cytology-based screening to HPV-based screening.  There may be some people who would be prepared to relocate for various reasons.  That is a market at which we are actively looking.  My point is that, whether we recruit people or train people, this is going to take time.  It will get a little bit easier as we move to the new testing model.  There are also discussions with the likes of the National Virus Reference Laboratory with regard to collaboration on this new model.  In summary, while the building is progressing to planning and a workforce plan is in place with regard to medical consultants - because we need consultants, of whom there are very few in this country - and medical scientists, we still face challenges.  As I have said, the Coombe is working with third level colleges and we are still looking to recruit internationally.  Posts have been approved this year through the Department and the service plan and these will roll forward into next year.</p></speech>

That is not really the challenge.  The challenge is developing the capacity.  We also have to consider resilience.  There has to be a level of resilience in the model.  Relative to other jurisdictions, we are a small country with regard to the volume for this programme.  If we lose people in the future, backlogs may arise for women again, which none of us wants to happen.</p><p>We are also looking at opportunities around resilience and how we could do that with all the laboratories if issues arise.  I am not talking about things like disaster recovery where a laboratory is flooded or something of that nature.  It is more if they lose staff or if a laboratory gets a peak, as in the Jade Goody effect in the UK, the last thing we want in this country is to get back to the backlog situation.  We are looking at those options as well.  Obviously, we are still teasing it through legally and in other ways in terms of how we can develop it.  It will take quite some time.  I would not put a year on it.  It would be madness to do that.  We are committed to developing this.  We have the funding available.  The building will be available within a number of years.  We will certainly try to grow it gradually through the human papillomavirus programme.  We face significant challenges in attracting people.</p></speech>

We have probably all been contacted by people who are in a situation where they are seeking an independent review.  They have to go via the legal route to get an independent review.  It is particularly costly apart from anything else.  It is not really very fair.  Women and their families want to know the truth.  They have said that.  For many people this will not be an issue.  They are happy and it is a settled matter.  They want to draw a line under it.  However, for those who feel the real need for an independent review, the process is highly cumbersome and expensive.  They have to go down the legal route simply to request their samples, as we have been told.  Can anything be done for those people to make the whole process a little less adversarial and perhaps easier on them?</p></speech>

Confidence has been mentioned on numerous occasions in recent years, including the lack of confidence in the system as expressed by patients and victims.  We can do little about what has happened at this stage but we can affect what happens in future.  Are the experts satisfied that the measures taken are sufficient to restore the confidence of patients and their families in the system?  Are they sufficient to reassure the families and the bereaved that, in the event of something like this happening again, they are in safe hands?  Can each of our experts address that question?</p></speech>

I believe unequivocally that women should have confidence.  I believe that our report should provide the basis for women to have confidence in the programme ongoing and that the responses to the Scally report can provide a further layer of confidence.  That is my unequivocal response.</p></speech>

We know the programme is now feeding into a reduction in terms of mortality.  All our efforts are to try to restore the service and then the confidence and trust that people can have in it.  Confidence is easily damaged, perhaps, and challenging to rebuild and put back in place.  We will not be complacent in saying that we believe this is done but we will continue to work to try to ensure that the confidence of people in the programme can be rebuilt.</p> <p>  It is also clear, not only in terms of the programme but in terms of what was at the centre of what happened with disclosure, that confidence in the medical profession was specifically talked about.  Rebuilding trust and confidence on the part of patients is challenging and difficult.  We will have to work together.  The committee members heard testimony last night from patients, service providers, health professionals and policymakers.  We need to try to ensure that collectively we do everything we can to try to rebuild confidence.  We have hope.  I will never say for certain that this will work, but we will continue to try to ensure that we build confidence.  Anything we need to do to continue to improve that, we will do.</p></speech>

All screening programmes are based on a foundation of confidence.  We need a critical mass of the population to have confidence in the programmes and to partake in them.  We know that despite all the events of last year, the uptake of the programme is remarkably high at 80%.  We also know from some work we have done internally that the attitude of women who use the programme is positive towards the programme.  There seems to be a high level of understanding of what the programme does and its limitations.  It is important to us that women who have not yet entered the programme can have confidence in the programme and are not discouraged from taking part.  There has been talk of reducing mortality.  It is not only a question of reducing mortality but of detecting cancer or pre-cancer at an earlier stage, when intervention is far more effective and far less severe.  That is a very important message for anyone watching this who may be wondering about the efficacy of the programme and what it may mean for them.</p></speech>

The measures that have been taken already and the experiences we have had point towards that.  We need to see this from the point of view of the experiences of the patients, some of which were successful and some of which were not.  That is where we have to deal with the extreme cases where things went wrong.</p> <p>  An issue arose some years ago with contamination in the blood bank.  It took a long time and a major effort to restore public confidence in the system, but it was done.  It was done because the system was corrected and double-checked in every which way to ensure that people could come forward and totally rely on the product.  The same has to apply in this case.</p> <p>  Professor Kitchener said that neither screening nor HPV vaccination alone is enough.  He said we need both public health programmes if we are to make cervical cancer a rare disease in Ireland.  Will Professor Kitchener expand on that point a little?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Henry Kitchener" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121800002#K02100"><p>The purpose of vaccination is to provide what one might term primary infection.  In other words, we are preventing women from acquiring the very viral infection that is responsible for the disease.  It is hoped a high level of coverage will be achieved.  Primary vaccination does not cover, or is not capable of preventing, every case of cervical cancer.  This is why there is still a need at the moment for what we might call secondary prevention.  This is where HPV testing and cytology - at the moment it is cytology alone - comes in.  This is the means of picking up abnormalities at an early stage such that they can be easily treated.  The two public health measures are entirely complementary.</p></speech>

This has been one of the few countries that have been able to turn around some of the experience in terms of uptake of immunisation for girls, so that is good.  The anecdotal evidence we have is that the uptake among boys is as good as the uptake currently is among girls.  We will not know that for sure until we have hard data at the end of quarter 1 and we will be happy to come back and share it with the committee.</p></speech>

I do not think the public did lose confidence in the product.  The reason I say that is because more women than ever before came forward for screening last year.  If people lose confidence in something like vaccination, they stay away.  We experienced the contrary point of view last year.</p> <p>  What instigated this, and what appears in the first line of the Scally report, is the difficulty that we had in communicating to patients the results of what we were doing.  We are in a position to reassure Deputy Durkan that we have learned that lesson.  We have taken it on board and are working very hard to ensure that that particular element, which started all of this off in the first place, will not happen again.</p></speech>

We discussed it last evening on the basis that nobody really knows if we have accuracy, or at least we do not.  I speak for myself.  A range between 70% and 100% allows for a wide margin of error.  It is a bit like an opinion poll which has a margin of error.  Are the witnesses satisfied, given the margin of error, that vague and nebulous area, that we can go forward with absolute confidence in the system, that it will work in the future and that we will not have to revisit this particular issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.465" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121800002#L00400"><p>It is an interesting question.  Every screening programme balances the risk between false negatives, on which much of the discussion has been focused, but there is less focus on the false positives, which can be very harmful too.  Over-referral of patients for interventional investigation can be harmful too.  We know that not just from the cervical screening programme but from other screening programmes.  In the breast screening programme, for example, the aim is to keep the recall rate below 7%.  Otherwise, they are over-referring patients who are otherwise healthy, coming in to a screening programme, volunteering their time to partake in a screening programme for interventions and investigations which may be harmful.  Every screening programme calibrates between the need to pick up as many precancerous changes or early cancer changes in the case of breast cancer against the risk of over referring people.  In the case of the cervical screening programme, for every 1,000 women screened, there are 20 abnormal findings of which the liquid-based cytology picks up 15, but once we move to HPV screening, that will improve to 18, as it is a much more sensitive screening test than cervical cytology.  We expect to see an improvement in the sensitivity without the expense of over-investigating and subjecting people to unnecessary harmful investigations.</p></speech>

In this country we use a less frequent system.  Ours is every three years compared to a one and a half year screening in the United States.  The question that arises immediately is which of those systems we go for now.</p></speech>

What it has is a test that practitioners can offer on an annual basis to women in their practice, so it is slightly different in terms of how the programme is organised.  There is not a screening programme, as such.  What we have in Ireland, Northern Ireland, the UK and in other European countries is a population screening programme that is offered at regular intervals.</p></speech>

Are there pitfalls similar to the ones that we have experienced here, and do they happen to a greater or lesser extent?  From our point of view in trying to establish confidence in the system, I believe that is the way we have to go.  We have to know how well we can rely on whichever system is being used.  Professor Kitchener has already said that we need the two systems.  That is good.  We know already one of them is imprecise in its determination.  Let us compare that with the United States and see which works best.  Could the witnesses indicate which we should do?</p></speech>

Testing is offered through laboratories, but it is at the individual level.  In this country what we have is an organised population-based programme where people are invited proactively on the basis of their age.  In effect, what our programme is saying to people is that if a woman participates in the organised programme from the age of 25 to the age of 60, at different intervals depending on one's age, over one's lifetime it will reduce the risk of mortality from cervical cancer.  They do not make that offering in the United States because they do not offer a population-based programme.</p> <p>  As part of our programme, we were then able to have in the quality-assurance arrangements a retrospective audit, which does not exist in the United States.  The non-disclosure of those findings of retrospective audit, which happened here, is not part of the design at all of what happens in the United States, so there is no comparable circumstance that could have arisen regarding what happened here.</p> <p>  As I said previously to this committee, the quality assurance arrangements and the retrospective clinical audit that was in place for CervicalCheck made us one of the very few programmes in the world that offered that.  The United States is quite a substantial way from that, and it does not have any of the features of an organised population-based screening.</p></speech>

Somebody, somehow, somewhere must be able to tell us what the Irish experience is in the last 150, 200 or 5,000 tests that were done, and the result was X, Y or Z, positive or negative.  What is the difference?  There has to be a comparison somewhere.</p></speech>

One relates to the timing and whether it is one year, two years or three years.  That would have been looked at initially by a clinical expert group to determine what is the appropriate timing in terms of interval between screening and there are balances, as has been described by colleagues, in relation to false negatives and false positives, in other words, over screening versus getting that balance right.  There would have been recommendations around that.  Going forward, with the advent of the new national screening committee, that will also help in terms of looking at that for future testing or major changes to existing programmes.  The timing would have been evidence-based in terms of whether one does three years and then how one deals with individual cases.  Some people may require a more frequent smear and others can move to a longer smear cycle.  That is all determined by experts in terms of the timing.</p> <p>  As Dr. Holohan said, the laboratories provide a service simply around cytology and HPV.  That is quality assured and examined through a whole series of measures.  My colleague, Dr. Doherty, can speak to that if need be.  That is purely the laboratory element of it, but in terms of the timing on whether it is one year, two years or three years, that is determined by a group of medical experts that would have determined that three years was appropriate for most people.  Some people will have more frequent recalls where that is determined by their own clinical status.</p></speech>

There are five laboratories involved, and the headquarters are in Teterboro, New Jersey.  As recently as November, a team from the HSE visited those laboratories on a formal quality assurance visit, and the reason I raise this issue is that I want to reassure women who are coming for screenings that they are getting a quality screening from this laboratory.  The laboratory has made a number of vast improvements in the quality of service it delivers.  It has worked very closely with us on aligning our testing processes and in complying with our quality assurance guidelines.  It has expertly trained staff who are participating in formal education and CPD programmes.  It has standardised quality measures right across the five laboratories that provide the service for us.  It has meetings with us on a weekly basis by teleconference and we have face to face meetings four times a year.  We have a very good working relationship with it around the quality of the service, and we are content with the quality of the service being provided to the women in the programme from these laboratories at this time.</p></speech>

This is reassuring, and this is where confidence can grow from.  Without that we will waste our time.  I appreciate that information.  It is very useful and it can be used to good effect in the future to restore that vital confidence in the system.  Once we have that, the women who have tests in this country will certainly have confidence in the system.  We are very sorry about the kind of pressure that the system had to work under over the last few years.  It is difficult to be under the microscope all the time, and to be criticised all the time.  It is difficult to restore any confidence in the system while that scrutiny is going on.  It is also difficult to retain staff in that system.  The confrontational nature of the business and the politics surrounding it is such that it puts pressure on a lot of people, in an area that can have its own sensitive pressures at the same time.  We recognise that, but we also recognise the things that we have to do to address the issues.  I refer to the weakness in the system and where the system went wrong and failed to deliver, reassure, and inform women.  This goes back to full and frank information and full disclosure.  This is hugely important, Chairman.  If we are to learn one lesson, that has to be about the need for full disclosure and the need to apply it across the board.</p></speech>

It arose out of evidence that we received last night, but it is something that has been on our minds as we have assessed this over the past 18 months.  I refer to the balance of risk in relation to screening programmes.  We understand that there is an inherent high rate of missing early changes of cervical cancer, pre-cancerous changes, and we understand that this is a problem with most screening programmes.  As Dr. Henry said, 15 out of 20 will be picked up, but five will not.  When one goes through the balancing of risk of a screening programme, there are instances where one looks at a slide and there is no evidence of pre-cancerous changes, even though there may be but they have not been picked up on the slide, there are instances where changes are not picked up but are evident and there are instances where major changes are not picked up.</p> <p>  As one moves through that gradiation, is there now a rebalancing of the risk?  The witnesses last night felt that there are inherent deficiencies in screening, but CervicalCheck was outside those inherent risks.  In other words, the programme was deficient.  Is that rebalancing down to the limitations of screening, and ensuring that the programme is not adding a greater risk because it is in some way deficient?  Is that being rebalanced at the moment?  Is the programme now running at a rate efficient to the maximum of the limitations of screening?</p> <p>  When we invite healthy people in to have a service, for instance, screening, should there not be a no-fault compensation scheme for people damaged by the failures of the system?  Might that encourage more people to come forward, because 20% of women are not being screened, for whatever reason.  It may not be because they do not have confidence in the screening but rather because they just do not engage.  If there was a no-fault compensation scheme in place, would that alleviate a lot of the anxiety that has developed over the last 18 months?  Perhaps the three main witnesses this could comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.483" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121800002#M00400"><p>I will address the first part of the Chairman's question.  The RCOG review gives substantial insight and evidence into the answer to the question that the Chairman is asking.  The limitations of screening was spoken about last night and there are many and varied reasons that explain the screening programme not identifying, failing to pick up on and, in about 30% of cases, failing to prevent cancers.  The reasons for that can be very different, and the Chairman will be aware of this.  They can be everything from the chain in terms of the issuing of call and recalls, and there could be errors there even before one gets to screening, the adequacy of the smear itself, the mounting on slides, and then ultimately, the cytology.  We have heard a lot about the cytology all the way through to colposcopic diagnosis and so on.</p> <p>  It is true to say that where one sets the balance of risk and benefit ultimately determines the levels, broadly speaking, regarding false positives and false negatives.  For most types of medical tests, not just screening, there is always a balance between the two.  As Dr. Henry said, we can set the balance at a certain level which means we are over-diagnosing, we are over-treating, and exposing people to genuine harm, because over-treating means unnecessary drugs, unnecessary surgery, unnecessary time in hospital, exposure to infection and so on.  All of those things have to be calibrated, and that constant calibration is an issue for all forms of medical test, but we have the best evidence that we have had in relation to the operation of our screening programme through what RCOG has done for us.  On a dynamic basis, the programme would have to have its own quality assurance ranges into the future that continue to provide that assurance, but I will defer to colleagues who wish to supplement what I have said in relation to that.  </p> <p>  On the specific issue of no-fault compensation, the committee will be aware that the Department is soon to receive the final report of Mr. Justice Meenan, who is giving consideration to the whole question of compensation.  He was asked specifically how it might be applied in relation to vaccination.  The point that the Chairman makes is a fair one.  As part of the overall consideration of whatever recommendations Mr. Justice Meehan will make, it may form one of the considerations as to how that might operate, how that might facilitate the objectives of a population-based programme in the same way as it might in relation to something like immunisation.</p></speech>

For instance, we are going to move from cytology to HPV testing, which reduces the risk of missed cases.  Is Dr. Holohan saying that there is a constant review of the balance of risk?</p></speech>

In broad terms for screening programmes, and as a point of principle, that has two dimensions to it.  One is what the evidence says, in general terms, around the performance of tests, but then there is also the question of the risks and benefits that arise in a particular country or a particular setting.  Ultimately, the costs and expenditures that accrue here will be difficult, so the cost and benefit of a screening programme, even if the technology is the same, can be different in different populations.</p></speech>

The inherent limits of sensitivity that cytology screening has is the reason women are invited every three years.  We know that - to use Dr. Henry's figure that one quarter of the abnormalities are not picked up in one screen - because the natural history of cancer of the cervix endures over a number of years, the hope is that they will be picked up in a subsequent screen.  Repeated screening, and compliance with or adherence to repeated screening, is an important way of trying to raise the overall sensitivity of cervical screening.  It is quite clear that HPV testing will reset the risk, because there will be an increased detection of underlying pre-cancerous lesions, and that will happen.</p><p>It is also the case that because women who are HPV negative are at such low risk, not just at that moment of time but in the short term, that screening intervals could increase.  Regarding no-fault compensation, we do not have that in the UK and this is a matter for Irish policy-makers to consider.  </p></speech>

This is not a static document and it will be reviewed in the light of best international evidence and our experience here.  Nothing is carved in stone as to how the programme will function in future.  All we can do is to take the experience of what other countries are doing, modify it and then look to see how that works here.  To say that it is an inflexible forever document would give the wrong impression.  It will be modified with time.</p></speech>

Some people have been involved from the start and some people came in at a later stage.  I thank them for the detailed information provided to us.  I will start with Professor Kitchener.  His report states reviews were carried out of 1,000 women.  It is not easy to do a review.  It is a complex process and involves many people.  Professor Kitchener has given that explanation, but in his report he has stated there were 20,000 data items.  He might outline what those data items are, because I understood that around 3,500 smear results were reviewed.  How is that total of 20,000 data items made up?</p> <p>  Professor Kitchener also referred to the comparison with the UK.  The Irish results were similar to the UK.  Regarding audits undertaken in the UK, what has been the experience regarding releasing information back to the patients?  Is that process in place?  I understand that in some European countries information from an audit it not released.  It is retained because the whole idea of an audit is to ensure the system is working, first of all, and then that any glitches are addressed.  Will Professor Kitchener deal with those issues?</p> <p>  I turn now to the issue of staffing and the challenges staff have faced over the past 18 months.  I refer in particular to comments made by Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell, who is based in Cork and Kerry, which set out clearly that staff have faced major challenges in some centres.  I understand that in some centres there have been resignations and people have been difficult to replace.  Has any mechanism been put in place to support staff who had to deal with this defensive work daily during the past 18 months?  In fairness, all the staff have been doing their best to provide the best possible service.  The public perception was different, however.  If staff are facing challenges, it is important that they have the necessary support.  The last time I raised this issue was when someone from the Medical Council was in here.  I am referring to a situation where there is an adverse outcome regarding work done within the HSE or by medical staff and the lack of support available.  Have we identified how we can support and retain staff?  </p> <p>  Also on staffing, the number of consultants in this area is very small.  The total number of consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology is about 135, and it is smaller again in this particular area.  Have we set out how many people are due to retire in the next five years, how many people are in training and how many people we need to encourage to go into training in this area?  What work is being done on that issue?  I ask that because I see major challenges.  For example, I have heard of two people who have dropped out of the area of obstetrics and gynaecology.  One person was in training for nine years, but then decided to go back to do GP training.  The second person had done six years of training in obstetrics and gynaecology before dropping out, again to do GP training.  It is the same in this particular area.  What supports are we putting in place?  How can we now help retain those staff and ensure we have the necessary numbers of staff in place to deal with requirements and provide an adequate service for the patients?  They are entitled to the best quality service and to do that it is necessary to have the staff.  Those are my opening questions.  </p></speech>

The Senator asked about the policy of disclosure in England.  That policy was developed some years ago by policy-makers who felt it was important that there was transparency in the system.  That was what it was all about.  It was a measure taken to try to increase public confidence in the cervical screening programme.  Senator Burke is correct that in a number of countries with high standards of cervical screening that the results of slide audits are not disclosed to individual women.  I have recently been in contact with the director of the world-renowned cervical screening programme in British Columbia.  He informed me that the programme has not been doing that, but they are examining the resources put in place in England for that purpose.  The Senator is correct about other countries with good programmes in Europe.  We have this policy of disclosure and we think it is a good policy.</p> <p>  As for the response women have to this situation, a significant proportion when asked do not want to know the result of the slide review because they are content that they have been diagnosed.  They may regret and be upset, of course, that cancer intervened, but having been treated they do not necessarily want rake over all of that again.  Other women do want to know and when some find out they are prepared to accept the results in the context of the limitations of screening.  Some women may also wish to use the results as a basis for pursuing litigation.  The policy is there and the interaction women have with that policy of disclosure is a matter of individual preference.  I will hand over to Dr. Walker now, if I may, to answer the question concerning the size of the data.  </p></speech>

There were 1,038 women, but 1,659 slides.  As we worked across the database, therefore, we had the CSPID to identify the case.</p><p>There is a slide number to identify the slide.  There is the CervicalCheck result, classified as negative, low-grade or high-grade, and the P number, which is from one to nine.  There are sometimes more than one P number.  Then comes the review result, the review result P number, the final diagnosis from the cytology group, and the P number result - P 2 from the screener.  Where the slide went to a first consultant, there is that consultant's opinion and a P number.  Where there was a second consultant, there is another opinion and P number.  Then there is consensus, if there was a consensus, and the subjective comments, if made.  The date of attendance at colposcopy had to be tabulated against the date of diagnosis of cancer to identify the subgroup that needed to be seen.  Then there is the comparison of the CervicalCheck result with the review result in terms whether it is concordant or discordant.  Then there is the issue of whether a letter has been drawn up or not, or whether the letter has been completed or not, and other matters relating to stage.  All these items did not come down in the dropped merged mail.  They all had to be put up there and extracted.  For each individual letter, there are approximately seven items to be drawn down, manually or otherwise.  We sent the committee a copy of the draft letter.  The point that was being made in the sentence was that this was a complex task.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work doctors, nurses and support staff have done in the 15 colposcopy units around the country.  Undoubtedly during the crisis they would have been the front-line point of contact for women who were understandably anxious and concerned.  The staff have provided extra sessions and done a huge volume of work to try to bring about some stability.  They are still challenged in the service.  What has been put in place is a working group involving the acute hospitals, the women and infants programme, Dr. McKenna and CervicalCheck, under Dr. Doherty.  There is a team in place to examine a number of issues, one being investment.  As I stated, &euro;2 million was allocated this year to try to support the service in regard to both staffing and equipment.  A second aspect involves looking at the clinical pathways in the utilisation of the service.  The third aspect involves GP education and guidance on referrals to the colposcopy service.  In addition, it is a matter of considering alternative pathways for certain categories of patients in terms of ambulatory gynaecology clinics.  Colleagues could speak about this.  Finally, there is a focus on planning over the next few years as we move to HPV.  As we have mentioned, there is a higher impact over a number of years as one moves through HPV screening in colposcopy.  Alongside that, there is a workforce piece examining some of the issues referred to in terms of planning, including medically and in the areas of nursing and other models that would have been developed.  An impact assessment was done.  Dr. McKenna might speak about that first before tackling the wider point.  Each unit was visited last year to consider the issues and what the solutions might be.  They vary around the country based on the nature and shape of the units.  Dr. McKenna might speak to that first and then talk about support.</p></speech>

There are two important features to retaining staff in colposcopy.  They must have the facilities to treat the patients coming to them.  They have been under a lot of pressure owing to clinical referrals.  One of our objectives is to take the clinical referrals out of the colposcopy clinics in order that they can focus on the patients who are best seen in them.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned trainees dropping out.  This has always been a concern in the specialty of obstetrics and gynaecology.  It is not something that is suitable for everybody, for a variety of reasons, but, in fairness, colposcopy is not a reason for trainees not continuing in the specialty.  It may be a very cogent reason for those becoming consultants not taking up that particular part of the profession.</p> <p>  The Department has allocated funding to make the conditions for the patients and the staff in the colposcopy units better but it would be remiss of me not to say the biggest difficulty the staff have in the colposcopy units is the fact that they felt they have been pilloried and demonised over the past 18 months.  They are very sensitive about the negative information about them in the public domain.  When that ceases, it will go a long way towards making recruitment into this area less difficult.</p></speech>

It is important to recognise the screening programmes are primarily about the women engaged in them.  They will only be successful, however, if they have happy, engaged and supported staff, including not only colposcopists but also administrative staff.  I visited the staff in Limerick on Monday.  I pay tribute to them for their great resilience and for sticking with the programme over the past 18 months.  The unit proved quite successful at holding on to staff in a period of markedly increased demand, not only in terms of the number of inquiries but also in terms of the nature of the interactions with the public.  The Senator is quite right.  To refer to what Dr. McKenna said, when we consider the needs of colposcopists and the sources of pressure on clinicians, the primary objective is to ascertain the supports they need to address the demand in their clinics.  The past year has seen a remarkable increase in demand, not just through the screening service but also through direct referrals from GPs.  With the support of Dr. McKenna and his colleagues, we have been seeking and securing funding for alternative pathways to ensure women can go to the right clinic for the first time and preserve the integrity of those clinics in respect of what their set-up is supposed to be.</p></speech>

The colposcopy units are under the management of the acute hospitals.  The hospitals run the colposcopy clinics and the programme then funds and has a contract with the colposcopy clinics.  I spoke to Dr. Russell myself.  All the hospitals have asked us to ensure the necessary supports are in place in terms of employee assistance and so on.  There may have been variation between hospitals in this regard over the past year but we are going to make sure that whatever is needed is provided.  As we have all said and agreed, the service has been through a very difficult 18 months and continues to be under pressure.  It is a bit like the laboratories in that we have to try to retain and stabilise the service and then deal with future demand.  That is the purpose of the group I mentioned in terms of considering how to utilise the funding provided by the Department under the service plan and the changes to which Dr. McKenna referred.</p></speech>

I have not spoken to her directly about this but this indicated that she felt the level of support required for staff was not in place.

I do not want to personalise it, in fairness to her.  She is just representing a general view.  The hospital groups are being contacted to make sure that if what should be in place for them is not in place, it will be put in place.  They ultimately have responsibility for managing the service from day to day.  From a screening perspective, Dr. Doherty has secured a colposcopy adviser.  There was a gap in this regard, and we have talked about it here.  I am referring to someone within the programme to interface with the units on a day-to-day operational basis.  We have just appointed someone in the past week after a long search to recruit someone.  That will help from a screening perspective.  Ultimately, the units work within the hospitals and we need to make sure the supports are available for them in the hospitals.  There are practical aspects, which we have discussed, but there are also elements in terms of the personal impact on the staff of working in a service that is stretched and under pressure.</p></speech>

On this occasion, we engaged with the units.  We offered support and training as to how to do it and what was likely to lead to the best outcome for the patients and, indirectly, for the staff.  Where the staff felt that they were unable to do it we provided a central team that would go to their unit and deliver these results.  This is a quite significant difference from how the programme would have interacted with the individual colposcopy units in the past.  More than 200 of these visits and meetings with the women have taken place to date, many of them with the local units, most with the central support team.  The fact that we have not heard more about them - I am not saying that they are all going absolutely smoothly - says something for the effort that the HSE put into preparing for this event.</p></speech>

I mentioned the units were all visited last year.  The intention in January, through the women and infants programme, is to visit the units again.  This is in order to understand the issues at a practical level, because each unit does not necessarily have the same issues in relation to how it is functioning, how it is supported and so on.  That repeat visit of each individual site will also help to identify issues for each unit that can be addressed either locally or with support from the centre.</p></speech>

I am not sure if enough information is out there in the public domain.  For instance, the National Office of Clinical Audit published figures recently on the reduction in the number of people dying in hospitals due to heart attack, stroke or pneumonia.  I do not know whether we have got enough information on the changes that have occurred over the past ten years in CervicalCheck.  A lot of progress has been made and I am wondering if something can be done to get out the positive information because it has been very much a defensive role that the HSE and the Department have played over the past 18 months.  I am wondering if something could be done to get that information out as well.</p></speech>

It is not just a question of us communicating figures such as the reduced mortality or the earlier detection of precancerous changes.  It is the summary view of the royal college that the CervicalCheck programme is working effectively.  That is a strong message of reassurance to our population, not just to those who are engaged in the programme now, but to women who are coming up to the starting age for the programme.  They should have confidence that this programme works, and is effective, as benchmarked by an external, independent body.</p></speech>

We do monitor the outcomes from the screening programme on the incidence of cervical cancer.  As the Senator will know, before the programme was introduced cervical cancer was rising by a rate of around 4% a year.  What we know from our most recent data is it is decreasing by approximately 5% to 5.5% year on year now.  The most recent data we have on that is from 2016.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is not Dr. Doherty's area, but my understanding is that before the start of the cervical screening programme ten years ago we had the highest rate of cervical cancer in Europe, and we had done nothing to try to impact on that.  I think Dr. Walker said at the private briefing that it has gone down 7% year on year; that is what I wrote down that day.  It may be 5.5% as Dr. Doherty said, but at least it is in the right direction.  There was a comment passed here yesterday, and I am not sure if I misinterpreted it, asking if there was a material impact.  It is very important that somebody with a medical background, who is qualified to say it, can say categorically here today that we used to have an increasing rate of 4% and now it is between 5.5% and 7% in the downward direction.  The net impact of that is lives saved, but also that early intervention has had positive outcomes for the population for women who might have had their fertility or their personal lives affected.  </p> <p>  It is not just about mortality.  One of the witnesses said earlier on that it is about having the least impact on people's lives.  Reference was also made earlier to the consequences of over-diagnosis, or dealing with false positives, and that one does not start zapping everybody with radiation if they have a small cellular change, that that has a net impact on the rest of their cells.  If it was as easy as just assuming everybody had a certain low level we could zap everybody, but that is not the way it is done.  One has to deal with the data in front of one on the slides-----</p></speech>

A total of 50,000 high grade lesions have been picked up and so on over the period, and the incidence impact that we have heard about, just under 7% in the years from 2010 to 2015, is now beginning to feed into mortality.  I want to take the opportunity to pick up on the point that Senator Burke was making.  I refer to the importance of us being able to get into a situation where we can on a positive and a proactive basis communicate the full range of information.  That has been a challenging space for the HSE, and for the Department, and for the professional colleges who would normally be in that space over the course of the past 12 to 18 months.  It is something that proactively we need to get back into in the coming year, and that is something that we will be doing for sure.</p></speech>

I can recall the role that was played by the original CervicalCheck clinical director Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, in her engagements with the Department, and in public, in making strongly the case for the introduction of a screening programme.  She talked in very clear and passionate terms about her gynaecological practice in the UK, where she had trained, and seeing young women presenting with late-stage cervical cancer, and lives being lost with young children.  She was instrumental in making the case in public and political terms, for investment in the development of a new programme at a time, in 2008, when the overall expenditure on the health system was being reduced.  There is no question that that played an important role in establishing a programme that has had the positive impacts we have seen over the past ten years.</p></speech>

There was a lot of resistance to funding for this area, and there was a lot of hearsay and all sorts of carry-on that was very hard to battle.  I know that Senator James Reilly was instrumental in bringing the truth of the situation to the fore as well.  To go back to today's job, I have been meeting all the witnesses at the Committee of Public Accounts and this committee for a while now and for 18 months with regard to this matter.</p><p>The words "blame" and "truth" have come up a lot.  I would level the blame for this on the audit and, in particular, whoever it was who decided that it was a good idea to audit without considering the impact of the audit results.  Something that was imprecise, with a 70% detection rate, was being audited so naturally the results would not be easy to read if someone fell into the other 30% all the time and had cancer.  The main lesson that needs to be learned is that in the context of everything that is done by the Department and the HSE, the patient must be to the fore.  The impact all the way down to the person whose slide is involved must be considered.</p><p> Another lesson from what happened involves the lack of leadership and governance.  It was very clear to me and to other members of the committees that no one seemed to be in charge.  There was a vacuum and this left space for falsehoods or for incomplete information to get out.  A lie is halfway around the world before the truth is putting its boots on.  That is really what happened in this case to some extent.  I am grateful for the report and I believe in its independence.  However, it is very difficult to explain to people that despite the questionable quality assurance that was in play when we were going over to see the labs, despite not noticing that slides were being sent to other labs in clear breach of contract, despite the guy in Salford operating without approval and despite all the things we discovered, it appears that our gross population data, as per the report, is not too different from that of the UK.  I believe that but it is very difficult to communicate it to the public and to say that, despite all that has happened over the past 18 months, "Nothing to worry about girls, it has all been fine."  That is a very hard message to get across to people and they do question it.</p><p> In terms of the labelling of slides, I can understand the complexities involved.  I would like to clarify something which emerged yesterday and about which I am unhappy.  Where there was a slide that was concordant with the result, it was categorised as concordant.  Where a slide was discordant with the CervicalCheck result, it was discordant.  Dr. Walker spoke about the non-homogenous group, namely, the third group of people.  I agree with him, particularly in the context of trying to just force everybody into that group.  On the basis of what he stated, they were not a homogenous group and they could have had no smears.  I just want to clarify that where there was an assumption or a decision made that a slide was concordant, there was actually a physical slide present.</p></speech>

That is something that came out of yesterday's meeting.  I do not really know why, but it left me uncomfortable and last night I was wondering if the results are as I read them initially.</p> <p>  In terms of the labelling issues, there is continuous reference to the idea that a person would be as likely to win the Euromillions as to have this happen to her, which is just ridiculous because the sum is not right.  In terms of looking at people's smears, there was no indication given to slide readers or operatives of who the slides belonged to.  Is that not true?  The process was totally anonymous.  The slide readers knew that the person had cancer, because that was obviously the trigger, but they did not know it was my smear, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's smear or whatever.  They did not know who it was.  It is unfair for people to suggest that particular people were being looked at through a different lens.  I think there is some element of that going on.</p></speech>

All of this damages the screening programme.  I thought the whole point was to have an adequate screening programme.  Lorraine Walsh spoke yesterday about oncofertility and lymphedema  These are the side-effects of surviving a devastating illness.  There appear to be inadequate services for people who are diagnosed and treated and then have to deal with the issues that come from surviving such a devastating illness.  I understand that there are recruitment and financial issues.  W are trying to get over this hump, as it were, but what work is being done with the Irish Cancer Society in terms of referral pathways for women who maybe at 32 or 34 years of age find themselves with this devastating diagnosis?  They might not have anybody in their lives they can turn to.   They might not be able to have children.  What about freezing eggs or any of the advice that is out there?  In terms of dealing with women who have an early diagnosis and treatment and the pathways for them, as cancer survivors, is there anything in train?</p></speech>

It is somewhat of an orphan speciality in that it does not lend itself readily to one particular specialty.  We will be interviewing this Friday for a lymphedema lead.  Working with the Department, we have secured funding to start up a service in the Mater Hospital and one of the community healthcare organisations.  That service will address the needs and will be core to the needs.  One of the core issues for some of the survivors of cervical cancer and indeed other types of cancer is lymphedema and the difficulty they have in accessing a single specialist who can signpost them.  We are making progress on that and will be working with Lorraine and others in pushing it and with the Department in securing funding.</p> <p>  On the broader issue of cancer survival and the ten-year strategy of the NCP, part of that strategy focuses on post-cancer care which has been somewhat neglected in recent years with all the focus we have on consolidating care in our eight cancer centres and all the improved outcomes we see in that.  As we see greater success with cancer survivorship, there needs to be greater focus on the needs of people who have survived cancer, which until now have not been as well addressed as they should have been.  I acknowledge that.</p></speech>

There is acknowledgement that there is not a range of supports in place for - this is not a medical term - the fallout or aftermath of surviving cervical cancer in particular.  There were a number of issues raised regarding the type of support and-or intervention that a woman might need.  If I am understanding her correctly, that is the issue Deputy O'Connell wanted addressed.  It is not so much an acknowledgement of it, which is grand, but more what plans are in place to deal specifically with the fallout.</p></speech>

The person who has kept me most aware of this is Professor Donal Brennan in the Mater, who has obtained funding from the Irish Cancer Society with a view to improving survivorship.  The team is not medically based.  It is multidisciplinary, including dietetics, physiotherapy, psychological counselling and that sort of thing.  He will be looking for co-funding from the HSE in order that this pilot project can be rolled out long-term and for other units as well.  It has gone beyond a plan.  I would not be aware of this only for the tenacity of Professor Brennan in keeping me informed and looking for funding.</p></speech>

A bit like engaging with patient groups, we have to talk to the people it affects.  I imagine that people in the Department and, from our perspective, in here can be very removed from the process.</p><p>One has to interface with patients in order to hear what they are saying.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.549" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tracey Conroy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121800002#R00300"><p>We have been talking about survival and as has been mentioned, survival rates for Irish cancer patients continue to improve.  Survivorship is a key theme of the national cancer strategy that was approved by Government and launched in 2017 by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  The statistics show that in 2016 there were 173,000 people alive in Ireland who have had a cancer diagnosis.  That is almost 4% of the population.  In developing the cancer strategy, which was done in consultation with cancer patients, we were keen to ensure a focus on this area generally.  In August, the Minister launched the National Cancer Survivorship Needs Assessment: Living With and Beyond Cancer in Ireland.  That report establishes a baseline assessment of the services available to cancer survivors and it recommends models of care for future development and actions to develop cancer survivorship care across the full spectrum of care required.  We are very focused on that.  Under the auspices of the cancer strategy, a cancer patient advisory committee has been established.  That builds on the work of the cancer forum that developed the strategy.  We have 15 members selected to sit on that committee and it meets actively to work on those issues, including survivorship.  The Department is strongly focused on the ongoing need for funding of these services, particularly survivorship services across the spectrum of care.  There is a lot of work still to be done on that.</p></speech>

We have worked with the HSE in the development of same.  This is for the full range of assisted human reproduction services to sit alongside the drafting of the legislation.  Members will be aware of this as they completed pre-legislative scrutiny of that legislation in July.  We will be considering the committee's recommendations as part of the drafting.  We hope to have the Bill drafted by the end of quarter 1 and to be in a position to move on the development of the services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.551" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121800002#R00500"><p>I am fully aware of that through my work on this committee.  People often get a quick and unexpected cancer diagnosis.  They often then fall foul of interventions such as having their eggs frozen in short order and money is taken from them in a frenzied situation where there is a lack of information.  If cancer patients are being supported in this way, it has be structured with clear evidence coming from qualified clinicians as opposed to people who want to make a few euro out of people at their lowest moment.</p> <p>  On the laboratories, we have five laboratories now which are subject to quality assurance visits.  It is, therefore, a different picture from what we saw a year or 18 months ago.  Is it a completely different picture with regard to custody over slides and governance?  I imagine it is far more robust now and it will be much easier to audit if we ever have to audit again.  We are no longer trying to find laboratories in Salford, Honolulu or wherever.  We know where the laboratories are, that the slides will stay in them and be available to be looked at, and that the quality assurance is up to scratch.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

We know where all the laboratories are.  They are all on the eastern seaboard of the United States.  They are all linked in to a common system in Quest Diagnostics.  As I alluded to earlier, they have good quality assurance measures in place.  Most importantly, we have a close working relationship with them now, including regular meetings, and they are working closely with us every week.</p></speech>

This has been a testing time for many of us on the committee.  Our job is to interrogate what went wrong.  I know it has been difficult for many of the witnesses and many staff working in the system.  I ask them, however, to understand where we are coming from.  It is very difficult to explain to the public that the test being provided to women was only 70% accurate.  Some women do not think about having a smear test but most do not look forward to it.  It is something they do because they have bought into the system.  It was very difficult to meet women or families who had lost people.  In the information vacuum we had in the immediate aftermath of this crisis, the medical people at the top of the Department - I have the height of respect for Dr. Holohan and Dr. McKenna - should have taken hold of the reins.  There are lessons for all of us in this.  I am not saying I am blameless either but there should have been better leadership at the top, especially when so much was at stake.  We had the roll-out of a large population-based screening programme involving an invasive test for a cancer that is personal to people and has affected many families.  It was such a basket case of a situation 18 months ago.  I genuinely believe the position has improved, although we could not possibly have gone any further backwards, and we will learn from this experience.</p> <p>  Stephen Teap spoke at our meeting yesterday about the lack of organisation and leadership.  The medical person, Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, who has arguably saved more lives than anyone in this room, was the first person to get the chop.  Lessons have to be applied from what we have learned today.  If I have the privilege of being a Member of these Houses in the next term, I will be disappointed if we ever again come across such a lack of organisation or top-down accountability in the HSE or the Department.  It is regrettable for population health that we have ended up where we are today.  It is testament to the work of all the witnesses, the laboratories and the patient advocates that we can, as a result of the report from RCOG, say that despite all that has happened, the screening programme has not been pointless or a waste of time and money because women have lived who would ordinarily have died and women have had better outcomes than they would have had if there had not been a screening programme.  I thank all the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>

That is probably true.  All I will say, and this is a personal reflection, is that it was a difficult time for everybody.  That is not any form of excuse.  In the public engagements in the early days of this, there was a concerted effort to do exactly what Deputy O'Connell is reasonably suggesting, namely, to establish and provide clear communications.  Good work was done in that regard between the colleges, the HSE and others.  It got to a point where communicating in public and doing our jobs in public in the normal way became almost impossible.  I am not reflecting on that in terms of us doing our jobs alone, but it impeded our ability to be able to provide the assurance to people who were using the services.  That is where the regret is.  However, we are a long way down the road, as the Deputy has said, in learning the lessons that come from this.  The Minister and many others have made clear publicly that mistakes were made and there are lessons to be learned.  Everybody across the board is committed to ensuring the lessons that have been set out for us in the Dr. Scally report and elsewhere will be fully implemented.</p></speech>

We should also acknowledge that.  Our last speaker is Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  I am conscious of time because two of the witnesses have to leave to catch a flight.</p></speech>

As they will know, the committee heard from Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh yesterday.  I was particularly struck by Ms Walsh's lack of confidence in the RCOG report.  We have had a lot of discussion about the need for confidence in the screening system.</p><p>I for one am an advocate of screening.  I have taken part in it all my life and I would never undermine the need for it and the recognition that it saves lives.  To ask questions is not a mortal sin and, in some ways, the statements that the questioning by others is leading to a lack of confidence are really over-exaggerated.  I understand that RCOG has stated that unfounded criticism of its evidence-based report could undermine trust in its findings.  The witnesses should probably tell us where that unfounded criticism is coming from.  The one critic that I heard here yesterday was Ms Lorraine Walsh.  Some people in this room think it is no big deal that in the two most high-profile cases, hers and Vicky Phelan's, the slides were confused-----</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, it is read out at the beginning of every session that we do not do that at these committees.  I ask the Deputy to refrain from mentioning those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.578" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121800002#S01900"><p>Okay.  I will park that.  Deputy O'Connell also referred to her colleague, Senator Reilly, who advocated for the introduction of a national screening programme.  At the time, he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	I understand several laboratories are now accredited, including Beaumont/Rotunda, RCSI, St. James's Hospital through its connection with Antrim and Altnagelvin Hospital, which has looked after the needs of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. St. Luke's is also mid-way through the process. </blockquote> <p>Having pointed out all that, he said: &quot;This call for action obviously fell on deaf ears&quot;.  He continues to say that instead of addressing this issue and ensuring that our laboratories would be in a position to tender for and successfully provide cytology, there was a rushed and ill-considered decision that has serious consequences for our health service and for the health of our women and further begs the question as to why we sought out partners in the USA.  At the time, the unions, professionals, academics and many politicians advocated against the outsourcing of our health service to the USA.  Why do all the bodies here think this is not an issue, when they have settlements for several millions in several high-profile cases from laboratories in the USA?  Are the bodies here happy with the way those laboratories were run when we knew they were not ISO-accredited, they were processing 100 slides per day compared with an average of 30 to 60 in Irish laboratories, that the standards were lower and all the evidence from Dr. Scally?  Why is there not something to look at?  The NHS has a document in which it advises on the guidance of applying duty of candour and disclosure for audit results.  It states &quot;sometimes it can be hard for screening services to know how to distinguish between a false negative/false positive that has occurred because of the limitations of screening and a false negative/false positive that has occurred because <i>something has gone wrong</i>&quot;.  I note &quot;something has gone wrong&quot; is written in italics.  Something went wrong in the cases of the women with whom the laboratories settled for millions.  More cases are coming up.  Cases have fallen outside the audit and outside the RCOG report that are now coming to light too.  That will go to court and cannot go through this non-adversarial process.  Nobody has actually looked at what went wrong.  This is a problem and it is very disappointing that RCOG was not able to look at it either.  Something has to have gone wrong when one hears evidence that states that Dr. Scally told us that he could not look at the particulars in Lorraine Walsh's case because the laboratory told him it did not have the records.</p><p>An answer to a parliamentary question about the missing slides stated that more than 1,700 slides were transferred for the RCOG report.  The HSE reported that during the process, a total of 35 slides of women or their next of kin who had consented were not located by the laboratories at the closing date for the slides to be transferred on 7 June.  Does that inspire confidence?  I am not trying to undermine the process, the screening or the need for it, but does that inspire confidence in laboratories that tell Dr. Scally that they cannot investigate the particulars of very serious and high-profile cases because the evidence is missing and that somehow cannot find 35 slides that should have been part of the RCOG report?  As it happens, many of those 35 slides had serious misreadings.  My final question to RCOG is, if it had those slides and they had serious misreadings, would that change the outcome of its judgment that what happened here in Ireland is broadly in line with the audit of what happened in Britain?  I do not believe it reflects it.  I think it would change it and the headline here is that we are broadly in line, in our audit, with what happened under the NHS.</p></speech>

I do not think that those slides as a sample would be qualitatively different from the very large sample that we reviewed.  In other words, the ratio of concordant and discordant findings would not have been any different.  The Deputy suggested that given all of the cancers that have developed following involvement in the CervicalCheck programme, that is surely a sign that all is not well.  I refer back to the fact that, as has been said on multiple occasions today, cervical screening will simply not prevent every case.  Each and every one of these cases is of major consequence to the lives of women.  In this cohort, a very large proportion of women were caught at a very early stage which, as Deputy O'Connell has indicated, means that women can avoid some of the more unpleasant consequences of, for example, radical treatment.  Despite all of that, that does not mean that the programme is not working.  Those two matters are not-----</p></speech>

Earlier Dr. Doherty described well the focus there is now on the quality assurance around both laboratories, the Coombe and Quest.  We visit both laboratories and we monitor both and we work closely, operationally, with them.  There is increased operational management, as well as quality assurance in the laboratories to try to strengthen them going forward.

That is part of any good screening programme.  The original audit was constructed to examined education and learning opportunities also.  In regard to the expert group that we have set up around interval cancers, that is one of the aspects on which it will come back with recommendations.  That will be incorporated into the recommendations for implementation going forward.  There are a series of steps that are examining quality at a much lower level, including, as I said, at individual screener laboratory in the Coombe and in Quest, which are the two current providers.</p></speech>

As he is not here to clarify that point, perhaps Dr. Henry would do so.  Am I correct that the point he was making is that inclusion of the missing slides would not have had a material effect on the overall aggregate data.

I am joined by Fergal O&rsquo;Leary, member of the commission, who has responsibility for our consumer protection and advocacy activity.</p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, was established in 2014.  We work to improve consumer welfare across the economy by enforcing more than 40 competition and consumer protection legislative instruments.  Through our advocacy efforts, we work to influence public debate and policy development, promoting competition and highlighting the interests of consumers.  We are active in several markets including motor insurance, ticketing, public transport procurement, the motor sector, nursing homes and in the retail sector regarding pricing and product safety.  Most recently we commenced a major study on the public liability insurance market.</p> <p>  The legal services market has been a high priority for the CCPC and our predecessor organisation, the Competition Authority, for many years.  I want to outline some of the key aspects of our work and highlight some potential considerations that would help to address some of the issues in the market.</p> <p>  Legal services are fundamental to the functioning of our economy.  The State, and therefore taxpayers, is the biggest purchaser of legal services.  Excessive legal fees, along with out-dated, inefficient practices, increase the cost of doing business, while also resulting in higher costs for all consumers of legal services.  In 2006, our predecessor organisation, the Competition Authority, published its final report on competition among solicitors and barristers.  The report concluded the legal profession was saturated with unnecessary and disproportionate restrictions on competition and was in need of substantial reform.  These restrictions limited access, choice and value for money for those wishing to enter the legal profession and for those purchasing legal services.</p> <p>  From the consumer perspective, the legal services market was, and remains, extremely challenging to navigate.  As is the case for most professional services, there is an information asymmetry between the profession and consumers.  The ability to compare offerings is limited, particularly when the service is required urgently.  An additional difficulty arises given the uncertainty around cost, as the likely cost of services is often uncertain at the outset.</p> <p>  One of the challenging features of the legal services system is that it is characterised by well-organised groups of professionals who have been effective at influencing the nature and pace of reform efforts.  Since our 2006 report and recommendations, several important developments have taken place, including the establishment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority and recently, the Legal Costs Adjudicator.  However, as is widely acknowledged, the pace of reform has been slow and much more work needs to be done.  The cost of legal services is a critical concern for anyone who has to engage the services of either a barrister or a solicitor, including the State.  An assessment of whether costs have increased, or are high, can be made only on the basis of accurate industry data.  In most markets, a sectorial regulator is best placed to gather such data.  The CCPC is of the opinion that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority should promote public awareness and disseminate information to the public in respect of the cost of legal services.</p> <p>  The CCPC believes that action is also required in the area of education and training of legal practitioners to enhance consumer choice and competition between legal practitioners.  Existing monopolies on the provision of legal education and training held by the Honourable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns and the Law Society of Ireland should be brought to an end and replaced by a system of regulated standards for education, overseen by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  The opening up of these markets would enhance the quality and standards of legal services education while encouraging the emergence of competing providers.  There is also scope to reduce the barriers to entry to the legal professions.  There are unnecessary costs and duplication in education encountered by new entrants and those switching between the professions.  Competition in legal services education would not only address issues in terms of access and choice but would also contribute to bringing down costs.</p> <p>  Specifically, on consumer access to redress, and in the context of the types of issues we deal with day to day through our consumer helpline, consumers can seek redress through the small claims procedure and through a small number of alternative dispute resolution processes.  However, there are challenges to both, with low engagement levels with the alternative dispute resolution process.  The limit for claims that can be brought by consumers through the small claims procedure is currently &euro;2,000.  We have in the past and continue to suggest that consideration should be given to increasing the small claims value in order that consumers can seek their own redress for higher value products and services.  For example, the European small claims procedure, which allows for a claim to be made in civil or commercial matters against a trader based in another member state, had its limit increased to &euro;5,000 in 2017.</p> <p>  A further significant future development in this area is in the field of collective redress.  We note that in November EU member states agreed on a position which would make it possible for consumers across the EU to go to court as a group, when a trader has harmed them, which is a positive move for consumers.</p> <p>  The CCPC believes that, despite reforms, the legal services market could and should be more competitive.  If further reforms were introduced, they would drive higher levels of competition, consumers, businesses and the State would benefit.  While some progress has been made, significant issues which led to the establishment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, including low levels of competition, barriers to entry, self-regulation and resulting high costs have not yet been resolved.  Meaningful reform will be achieved only if momentum is maintained.  The scrutiny afforded to this cause by the committee is welcome in that regard.  The CCPC is committed to playing its part in this reform.</p></speech>

I will begin with the role of the SCA legal costs unit and then make specific comments on third-party legal costs in personal injury cases.</p> <p>  The legal costs unit was established in the SCA in 2013 to deal with third-party costs arising from certain tribunals of inquiry, namely, the Mahon, Moriarty, Morris and Smithwick tribunals.  Its remit has been extended to include third-party legal costs of the State and certain State authorities.</p><p>This means the legal costs unit deals with third-party legal costs of these State authorities regardless of whether they arise in the course of the SCA's claims management work or involve other legal costs incurred by the State authority concerned.  The legal costs unit carefully examines the legal costs submitted by the representatives of plaintiffs, before negotiating to cut the State's bill for legal costs by as much as possible.  If it cannot reach an acceptable agreement, it refers the case to a legal costs adjudicator, subject to a right of appeal to the High Court.  The legal costs unit has successfully achieved significant savings for the State.  I have attached a summary of our results in 2017 and 2018 and the position up to the end of November 2019 as an appendix to this opening statement.</p><p> While we are aware of the significant level of public dissatisfaction with legal costs, our view is that large sections of the legal services market work effectively.  We believe that in terms of the remuneration of solicitors or barristers, legal costs are generally non-controversial in areas like probate, conveyancing, company law, acquisitions and mergers, and commercial disputes.  The introduction of the lawyer-client terms and conditions agreement mandated under section 150 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 is likely to enhance relationships and competitive fee structures in these areas.  The common denominator driving the smooth working of these areas of law is pure economic market forces.  In short, consumers have never been more empowered and equipped to shop around, and indeed they do so in respect of certain categories of legal costs expenditure in which there is a direct contractual liability to meet the cost of the service rendered.</p><p> It would be a mistake to say the entire market for legal services is functioning as competitively as it should.  Personal injury litigation is the great outlier in this regard, largely due to the widespread take-up of no-win, no-fee retainers.  It cannot be disputed that such terms facilitate access to justice for those who would not otherwise have the means.  In basic terms, the injured party may not have the financial resources to fund litigation but has a good case which the solicitor is keen to take.  However, the costs are ultimately paid by a third-party insurer or indemnifier and there is no incentive on the plaintiff to shop around or to seek value with regard to the fees charged.  It was made clear in the 2005 report of the legal costs working group, which was known as the Haran group, that the problem with this is that the person paying the piper "is not in a position" to call the tune.  This model does not work unless the defendant or potential indemnifier for damages and costs has sufficient resources and there is a good prospect of success with the claim.</p><p> It is worth noting that excessively high legal costs in personal injury litigation were flagged during an earlier pressure point in the mid-1980s.  This resulted in the introduction of certain measures to alleviate the problem.  One such measure, section 5 of the Courts Act 1988, was enacted to end the practice of briefing two senior counsel and one junior counsel in personal injury cases.  The Bar Council, as it was then known, held a meeting of members which resolved that not more than one senior counsel and one junior counsel shall seek to recover brief fees on a taxation of party and party costs in personal injuries actions.  An undertaking in these terms was provided to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and the relevant statutory provisions were left in abeyance.  The undertaking has since been withdrawn unilaterally by the Bar of Ireland on the grounds that it is anti-competitive.  To date, the impact by way of increased claims for the numbers of counsel brief fees has been limited to a small number of catastrophic injury claims.  However, in a written ruling delivered in one such case, the taxing master opined that claims for two senior counsel and one junior counsel are likely to become more frequent as the precedent for such representation becomes more established.</p><p> The legal costs provisions introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 are to be welcomed and have the potential to reduce litigation costs.  For example, the modification of the costs-follow-the-event rule provided for in section 169 of the Act will enable the court to carve out costs orders that do justice between the parties.  The new court rules contained in Sl 584/2019 will be also of assistance to paying parties with capacity to make lodgments or tender against legal costs liabilities with a view to avoiding some of the costs of adjudication.  These measures were identified by the Haran group as necessary to reduce costs.  There are good reasons to believe they will achieve this aim.  The Haran group also advocated a three-pronged approach for reducing legal costs, involving the replacement of the taxation of costs system, the introduction of enhanced and meaningful lawyer-client written retainers and an overhaul of court processes with a view to increased efficiency.  Progress has been made in all three areas.  The newly appointed chief legal costs adjudicator brings a vast amount of experience in legal costs knowledge.  He has undoubted expertise and is well placed to improve the operation of the rules for all parties by way of practice directions, protocols and other informal guidelines.  The new four-phase bill of costs, which replaces the traditional lump sum approach, is aimed at providing more transparency in the process.  Transparency in costs claimed is an area in which further work could prove beneficial.</p><p> The legal costs landscape in England and Wales has been undergoing major transformation in recent years.  As these reforms remain ongoing, it may be too soon to draw conclusions about their overall effect.  I draw the committee's attention to two particular initiatives: proportionality and costs management.  Under the principle of proportionality, no more should be payable than if the litigation had been conducted in a proportionate manner.  The so-called Lowndes test indicates that if global costs are disproportionate, individual items should not be allowed unless it is established that they were necessarily incurred and reasonable.  A more radical approach evolved whereby a final costs figure was effectively guillotined if the outcome was deemed to be disproportionate to the issues litigated.  In recent times, there has been a move away from the guillotine approach towards the original Lowndes test, as enunciated in 2002.  Section 17 of the Courts Act 1981, as replaced by section 14 of the Courts Act 1991, is an example of an earlier Irish experience with this principle.  The rule was generally unsuccessful because the prevailing view on the adjudication of costs was that the statutory cap had no application in respect of negotiated settlements or consent orders where the onus was placed on the paying party to make express provision for the limitation as a term of the settlement.  Furthermore, increases in the jurisdiction of the courts have rendered the 1991 provision redundant.</p><p> Proportionality can be of particular use in some lower-value claims in which the costs claimed and allowed can exceed the damages awarded.  In England and Wales, cost management is inextricably linked to case management as an overriding principle of the civil procedure rules.  A cost-budgeting approach is regularly used in the UK courts at a preliminary phase of proceedings and is prospective in nature.  The parties apply to the court for approval of a litigation budget which is enforced with liberty to increase the amount fixed for costs in limited circumstances only.  Such a system can have benefits for larger claims in which case management directions are currently an issue.  I hope my remarks have been helpful to the committee.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.657" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Hassett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019121800002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make this address.  I am joined by Mr. Michael Horan, who is our non-life manager; and by Mr. Declan Jackson, who is our director of Government affairs.  Insurance Ireland represents the general insurance, health insurance, life assurance, international, reinsurance and captive management sector.  We represent 140 companies.  Our membership is split approximately 50:50 between companies that write insurance for the domestic market and companies that sell to the international market from Ireland.  Insurance Ireland members export insurance cover to 110 countries throughout the world.  We have more than 25 million policy holders.  Our members pay out &euro;13 billion in claims and benefits annually and contribute more than &euro;1.6 billion to the Exchequer each year.  Total industry employment is 28,000, both direct and indirect.  One in four jobs in financial services in Ireland is in insurance.</p> <p>  It is important to provide some context before we discuss the practical aspects of the Irish legal system.  Legal costs and processes must be seen in the context of the urgent need to reform our cost of claims.  We know that the average personal injury award in the most frequent category, that of soft tissue whiplash, is 4.4 times greater than in the UK.  This very stark fact cannot continue to be ignored.  The cost of compensation awards is the defining issue in the Irish non-life market.  This has been established by the Personal Injuries Commission and in the policy approach that led to the establishment of the Judicial Council.  The need to reform ancillary costs such as legal fees is equally pressing.  The recommended reforms which were set out clearly in the report of the cost of insurance working group must be completed as a matter of urgency.  Therefore, the consideration of legal costs by this committee must be cognisant of the wider impacts of legal fees and the need for urgent reform of costs.</p> <p>  We are seeking to provide a perspective from the insurance sector, which is a heavy user of, and highly dependent on, the Irish legal system.  In our evidence before the committee, we will concentrate on the civil justice system, with which our members interact on a daily basis.  On behalf of policy holders and customers, insurers are seeking four essential qualities when we interact with the legal system.  First, we want it to be consistent, which means that predicted outcomes can be repeated in similar settings on numerous occasions.  Second, we want it to be efficient, which means that no party to the proceedings should spend more than necessary in terms of time and resources to get to the outcome.  Third, we want it to be independently reviewed, which means the actions and expectations of all participants in the system should be reviewed to ensure the legal system is delivering against policy goals.  Fourth, we want it to be fair, which means that the system gives a fair outcome to policy holders and those who have suffered through no fault of their own.</p><p> On consistency, insurance companies are supporters of the model as operated by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  We support it because it is consistent with the award levels in the book of quantum and there is stability in terms of delivery costs, which were 6.1% in 2018 with an average processing time of 7.2 months.  Traditionally, insurers accept the determination of PIAB in approximately 90% of the cases where such a determination is made.  PIAB is consistent in terms of amounts awarded as well as time to deliver and cost of delivery.  It should be noted that PIAB put through more cases in 2018 than it did in 2010, although this increase stabilised from 2014 onwards.</p><p> In contrast, litigated cases are adjudicated subject to the facts as presented before the judge on the day the case runs.  The variables in such a situation may be as elementary as the relative skill and experience of the legal teams on either side.  The justice system is suffering from increased demands on capacity.  In 2014, 17,763 personal injury cases were filed across the District, Circuit and High Courts.  In 2018, 22,049 such cases were filed across the three court.  For valid reasons, there is inconsistency in the amounts awarded in litigated cases, as illustrated by the figures for each court.</p><p> On how the legal system can become more consistent, the establishment of the Judicial Council is to be welcomed.  The operation of the personal insurance committee of the council will be vital in reviewing and striking a just quantum for Irish personal injury awards.  We believe it was an error not to give the book of quantum to the Judiciary when it was first introduced in 2004.  Judicial peer review of decisions, in conjunction with training and collective judge-led learning, will assist in further generating consistency in awards.  Much of the legislative basis for this is contained in the Judicial Council Act 2019, under which the book of quantum will be replaced by statutory guidelines on personal injuries awards.  These guidelines will result in a system similar to that in operation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p><p> In advocating for efficiency, we are striving for a situation whereby no party to proceedings spends more time or resources than is necessary to get to the appropriate outcome.  The Irish legal system does not perform well in respect of time to decision.  According to the World Bank, the average time from filing a proceeding in Ireland to enforcement of justice is 650 days.  The OECD average is 578 days, while only two other EU 27 Countries, namely, Poland and Italy, take longer than Ireland.  Irish insurers typically reserve on the basis that judgment in litigated personal injury cases will be delivered between four and six years after the date of an incident.  In the UK, insurers typically reserve on the basis that judgment will be delivered between two and four years after the date of an incident.  Time to settle is a key indicator of efficiency in litigated cases as the settlement offered is based on prevailing injury award levels at the time of judicial decision rather than the date of the incident.  This can involve considerable inflation.  There was considerable inflation in the size of awards contained in the second edition of the book of quantum published in 2016 compared to the first edition, published in 2004.</p><p> Costs for delivery are also considerable as a direct result of the time to deliver.  In this regard, I will rely on two Government reports, namely, the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, legal costs bulletin 2016 and the Department of Finance motor insurance key information report 2017.  The NCC bulletin indicates that, based on CSO data, legal services prices did not fall for a prolonged period between 2007 and 2015.  To illustrate the point, the NCC contrasted this with the fall in the price of accounting services.  The Department of Finance report found that legal and other costs in closed personal injury claims typically accounted for 42% of the compensation amount paid to claimants.  In 2016, the average personal injury payment to those involved in a motor accident was &euro;23,600, which aligns with the average PIAB motor award of &euro;22,454 for that year.</p><p> On how the legal system can become more efficient, there should be more active case management to ensure that cases, once entered, are heard as quickly as possible.  There is a suspicion that the seeking of leave to adjourn is often used as a lever in negotiation.  There should be agreement on independent medical experts and methodologies of assessment which would decrease the time taken to reach a judicial determination.  The Judicial Council Act which passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas in July 2019 and was commenced yesterday evening by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is of importance.  Effort should be made to extend the pre-action protocol model from medical negligence cases to personal injury cases.</p><p> On an independent review process, given the nature of litigation, a very narrow understanding of review is often applied.  In the past, this has been confined to appeals of judicial decisions.  It is for this reason that Insurance Ireland supports the role of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA.  Specifically, we believe the authority will be vital in protecting and promoting the interests of consumers and promoting competition in the provision of legal services in the State.  The principle of independent investigation of complaints is to be welcomed.  There is no national aggregate collection of costs as they apply to litigation and this lack of insight makes it difficult to undertake effective analysis of legal costs.  In turn, public policy is often fragmented and without a frame of reference.</p><p> I refer to how to review the performance of the legal system and the associated costs.  The establishment of the LSRA is welcome but the length of time for it to become fully operational illustrates the complexity of the task it faces.  It should be actively supported to be self-funded and fulfil its mandate as a matter of priority.  Once fully operational, it should be given a mandate to conduct proactive and own initiative thematic reviews, rather than merely investigate complaints.  In so doing, the authority would be acting in line with best international supervisory practice.  We would like to see a national aggregated collection of legal costs as a ratio to compensation payments in civil disputes.  In time, such an agreed data source would provide the necessary raw data to evaluate the success or otherwise of public policy in this area.</p><p> On fairness, the balancing of rights and responsibilities between claimant and policyholder is difficult and can lead to the generation of considerable costs.  We would support a system which may separate the issues of damages and liability.  In such a system there may be an increased role for PIAB in determining damages and, prior to moving to litigation, a form of arbitration to establish where liability rests.  Ideally the arbitration should take place quickly and allow for a speedier conclusion of the matter.  This may be fairer and avoid full litigation.  Such a system has been successful in the commercial courts and would mean that only cases involving irreconcilable differences between the parties would come before a judge for a full hearing.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to come before it this morning.  We look forward to answering members' questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.659" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019121800002#G00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to appear to discuss the issue of legal costs.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ultan Ryan, secretary to the authority.  The invitation letter issued by the committee suggested that witnesses may wish to focus on issues they believe are most relevant to their areas of expertise.  Of the areas of examination listed by the committee, those most relevant to the role of the LSRA relate to greater transparency on legal costs in Ireland and increased competition within the legal sector which may reduce costs.</p> <p>  It may be helpful to outline the relevant statutory objectives and functions of the LSRA that frame its mandate, highlighting those directly relevant to the matter at hand and the concerns of the committee.  I will provide an update on the status of the LSRA in fulfilling its broad statutory remit with emphasis on the areas of activity that might have most impact in the areas of cost and competition.  I will look ahead to the new year and some elements of the future work programme of the LSRA relevant to the costs of legal services in the State.</p> <p>  The LSRA is the new independent regulator for the provision of legal services by legal practitioners.  Section 13(4) of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 sets out the six statutory objectives of the LSRA which are, in effect, our operating principles.  These are to protect and promote the public interest, support the proper and effective administration of justice, protect and promote the interests of consumers relating to the provision of legal services, promote competition in the provision of legal services in the State, encourage an independent, strong and effective legal profession and promote and maintain adherence to the professional principles of legal practitioners as specified in the Act.</p><p>The committee will note that while a reduction in legal costs is not explicitly mentioned, we are tasked with protecting the public interest, the interests of consumers of legal services and with promoting competition.  The Act intends that these principles guide the authority in all of the work it undertakes.  The authority&rsquo;s 11 functions are set out under section 13 of the Act, and in the context of today two of those functions are particularly relevant.  I will not read all of section 13 into the record.  It is included in our submission.  I will highlight subsections (e) and (g) which relate, respectively, to receiving and investigating complaints and to promoting public awareness and disseminating information to the public in respect of legal services, including the cost of such services.  The committee will note that the remit of the LSRA is broad.</p><p> The membership of the authority is comprised of 11 members who are appointed by the Government following nomination by a number of bodies.  The Government appointments to the authority are approved by resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Of the Authority&rsquo;s 11 members, six are lay members including a lay chairperson, Dr. Don Thornhill, and five are non-laypersons.  The six lay members are nominated by the following bodies: the Citizens Information Board; the Higher Education Authority; the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants; and the Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland.  Of the five non-lay members one is nominated by the Bar Council-Bar of Ireland, one is a solicitor nominated by the Legal Aid Board, one member is nominated by the Honorable Society of King&rsquo;s Inns and two are nominated by the Law Society.  Each member of the authority is statutorily required to act on a part-time basis.  The authority is required by law to be independent in the performance of its functions.  Authority members are required to protect and promote the public interest.  They are nominees and not representatives of the nominating bodies.  The authority has met on 19 occasions since its establishment.</p><p> The executive function of the authority is provided by myself as the CEO and by the staff of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  As I mentioned earlier, the statutory remit of the LSRA is broad.  In terms of areas of our work that relate most directly to legal costs, there are three key areas that I will focus on today, namely, legal costs transparency; promoting competition; and complaints about costs.  On legal costs transparency, from 7 October 2019 under sections 150 and 152 of the 2015 Act, legal practitioners are required to provide specific and detailed notices on costs to their clients.  Under the new provisions, when solicitors and barristers first receive instructions from a client they must provide the client with a notice written in clear and understandable language setting out the legal costs that will be incurred in the matter concerned or, if this is not reasonably practicable, the basis on which the legal costs are to be calculated.  Section 150 sets out in detail the information that must be included in the notice.  This includes the costs incurred up to the date of the notice; the costs that are certain to be incurred and the costs that are likely to be incurred; the amount of VAT to be charged; information as to the likely legal and financial consequences of the client&rsquo;s withdrawal from the litigation and its discontinuance; and information as to the circumstances in which the client would be likely to be required to pay the costs of one or more other parties to the litigation and information as to the circumstances in which it would be likely that the costs of the legal practitioner would not be fully recoverable from other parties to the litigation.  There is also an obligation under the Act for the legal practitioner to provide a further notice to the client where they become aware of any factor that would make the legal costs likely to be incurred significantly greater than those disclosed or indicated in the first notice.  This means that the process of notification of costs is an ongoing one and not just an initial once-off notification.  Legal practitioners are also now required to provide, as soon as practicable after the conclusion of legal services, a signed bill of costs that meets the requirements of the Act including an itemised statement of the amounts charged in respect of the legal services.  The provisions of sections 150 and 152 are an important step in the promotion of transparency and consistency in how legal services are costed and billed.  These new requirements on legal practitioners will allow consumers of legal services to make more informed decisions in respect of the legal services which they have sought.  With updated notices being provided to them, they will have the opportunity to review their own choices, priorities and decisions as to how they wish to proceed.</p><p> The LSRA expects that it will be required in due course to consider complaints where it is alleged that section 150 notices were not provided, were not clear or were inadequate.  However, these notices should greatly improve communication and transparency on cost between practitioner and client, which should in turn have a positive impact in respect of volumes of such complaints.  Section 150 and the requirements of this part of the Act go a long way towards providing a statutory framework for the communication of legal costs.  There is now a clear obligation on legal practitioners to be transparent, consistent and thorough in communicating with their clients.  The LSRA will consider the failure to provide a section 150 notice or an accurate notice when considering complaints of excessive costs and the new Legal Costs Adjudicator will also consider the notices when adjudicating on bills of costs.  In fact, a failure to properly comply with the requirement to provide a notice of costs can be taken into account to disallow costs in an adjudication.  The new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator is established under part 10 of the 2015 Act.  The Legal Costs Adjudicator replaces the Taxing Masters&rsquo; Office and is wholly independent and separate from the LSRA.  The new office will also maintain a register of determinations in relation to applications for the adjudication of legal costs, which adds a new layer of transparency to legal costs.</p><p> On promoting competition, the LSRA has conducted public consultations, research and reports on a series of key subjects as required under the Legal Services Regulation Act.  Three of the reports submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality were undertaken in line with the statutory objective of promoting competition in the provision of legal services.  These reports examine or relate to the introduction of legal partnerships in the State, multidisciplinary practices and the consideration of whether barristers should be permitted to hold clients&rsquo; money or to receive direct instructions in contentious matters.</p><p> On limited liability partnerships, LLPs, legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices, in November 2019 the LSRA introduced the framework that will allow existing solicitor partnerships to apply to the LSRA for authorisation to operate as limited liability partnerships.  This is intended to put Ireland on a par with other jurisdictions that have operated LLPs for a number of years but also to have the potential to increase competition in the legal services market, reduce professional indemnity insurance costs for LLPs and to consequently lower legal costs.  Following on from the introduction of LLPs, the Minister for Justice and Equality will be introducing the necessary legislation to allow the LSRA to introduce the framework for legal partnerships as a new business model for legal service delivery in 2020.  Once legal partnerships have been introduced, the LSRA will consider whether multidisciplinary practices would be a viable and positive model for legal services delivery.</p><p> On complaints about costs, on 7 October 2019 the LSRA began receiving and investigating complaints relating to solicitors and barristers.  Since that date, the LSRA has received 522 complaints or queries and more than 847 phone calls and e-mails requesting information or complaint forms.  We have been busy.  It was anticipated that there would be a spike in complaints at the beginning of operations under this function as a result of persons waiting for the LSRA to open its service who might otherwise have made their complaints through the previous framework at the representative bodies.  It should be noted that the LSRA in determining admissibility of complaints cannot admit a complaint to the process where the same or substantially the same complaint has been previously determined by the High Court or by the Law Society or any of its committees or tribunals.  Similar restrictions on admissibility apply in relation to matters which have been the subject of civil or criminal proceedings.  The impact of this is of particular significance at this early stage of the operation of our complaints function as part of the transition to the new regime.  The issue of the cost of legal services is directly relevant to complaints in a number of key ways.  There are three grounds for complaint, namely, that the legal services provided were of an inadequate standard; that the amount of costs sought by the solicitor or barrister were excessive; and that the legal practitioner performed an act or omission which amounts to misconduct under the Act.  There is a degree of overlap between the three grounds for complaints when it comes to costs.  This is because a complaint about excessive costs can actually become a complaint about misconduct where the amount of costs sought is grossly excessive.  Under the definition of misconduct for legal practitioners in the 2015 Act it is misconduct to seek an amount of costs in respect of the provision of legal services that is grossly excessive.  It is also misconduct for a legal practitioner to be involved in an act or omission which involves fraud or dishonesty, is connected with the provision of legal services which are inadequate to a substantial degree or which is likely to bring the profession into disrepute.  Focusing on non-misconduct cases for a moment, in non-misconduct complaints where it is alleged that the amount of costs sought by the legal practitioner in respect of legal services provided to the client was or is excessive, the complainant has three years either from the issuing of the bill of costs or from when the complainant knew or ought reasonably to have known that the amount of costs sought was excessive, to bring the complaint to the LSRA.  If a complaint of excessive costs is made to the LSRA and meets the admissibility criteria under the Act that would allow the LSRA to deal with the complaint, the LSRA must first attempt to informally resolve or mediate the complaint between the legal practitioner and the complainant.  We are hopeful, based on our experience so far from 7 October, that both legal practitioners and complainants will engage in this process and allow for an early resolution of issues of cost and inadequate service.  However, where the client or the legal practitioner do not accept the invitation to informally resolve the complaint of excessive costs, where attempts to resolve are not successful or where the LSRA forms the view that a resolution or agreement is unlikely, the LSRA has the power, having first sought the views of the parties, to determine the complaint.  This means that the LSRA can direct that the costs were, in fact, not excessive or where it concludes that the costs sought were excessive can direct the legal practitioner to refund without delay, either wholly or in part as directed, any amount already paid by or on behalf of the client in respect of the practitioner&rsquo;s costs in connection with the bill of costs or to waive, whether wholly or in part, the right to recover those costs.  Any direction of the LSRA can be appealed by the client or the legal practitioner to an independent review committee. The decisions of the review committee ultimately can be appealed to the High Court.</p><p> Dealing with misconduct complaints under the Act that relate to costs where it is alleged that the amount of costs sought by a legal practitioner was grossly excessive, these will be considered and assessed for admissibility and the legal practitioner will be given the opportunity to address the allegations.  If the complaint is found to be an admissible complaint, it will be forwarded by the authority to an independent complaints committee.</p><p> The complaints committee is tasked with considering and investigating misconduct complaints, and has a range of sanctions at its disposal, including directing that a legal practitioner participate in a professional competence scheme, that he or she refund to the client some or all of the fees paid, or that he or she pay compensation to the client of a sum set in the Act as not exceeding &euro;5,000.</p><p> Should the complaints committee be of the view that the matter is so serious as to warrant it, it can refer the matter for the consideration of the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal, LPDT.  The tribunal is independent of the LSRA and is in the process of being established through the Department of Justice and Equality.  That tribunal, the LPDT, will consider more serious matters of misconduct and has a wider range of sanctions from advice, admonishment and censure, a direction that the legal practitioner pay up to &euro;15,000 restitution to the client, to a direction that a specified condition or restriction be placed on the legal practitioner's practice.  The tribunal can also apply to the High Court for further measures including that a legal practitioner be prohibited from practice.</p><p> Under section 73 of the 2015 Act, the LSRA is required to report on the operation of its complaint function every six months.  The first report is due before 7 April 2020.  The Act requires that figures on the nature and type of complaints received be included in the report, and the LSRA intends to identify and outline where trends in complaints have emerged.</p><p> Even in the relatively short time that has passed since 7 October 2019, complaint themes are emerging.  The one feature that seems to cut across almost all of them is, perhaps unsurprisingly, communication.  Where a legal practitioner fails to explain adequately to a client the costs of legal proceedings or services, the timeline it may take to deliver legal services, or the risk involved in pursuing certain costs of legal action, complaints will naturally follow.</p><p> I mention briefly the roll of practising barristers, which the LSRA established in 2018.  The roll is a tool by which members of the public can be assured that the barrister to whom they may turn for legal advice is lawfully entitled to provide legal services.  It is published on the LSRA's website.</p><p> We have also issued professional indemnity insurance regulations for barristers.  This means that, for the first time, practising barristers outside of the Bar of Ireland are required to have minimum levels of professional indemnity insurance that provide an important protection for consumers.</p><p> I draw the committee's attention to a number of other initiatives under the Act that the LSRA will be undertaking in 2020.  We will be issuing advertising regulations in the new year that will govern the advertising of legal services.  We will also issue regulations that will allow us to enhance the roll of practising barristers to include information on barristers' areas of practice and specialism.</p><p> We were disappointed not to be able to introduce legal partnerships alongside limited liability partnerships as a new model of legal service delivery in 2019, but there is a need for a legislative amendment before this can be done.  We have been assured of the Minister for Justice and Equality's support for that amendment.  This will allow barrister-barrister partnerships and solicitor-barrister partnerships to be formed for the first time and, although take-up may be modest to begin with, the new model has the potential to reduce costs for consumers.  Once we have delivered legal partnerships, we have committed to revisiting the issue of multidisciplinary practices under the 2015 Act.</p><p> Before 30 April 2020, the authority is required to report for the first time, and thereafter annually, on the admissions policies of the legal profession and to assess whether the number of persons admitted to practise as barristers and solicitors in 2019 was consistent with the public interest in ensuring the availability of legal services at a reasonable cost.  The LSRA is also required to consult publicly and to report to the Minister before 1 October 2020 on whether the profession of solicitor and barrister should be unified.  Finally, and this is not an exhaustive list, the LSRA in 2020 will submit a further report to the Minister, following on from our initial report of September 2018, on the education and training of legal practitioners with recommendations as to potential reforms.  All of these reports have, at the very least, the potential to lead to reforms that could increase competition in the delivery of legal services and could have a positive impact on the costs of those services.</p><p> My colleague and I look forward to engaging with the Chairperson and the members of the committee and to responding to any issues and questions that may arise.</p></speech>

I have indications from Deputies O'Callaghan, Jack Chambers, Pringle and Martin Kenny, and I will start with Deputy O'Callaghan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019121800002#J00300"><p>I thank everyone for coming in here and for their submissions.  I have been a barrister for a long time.  Usually, I do not like to give speeches about my own assessment but I will give these entities my assessment of how legal costs could be reduced.  I want to hear what they have to say in respect of it.  It is helpful that we have here before us today two of the largest purchasers of legal services - insurance companies and the State.  In most cases that are operating in the courts, most defendants will be indemnified.  They are covered by insurance companies and, therefore, insurance companies are involved in most cases.  There is also a large part of litigation that involves the State.  That is nothing unusual.  It would be the same in most other parts of the world as well.</p> <p>  In terms of purchasing the services of barristers, there are approximately 2,300 in the country and the vast majority of the work is probably done by 300 barristers.  It is a very competitive environment being a barrister in Ireland, and there are a large number of people who are highly educated, have qualified to be a barrister, have worked there for many years but who are not getting much work.  They are not making a living out of it.  Part of the problem, in my assessment, is that the large purchasers of legal services purchase services from the same group of successful people all the time.  That is understandable because going to court is an unusual event - it can be an exceptional event - and one wants to ensure that one will not hire somebody who is untested.</p> <p>  However, it would be helpful if insurance companies, the State and everyone else who is involved in litigation would shop around a bit more to try and see whether there are other places they could go to get the work done.  It is as though all of these entities are shopping in Brown Thomas.  There are other shops that they could go to and look for services.  I do not say this to facilitate younger barristers who are desperate to make a living.  It will have the impact of reducing the amount of money these entities must pay on legal costs.  I am sure at present insurance companies have barristers and solicitors who are doing cases in the courts for them, and the State has as well, but if there were a mechanism whereby cases could be put out to tender to see whether a person would charge a certain amount for a case, I guarantee it would get younger qualified capable barristers who would be prepared to do the work for 75% of what is being charged at present.  When the State Claims Agency is trying to purchase the services of, for example, a barrister or a solicitor, to what extent do Mr. Mack or Mr. Dunning shop around and, having heard that Jack Chambers will do it for a certain amount, ask whether another barrister or solicitor will do it for 75% of that?</p></speech>

First, we welcome the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  That fits in exactly with what the Deputy stated.  It encourages people to shop around.  My role, as head of legal costs, involves third-party legal costs, and I am not fully qualified to explain our position as a purchaser of legal services.  Suffice it to say that we certainly have a procurement model within the agency in terms of barrister panels acting for our own clinical indemnity scheme and general indemnity scheme.  It is a feature of what we do at the agency.  We are in a position to manage and control the costs that we directly incur, but the same cannot be said about third-party costs where, to quote Haran, we do not get "to call the tune".  We can manage our own spend and do so in terms of some of the clinical indemnity claims and the general indemnity claims.</p></speech>

I suppose third-party costs to a large extent will be determined by the costs that the State or the insurance company is paying out.  If there is a medical negligence case or another case the State is involved in, is there some mechanism whereby barristers could tender their price for that case and the State could decide, as in any other procurement process, that it would go with that person, stating that he or she seems well qualified and deserving of a chance?</p></speech>

My assessment is that it is an extremely competitive place but the reason costs are not coming down is because people are not availing of the full panoply of people who are available and are sticking with the same people most of the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Isolde Goggin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019121800002#K00700"><p>That is a very good point.  From our point of view, when we are looking at competition in the market, it is not enough that there are many competitors in the market.  I take the Deputy's point that there are many barristers and it is a very long-tail profession.  There are a few superstars at the top who are making a lot of money and many people down at the end who are scratching around trying to make a living and finding it very hard to survive, particularly in the first few years.</p> <p>  The difficulty in competition comes down to the point I was making about information asymmetries.  In many consumer transactions, there is an information asymmetry between the ordinary person who is going to court for the first time or whatever and the solicitor or barrister who understands how the case might evolve and the cost.  Also, within the profession, there are many information asymmetries, even for professional buyers, the insurance industry and the State.  If I am looking for somebody who has a competition specialism, how do I know who they are?  It is very difficult.  One tends to rely on word of mouth, and that exacerbates the problem.</p> <p>  In terms of the point Mr. Doherty was making about barristers being able to point out their areas of specialism on the barristers roll, that would give one a start.  One would at least be able to say that apart from the big names that everybody has heard of, there are people who have litigated in this area about whom the solicitor one is using might not have heard but who could be brought into the mix.  The idea of going to tender for that is a good one, once we have a base of knowledge of who does this kind of work, because some of it is quite specialised.</p> <p>  The other area we brought up in the report and on which I know the Legal Services Regulatory Authority is working is the one of barrister partnerships.  If one is doing litigation frequently, one finds that the top barristers constantly double and triple-book themselves.  It then comes to the date and they are in the Supreme Court so they cannot do the High Court or the Central Criminal Court and they give the case to somebody else.  For us, the advantage of barrister partnerships from the consumer point of view is that they are a sort of guarantee of quality.  I refer to an arrangement like chambers in the UK.  If one is going to a certain chamber, that chamber is a mark of quality so one knows that if the case is being passed on to somebody, he or she will reach the same high quality of the person one originally wanted.  We believe that more flexibility in the business models would make it easier for new people to get in, get a start and not be expected to make a living in the same way as the top people do through word of mouth but through being handed over work within a partnership or a firm.  We believe being able to say, "Yes, I have an expertise in this area and put that on the roll", would help them a good deal as well.</p></speech>

One can go on the Law Library of Ireland website and check the expertise of a barrister.  In my assessment, it is an obligation on the purchaser of the legal service, the person who is spending the money, to look around to see if he or she can get this cheaper.  That is what we would do in any market.  We look around.  If we want to get a flight somewhere, we do not necessarily book the first one we see.</p></speech>

They tend to go for the superstar names if they can get them because they believe that is a guarantee of quality.  There is a fear of people who are lesser known but we need to find ways of overcoming that.  We would have an obligation to get the best value possible.  When I say "we" I mean anybody in the State who is making these purchases.  We also have an obligation to do our best to win the case.  That is where that choice becomes very difficult for people when they do not know much about other parts of the industry than the very top 1% or 2%.</p></speech>

The profession is full of young, talented people who do not get an opportunity.  I have trained barristers and opportunity is the biggest determinant in terms of whether their career takes off.  Some of them get it; some of them do not.</p></speech>

It is hard to get into them.  If one does not get into a good chambers, one will not get anywhere.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for the Insurance Ireland witnesses.  My first is to Mr. Hassett.  In fairness to Insurance Ireland, its assessment is that the recent premiums in Ireland are too high is because judges' awards are too high, there are too many fraudulent claims and legal costs are too high.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Hassett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019121800002#K01300"><p>One is the primary reason and then there are other secondary reasons.  If we take, say, motor insurance, 8% of claims relate to personal injury and 75% of costs relate to personal injury.  A typical personal injury claim for, say, a whiplash soft tissue injury is of the order of &euro;20,800.  That is four and a half times the size of an equivalent award in the UK.  That is the primary issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the secondary issue, we are short of data on this but our supposition is that because the awards are relatively high, it creates a bit of an incentive for people to commit fraud here more than, say, in the UK.  Also, we are aware that the cases that get litigated and go through the courts system can attract legal costs of up to 60% of the settlement amount.  The fundamental issue is the awards.  Everything else flows from that.</p></speech>

It would be District Court and Circuit Court, so the Court of Appeal does not reach down into those.  We believe the mechanism for that is the judicial council.  In terms of the larger awards, the Court of Appeal is reducing those in the High Court but the average award settlement for motor personal injury will be about &euro;23,000 or &euro;24,000.  That will fall below the High Court.</p></speech>

The Central Bank report is helpful in providing a clear lens on something complex.  It is, however, a clear lens in hindsight.  In the year in which a premium is collected, an insurance company will not be sure what the claims liability is going to be.  That estimate will sometimes be undershot and other times it will be overshot.  In fact, the one thing we know is that we will never get it precisely accurate.  What we see in an insurance cycle is that in some years we undershoot and in others we overshoot, and that is why premiums fluctuate year on year.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Hassett on the legal costs.  Looking at the Central Bank report, we can see the legal costs are reasonable when cases are resolved at the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, or even before that stage.  It is when cases are litigated that the legal costs become too large.  They are too high a percentage of the award.  Does the fact that so many cases can be resolved at PIAB not show that all the efforts of insurance companies should be focused on trying to settle cases there?</p></speech>

We are not <i>au fait </i>with the individual profit characteristics of firms, but what is clear in the liability market is that much of it, particularly some of the specialty cases, has been covered by syndicates from the UK.  Those syndicates are exiting the market and are no longer willing to write cover.  That would seem to indicate the necessity of some structural reforms.  I do not have access to individual profit numbers, however.</p></speech>

This meeting is happening in the context of serious developments in the childcare sector and the ongoing crisis in the motor insurance sector.  My first question is for the representatives of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  We have a competition issue in the insurance market, which is borne out by profitability and the mismatch between what we are hearing from the industry and the backdrop of claims.  The cyclical data over ten years highlight the clear difficulties we have.  Is there a competition issue generally and can the CCPC provide information on that?  Will the representatives from the CCPC also provide an update on the investigation ongoing regarding Insurance Ireland?  There is an allegation regarding Insurance Ireland acting in a cartel-like capacity and I would like an update on that issue.</p></speech>

On competition in the insurance market, it is very different in different sectors.  We have been hearing today about what is going on in the motor sector.  We are also carrying out a study, or have been requested by our Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to carry out a study on public liability insurance.  That study is ongoing and is topical.  As Mr. Hassett stated, companies are leaving that market and we seem to be heading for a different type of problem in that area.  I ask my colleague, Mr. O'Leary, to comment on that issue as he is leading on that study.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019121800002#L02500"><p>We have been under way with this study since July, when we got the request from the Minister.  So far, what we are finding, unsurprisingly, is that it is difficult to get data to make evidence-based recommendations in the public liability market.  In and of itself, that is a significant issue.  The lack of transparency on what is happening in the market is not helpful for anybody.  There are certainly issues with this being a niche market in parts.  What we have done is that we have taken the overall market for public liability and we are trying to break it down into as many subsectors as we can.  We are trying to figure out what exactly is the problem for each of those subsectors, and when we can do that we can then come up with some solutions and recommendations for the Government to consider.</p> <p>  What we are seeing, and this was alluded to by Insurance Ireland, is that insurance is cyclical.  There is a soft side to the market when things are good for insurance companies and then there is a hard side when things are not good.  It seems to be, however, that the market for public liability here is a little bit broken at the hard side of the market and we are seeing many exits from the market.  That is the nub of how we can make this better in future.  If we can understand why those companies are leaving and if there are barriers to entry for new companies coming in, then we will be able to come up with recommendations and solutions for individual subsectors such as childcare.  We have engaged in that area and Early Childhood Ireland has been very helpful in providing us with information.  We will be looking for more information from that organisation as a representative of a key subsector.  We need to get to the point of what exactly is the reason for firms leaving at this harder end of the market.</p></speech>

As we said, we absolutely support the Central Bank process in terms of the motor market, and if the CCPC or others want to engage in a similar process on the liability market, we will endeavour to do whatever we can to assist that.  Good transparency ultimately leads to good policy, which is in the long-term interest of all the players.</p></speech>

If we look at what some judges have said, they have said it is a dishonest industry and they have accused Insurance Ireland of having an effective PR strategy to distract from its core profitable basis, which has been represented by the Central Bank report.</p></speech>

It is difficult to respond to that in a general space.  What we have been campaigning on is that the cost of claims is too high, and the Central Bank report absolutely bears that out.  Injury claim cases are now 75% of all motor claims, up from 59% at the start of the decade, and the average cost per claim is up by 64%.</p></speech>

The industry is picking certain picking statistical phenomena to distract from the core probability, which I believe is the focus, and the core issue of competition in the market, given the number of underwriters that are underpinned on average in Ireland is far less than in other areas.</p> <p>  Does the Legal Services Regulatory Authority believe it is correct that a solicitor would ask a doctor to amend a medical report? </p></speech>

It is a misconduct offence under the Act for any solicitor to engage in fraud or dishonesty, so it would be improper for any solicitor to intervene with a doctor to try to amend a report in a dishonest or fraudulent way.  There are scenarios whereby, if the solicitor was to receive a report he thought did not cover all of the actual facts, he may write back to a doctor to say it requires amendment.  There is certainly a line to be drawn and it is not for the solicitor to engage in diagnosing or coming up with medical conclusions.  It is for the doctor to do so independently and also in an ethical way.</p></speech>

In my view, it comes down to pure transparency.  Would the authority like to see both barristers and solicitors publish their prices and their per-hour costs?  I would also like to hear the CCPC view on that point.  Does the Legal Services Regulatory Authority believe there should be full price transparency at entry point?  For me, this is the bigger issue and it is because of the unknown unknowns that legal costs rocket.  Is the Legal Services Regulatory Authority trying to implement that with solicitors, in particular in regard to the cost per hour or the cost for a particular service that is being provided at entry point?  Dr. Doherty mentioned the section 150 obligation that the solicitor would provide the client with the cost.  Should there not be an obligation on the solicitor to provide publicly the potential cost before the service is even sought?</p></speech>

However, the section 150 notices, as they require the legal practitioner to outline in a very detailed and structured way what the costs have been to date and what costs will be incurred, are a useful step and a useful tool.  While this might not have the complete transparency the Deputy is suggesting, it would allow consumers of legal services to shop around, in effect, and to compare one with the other.  We have a responsibility under the Act, and the CCPC referred to this directly, to promote and disseminate information in regard to legal costs.  While the Act does not then continue by providing us with powers to require legal practitioners to provide us with those costs, we can rely on the powers under section 73 in regard to complaints concerning legal costs.  As the legal costs adjudicators register of decisions increases, we hope that will provide us with a mechanism to try to increase transparency.</p></speech>

We also looked at legal fees and engaged with the Law Society.  We were trying to put more information in the public domain about some of the commoditised services that a solicitor may offer such as conveyancing or making a will.  We made some progress with that and I think that more prices are available.  We also looked at the idea of solicitors and, in due course, barristers making known how much an hour of their time costs.  We got into some difficulties about the exact specifics of how that would work.  Ultimately that work was overtaken by the establishment of the LSRA, which has a specific remit in this area.  We think that there should be more transparency and we will continue to work with that.  To be fair to the profession about the specifics of publishing costs upfront, it can be difficult, but nevertheless it is an area in which more progress should be made and we will continue with that.</p></speech>

My colleagues from the LSRA cited communication issues as being one of the main factors that prompt complaints to them.  When consumers are seeking to engage the services of a solicitor, they need to be upfront about what they are looking for, and in return, the solicitor needs to give a reasonable expectation of how much this will cost.  I think that remains an issue and prompts many complaints.  That interaction at the start is not clear enough on both sides.</p></speech>

I googled that this morning and approximately 20 solicitors' firms have used that particular phrase.  We clearly have an industry that is trying to incentivise claims and it is promoting that issue.  Has the LSRA investigated that?  A simple googling of the term would be enough to examine it.  There is an incentive between the service provider who is the legal professional and the client to drive a claim forward to a significant degree beyond the intermediary bodies that have been mentioned.  What is the witnesses' legal assessment of that?  Does it match proper professional practice?  Are they investigating that?</p></speech>

It has been enlightening and interesting.  With regard to complaints about fees and where that takes us, the witnesses made the point that the LSRA has a statutory system for complaints with a limit of &euro;5,000.  One of the flaws relates to when a legal process is going on.  I have come across a situation where a person has a dispute with a solicitor about the fees charged, where they believe they were wrongly charged and overcharged and the service provided was not adequate for the money being charged.  The solicitor has moved very quickly to take a case against that person.  If that were to happen quickly, is it correct that the LSRA cannot intervene?  If a solicitor has moved to recover the costs legally and has taken that person to court or taken proceedings against him or her, the LSRA is prohibited from engaging at that point and the person cannot complain to it.</p></speech>

I believe that the Act allows that the LSRA can examine the issue and can, in certain circumstances, append the consideration of the complaint to the conclusion of the legal proceedings.  An avenue is open to the LSRA to consider the complaint.  I do not think the issue of complaints has arisen since 7 October.  I do not think it is a prohibition.  It is a prohibition if a court has determined the issue, but if it is pending, I believe that we can still have jurisdiction in certain circumstances.  Obviously the court proceedings may taken precedence in certain circumstances.</p></speech>

I will come back to what Deputy Chambers was speaking about earlier - no foal, no fee - which is a term that one would often hear.</p><p>The problem here is more one of regulation than whether it should be a practice that we need.  I refer to circumstances where a person with a strong case, wherever that might be, reaches an agreement with a legal practitioner that he or she will not be charged anything if the case is not won.  There is confidence in that situation that a win is going to happen.  The person in that case is not going to be looking closely at the level of charges because someone else is going to be paying them.  That is what people feel is the case.  It may well be an insurance company that ends up paying.  Is there a requirement for tighter regulations in that respect?  I do not think it is a practice that should be banned or barred.  It is a practice that may well, as the Chairman said, open up a legal avenue to somebody who would not otherwise have the necessary resources and would be afraid of entering the legal process.  We all hear the scare stories.  In those circumstances, regulation is the issue.  Is there regulation in this area or what degree of regulation can be brought to bear?</p></speech>

It is no longer just a once-off responsibility.  If circumstances change, then that has to be reflected in further notices to the consumer, and if there is a failure to do so, then the legal costs adjudicator can disallow some of those costs.  A complaint can be made to us about such issues.  There are, therefore, protections within the new regimen to explain not just the costs that have been incurred but any potential for costs, and there is a responsibility on the legal practitioner to provide an explanation should there be an event that may increase the risk of costs.</p></speech>

As the Chairman pointed out, questions arise involving access to justice for people who otherwise would not be able to fund it.  We have not looked specifically at the issue described by Deputy Kenny.  It is the case, as he has pointed out, that there are perverse incentives for people not to pay close attention to fees being paid by someone else.  That would, however, have to wash out through the role of the legal costs adjudicator, in that the person who ends up paying the costs can appeal the fees through an independent third-party body.  It would have to be dealt with in that way.  What would knock out false claims is them being thrown out by the courts.  There is an incentive for people to enter into these things with a hope of winning where the claim may not be justified.  That element of arbitrariness in judgments creates the incentive for these kinds of cases to be taken in the first place.</p></speech>

The fact, however, that the people taking cases know they will not have to pay for the legal services and that someone else will be paying means they will not be paying close attention to the level of services or resulting costs that will be incurred.  That is because the people taking the cases have been guaranteed that they are not going to have to pay the costs.  People, therefore, go into a case they know they are going to win, the case is likely to be settled in those circumstances and, at that point, the costs of the legal services are going to be paid by the other party.  The other party does not have access to knowledge of what the fees were from the outset because that information is only given to the client.  Is an element of regulation required in respect of that?</p></speech>

The risks to the legal consumer have to be set out.  On the side of the legal costs adjudicator, in the context of a third-party application, there must be consideration of whether costs are reasonable and were reasonably incurred.  The legal costs adjudicator can, therefore, dig into the costs, and that is its role.</p></speech>

Turning to Insurance Ireland, a point was made regarding underwriters.  Every time we hear of underwriters, they are outside the State, in London or somewhere else.  Yet, there is this situation where competition from outside of the State seems to be something we cannot get around.  Only one underwriter is going to cover the cr&egrave;che and childcare sector.  I am sure, however, that dozens of underwriters across the European Union cover this situation.  Why can we not get any of those companies to come in here?  Is there truth in the view regarding the importance of access to data and Insurance Ireland controlling access to that data?  I refer to companies from outside of the State being unable to access the data and therefore being unwilling to enter the market.</p></speech>

Pretty much all of the companies that left the market had access to the data.  Many of those companies were members.  It is not necessary, however, to be a member to get access to the data.</p></speech>

That is very clear.  Each speciality market has its own characteristics.  The UK, with Lloyds etc., is clearly the centre of insurance risk in Europe.  That may not be the case for much longer, but it certainly is at the moment.  Regarding the overall liability market, my understanding is that about 70% of it is underwritten in Ireland and about 30% internationally.  We find, however, that some of those speciality type cases, such as cr&egrave;ches, have their own particular requirements and underwriting needs.  Those are the ones that tend to be more often underwritten by somebody outside.  My understanding regarding cr&egrave;ches is that up to some months ago there were two providers, one of which was an international business based in Ireland and the other a speciality business based out of the UK.</p></speech>

While we are a big exporting jurisdiction of insurance, selling insurance to some 110 countries around the world, given the size of the market we also rely on capacity coming into Ireland.  For sustainable risk pools and for speciality lines, there is a need for more provision than is available in Ireland.  In January 2017, we were asked by the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, what success in these reforms would be like.  We said that it would involve more capacity coming into Ireland and staying here.  For us, if we have a sector with three, four or five companies, for instance, writing those sorts of risks, it then becomes much more stable as they move their positions in the market.  That is not happening at the moment.  It was correct to say in 2017 and it is more correct to state today that we need more provision.</p></speech>

Are there any views as to why there is a feeling that there are legal barriers or any other barriers?  Insurance, as has been said, is one of the major factors in legal costs involved in people going to court, to take or defend cases, and engaging in the legal system.  The limited availability of underwriters seems to be one of the problems we have.</p><p>Has anyone else got any reasons, apart from-----</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Chambers in terms of the responses I gave on the public liability study we are doing, that is a key part of this.  We are going to be talking to the many insurance companies which operated in public liability here and which have left the market, and we will be travelling to the UK early in the new year.  As I said, within the cycle there is a soft part and a hard part but, normally, the hard part does not lead to a whole lot of exit, which is a critical point.  The question for us is whether there are things particular to Ireland or is it just investment decisions.  What we have learned so far is that these are large companies operating in Lloyds in London and they have a pool of money which they allocate across Europe.  Given the relative size of the market here, there is a small bit that may come to Ireland and stay here for a while but the question is what is the decision-making process.</p> <p>  The other thing we have found, as I said in response to Deputy Chambers, is that data is an issue here, and I am not talking just about specific data on claims, costs or premiums.  If companies in a foreign jurisdiction are making investment decisions to come here or not, I think the data could be better to allow the companies to make those decisions. </p></speech>

I believe there is a great lack of data generally on the insurance industry, which is a huge problem, although we are beginning to get it with the Central Bank report, which is a start.  Are statistics available as to how many cases have been taken on a no foal, no fee basis and is there any way of accessing that information?</p></speech>

I have a difficulty with that narrative, and I would come back to the insurance companies about narratives.  We cannot have any narrative about no foal, no fee because we do not know, except that solicitors and barristers, who are often very courageous, go forward to take cases on behalf of people who would not have access to justice if they did not do that.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

With any competition assessment we do, we would normally start out by assessing what is the concentration level in a particular market, who is operating year-on-year and who is coming into or leaving the market here.

The crux of this matter is how much time we spend trying to collect data versus making recommendations on which the Government and the State can act.  As I said, we are in the middle of the study at the moment and our resources are going towards trying to figure out that key part of getting enough evidence while not spending too much time on it.  While I say this in a way that is not critical of the Central Bank, it is about three and a half years since the cost of insurance working group started and the report was published this week.  I do not think anybody wants us to be a year or two working on this public liability insurance study.</p></speech>

The issues around transparency are already accepted.  As our colleagues from Insurance Ireland said, the Central Bank plans to publish data on public liability next year, so I think that point is well accepted.  Again, we are not trying to replicate the work that is being done by either the cost of insurance working group or the Personal Injuries Commission.  We feel we can do that.  We are confident in terms of our ability to look at this market from the point of view of an analysis around theories of harm and to make evidence-based recommendations on that point.  However, we do not plan to make an interim report simply because that would slow down the publication of the final report.</p></speech>

They had a scheme of events and they cannot do it because their insurance literally jumped in one year from &euro;10,000 to &euro;24,000.  That happened without explanation and not based on any claims, alleged fraud or anything like that - it was a complete jump.

We have received complaints in regard to a number of parties who may be putting themselves forward as barristers but who are not on the roll of practising barristers and may be exploiting members of the immigrant community who are very vulnerable.  We have also received complaints in regard to the non-payment of barristers.  I would caveat all of that with the point that all of this is based on data since 7 October.  We will report in full on 7 April.</p></speech>

I have read Mr. Hassett's submission in detail.  I like to deal in facts.  There is an absence of fact generally in the Insurance Ireland submission.  Reference is made in the submission to there being a "suspicion" that very often seeking leave to adjourn may be used as lever in negotiation.  I do not believe the word "suspicion" should be referenced in a submission.  It should be based on facts.  I have some questions for Mr. Hassett in regard to the narrative of Insurance Ireland.  Does that narrative change following the publication of the Central Bank's report?  I agree there are many nuances in the report such that it requires a second reading and that I have read it only once.  </p></speech>

We have seen significant inflation in that area in the past number of years.  For example, the report from the National Claims Information Database, NCID, shows a drift from &euro;31,000 to an average of &euro;47,000, which is approximately 40%.  I am not 100% sure why that is, but I know it seems to be a fact.</p></speech>

Dual pricing is a common practice across many markets.  There are positives and negatives to dual pricing.  Encouraging people to switch creates value in the market.  It is a sign of a healthy market.  However, if loyal customers are being penalised for their loyalty then that is a problem.</p></speech>

A premium is collected in a single year and losses or claims are sustained in future periods.  This report is very clear.  It is probably much more accurate about earlier years than later years because the claims data for earlier years are much more accurate.  We have been able to count up all the claims with the passing of time.  We have seen for litigative cases that companies typically reserve four to six years ahead.  When a premium is set, one is not always aware of what the claims experience will be.  That is why it is cyclical.  Sometimes one overshoots and sometimes one undershoots.  That is the nature of it.</p></speech>

It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Between 2009 and 2018, the average annual gross earned premium increased by 42%; the average cost of claims per policy reduced by 2.5% over this time.<br /><br />To recap on Part 2, 2013 was the lowest point for average premiums over this ten year period, having decreased by 13% from &euro;498 in 2009 to &euro;435 in 2013.  Premiums started to increase again in 2013, increasing by 62% </blockquote> <p>It recaps again for us after that.  It is very helpful.  What is really jumping out for me is a healthy profit, premiums going up and a narrative that is not reflective, partly because the narrative is not based on fact from anybody, even the no foal, no fee basis.  I have a difficulty with the narrative from insurance companies.  I was in the Chair in the D&aacute;il lately and heard a narrative about fraud, lying and cases that were not right.  Are the figures for fraud not in fact extremely low?</p></speech>

The year 2013 was the period of peak losses in the sector.  Companies such as Setanta and Enterprise collapsed, with a major multinational company here having to recapitalise itself to the tune of hundreds of millions.  To put this in context, with average premium levels, we collect approximately &euro;1.5 billion a year and pay out in the order of &euro;1.1 billion or &euro;1.2 billion.</p></speech>

In 2013 and 2014, there were questions about whether companies would have enough money to pay their claims.

I fully appreciate the context of the Deputy's line of questioning and its appropriateness, but it is important for the questioner to contextualise it himself or herself and not to rely on my understanding of it.  I need the Deputy to reflect that it is in the context of legal costs.  We are not a different committee.</p></speech>

I probably will not have time to get to the State Claims Agency.  It is in the context of the submission from Insurance Ireland and the report published yesterday.  That is why I asked my questions at the beginning.  I have a final question for Insurance Ireland, and if I am allowed, I will go back to the State Claims Agency, or if my time is up, so be it.  Does Insurance Ireland have a view on premiums and how they are calculated?  Should there be more openness?</p></speech>

This is the first year that we have seen it and we are all coming to terms with the data in it.  We will see it annually.  Much of the debate will be about the changes from one year to another.  I think that level of transparency is helpful.  Typically an insurance company will price to achieve a 5% margin in a year.  The reality of it is that it rarely achieves that.  It will either overshoot or undershoot.  The Deputy can see that it fluctuated wildly over the ten years.  There were years of losses and years of profits.  I accept that 2018 seems to have been a pretty profitable year.  It is hoped that marks the top of a cycle and it may move in a different direction.  I do not know.  As the Central Bank says, it ebbs and flows.</p></speech>

Legislation was passed here in 2007.  It was suggested by PIAB at the time that it would result in fewer people going to the courts.  The trend has been the opposite because it allowed the courts to ensure that no legal costs would be paid if the award was not paid.  What are Insurance Ireland's affiliated insurance companies doing?  Do they press that?  Do they bring it to the judges' attention in these cases?  Is it the case that all of these claims get a higher payment than PIAB had offered?  I would find that surprising given that PIAB's payments and the court payments are quite in line when one excludes payments of more than &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

There is a section of the Act that allows for legal costs not to be paid out and, at this point, Insurance Ireland does not know if any of the 100-plus companies that make up Insurance Ireland actually press this in any of the court cases it is dealing with, yet it continues to raise the issue of legal costs as a major issue in terms of the cost of claims overall.</p></speech>

How many claims have the insurance companies rejected annually?  What does 10% look like?</p></speech>

Has Insurance Ireland done any analysis of those?  Once it rejects a case or rejects a settlement, it is more than likely that it goes into litigation or else the insurance company settles, which is unlikely if it is the one rejecting the settlement.  When the case goes into litigation, that is adding the extra &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000.  For those 1,200 cases the companies have rejected per annum, has Insurance Ireland done any analysis as to whether it was cost effective for them to do so, that is, that there would have been a reduced cost in the courts?</p></speech>

The reason we would not do that is because how companies settle and manage claims is a competitive issue.  How they price is a competitive issue and how they manage the expense line of settling claims is a competitive issue for them as well.  We have not done anything individually or at an aggregate level in that regard.</p></speech>

Has Insurance Ireland done any analysis of the 1,200 claims it rejects each year from PIAB with regard to how many of them fall into the different categories, for example, &euro;1 to &euro;10,000, &euro;10,000 to &euro;20,000, &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000, and those above &euro;100,000?</p></speech>

The point I am making is that it is likely the 1,200 claims that Insurance Ireland is rejecting are claims that have higher costs, that is, those that are at the higher end of perhaps &euro;90,000 or &euro;100,000.  We know the cost of these claims when they are litigated makes up over 50% of total costs, even though they are a small proportion, given some 7% of claims are above &euro;100,000.  The reality is Insurance Ireland could have rejected every single one of them and, therefore, Insurance Ireland or the insurance companies could be the reason 50% of the legal costs are being paid out through the courts because they did not accept the settlements from PIAB.</p></speech>

A lot of cases would involve disputes on liability and there would be complexity involved in the case and maybe high value involved in the case as well.  PIAB only deals with the cases where there is no issue on liability and we are just talking about quantum.  That takes a lot of the complexity out of the debate.</p></speech>

When they settle on a quantum, when they settle on a figure to pay a claimant who may have serious bodily injuries, insurance companies affiliated to Insurance Ireland reject 1,200 of the cases based on the quantum.  They go to court and if they are at the higher end, they could make up in excess of 53% of the entire legal costs of all litigated claims in the courts.  Let me make this point.  The courts pay out, on average, the same compensation as PIAB for claims less than &euro;100,000.  It is extremely likely that what is happening here is that insurance companies are rejecting claims that are on the higher end, towards &euro;100,000, which make up some 53% of all legal costs when they go into litigation.  The real issue is that it is insurance companies that are putting this bill upon themselves and, really, upon their consumers as a result.  I am fully aware the witnesses do not have any of that knowledge.</p></speech>

Let us take the 1,200 figure, the PIAB figure.  That is 5%.  It may be they are proportionately higher - I do not know - but we are certainly not flooding the courts with lots of cases.  In the Central Bank report, the annual filing went from 14,000 to 18,000 over the past five years.  At 1,200 per year, even if they all went into court, I do not see how it is the insurance companies that are clogging up the courts.</p></speech>

We are just dealing with PIAB at the minute and I did not suggest the insurance companies are clogging up the courts.  I am trying to find out, for the cases they have rejected, whether it has been the case that they have been at the higher end.</p><p>Have they resulted in significant legal fees?  For cases above &euro;100,000 the legal fees are significantly more.  Yet, Insurance Ireland has not polled any of its members or collected any data on that.

Does Mr. Hassett wish to correct the record of a previous committee meeting?  Mr. Hassett was before me recently.  He stated that his information was that premiums were coming down and had come down.  He said they peaked in 2016 and had come down significantly.  I challenged him and asked him to produce the facts.  He went on to say his understanding was that prices had been coming down since the middle of 2016.  He then went on to say that prices were falling.  Mr. Horan intervened and defended the statement from Mr. Hassett.  Mr. Horan said that the fall in recent years meant that motor claims costs had stabilised.  Does Mr. Hassett accept that was not true?</p></speech>

Based on the Central Bank report, which I accept, I accept that is not true.  I want to put some context on this - I think I placed the same context at the time.  Actually, I was relying on data that had been shared in the market.  It was third party data.  Insurance Ireland has no access to price information.  We should not have access to price information from any of our member companies either.  The only data source we had at that time was the Central Statistics Office data.  The data we quoted relating to 2017 were CSO data.  One could look at the CSO data and the Central Bank report and question it because they do not line up.</p></speech>

I am sick to my teeth of telling people this, including those in the Government.  Mr. Hassett knows this better than anyone.  The CSO data come from a CSO official telephoning an insurance company and stating that he or she is from the CSO and the office is looking for a price on a particular insurance policy.  Then, the insurance company gives the price and the CSO reports on the change of that policy.  Insurance Ireland provides information to the European authority, which compiles a report on insurance.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

They did not go up a little; they went up 15%.  Is Mr. Hassett telling me that he is so completely unconnected with the industry that he has no clue what is happening?

Sinn F&eacute;in had reservations in regard to the legislation that underpins this report in terms of the Central Bank because we know that insurance companies transfer moneys to their headquarters.  One insurance company transferred a significant amount of money to its headquarters and, therefore, was able to record a loss in this jurisdiction.  This practice is legal but, therefore, the data are distorted.  </p><p> On the Insurance Ireland fact file, in responses to me at a meeting of another committee Mr. Hassett, backed up by Mr. Horan, stated that the claims ratio for 2017 was 71.5%, which they reiterated to other members here today.  We now know the claims ratio for 2017 was 59%, which means the insurance companies were more profitable than was suggested.  At the aforementioned meeting, Mr. Hassett also made the point that the loss ratio for 2016 was 82%.  We now know it was 69%, which, again, means the insurance companies were more profitable than was disclosed.  He also made the point that in the three years prior to 2016 the loss ratio was in the mid-90s, but it was not.  It fell into the mid-90s only in one year and it was in the mid-80s in the other two years.  Again, this means the insurance companies were more profitable than was suggested.  </p><p> The Insurance Ireland fact file covers 90% of the motor market.  Is it nothing more than a propaganda tool given the information we now have in terms of the 100%, which could in no way allow for the type of discrepancies in the figures which Insurance Ireland present compared to what is now presented to us by the Central Bank?</p></speech>

There may be variations on a year-by-year basis and we can discuss how they may occur.  In terms of the cycle, a claims ratio of 75% is highly consistent.</p></speech>

This means that for every euro taken in 71.05 cent is paid out in claims.  The Central Bank reports states that the amount paid out is 59 cent, which is a significant reduction.  For the previous year, Mr. Hassett claimed it was 82 cent, but the Central Bank report states it was 69 cent.  They are not small margins of error.</p></speech>

What I am disputing is that the statistics provided in Insurance Ireland's annual fact file are completely at odds with the statistics provided in the Central Bank report.  Legally, companies are required to report accurate, verifiable information to the Central Bank.  There is a massive discrepancy in regard to how much of every euro taken in by Insurance Ireland is paid out in claims.  Insurance Ireland claims that last year it paid out 71.5 cent of every euro it took in but the Central Bank report indicates that the actual amount paid out is as low as 59 cent.  For the previous year, the discrepancy was massive as well, at 82 cent versus 69 cent.  Insurance Ireland claimed that in two previous years it was in the mid-90s but it was 84.  How could there be such a discrepancy?</p></speech>

This is explained on page 6.  It is the year in which the accident occurred.  It may take several years for all claims to be fully paid, etc.  That is the basis of the NCID report.  On page 7, it references the financial year, which is the year for which financial accounts are stated.  When stating the claims incurred in a financial year insurers include claims which were paid in the year, reserves they set aside for claims that happened that year and changes to the reserves set aside for claims that happened in previous years.  The fact file is done on a financial year basis.  In the National Claims information Database report many of the chapters are on an accident year basis such that the figures will not stack up exactly.  For example, the financial year stated accounts for, say, 2016 are a snapshot as at year end 2016 and the NCID report is a snapshot as at year end 2018, looking back at all of the accident years, such that it can see that in many of the earlier years in particular the claims were fully settled.  There is an element-----</p></speech>

The industry is over-compensating in regard to future losses.  It has to identify the claims settled in a particular year and make provision for the following years such that it is cooking the books and over-estimating only to find on look-back that that level of claims was not paid.  When the Central Bank carries out the exercise which Mr. Horan spoke about, the actual claims ratio drops dramatically.</p></speech>

The Central Bank report is most likely the reason for it.  As I have emphasised repeatedly, the committee's business is the address of access to justice and legal costs.  It is important to point out the that views of members' expressed during the course of today's hearing are the views of members.  They do not have the imprimatur of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  The committee will deliberate on all of the evidence presented to it over a number of hearings, and others received in written submissions and, ultimately, publish a report with recommendations.  This is always a compromise.  The committee is comprised of 11 members coming from disparate positions, as evidenced today, so for the report to have the imprimatur of the committee there will be a degree of give and take.  </p> <p>  As in the case of committee members the expressed views of the Chairman are the views of the occupant of the Chair of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I take a very different view in regard to the line of questioning posed to Dr. Doherty regarding "no win, no fee" and "no foal, no fee".  I want to make it abundantly clear that the theme of these hearings is access to justice.  Anything that would in any way inhibit or prevent any citizen having access to justice would run utterly and absolutely contrary to everything that I would believe in.  In regard to the particular question posed to Dr. Doherty, in my view, he was correct in not responding to it.  We must ensure that access to justice is not the preserve of those who can afford it or those who can afford to take the risk.  Every citizen has the right to access justice.  I believe strongly in that view.  </p> <p>  In regard to the data requests, of which there were a number and Dr. Jackson indicated it will be possible to provide, I do not expect him to provide PIAB data but if he can we would welcome it.  With no disrespect to any of the witnesses, there is a dearth of data as evidenced in questioning by colleagues from across the political spectrum.  This is regrettable because data inform.</p><p>They help to formulate ideas and, it is hoped, effective and efficient change in the workings of the system.  Where requests have been made, including by Deputy Pearse Doherty, the previous contributor, any information should be furnished to the clerk to the committee and not to the individual members who have presented.  The clerk will circulate information to all members, who will have equal access to the information that the witnesses or any of the representative groups will share.  Though Deputy Doherty is not a member of this committee, it will be shared with him equally, as it will be with members who have presented or who have not been able to attend today.  I had some questions but I think we have all been exhausted, and the questions have been touched on in different ways.  We have a significant job once we resume.  We are anxious to conclude this report.  We do not know how long we have in these Houses, so we will endeavour to get the report concluded as quickly as possible and published before the Taoiseach blows the whistle for a rematch for everybody concerned.  I will vacate my position at that time.</p><p> It remains only for me to thank the witnesses.  I will not reference the organisations but call the witnesses by their Christian names, if I may.  I thank Isolde, Fergal, David, David eile - two together; snap - Brian, Ultan, Gerry, Michael and Declan for their attendance today.</p><p> This is the last sitting of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality in 2019.  I thank members for their participation throughout the year.  It has been very productive.  We hope that whatever duration the Thirty-second D&aacute;il has into 2020, we will continue to be an important contributing body within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I invite witnesses to join us for a photograph.  Pat will show us outside.  We publish the photograph of all our witnesses with the reports.</p></speech>

That is why the Minister, the Minister of State and Mr. Treacy are going to address the committee.  Everybody here will have an opportunity to ask whatever questions he or she wants.  It will be a question-and-answer session.  We do not want speeches.  We will be looking for direct replies after the three opening speakers have made their initial statements.  The transparency and accountability of the Oireachtas and the work of this committee, in particular, have been very effective in dealing with this issue.  We insisted on the forensic audit, which turned out to be the KOSI audit.  We have nothing to be ashamed of here as a committee.  We work as a committee.  We are not political in that context.  We want to see a future for football that involves funding being restored for young people and women who play the game.  I understand that the assets of the FAI include club grounds around the country, such as United Park in Drogheda.  We want to ensure that regardless of whatever happens, these assets remain in sport ownership, if at all possible.  I do not know what will happen, but I know that everybody up and down the country wants us to get a new committee in place, to get the new directors in place and to move to the future.  We want to ensure the mothers and fathers who are out with their children every week in good and bad weather have confidence in football as a sport.  As a committee, we are working with the Minister and with Sport Ireland to restore confidence.</p></speech>

I am also joined by two officials: Mr. Ken Spratt, who is an assistant secretary in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Mr. Peter Hogan, who is a principal officer in the sports division of the Department.  I would like to respond to what the Chairman said about my opening statement being provided late by apologising for the fact that it was not possible to share a copy of the statement with the committee earlier than this morning.  I was receiving responses to queries from UEFA, the Attorney General and Sport Ireland yesterday afternoon.  Therefore, this statement was not finalised until last night.  In fact, one or two changes were later this morning after the script was provided to the committee.</p><p>It is deeply disappointing to be before this committee once more to discuss the need for major reform of the FAI.  It was on St. Patrick's Day that we first read in <i>The Sunday Times</i>about a most irregular financial transaction, namely, the 2017 loan of &euro;100,000 by the former chief executive.  This was prompted by a financial crisis in the FAI.  The association was looking at a situation in which it could not settle its creditors.  The national governing body for football in Ireland, which is one of the largest sporting bodies in the State, found itself without funds to pay for its day-to-day operations.  In such circumstances, the board of Sport Ireland had no choice but to suspend funding to the FAI for this breach of funding conditions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I confirmed that no funding from the Department&rsquo;s sports capital programme would be provided until the corporate governance and financial control issues had been resolved to our satisfaction.  I regret that this position remains unchanged today, notwithstanding the good efforts of Sport Ireland, the Institute of Public Administration and the professional firms that have been advising the FAI throughout this process.</p><p>The initial story in <i>The Sunday Times</i>was followed by a distressing drip feed of stories in the national media outlining years of poor corporate governance, poor financial management and a complete lack of proper oversight or key controls.  This culminated in a disastrous appearance of representatives of the FAI before this committee in April.  The former chief executive appeared before the committee but chose not to respond to the important questions tabled by members.  The members of the FAI board who attended that meeting did nothing to restore confidence.  It was clear after the meeting that there was a need for a robust independent review of all financial matters and of the governance structure of the FAI.  Like the members of the committee, I am dismayed that the FAI has decided not to appear here today.  I made it clear some months ago that there was a need for a total clear-out of the FAI board as part of a complete break from the past.  In respect of the appointment of an interim chief executive, I stated explicitly that it was not in the FAI's interests to appoint anyone associated with the old regime.  I was rebuffed in both cases, as was the FAI's right, firstly by the appointment of Mr. Noel Mooney as the interim chief executive and then by the decision of the President of the FAI, Mr. Donal Conway, and Mr. John Earley to stand for re-election to the board in July.  I understand that both of them have finally decided to step down, and that Mr. Earley has already resigned.</p><p>The governance review group carried out a serious review of the weaknesses in the FAI's governance which have led directly to this crisis.  The group made many recommendations, all of which were accepted by the FAI.  As the committee will be aware, one of the most important recommendations involved the appointment of an independent chair and three other independent directors.  As we have seen, recommendation is one thing and implementation is apparently completely different.  It is a source of great and ongoing frustration that, five months later, these independent directors have incredibly not yet been appointed.  I have not received a satisfactory explanation of the reason for the non-completion of this process.  This should have been one of the first things the FAI did to start the process of restoring trust in the association.  Instead, as we approach the end of the year, we find ourselves still waiting for these vital appointments.  I have been advised that the appointments will take place in the very near future.  I reiterate that filling the posts of the independent chair and the independent directors must be and is the first priority for the FAI.  Thereafter, it should move without delay to launch a robust and competitive process to recruit a new independent chief executive.</p><p>The final report of the KOSI audit was received by Sport Ireland at the end of last month.  I am restricted in what I can say about the KOSI report, which is with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  Transparency is always crucial when it comes to tackling difficulties like those of the FAI.  On foot of requests from this committee for the report in full, or even a redacted version, I have taken legal advice from my Department's legal adviser and the Attorney General.  They have insisted that it would be unlawful for me to furnish the committee with a copy of the report.  I have also consulted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has advised me that the matters outlined in the KOSI report are central to its investigations and those of the ODCE.  The Garda has further advised me that making the report public at this time could have serious implications for any criminal proceedings subsequently brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p>While I would very much like to share the KOSI report, and my instinct is to do so, it is clear from the advice I have been given by the Garda that even a heavily redacted copy could undermine its work.  Consequently, I am not in a position to share the report with the committee today.  I hope I will be able to furnish it at some point in the future when the investigations that are under way have been concluded.  I am somewhat relieved to confirm to the committee that the KOSI auditors found that the State funding given to the FAI was expended for the purposes for which it was provided.  This was one of the key questions we wanted the auditors to answer.  The committee was clear in its desire that the audit would be forensic in nature.  I am pleased to assure members that the KOSI audit team pursued a forensic approach in its assessment of the FAI's compliance with the terms and conditions for Sport Ireland grant funding.</p><p>The second key question for KOSI was an assessment of whether the association could demonstrate its fitness to handle public funds.  The committee will be aware that after the board of Sport Ireland considered the KOSI audit on 27 November last, it decided against restoring funding to the FAI.</p><p>While I have been advised that it would be unlawful to share the full details of the KOSI auditors&rsquo; findings, I can confirm that their opinion is that the FAI is not fit to handle public funds.  They acknowledge that some steps have been taken to address shortcomings, but there is a steep mountain to climb before we can reinstate funding to the FAI.</p><p> In the interim, we have been looking at all options to continue our support for those who really matter, namely, the clubs, players and coaches at the heart of Irish grassroots soccer.  We have developed a scheme through Sport Ireland to support the players on the women&rsquo;s national team.  Sport Ireland has engaged BDO Ireland to deliver funding and other support to the players, with the assurance that no public funds will be disbursed directly or indirectly to the FAI.  This arrangement will enable us to continue to support the players as they seek to clinch qualification for the women&rsquo;s EURO 2020, while assuring taxpayers that funding will be safeguarded.  I am pleased to be able to reveal to the committee that Sport Ireland has put together a similar scheme to deliver support for the youth field sports programme which has been the primary vehicle for public funding for the development of soccer.  This funding will ensure continued support for 60 development officers and the programmes they deliver throughout the country.  This scheme will begin next month, and if necessary will deliver funding of &euro;2.3 million to the development officers throughout 2020.  Notwithstanding the suspension of Sport Ireland funding, there has been no break in these programmes and there will be no break.  Mr. Treacy will be able to provide the committee with more detail about this funding scheme.  Not one euro of this funding will go to the FAI.  It will not receive a single cent, directly or indirectly, until we are fully satisfied that all weaknesses in governance and financial control have been fully addressed.  The funding will be channelled through a payroll processing company which will make payments directly to the development officers themselves.  That company will also ensure the payment of deducted taxes, PRSI and expenses as appropriate.  Development officers play a vital role in supporting clubs throughout the country, and the last thing we want to do is disrupt their important work.  Grassroots football must not suffer because of the mistakes of those at the top of the greasy pole.</p><p> As members of the committee will be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I met with members of the FAI board on Monday evening.  The delegation was led by the vice president and executive lead, Mr. Paul Cooke, along with the FAI's financial advisers from Grant Thornton.  It was a sobering experience.  As I have stated, the FAI delegation accepted the need for a full changeover of the board, and for the urgent appointment of an independent chair, directors, and chief executive without undue delay.  The FAI delegation presented the stark reality of the association&rsquo;s financial crisis and outlined their proposed business plan to overcome these very considerable challenges.  They came seeking a bailout.  Deputy Griffin and I made it clear to the FAI that we cannot and will not provide it with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The KOSI report makes it clear that the association is not in a fit state to receive public funds and we must respect that.  However, we did tell the delegation that we would meet with UEFA to discuss the FAI&rsquo;s challenges.  Officials in my Department are in contact with UEFA with a view to arranging a meeting as early as possible, which we expect to be held in early January. </p><p> Before concluding, Deputy Griffin and I pay tribute to the forgotten stakeholders - the FAI staff who are facing an uncertain future.  The staff at the FAI have endured pay freezes and more over the past ten years, and have been shocked to learn about the previously undisclosed pay agreements with the former chief executive.  They are not the ones who caused this problem and they deserve recognition, not victimhood, for their service to Irish football.  Deputy Griffin and I will be meeting with SIPTU and the employees&rsquo; representatives later this evening to hear their concerns.  I assure them that we will continue to engage with them over the challenging days to come.  I will now hand over to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin. </p></speech>

This should be a time for optimism, given the recent positive performances from our men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s national teams and the exciting prospect of hosting EURO 2020 matches at the Aviva Stadium next year.  However, the FAI has not been able to move on from the crisis which began last March.  I am sorry to say that we are now seeing the real impact of failures in financial management and corporate governance at the top tier of the football pyramid on those at the bottom, namely, the grassroots clubs, coaches, volunteers, players and supporters.  One of the most common criticisms we heard of the FAI is that the decisions were made by a small group at the top and the wider membership never got the opportunity to have their say.  Last May, the Minister and I hosted a very successful Irish football stakeholders forum in the Mansion House, which was also attended by several members of this committee.  That forum brought together stakeholders from across the Irish football community to discuss the future direction of football in Ireland.  There were some hysterical warnings that this would be a bad-tempered event which would not deliver anything meaningful.  However, the engagement by those who attended was respectful, considered, and serious about the well-being of the sport.  There was an openness to new ideas and a willingness to listen to the views of other sectors of the game.  The broader football community made it clear that they are committed to growing their sport and that they want to move past the current crisis.  We in Government are committed to growing football in Ireland as well.  We know the positive role it plays in Irish life in clubs throughout the country.  In spite of the challenges, we have been doing all we can to support the game of soccer in Ireland.</p> <p>  Regarding Government assistance for capital projects, we can be very proud of the huge improvements in sports facilities in recent years.  More than 10,000 projects have benefitted from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing total allocations in that time to more than &euro;1 billion.  Soccer clubs have also benefitted significantly in this regard.  More than &euro;156 million has been granted to soccer clubs, leagues and organisations.  The final grants under the 2018 round of the sports capital programme were announced last month and under this round alone, more than 300 grants valued at &euro;6.5 million were allocated to soccer clubs throughout the country.  The Department is now undertaking a full review of all aspects of the 2018 sports capital programme.  This review will include consideration of the timing and scale of the next round of the programme.  I expect that the programme will be open for applications again in the coming months and I look forward to seeing many more excellent soccer projects from clubs in every county applying and being assisted.</p> <p>  This committee had a very interesting discussion with Hockey Ireland last week, which underscored the importance of State support for our amateur athletes representing Ireland in international competitions.  The Minister and I are absolutely committed to supporting the players in the women&rsquo;s national team who make such a huge contribution as the leading exponents of women&rsquo;s football in Ireland.  I am delighted that we have been able to develop an effective intermediary arrangement for the payment of grant funding for the women&rsquo;s national team.  The team achieved record attendance for international home games this year and delivered some impressive performances to boot.  I am confident that under the guidance of team manager Vera Pauw the team can achieve its ambition of qualifying for its first major tournament, the women's EURO 2021.  As the Minister said, Sport Ireland has developed a similar arrangement for the provision of funding for development officers.  I welcome this pragmatic solution and I am confident that with Sport Ireland support, development officers will be able to continue their important work with grassroots soccer.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland is continuing to explore every option to continue our support for soccer in Ireland.  With the best will in the world, it may not be possible to find a mechanism for every programme.  This is why it is so important that those at the top of the FAI commit to restoring public trust.  The board must show leadership and act decisively to implement serious reform in the association&rsquo;s corporate governance.</p><p>At the meeting earlier this week, the board members acknowledged to the Minister and myself the serious failures that occurred under the previous regime.  They indicated that they accept the urgent need for reform.  I trust that they will redouble their efforts to make good on their commitment to overhaul their association.</p><p> Unfortunately, when governance failures occur within individual organisations, they tend to damage the reputation of the entire sports system.  It would be unfair to tar all of those involved in Irish sport with the same brush.  I frequently meet the chairs, directors and chief executives of the various national governing bodies, as do the committee members, and I have great confidence in their commitment to strive always for the benefit of their members and to the values of sport such as honesty, integrity and fair play.  I understand, however, that a crisis such as this one lays bare structural weaknesses which, if not addressed, can lead to difficulties in the future.  The development of stronger governance is therefore very important, at both an organisation and a system level.  The need for measures aimed at better governance in national governing bodies was recognised a number of years ago and in 2017, Sport Ireland introduced the mandatory adoption by NGBs of the governance code for sport, formerly the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity sector.  The governance code for sport is a principles-based code consisting of best practice for boards.</p><p> The Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027, which the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I published in 2018, requires that all national governing bodies, NGBs, and local sports partnerships are signed up to the governance code by the end of 2021.  I am pleased to say that there has been good progress with 31 NGBs and sporting bodies already fully signed up to the code, with a further 50 working towards adoption of the code.  The FAI is one of those NGBs which has committed to achieving compliance with the governance code.  I urge the board and the new CEO, when that person is appointed, to ensure that they continue this important work.</p><p> As the committee knows, Sport Ireland already has robust auditing arrangements in place in respect of the funding it allocates to the main field sport NGBs &ndash; the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU.  Following discussions at this committee earlier this year, Sport Ireland has now strengthened the terms and conditions of its funding schemes, which will apply to grants from 2020.  The changes confer full audit rights on Sport Ireland and require NGBs to disclose the remuneration packages of their CEOs to Sport Ireland.  I acknowledge the good work that Sport Ireland has done in revising the terms of conditions of funding.</p><p> The most immediate tasks for the FAI are to appoint the independent chair, the other independent directors and an independent, full-time chief executive.  These appointments are vital for the association to rebuild public trust and to enable the Government to once again provide funding for the FAI&rsquo;s programmes and capital projects.  The FAI board members confirmed to the Minister and myself that they are absolutely committed to these appointments.  I hope that we will see progress in the near future.  I welcome the announcement by Donal Conway that he will step down at an extraordinary general meeting, EGM, in January and the recent resignation of John Earley from the board.  I regret that they did not step down at the EGM last summer but I welcome the fact that they are now stepping down to make way for new leadership in the FAI.</p><p> As members will know, the FAI, at its annual general meeting, AGM, in June, agreed overwhelmingly to accept the recommendations of the governance review group and to completely overhaul the association&rsquo;s rule book and structures.  This was a positive step and I know that progress has been made since then.  That progress must be maintained if the FAI is to restore public trust.</p><p> I reiterate that no public funding will be provided to the FAI by my Department or Sport Ireland until we see evidence of real reform and a clean break with the previous regime at board and executive levels.  The FAI is well aware of the steps it needs to take to bring about a situation where public funding can be reinstated.  I urge it to do so without any further delays.</p></speech>

At each meeting, we detailed in-depth the remit of Sport Ireland, its funding relationship with the FAI and actions taken to support the FAI through its ongoing situation.<br/><br/>As the committee will be aware, KOSI Corporation Limited recently completed its forensic audit of the FAI, which was commissioned by Sport Ireland under the terms and conditions of grant approval.  The committee will be aware that the audit report was referred by the board of Sport Ireland to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Today, I will outline to the committee that the independent forensic KOSI audit verified that taxpayer funding to the FAI, through Sport Ireland, was spent in line with the approved submissions and for the purposes it was given by Sport Ireland during the period 2015-2018<i>.  </i>I will give an overview of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s role and remit under the Sport Ireland Act 2015, with a particular focus on the extent of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s powers with regard to the oversight of public funding invested in our national sporting organisations.  I will also inform the committee of recent developments with regard to governance training in national governing bodies of Sport and the revision of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval to enhance, on a consent basis, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s right to conduct audits beyond the scope of funding provided to sporting organisations.<br/><br/>KOSI&rsquo;s independent forensic audit of the FAI, which was commissioned by Sport Ireland under the terms and conditions of grant approval agreed with the FAI, has been completed.  Sport Ireland received KOSI&rsquo;s audit report on the FAI on the evening of Tuesday, 26 November, and provided a copy of the report to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in compliance with his request and powers under the Sport Ireland Act 2015.  The KOSI report was considered by the audit and risk committee and the board of Sport Ireland early on Wednesday, 27 November. The independent forensic audit completed by KOSI confirmed that the FAI spent all taxpayer funding allocated through Sport Ireland in line with approved submissions and for the purposes it was given by Sport Ireland during the period 2015 to 2018.  KOSI found that the consumption of Sport Ireland grants had been safely covered by FAI expenditure in the programme areas supported.  It is worth noting that KOSI&rsquo;s overall conclusion was similar to previous internal audits of the FAI completed on Sport Ireland&rsquo;s behalf in 2010, 2014 and 2016, which also found that Sport Ireland funding to the FAI was fully accounted for and expended for the purposes in which it was intended.  The board of Sport Ireland subsequently referred the audit report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, following consideration of legal advice, which included senior counsel input.  As such, for legal reasons, Sport Ireland is not in a position to publish the audit report or provide any further information on it at this time.  Our legal advice is that Sport Ireland cannot discuss the report or its contents in public, including with the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.<br/><br/>Following consideration of the KOSI report, the board of Sport Ireland agreed that the suspension and withholding of funding to the FAI remains in place.  However, the board approved the establishment of a process, with the consent of the FAI, to meet with the FAI on an ongoing basis to discuss governance and financial issues and to support the FAI on its reform agenda.  This is an essential requirement to fulfil as part of the pathway towards restoration of Sport Ireland funding to the FAI.  Sport Ireland has written to the FAI in this regard.  The status of funding to the FAI continues to be reviewed by the board of Sport Ireland on an ongoing basis.  The committee will be aware that in November, the board of Sport Ireland approved a payment of 2019 grant funding for the women's senior national football team programme.</p><p>The grant of &euro;195,000 will be paid by Sport Ireland to accountancy firm BDO, which will oversee the disbursement of the funding in line with terms and conditions.</p><p> The Sport Ireland Act 2015 confers considerable authority in Sport Ireland as the statutory body for the development of sport in Ireland.  The functions of Sport Ireland are prescribed in section 8 of the Sport Ireland Act and include powers to develop participation in sport and high performance sport, eliminate doping in sport as the national anti-doping agency, develop coaching, develop guidelines on the protection of children in sport, and the development of the Sport Ireland campus.  Sport Ireland must adhere to the Sport Ireland Act 2015 and cannot act beyond its legal powers or authority as prescribed by the Act.  As a statutory development agency, Sport Ireland seeks to develop strong sports organisations and recognises the considerable public interest in a successful Irish sports sector.  Sport Ireland is responsible for the investment of public money in sport and the subsequent oversight and accountability of this investment.</p><p> From previous meetings, the committee is aware that Sport Ireland is not a regulatory body and Sport Ireland has no regulatory, investigatory or enforcement powers relating to corporate governance in sporting organisations.  This was discussed at length with this committee during meetings earlier this year.  The committee is also aware that there is no provision in the Sport Ireland Act that gives Sport Ireland statutory authority to audit or inspect the books and records of a body in receipt of Sport Ireland funding.  This has been confirmed by our legal advisers.  The committee is aware that funded organisations sign up to Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval, which permits audit on a consent basis.</p><p> It is important to note that Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval clearly stipulate that all funded bodies must have in place a valid tax clearance certificate before any funding is paid.  Sport Ireland can confirm it received all necessary tax clearance documentation from the FAI each year, including in 2019.  Furthermore, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s terms and conditions of grant approval require all sporting bodies to submit to Sport Ireland a copy of its annual financial statements, fully audited by a registered auditor in accordance with Irish generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, accounting standards.  Sport Ireland places fundamental reliance on the statutory auditor's signed audit opinion.</p><p> The terms and conditions explicitly state that the accounts furnished to Sport Ireland must "include all financial transactions of the organisation during the course of the accounting year in question".  It is important to remind the committee that primary responsibility for preparation of any company's financial statements rests with that company&rsquo;s management and board of directors.  The FAI board is responsible for risk management within the association and for ensuring that the FAI keeps adequate accounting records.  Corporate governance practice and company law require that the directors of a company must not approve accounts unless they are satisfied they give a "true and fair view" of the financial position.  Sport Ireland relies on the objective, independent and professional judgment of the statutory auditors whose work was carried out in accordance with international standards on auditing.  Each year the FAI's financial statements were given a clean, unqualified opinion by the external auditor Deloitte.  The audit opinion stated that the auditors had not identified any material misstatements and that the financial statements, in the auditor's opinion, gave a "true and fair view" of the financial position of the FAI.</p><p> It is clear from the filing of the H4 notice in April and the restated and revised FAI financial statements that this was not the case.  Undeclared transactions of serious concern and unrecorded liabilities for a number of years only came to full public attention on the recent publication of the FAI's 2018 financial statements approximately 12 days ago.  Oversight of compliance with company law is a matter for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  Sport Ireland notes that the ODCE has extensive investigative and enforcement powers and we are aware that its investigation of the FAI, which we understand is serious, is ongoing.</p><p> Sport Ireland places a high premium on good governance and encourages high standards in governance from all funded bodies.  As a development agency, it is our aim to provide leadership in this area, empowering sport organisations to take responsibility for their own governance and meet the challenges they face.  We have previously outlined to the committee the range of governance training, seminars and supports provided by Sport Ireland for those in key leadership and governance roles in sporting organisations.  Although Sport Ireland promotes good governance in sporting organisations, we cannot enforce good governance, and it is up to governing bodies themselves to do that.  In accordance with a key corporate governance principle, the board of any national governing body is collectively responsible for leading and directing the organisation&rsquo;s activities and for ensuring that effective systems of internal control are in place.</p><p> The committee is aware from Sport Ireland's attendance here in July this year that the board of Sport Ireland has approved revised terms and conditions of grant approval for all Sport Ireland-funded organisations to come into effect for 2020.  To recap for the committee members, the amendments to the terms and conditions include strengthening the audit clause to explicitly confer full audit, inspection and investigative rights on Sport Ireland for every funded body, and the right to audit, inspection or investigation may also extend to any matter of concern to Sport Ireland that arises in respect of the organisation and not just relating to the use made by the organisation of the Sport Ireland grant funding.  The amendments also include making it an explicit condition of funding that Sport Ireland-appointed auditors are entitled to request and receive all the information and explanations they require for the proper performance of their job and making it a condition of funding for all national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships to provide details of the full remuneration packages for their chief executives or equivalent positions to Sport Ireland.  Additionally, Sport Ireland will need to be provided with independent verification that each organisation is fully compliant with the code of practice for good governance of community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Ireland by the end of 2021.  Failure to co-operate fully with any audit, inspection or investigation on a timely basis will entitle Sport Ireland to suspend or withhold grant funding or claim repayment of any grants previously advanced by Sport Ireland.  The board of Sport Ireland is satisfied that these measures are appropriate and necessary in light of the recent learnings from the FAI case.  We are confident that the additions will further strengthen Sport Ireland&rsquo;s authority in respect of overseeing public funds.</p><p> The Government&rsquo;s national sports policy, published in July 2018, tasks Sport Ireland with overseeing a process whereby all national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships adopt the governance code by the end of 2021.  As reported at the meeting in July, Sport Ireland has taken over the governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations as a governance code for sport.  This follows the decision of the governance code working group to retire the code.  To date, 31 Sport Ireland-funded bodies have fully adopted the code and another 50 are on the adoption journey.</p><p> Following recent developments at the FAI, Sport Ireland considered new ways to build and sustain governance capacity and capability within the national governing bodies and local sports partnerships.  Sport Ireland invited applications from senior executives and board members within national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships to undertake a level 9 professional certificate in governance.  This certificate is delivered by the Institute of Public Administration and accredited by the National University of Ireland.  There were 60 applications received from national governing bodies and local sports partnerships and, following a shortlisting process, 51 applicants were selected for participation in the programme from a total of 35 sporting bodies. It is a one-year part-time programme that addresses a key area of concern to executives, boards and committees across the sport sector.</p><p> This accredited programme examines governance as a set of structures, arrangements, processes and procedures.  It focuses on the principles and culture that ensure organisations are properly directed and controlled.  The course covers the roles and responsibilities of governing bodies and boards, the performance and accountability of directors and executives, assurance arrangements, fiduciary responsibilities, distinction of executive and non-executive functions and reserved functions of boards, strategy, finance and leadership.  On completion of the course, graduates will have authoritative knowledge of the principles and practices associated with proper direction, decision-making and control in organisations.  The programme commenced on 15 November this year.</p><p>The committee will recall from previous meetings that the FAI established an implementation oversight group tasked with overseeing implementation of the 78 recommendation of the governance review group report conducted by the IPA.  The effective ongoing operation of the implementation oversight group as set out in the governance review group&rsquo;s report is of vital importance on the journey to reforming FAI governance, and restoring public trust and confidence in the FAI.  The association recently provided an update on the work of the implementation oversight group.  It reported that 40% of the recommendations have been implemented, including 11 priority actions.  </p><p> I will summarise the information given in this statement.  The KOSI audit independently confirms that the FAI spent all Sport Ireland funding in line with approved submissions and for the purposes it was given by Sport Ireland during the period 2015 to 2018.  Sport Ireland is the statutory development agency for sport.  Under the Sport Ireland Act 2015, Sport Ireland is not a regulatory body, and it has no regulatory, investigatory or enforcement powers in respect of corporate governance in sporting bodies.  No provision of the Act that gives Sport Ireland statutory authority to audit or inspect the books and records of a body in receipt of its funding.  This has been confirmed by our legal advisers.   The board of Sport Ireland has approved revised terms and conditions of grant approval for all Sport Ireland-funded organisations to come into effect for 2020 funding.  This includes the strengthening of the audit clause to explicitly confer full audit, inspection and investigative rights on Sport Ireland for every funded body.</p></speech>

We move to the members of the committee.  As agreed, everyone will have ten minutes.  If members wish to share their time, they should let me know.  I remind everyone that the KOSI report is with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I ask every member to be cognisant of that in order that we do not prejudice anything that might arise by our comments today, notwithstanding anything already in the public domain.  I ask everyone to ask a question and get an answer, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1023" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1426" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#M00300"><p>I thank the Ministers and Sport Ireland for their opening remarks.  I will begin by addressing the Minister.  Based on his presentation to the committee, does he agree that the only thing that has changed since the FAI was before the committee last March is the revelations of the mismanagement of the organisation over the years, their audits and so on?   I take from his presentation that the implementation of reform in the FAI is painstakingly slow.  I get the impression it is being brought kicking and screaming to implement reform.  The Minister stated: "I have not received a satisfactory explanation as to why this has not yet been completed".  The independent directors have not been appointed.  If he has not had a satisfactory explanation, what explanation did he get as to why they were not appointed before now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1024" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#M00400"><p>I agree with most, probably all, of what the Senator said.  The slow progress - and there has been some progress but very little - on the important issues is unbelievably frustrating.  What should have been done with great urgency first after the resignation of some directors last March, which we welcome, was the process of appointing independent directors.</p></speech>

What explanation did they give?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1026" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#M00600"><p>The reason for the delay was that they were waiting for various staging points, such as AGMs and EGMs.  The most recent excuse given was that they wanted to wait for the KOSI report and that any independent directors might want to see that.  The excuse being given now is that they are examining the KOSI report and those who have been chosen are apparently deciding whether they will accept the position if offered as the situation reveals itself.  I do not believe this is a good reason for not making the appointment of a new chief executive or starting the process or retaining the current chairman.  The key to change and the FAI coming into a new corporate governance regime and the FAI's credibility is that those independent directors must be appointed.  It is now six months later and they have not been.  The reasons given vary but the delay is unacceptable.  We believe the independent directors are the key to unlocking progress and reform, which is not happening.</p></speech>

Is there a vehicle to distribute all the funding, which, I think, amounts to &euro;2.9 million, to the grassroots?  That is going a different route, but has any other funding been withheld?  I am thinking of Euro 2020.  It looks as though this may run into the sand.  Will there be funding for the four games in Ireland at the Aviva stadium?  Is some of that funding under threat?</p></speech>

The presentation the FAI made to us last Monday night listed the possible dangers of a disaster situation which included Euro 2020.  We have no indication that the funding has been withheld from that or that there is any delay.  We are absolutely adamant on the &euro;2.9 million to which the Senator referred.  That will be channelled through various independent bodies and there will be absolutely no gap in funding whatever.  They will not lose out.</p></speech>

We are dealing with 65 organisations.  With the revised terms and conditions, we can do a deeper dive with our own auditors having a good look at corporate governance functions.

Where a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer applies, will the witnesses opt for it as opposed to talking down the clock?</p> <p>  For all of us it is unacceptable what happened.  All the witnesses have read the KOSI report.  We have not.  We are questioning in a vacuum as a result.  The witnesses&rsquo; legal advice is exclusive to them, meaning we do not get to say whether they are right or wrong.  The Minister, the Department and Sport Ireland regularly refer to KOSI.  This is a difficult position for us to be in and it is not acceptable.</p> <p>  When was the last time the board of Sport Ireland met the FAI?</p></speech>

I believe we are heading towards Bank of Ireland putting up a "For Sale" sign on the Aviva stadium.  Obviously, no one wants to see that because we are all here to secure Irish football if we can.  While I appreciate that the Minister will not answer, I respectfully suggest that he add that option to the list of considerations because it may well be where we end up.  As much as it is unpalatable for the State and for all of us, it is potentially a realistic option.  It may not be our preference, but we may need to consider it if the IRFU or others do not step up.</p></speech>

I would hate to see that but if it gets to the stage where nothing else can be done, the stadium is a tangible asset that the people would be happy to own.</p> <p>  I am a little confused.  A previous speaker referred to the independent directors.  We all do our own research and we try to pick up information from the press corps, people we know in the FAI, Department officials and so on.  There seems to be total confusion with regard to the independent directors.  There are people in the FAI who claim not to know the names of the independent directors and that they were shown only profiles of independent directors rather than names.  They say they are screaming for the independent directors to be appointed and are not delaying these appointments.  I am told that the independent directors have been selected and are engaging with Grant Thornton and getting financial briefings before taking up their positions.  None of us knows the independent directors but the clear public perception is that the FAI is blocking the appointment of independent directors.  The Minister's words today very much suggest that is the case.  I have access to Department officials, FAI staff and colleagues in the press but I still do not know who is blocking or delaying the appointment of the independent directors.</p></speech>

Amrop has gone through an exhaustive process.  It has identified a host of candidates who put their hands up for this.  It has identified a number of people who would be suitable for the board and for committees within the FAI.  That process is near completion.  I was hoping that a nominations committee might be put together this week.  That is a critical aspect.  They are, therefore, very close.

The other aspect is that, obviously, we can do something but we cannot do something for everyone.  We have managed to do something for the women's team and we have managed to do something for the development officers.  I come at it from a different perspective, as a League of Ireland fan.  If the FAI goes into examinership in the morning, or in April, May or June, it is my understanding that the league ceases - it is gone, and there is no League of Ireland.  The clubs will remain but they will not have a league to play in and there will not be any European qualification places available because they are given to the governing body and not directly to the clubs.</p> <p>  Have we done any work on possible scenarios?  In the eventuality that the FAI had to go into examinership, is it possible to continue the league?  If it does not go into examinership and just goes under, does the league automatically collapse?  What happens to those qualification places?  What happens to any money that may be outstanding to League of Ireland clubs?  If it does go into examinership, are penalties imposed on the FAI in terms of qualification places for European competitions which will be passed on to League of Ireland clubs?  Have we done any analysis on what the impact on the League of Ireland will be?  While I agree grassroots football is critical and we should be doing everything to protect it, there are many jobs within League of Ireland clubs which could potentially be at risk if the FAI went under.</p></speech>

When we met the FAI on Monday night, Grant Thornton was there as well and it had done some work on the consequences of examinership.  I do not know how far it had gone but I asked Grant Thornton to share it with us, and it said it will share it with us in the next week or so.  I would be happy to let the Deputy know the result of that.  My guess is that if the FAI goes, the League of Ireland goes the same way.  I think that is absolutely inevitable but it is something which we would have on the agenda for our meeting with UEFA as well because it would have implications for it too.  We are going to, obviously, do some serious analysis of the consequences of examinership and liquidation, but that is what we want to avoid at all costs, of course.  We do not want to see, above all, grassroots football and League of Ireland football suffering as a result of what happened.</p></speech>

The board meets ten times a year.  We bring in NGBs maybe five or six times a year and it rotates around.  The last time the FAI came in was 2015 and it made a presentation to the full board.</p></speech>

I am not absolutely sure but it is around that period.  Our process and procedure is to invite presentations from governing bodies, so we would have had in the FAI, the IRFU, the GAA, Cricket Ireland, Athletics Ireland, Rowing Ireland and so on.  It is a rotation thing to allow them to make a presentation to the board and then, on separate occasions, a special grant may be required where we would require the board to meet.</p></speech>

In his opening statement the Minister said that the FAI is not fit to handle public funds.  That was the finding of the KOSI audit.  It acknowledged that some steps had been taken to address the shortcomings but there was a steep mountain to climb before funding could be reinstated to the FAI.  I accept that we cannot see the KOSI report and I am not looking for it, but for the recovery to happen we need to know what the shortcomings are.  Surely it will be possible to get that.  Otherwise we will not be able to map out a route to recovery for the FAI.  Perhaps Sport Ireland and the Minister will address that.  That finding is a big statement.  We are trying to work in the dark here.  Is it possible to get that?</p></speech>

That was my objective.  When trying to find a way of doing that, and that is still my intention, I met a brick wall from the Garda, the Attorney General and others.  The Deputy understands the reasons, and I will not waste the committee's time by going into it.  If I say anything about the reasons, I could tread into very dangerous territory.  There could be some way of looking at publishing some sort of redacted summary of what is going on here.  That is only a possibility.  I do not under any circumstances want to give any hope.  That is as far as I can go.</p></speech>

I will not promise that but it is an avenue which I will pursue.  It is important that as much information as possible can come out without prejudicing legal proceedings.  The Deputy is right about that.  I cannot allow those proceedings to be prejudiced.  There are probably two reasons KOSI said the FAI is unfit for purpose.  The first pertains to corporate governance and the second to the financials.  The Deputy will have to accept my bona fides on this.  KOSI stated that the FAI should not be getting public funds.</p></speech>

We accept that.  They have to do their jobs and that is fine.  However, we need a football association.  Given the solvency issues and so on, whether it should be the FAI is another matter.  We need a resolution so that we have a football association in place.  We need to know what we need to do to achieve that.</p></speech>

The KOSI audit is very detailed.  The Institute of Public Administration, IPA, put the governance reform agenda into effect.  The implementation of those recommendations will address a lot of the structural issues covered in the KOSI report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#Q01000"><p>I have heard this point made throughout this process.  We thought we could release this report but our advice said otherwise due to its nature and content.  So much so that when we called a special meeting of the board of Sport Ireland, members had an hour to read the report and then had to hand it back.  I do not have a copy of the report.  I wish to clarify that.  We did not want information to get out inadvertently and prejudice an investigation.</p></speech>

Are structural changes other than the 76 recommendations to be made?  We have been told that the IPA report does not contain all the recommendations.  I think Deputy Murphy is asking how the process can be moved forward, forgetting the names of individuals.</p></speech>

We want the public to know all the relevant details, but for obvious reasons it is in the overall public interest that we tread very carefully when talking about any of the contents of the report.  We all want as much information as possible to be public.  The committee must understand that this is particularly difficult and it is dangerous even to talk about specific issues.</p></speech>

It is very unsatisfactory, to put it mildly.  We understand that.  We know there is a transition period, but there is also a requirement for a solution.  Most of us want to contribute to that solution.  It is very frustrating that we cannot see a pathway.  We cannot wait until the ODCE and the Garda complete their work because the FAI has huge monthly outlays.  Will it be able to meet them?  Was there any indication that that would be an issue?  Are there issues in relation to the staff, beyond the staff involved in promoting football through the local authorities?</p></speech>

Their concerns are whether they will be paid and whether they will still have jobs.  It is not very obvious where the income for that will come from every month.  That is part of this transition too.  Either the organisation is solvent or it is not.  Other than meeting the unions, is a clear pathway available to the Department?  Can the Minister see anything in the business case to indicate that the organisation's normal expenses can be paid?</p></speech>

We are getting shocks from the FAI on a weekly basis, particularly with regard to its financials.  That is why we are meeting all stakeholders who want to meet us.  We will continue to do that.  That is why we are also meeting UEFA.  Every single stakeholder will be met.  Every point of view will be taken into account.  We are in a very fast-moving crisis and we are doing everything we can to meet those who are concerned, particularly the staff who at this point are very concerned about their futures.</p></speech>

There is an expectation that it will be closer to &euro;75 million or &euro;80 million.  What is the extent of FIFA's requirements with regard to restructuring?  Did it give a figure?</p></speech>

I imagine that the new directors and the new CEO will want to come in and have a full stop at the end of 2019.  We should see the totality of the debts that require to be restructured.  It is important that we have a full stop there so the new board can proceed.  It is essential that they take ownership of the resolution also.</p></speech>

Yes, it is free to sell its share in it.  The FAI owns 42.5% of the Aviva stadium.  The Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, owns 57.5% of it.  They are joint owners of New Stadium DAC, which owns the asset.  The FAI is free to sell its share but can only sell with the agreement of the Minister.  Yes, it is free to sell it.  Having said that, the Minister has first charge on the asset.  There is a deed of covenant and charge on it that protects the Minister's interest, which was the significant investment that was made by the Government initially.</p></speech>

The same auditors were used for a long time for this entity, which in itself is a lesson.  Is Sport Ireland likely to change its governance arrangements to seek rotation after a reasonable period of time as an extra safeguard?</p></speech>

Sport Ireland has used different auditors to audit the FAI and we rotate our own auditors on a regular basis.  It is good practice to do that.  This is something we certainly could put in place very easily.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the stadium and the Minister having first lien on the FAI interest in it.  If the company became insolvent or went into liquidation, would it mean that the Government or the Minister would then become the owner of that asset or would it be the creditors?  Who would get that asset?</p></speech>

In the event the company became insolvent, the banks could move on the asset.  The Minister and the Government, however, do have first charge on the asset if it is realised.</p></speech>

Would the Government then own the asset if it has a &euro;191 million stake in it?</p></speech>

If, for example, the bank was happy enough to move in on the asset and hold it, then the bank would become the part shareholder instead of the FAI.  If the bank held on to the asset, which it could do, the bank would simply replace the FAI as the shareholder.  Whether or not they wished to sell it, that can only be sold with the permission of the Minister.  The Minister cannot unreasonably withhold permission to sell it, but it could be sold, and whether or not the Government would be interested in buying it would depend on circumstances.</p></speech>

It only really works if it is owned by national governing bodies for sport.  The stadium has a significant annual cost.  It raises revenue from concerts and conferences and so on, but the gap must be filled by the two national governing bodies.  This is filled through a licence for each of the national governing bodies to hold a number of fixtures each year.  Based on the revenue raised from those fixtures, they are able to fill that gap.  It is a not-for-profit company but it does wash its face as there is a little bit of a surplus that goes into a sinking fund.  It really only works by being owned by the two national governing bodies and by being used for sport.</p></speech>

When this series of committee meetings started out, in the earlier meetings we had, Sport Ireland was still funding the FAI.  That stopped.  Today Sport Ireland has announced a huge change in the terms for the allocation of grants.  All national governing bodies must provide full details of the remuneration package of their CEOs.  Why was this not done a long time ago?  This is being done without any difficulty now.  It did not require a change in legislation.  It just required Sport Ireland to change its terms and conditions.  I ask this because surely Sport Ireland and successive Ministers for sport must have seen the caviar culture that was going on at the top of the FAI.</p><p>It was at a time when birthday parties and rent were paid for.  Prawn cocktail would not even make it onto the menu, by the sounds of it, yet the public was part-financing the organisation.  Why did it take so long for the powers that be to react?</p></speech>

In April, two weeks later, Sport Ireland suspended funding to the FAI.  The terms and conditions of grant aid are reviewed in consultation with the governing bodies of sport.  When we rewrite our terms and conditions, we contact the governing bodies, tell them what we are doing and secure their consent.  We conducted the KOSI audit with the consent of the FAI.  We did not have the power to do it-----</p></speech>

Mr. Treacy stated the grant of &euro;195,000 for women's football will now be paid through a private company, BDO.  I knew nothing about BDO before the meeting but researched it.  Its website states that it advises a number of corporate and personal clients, Irish and multinational, on their tax planning strategies, from both a domestic and international perspective.  It seems like a strange organisation to disperse sports funds on behalf of the taxpayer.  How much is BDO paid for the role?  Are there no women in the sport who could be asked to take on the role?  Are there no civil servants who could do it?  It seems like an effective further privatisation, whereas our difficulty has been in having private organisations such as the FAI answer to the public.</p></speech>

He stated not a cent will be given to the FAI as yet, and I am sure everybody would agree with that.  There is no way the public should funnel money into the FAI at present because it would end up going to the banks.  Is the FAI sustainable as an organisation without a bailout or will it go bust?  What liabilities are due, and when, that could tip the FAI into administration?</p></speech>

Many players are involved, including UEFA, the FAI and Sport Ireland.  We met the FAI at its request in order that it could outline the gravity of the circumstances.  It has not in any way accepted there is some sort of Doomsday scenario.  It came to us to warn us of how bad it was, give us some stark figures and determine whether any money was available from the State.  My guess is it will now have to come up with a new plan, which may or may not be viable, but it will depend on the banks, which will have to decide whether they will give a further extension.  UEFA is also funding it.  That is where the solution will lie.</p> <p>  If the independent directors are appointed, I expect there will be a new atmosphere in respect of the issue.  That they are not in place - I do not point the finger at anybody - means there is a blockage.  The appointment of the independent directors will release a dynamic that will be quickly followed by a process to appoint an independent chief executive and an independent chair, which is what we sought.</p></speech>

It receives &euro;2.9 million, despite almost 200,000 people playing.  Greyhound racing receives &euro;16 million, while white-water rafting will receive &euro;22 million from the taxpayer through Dublin City Council.  The allocation to soccer, however, has been low.  Nobody suggests the FAI should be allowed to carry on in its practices, but people want to be assured that support will continue for grassroots football, such as the League of Ireland and people who play the sport every day.  It is critical, not least for obesity levels and so on.</p> <p>  The Minister will meet SIPTU later.  The trade union and the workers were whistleblowers in respect of what was happening at the FAI for a long time.  In April, I read an article in which Mr. Conway contradicted SIPTU and stated its claims that the company was bankrupt were unfounded.  At that time, therefore, the workers were aware of the state of the accounts but were publicly cut across by leading people at the FAI.  Will the State guarantee job security for the workers, who took pay cuts while their bosses enjoyed themselves, and will their jobs be safeguarded in the interest of providing ongoing development of the sport?</p> <p>  Has the Schoolboys Football Association of Ireland, SFAI, yet accounted for the &euro;50,000 it spent to hire a corporate box at the Aviva Stadium?  Was that public money and, if so, is it the case that such an organisation can move money from one place to another before receiving it again?  Hiring a corporate box for schoolboy football is the most bizarre financial transaction one could imagine.</p></speech>

The youth field sports programme is funding we give to the FAI, and similar sums are given to the Irish Rugby Football Union and the GAA.  Such organisations have relatively large incomes compared with those of other national governing bodies of sport, but it is not the only funding we give them.  In 2018, for example, which was the most recent round, soccer clubs throughout the country benefited from the sports capital programme to the tune of &euro;6.5 million, while in the 2017 round, the figure was just over &euro;7 million.</p><p>That funding is hugely beneficial to the sports in question and it is not counted in terms of the core funding that is administered through Sport Ireland.  Those sports, just by virtue of their size, get a proportionately larger amount of the overall sports capital budget.  Of the &euro;57 million allocation under the most recent round, they received &euro;6.5 million.  That is considerable, amounting to roughly &euro;1 out of every &euro;8 that was administered.  The capital grants do reflect the size of the sports more than the current allocation, the reason being that there is strong income for those sports on the current side which other national bodies do not have.  In 2017, the capital allocation of &euro;7 million to the sports in question again represented approximately one eighth of the funding that was given nationally through the sports capital programme.</p></speech>

We are on track to achieve that and it will benefit all sports.  There have been substantial increases in funding for sport in the past two budgets and that is reaching all sports.  We have 67 national governing bodies, if I recall correctly, and we are trying to benefit everybody.  As I said, there are sports which are less popular and not in every community, and we are trying to give prominence to and encourage them.  These sports do not have the funding opportunities that are available to the larger sports and we must be mindful of their needs.</p></speech>

Not many people will benefit from that.  The reality is that soccer and football are the most popular sports in the country but soccer does not get the level of State support that many other sports do.</p></speech>

I certainly feel there is full fairness in the system of allocations for sports capital and across the board.  Those allocations reflect the popularity of the sports but are also responsive to the needs of communities.  If we look at the most recent round of sports capital funding, it is clear to anybody who has analysed the figures that we very much try to target disadvantaged communities.  Of the &euro;57 million that was allocated recently, &euro;19 million went to disadvantaged communities and &euro;4.5 million was given to what are considered affluent communities, according to the Pobal deprivation index.  The funding is heavily stacked towards disadvantaged communities, and that is very positive.</p></speech>

He will recall that I sent him a letter concerning this meeting.  I will be brief as colleagues have asked a lot of good questions.  Having audited its accounts, Deloitte announced that the FAI is effectively bust.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Before indicating its intention to resign as auditor, Deloitte restated the 2017 accounts from approximately &euro;2.7 million of a profit to a loss of &euro;2.7 million, which is a shift of about &euro;5.5 million.  I have some sympathy and understanding for Sport Ireland and the challenges it faces because, it seems, it bases its review, to a large degree, on independent audited accounts.  Having said that, I have the Sport Ireland Act 2015, to which several speakers referred, in front of me, and I take issue with one or two of the points Mr. Treacy made in that regard.</p> <p>  Section 11 of the Act, which sets out the criteria, terms and conditions of assistance, states, in subsection (3)(a), that Sport Ireland may "request any person or body applying for or receiving assistance under section 8(4)(a) to supply Sport Ireland with information in such form and at such time as it may require".  This means that Sport Ireland has absolute flexibility in terms of how deep it wants to dive.  I have the transcript of the meeting where I asked whether Sport Ireland had identified any red flags in this regard, in response to which Mr. Treacy did not highlight any concerns.  To me, a red flag was raised when Deputy Jonathan O'Brien or Deputy MacSharry - I am not sure which of them it was - asked whether there had been a meeting with the board of the FAI.  The answer given was that there was one such meeting in 2015 and there were two further occasions on which members of the board were invited in by Sport Ireland but did not show up.  Did they give a reason for not showing up?  Subsequent to their not showing up, Sport Ireland still gave the FAI &euro;2.9 million in funding in January or February of this year.  Will Mr. Treacy comment on that?</p></speech>

Section 11(3) of the Act allows Sport Ireland to request information from a body in receipt of assistance and withhold or refuse assistance if that information is not forthcoming, but this does not amount to the right to audit such a body.  Accordingly, Sport Ireland will need to rely on the terms of the application grant arrangements, in particular the terms and conditions mentioned above, in respect of such audits. </blockquote> <p>The terms and conditions are drawn up in consultation with the organisations and we get them to agree to those terms.</p></speech>

We are not a regulatory agency.  We are a sports promotion agency, which works in partnership with other governing bodies.  That is the ethos of Sport Ireland as to its functions.  If one looks at these functions, these relate to participation, high-performance, anti-doping and codes of conduct.  There was an opportunity in 2015 to make Sport Ireland a regulatory agency but that would have been the wrong thing to do.  We do not want to be a regulatory agency but want to be here to work in partnership with and to support the organisations.  I have made the point in here previously that we took on an audit function where, in many other areas involving grant aid, such functions have not been taken on.  We took it upon ourselves that if were giving 50% of funding to an organisation, we would do a full audit.  We took a view which was shared by others, that if one is not providing a huge amount of funding to an organisation - 5% was the figure used by the FAI - and we tried and wanted to push the boat out.  We were rebuffed and pushed back because we did not have the power to do that.</p></speech>

It is standard practice in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, when I was involved in aviation, when one was tendering for a contract.  Enterprise Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Bord Iascaigh Mhara do the same.  One has to prepare three years of projections, to be sure of this funding or the grant-aiding authority must be comfortable that this organisation is going to be here in a year, two or three years' time.  This is standard practice in the Department from my own personal experience, and rightly so.  I believe there were flags there in respect of the FAI.</p> <p>  I have asked the Minister about this point previously in the Seanad and one of my colleagues also has mentioned it, namely, the &euro;16.8 million allocated for greyhounds in this year's budget a month or six weeks ago.  I cannot for the life of me understand why the FAI is getting &euro;2.8 million or whatever the figure is.  The Minister told me, when we discussed at the time, that this money comes out of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's  funding.  Would the Minister speak to his colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Marine, to ascertain whether this funding could come under his Department's aegis - because a significant amount of the whole greyhound sector comes under his Department - and that some form of re-balancing would take place?</p></speech>

What about the rest of the staff who are not development officers?

I have one last question on that point.  This is how it is hitting grassroots.  There is a small soccer club in north Galway, Colemanstown United FC, which was the overall national FAI club winner of the year this year.  It received &euro;5,000 in prizes, which was huge money for it.  That money and more has been spent on development and the club now has bank overdrafts.  Is there any way that the club can get the prize money it won or is the Minister aware of anything like that in this process?</p></speech>

What happened in the past should never have happened.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, the Garda and others are looking into that and a process is being gone through.  I am asking that we all now consider looking at a transition now, while asking how we can go to the future but learning from the past.  On a transition, I am asking that the Minister, Sport Ireland and the Department consider suggesting to the FAI that a transition process and an interim board be put in place. The problem with new directors coming in is that when they come in to this role, he or she could be personally responsible for the debts in this the past.  Who, in fairness, will do that?  If I was advising somebody, I would suggest that they be very careful in this regard because their house could be on the line.  A new structure should be created for transition in order that good people are placed on the board.  They can then appoint an independent CEO and get professional advice from one of the professional organisations to understand how to restructure in a professional manner.  This is what is needed because there appears to be no transition, plan or structure and we are going headless into this.  A suggestion like this has a good chance of working.  I believe there is a great future for the FAI and out of this dust, a very good soccer structure will emerge in Ireland.</p></speech>

That is why I want to emphasise to the committee that it has been incorrectly reported in various media that we are not continuing grants to soccer.  We are continuing sports capital grants to individual clubs around the country.  We have allocated a huge amount in the most recent round.  We will be opening it up again in a couple of months and all of those clubs will be eligible to apply again.  We are not going to see a situation where the small clubs, the volunteers and the players at grassroots level are being negatively impacted upon.  What we are doing is that we are not providing the sports capital that has been allocated to the FAI itself.  We are not making that available for drawdown, but it is only a relatively small amount overall.  All of those clubs throughout the country are eligible to come back in again for sports capital, and those that have been allocated funding are eligible to draw down that funding as normal.</p></speech>

It is hard to believe that, since last March, we would have arrived at this situation.  I have a long involvement in junior soccer.  I was treasurer of the Roscommon district league back in the 1980s, I was secretary of my local soccer club, I ran a double-decker bus to Germany in 1988 and I was at a celebration of junior football in Sligo County Council last Monday.  I know from members and playing members on the ground that they are absolutely disgusted at what has happened, and I can only reflect that back.  We are trying to get to the end of this but it is hard to imagine we could have ended up where we are.</p> <p>  I am disappointed at the FAI's absence.  Its representatives should have come in here today to answer questions and I hope we will have them here in the future.</p><p>I wish to ask a few questions.  There was a joke many years ago.  If one asked a doctor what two plus two was, the doctor would have said four.  If one asked a dentist what three plus three was, the dentist would have said six.  If one asked an accountant what four plus four was, the accountant would ask, "What do you want it to be?"  It seems that Deloitte has many questions to answer as well.  It is difficult to believe that it signed off on the books.  Mr. Treacy is right, in that we rely on professional auditors to do the right job.  I do not know whether it is in order, but can the committee invite the accountants?</p></speech>

The advice we have received through our clerk is that we have no role in respect of the auditors or accountants.  I appreciate that the Senator might not have been present at the time, but I raised the matter at the meeting.  I contacted the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, and made a written submission to it asking it to examine all aspects of the Deloitte audit.  I received an acknowledgement, which I circulated to members.  I wrote to the authority as a Deputy, but it replied to me as Chairman of the committee.  Everyone has a copy of it, and it might be helpful for the Senator.</p></speech>

He cannot say more, but that is probably the most damning statement made today.  My heart goes out to the 200 staff and their families who are caught up in this bad situation, which is not of their making.  I hope that what the Minister is doing will help to protect them and others in the FAI who are innocent of any wrong-doing.</p> <p>  We speak about an all-Ireland soccer team.  Since the time I grew up, we have been asking why the lads in the Irish Football Association, IFA, do not fold up their tent and join an all-Ireland soccer team, but what would the IFA have to do with the FAI now?  This situation has put back an all-Ireland soccer team years.  If we want to be honest, we have to resolve what is happening in the FAI.</p> <p>  The FAI is a toxic brand.  As many brands have done, is it time for a name change?  That is a matter for the FAI, but if the State is giving it funding, perhaps it needs to start afresh and change its name to, for example, "Soccer Ireland".  Given what has happened over the past two years, it needs to reflect on a name change.  We need to start from scratch.</p> <p>  At our first meeting on this matter approximately six months ago, I stated that the FAI was like "Goodfellas".  Look at UEFA.  It is the governing body and Mr. John Delaney had a powerful executive role there.  UEFA has questions to answer as well.  What is it doing and what has it done?  Can the committee ask representatives of UEFA to attend a meeting?  The Minister, the Minister of State, their officials and Sport Ireland have done excellent work trying to uncover facts and be helpful, but the FAI's governing body is UEFA and it should come clean about what is happening.  It should appear before us to explain what it will do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1318" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#Y00900"><p>On the comments relating to UEFA, we are due to meet it shortly and the Senator has raised many of the questions that we will be asking.</p> <p>  The image of the FAI and Irish soccer is damaged, although I hope not irreparably.  I am conscious of the fact that Irish soccer's image must improve if it is to get out of this situation, given the issue of acquiring sponsorships and other necessary elements.  For example, the Olympic Federation of Ireland rebranded, having formerly been the Olympic Council of Ireland.  That may be a template.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator that the issues are grave.  For a long time, he has been supportive of the concept of an all-island body.  That is a matter for both governing bodies, though, and is not for the Government to comment on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#Y01000"><p>I will reiterate that remark.  Senator Feighan's contribution was useful in several ways.  The accountants have questions to answer.  I do not know whether this is the right forum for that, but it seems somewhat absurd for Sport Ireland and, by extension, the State to depend on the accounts only for it to turn out that they have to be restated.  That makes much of the accountants' work redundant.  They have questions to answer, but whether they appear before the committee is up to themselves rather than the committee.  It would be welcome if they appeared to explain what happened.</p><p>I am <i>ad idem</i>with the Senator on an all-island soccer team.  I would love to see that.  It has probably been set back as a result of this situation.  As the Senator will be aware, it was meeting other obstacles, but I suspect the IFA would be less inclined to get involved with an organisation that the Senator described as having a toxic brand.  It will give those who do not want an all-island soccer team for other reasons, which I do not accept, an excuse for not getting involved, which is a great pity.  It is another setback.</p><p>UEFA is a key player in this matter, and as the Minister of State alluded to, we will meet it on 14 January.  I believe that is the date set at the moment.  We will look to talk to UEFA in as constructive a way as possible about what can be done to save Irish football.</p></speech>

When I saw the accounts, I went to a professional accountant to be sure.  So much has gone off track with the financial stability of what is a large national association.  That said, I would not be in favour of dismantling the association.  As happened with the Olympic Council of Ireland, perhaps a name change might be a move in the right direction.</p> <p>  I am delighted that the Minister met some representatives of the FAI last week, but I wish to ask him about people producing and seeing reports.  In fairness to Sport Ireland, the KOSI report shows that it acted fine in its distribution of money, in that the money was accounted for and it went where it was supposed to go.  That was good to hear.  The governance review group was chaired by Mr. Aidan Horan and produced a document.  Did the Minister see that document before it was signed off on and put into the public domain?</p></speech>

One of the reasons we have a big interest in the affairs of the FAI is because there are State aid or grants involved.  It has been acknowledged that as bad as the figures were, the FAI distributed the money where it was supposed to go, as in what Sport Ireland and the Department signed off on.  Now, the Minister is on about bringing in other means of distribution, which will add an astronomical cost because firms such as BDO do not come cheap.  When the firm gets money to allocate, will it get the money plus a fee or will the fee be taken out of the grant money?  It will cost at least a couple of &euro;100,000 to distribute the money.</p></speech>

There is a high risk that if we were to give money directly to the FAI, given that KOSI has stated that the moneys were pretty much well accounted for and given the precarious financial situation that the association is in at the moment, we could not guarantee that it would not disappear into a black hole.  That is one of the big challenges.  I mean when one has so many overdrawn accounts and different issues going on we want to ensure that the money gets to the front line and to the people who need it.  By going through the FAI, obviously there is a cost.  I understand that it is a very low cost to take the alternative route but at least we are guaranteeing that the money reaches where intended.  We would have no guarantee channelling the money through the FAI.  That would be completely out of the question and the KOSI clearly states that the FAI is not fit to receive public moneys.</p></speech>

We started funding the OCI before the final conclusions were reached and the matters were resolved.  Can we assume going forward that if the new FAI board is in place, we can surely put a guarantor in the administration to ensure the money would continue to be distributed?  We must give the current FAI credit and move on.</p></speech>

Mr. Treacy mentioned that Sport Ireland invited the FAI in twice in 2018 and it turned down the invitation both times.  Will he give us some more information on that?  For example, what were the dates in 2018 and what reason was given for not coming in?  What was the response of Sport Ireland and did it not raise a red flag in itself?  There was continuous speculation that the association was in difficulty even at that time.  Is there more detail on that?

The first invitation was issued towards the end of 2018.  It may have been the November board meeting.  The former chief executive officer was not available as it clashed with Ireland's away game in the UEFA Nations League in Denmark.  The second invitation was for the next meeting, which may have been the December meeting.  The former chief executive was not available as he was out of the country attending to business in his role with UEFA.  There was an executive meeting in UEFA and it was essentially a clash of dates.  We were working on other dates and there was a date in the diary for the first quarter of this year that seemed to suit all parties.  However, <i>The Sunday Times</i>article was published on St. Patrick's Day and events quickly overtook us.  The very next meeting of the board of Sport Ireland was the time when the decision was taken to suspend and withhold funding to the FAI.</p></speech>

The Minister, in response to a question, indicated that if the FAI goes, the League of Ireland goes too.  That has sent a shock across the State and people have been in touch with me since the Minister made that statement.  Will he commit that whatever happens, the League of Ireland will be protected?</p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions on Limerick FC.  I mentioned them briefly to the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, earlier.  Is the Minister aware that the Limerick FC club is being wound up?  Was he aware of the difficulties facing Limerick FC prior to last week's announcement?  Had he any discussions on the problems at Limerick FC?  As sports Minister, does he have any intention of stepping in to try to save the club, which has existed since 1937?  As things stand, next season's Airtricity League first division will have nine clubs if Limerick FC is not there.  The clubs left will face weeks with no games to play because Limerick FC will not be there.  It is an historical team and people are employed there.  I want to ensure the current position of Limerick FC is not lost in the absolute shambles of the FAI we are discussing today.  The club has existed for 80 years.</p><p>It is a core part of Limerick's sporting tradition and it is vital that it gets the support it needs.</p></speech>

I have deep concerns about it.  It is principally a matter for the FAI as to what happens to it in a doomsday situation.  We are trying to avoid that.  That is our ambition.  I am particularly concerned about the League of Ireland and I say this absolutely sincerely because I have felt for some time, as the Deputy does, that it had been neglected to an extent under the old regime.  There is room for improvement and I have made this perfectly clear.  When the independent directors come in, I intend to let them know that one of the great concerns we have relates to the League of Ireland.  It is one of the forgotten stakeholders and it should be given greater consideration and respect for what it is doing.  I will raise the issue of the League of Ireland specifically - I thank Deputies Quinlivan and O'Brien raising it - with UEFA on 14 January.  I am not sure whether UEFA is aware of the vulnerability of the League of Ireland.  I will certainly do this because the league needs protection.  Obviously, it is subject to the consequences of what has happened.  Our ambition is very definitely to save football and to save the League of Ireland and see that it continues to flourish.  I do not want to make any commitments, financial or otherwise, and I am not going to do so.  I would not do that.  I assure the Deputies that the representations they make are not falling on deaf ears.  I will ask Minister of State to answer the question on Limerick.</p></speech>

There is a long and proud tradition of soccer in Limerick.  There was so much hope in recent years and the club had been performing well until relatively recently, which compounds it.  It is a huge pity.  The licence is a matter for the FAI in terms of league participation.  I acknowledge the fact that an uneven number in the first division present all sorts of difficulties in terms of the team that will have a by every week and the lack of gate takings for those clubs.  Logistically, nine is a very small number to have in a league.  Since the club has gone into receivership, a prospective buyer will be dealing with the banks.  The Department would certainly be open to talking to any prospective buyer on how we could help and how other partners might help, for example, Limerick City and County Council.  I know for a while the club had been playing in Thomond Park.  There was a partnership with Munster Rugby.  At the same time, we cannot really intervene in the day-to-day running of the club or operational matters for the FAI in the context of the league.  The state of the overall league and its future security will be on the agenda for discussion with UEFA.  I will be very keen to explore it and see what, if anything, can be done to safeguard the league.</p></speech>

The Minister needs to address the issue more strongly than he has to date.  I appreciate his response, which was quite good, but we need a commitment that whatever happens the League of Ireland will be protected in some form.</p></speech>

We can set it up, or the Deputy can do so if he likes.  Let us meet them.  I am very happy to do so and take their message further.  The Deputy is making a fair point.  The League of Ireland teams are sometimes forgotten and it is not reasonable that this should be the case.  Certainly, we will set up a meeting-----</p></speech>

It is hypothetical at present and that is why we will meet UEFA and why we will explore all options to see what can be done.</p></speech>

The Minister stated earlier that the FAI is a going concern in his opinion.  That is not the opinion of the auditors.  I want to put this on the record.  The auditors have indicated that they do not know whether the FAI can meet its liabilities and that, therefore, they cannot support the assumption that it is a going concern.  On what basis is the Minister making the assumption the FAI is a going concern?  That is my first question.  If the Minister wants to answer it, I will come back in afterwards.</p></speech>

It has ridiculed us and laughed at us.  It threw some of us out of football grounds for trying to expose the incompetence in the organisation.  We had a situation where the FAI described the League of Ireland as the problem child.  We were not the problem child.  The FAI was the absentee father.  Forgive my language because I am angry about this.  The FAI was the absentee father.  It did not give an absolute bollocks about the League of Ireland and continues to not care about the League of Ireland.  Somebody needs to say this because it has not been said vocally enough.  I apologise for my language.</p></speech>

I am not going to get into reports or finger-pointing because I will respect what the Chairman asked me not to say at the start of the meeting, but we have a situation where Irish football is on the brink in terms of its future.  We are reliant on an organisation that has proved it cannot operate with due diligence to be the guardian and saviour of Irish football.</p> <p>  I do not want to see a situation where the FAI is liquidated.  I do not think anyone in the room wants to see it.  The consequences are too great to comprehend at present.  I am starting to come to the belief that if we are serious about protecting the future of Irish football we may end up with a scenario whereby the FAI goes into examination.  While it is in examinership an alternative structure could be put in place to take it back out examination.  If that were to happen, it would require financing and possibly State financing.  That the only way we will protect the national teams and the leagues as well as grassroots football.  It is the only way it can be done.  If it is liquidated under the articles of UEFA, the domestic leagues and the national teams will be gone.  They will all be gone.</p><p>Whatever our opinion of the FAI and its management structure, we cannot allow a situation where the FAI is liquidated because the consequences are unbearable to think about.  If it goes into examinership, somebody has to step in and we must be preparing for that eventuality now.  It might never happen but I do not want to wake up and find that the FAI has gone into examinership and we are not prepared to take it back out and protect Irish football.  That is the responsibility of the Minister, all of us and football fans throughout this country.  We need to start preparing for that.</p><p> I welcome the announcement of the 60 regional development officers that will be put in place.  There might be a misunderstanding about how this operates.  Those officers provide the coaching, they do not answer the phones or organise schools to compete in programmes.  Who is going to do all of that if we are not funding it?  We can provide the funding for development officers who will provide the coaching but if there is no one organising soccer schools and kits to be delivered, how does it work?</p></speech>

We hope that the FAI will co-operate but there is no sign of full co-operation yet.  We want a completely new chapter.  We will reduce the risk of things like examinership and liquidation and it is right that the Deputy has raised those issues.  We will reduce the risk of that immediately through independent directors coming in and that will mean more confidence in the FAI from the stakeholders including UEFA, the banks, the FAI itself and ourselves.  We might be considering changing the name of the organisation but whatever it will be called, we are looking for the moment that door is unlocked.  We might have a real opportunity to do the sorts of things the Deputy is talking about, specifically with the League of Ireland.  This could be a chance for something radical and some real reform could come out of this.  We are staring into a chasm but there are opportunities to correct something that has been going wrong for many years and respond to the things the Deputy is talking about, particularly with regard to the League of Ireland.  We will have an entirely new group of people involved who are not captured by the prejudices and loyalties of the past.  I hope we will have an opportunity in the coming days and weeks to get a strong chief executive in place because that is vital.  We need a strong group of independents who will turn their backs on the past.  We need a strong new chairman and we can set the example from the top.  That is not the solution but it is part thereof, as everyone here recognises.</p><p>The principal problem has been diabolical corporate governance and if we can sort that out, we will soon sort out the confidence issue.  We will be able to move on to the details thereafter, some of which are not our business, although the Deputy has addressed them, and many of which are symptoms of the things that are going wrong.  Our ambition and determination is to get those particular parts in place shortly and we can then address the issues about which Deputy is talking.  </p><p>There are sensitivities about us getting too involved which we will not breach.  Government policy and confidence are important factors.  We will have confidence if we see steps to reform that are radical enough to satisfy the requirements of corporate governance and begin to set in train an improvement in the finances.</p><p>I agree with everything the Deputy said.  We are meeting SIPTU this evening as a matter of urgency in order to hear more of the sorts of things the Deputy is saying because they are important to us.  We recognise the suffering that has been inflicted on people but we also recognise their importance as stakeholders and the contributions they will make to the FAI, or whatever the organisation might be called, in the future.</p></speech>

In the interests of openness and transparency, the business plan that the FAI presented to the Minister on Monday should be provided and made available to the public.  Is the business plan credible?  If we are going to start a culture of openness and transparency, we should start with the business plan and it should have been circulated to the members of the committee. The FAI seems to be good at avoiding meeting Sports Ireland, the Minister and this committee.  The FAI has previously supplied documents that we have seen and which are not credible.  I ask the Minister to provide to the public by this evening the business plan that was proposed.  The Government is being asked to bail out the FAI and we need to know whether there is any credibility to its business plan.</p> <p>  I also raise the competency of Deloitte as an auditor although I know it can only deal with the figures it is given.  There must have been interest payments on the loan.  Did Deloitte ever question the figures that were presented?  I ask the Minister and Sport Ireland how many other sporting organisations are Deloitte the auditor for.  How many tickets did Deloitte get from the FAI when it was the auditor of the association?  That would be insightful.  Deloitte did not do its job.</p> <p>  Has the Minister made any efforts to find out from the FAI whether the county organisations are being run on the same basis as the FAI?  The culture that exists at the top could seep into every county.  We are talking about reforms and legislation, as we were the last time the Minister was before the committee, and that things have to change.  During the term of this Government, there has been the Olympic Council of Ireland scandal and boxing has been an issue because the people in control at the top of those organisations have got money from the Government but the Government is unable to do what is in the best interests of the sports because the guys at the top are controlling everything.  Power needs to be taken back by the Department and Government because fiefdoms have been created by people in different sporting organisations which are not being run in the best interests of those organisations but of the very few at the top.  There have been issues about the greyhound industry and there are issues now with the FAI.  What legislation has been brought in during his term to stop those sorts of things happening since we found out about the Olympic Council of Ireland?</p><p>Given the number of sporting organisations involved and the amount of time being wasted, is there a proposal that an audit will be done - I suggest by a company other than Deloitte - of those organisations?  Instead of us having to bail out the FAI at Christmas in order to keep people who are in jeopardy of losing their jobs because of the incompetence of the bosses in their jobs, we must ensure that we will not be back here again in six months or a couple of years' time discussing another sporting organisation that is being run by individuals for their own gain and profit.  Is the Government proposing that there will be a forensic review?  That is the only way it will work because the auditors seem to be beyond useless.  They are off bolting doors after the horse, or the greyhound in some cases, has gone down the field.  What does the Government intend to do and what legislation has been introduced since we started dealing with the issues relating to the Olympic Council of Ireland?</p><p> I want to raise another issue regarding what was brought up here about pension entitlements-----</p></speech>

We will be auditing 14 next year.  We did eight or nine this year.  We will be continuing to do that.  We do use Deloitte but we use other auditors also.  We just need to be careful that we do not cast aspersions on one particular firm.  I understand the point the Senator made in terms of the misses around the FAI but at the same time we need to be careful.  I have to say that we get audits from Deloitte and they are very good.</p></speech>

Almost every year there is a scandal about a sporting organisation.  The Sports Council does not have all the powers.  It cannot go into an organisation and start opening filing cabinets.  We discussed previously the question of having such powers.  Changing personnel is a way of saying that we will ensure the ship is run better by getting a better captain.  The problem is that the super structure is always wrong.  It seems to be that if there is a bad egg in a sporting organisation, they can do whatever they want.  They run the show.  They hire and they fire, and there is no accountability.  We have seen that time and again.  To come back to the question, does the Minister have the answer?  He might supply it to the committee.  Someone might ask Deloitte if it got tickets from the FAI, the number involved and whether it paid for them.  What we are trying to establish here is the credibility of the organisation.  First and foremost, these are the people who should have raised red flags.  We had this previously with the banking crisis.  Here we are again, with another group of auditors saying, "We have enough caveats on this that we are not responsible for anything that goes wrong but we will get paid a lot to do it".</p></speech>

We need to remember also the role and responsibilities of the boards of the organisations that are running sport in the country.  I refer to all the corporate governance work we are doing with them in terms of ensuring they know what their duties.  The board of the FAI, in this case, has responsibility for the organisation and how it is run.  What we can do is provide the guidance and the training they need, as we do in terms of organisational development and change.  All that structure has been in place for the past number of years but if, hypothetically, a rogue chief executive or someone comes in-----</p></speech>

We did audits of the FAI and continue to do it.  We got good reports.  At the time we were being accused maybe of being heavy-handed with organisations.

That is fair enough.  Between now and our next meeting, I ask Mr. Treacy to send the committee a note on that because I think it is a legitimate question.  I am quoting from an article from the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Mr. Treacy and other people know the facts; the committee does not.  There is an element of relevance, albeit that Mr. Treacy might be able to give us an answer indicating that there is nothing to see here.  It is a legitimate question.  While I appreciate I have just sprung it on Mr. Treacy now, I will get him the<i>Irish Independent</i>article that made me ask the question.  It is from seven or eight years ago.</p><p>I am conscious that the Minister, Deputy Ross, has gone but no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, speaks for the Government.  Up to very lately the Government position was that we needed a total clear-out of the FAI.  Is the total clear-out complete or did the Government have any issues either with the current executive lead or the other five directors who joined the board since July?  I ask that for two reasons.  First, Fianna F&aacute;il is interested in moving this thing forward.  Second, these people are entitled to their reputations.  If there is confidence in them, they are entitled to hear it from the Minister of State today.  If there is not, the nation also wants to know that the clear-out is not complete, that X and Y still have to go and that the Government is still not content.  Can we have some confidence today to say that we are happy with the six we have?  I am still in the dark as to when the independent directors will be appointed.  Who are they?  Who is appointing them?  When will it happen?</p></speech>

We want to see the independent chairman and independent directors in place.  We want to see an independent chief executive appointed as quickly as possible.  We are happy to work with those people and do our best to move this forward and achieve progress.  Earlier we discussed the process of appointing the independent directors, which should have started earlier.  We are where we are.  As the Minister, Deputy Ross, said earlier, we want to meet those people the day they are appointed and get stuck in.  Unfortunately, we are not at that point yet, but we want to get there and we want to work with those people.</p></speech>

I just want to respond to one point Deputy MacSharry raised.  The KOSI audit happened because we insisted there should be a forensic audit of the organisation.  Nobody wants it more than I do, because I had to ask the FAI president, Mr. Conway, three times to do it and each time he did not commit to it.  However, now that audit has been done.  The Minister said:</p> <blockquote> 	I have also consulted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has advised me that the matters outlined in the KOSI report are central to its investigations and those of the ODCE.  The Garda has further advised me that making the report public at this time could have serious implications for any criminal proceedings subsequently brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions. </blockquote> <p>That is a very clear position that we have on that.  The committee has agreed.  We have made sure that there is no questioning which would put that in peril.  Notwithstanding the Deputy's suggestion that we should all have a copy of it, I think it is the last thing we should get before the Garda confirms it is finished with it, irrespective of what it does with it.</p></speech>

There are professional staff within the organisation and they are progressing the work.  The four independent directors bring a level of expertise to the board.  There are also people on the board who are engaged in the current IPA course being run by Sport Ireland.  Obviously, the independent directors would already have this expertise, which will enhance the board.  The governance review sets out what needs to be put in place.  This is set out in black and white for the organisation as well.</p></speech>

There are people who, having worked with other organisations, have expertise in this area, including Brendan Menton and Sarah Keane, in terms of her hands-on approach to the restoration of an organisation.  The committee could usefully hear from such people if we are holding another session in the new year.  We should have another session because this is going to be an ongoing process.</p> <p>  I do not think the new directors of the FAI are helping their case in terms of their communications strategy and how they are working through the 78 recommendations.  It would be far better if they gave a constant update on where they are in the process.  That would be of assistance to people and sponsors who have concerns in terms of reputational damage and so on.  </p></speech>

Earlier, I referred to the fact that there is a KOSI implementation group between Sport Ireland and the FAI.  On the governance review group and the oversight group, there were 78 recommendations, 16 of which were considered priorities.  Of these 16, 11 have been implemented and five are in progress.  In total, 30 of the 78 recommendations have been implemented or completed, 20 are in progress and 28 have not yet commenced.  I do not have the specifics in this regard, which I accept would be useful.</p></speech>

The total amount for tax and audit advice over four years was &euro;430,000, which is an awful lot of money.  Some of those accounts had to be restated.  There are other issues in regard to FRS102, which is about related parties.  One would expect to see that in a set of accounts, where somebody who purchases jerseys or goal posts is related to a member of the board.  In this regard, there was nothing recorded for 2017.  There was also nothing recorded for 2014 or 2015.</p><p>Rigour was not demonstrated in those accounts.  I am using this as an example for Sport Ireland.  In addition to internal audit, does Sport Ireland look at what might be missing or at how routine accounts are, which may suggest they are almost copied and pasted?</p></speech>

A review of the annual financial statements presented is carried out by the director of finance every year.  This does not relate only to the FAI's accounts but to those of every organisation we fund.  Over the years, Sport Ireland raised several queries about the FAI's accounts.  We reported to the committee on queries raised about the 2017 financial accounts and the position with regard to net current liabilities and solvency.  The FAI provided a response, which has been provided to members of the committee.  That is just an example.  Queries were raised about the FAI's financial statements every single year, as is the case for every set of accounts presented to us.</p></speech>

I have been informed by someone who looked at the accounts of the Irish Football Association in the North of Ireland, which has a turnover of &euro;15 million, that its audit fees totalled less than &euro;40,000.  There is a huge difference between the situation here and there.</p></speech>

The number of people who will elect, for example, the next president is very limited.  Does Mr. McGinty have concerns about that?  Has Sport Ireland been talking to the FAI in this regard?  That is part of its governance arrangements and it strikes me that this number may not be representative of the totality of the organisation.</p></speech>

The FAI will look at extending the range of people it can put in.  They will not come from the council itself but from a wider pool.  The Deputy makes a very valid point.  We need to ensure that we capitalise on the expertise available, probably not through an elected body.</p></speech>

I refer to the under-13s and the relationship between their clubs and the league.  There are serious concerns about the quality and sustainability of the underage game.

I have been very clear on this.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has said that the matters outlined in the KOSI report are central to its investigation and those of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Making the report public could have serious implications for any criminal proceedings.  We have all been very conscious of that all day.  In fairness to Mr. Treacy, we have to be consistent on this to protect the integrity of the report and to avoid compromising anything the Garda may do in this regard.  That is the truth.</p></speech>

I understand the position.  I will move on.  Given that the FAI is often audited and that Sport Ireland often cites such audits as a sign of the health of a sporting organisation, does Mr. Treacy feel this sort of problem could exist elsewhere?  As the Chairman has outlined, this sort of forensic audit only happened as a consequence of the insistence of the Chair and the committee.  It has shown up a number of shortcomings in the regular audit process.  Does Mr. Treacy feel this kind of problem could exist in other organisations?</p></speech>

We received the agreement of the FAI to carry out an in-depth audit in March, when this issue came up.  Through the prompting of the Chair, we did a forensic audit.  We have now changed our terms and conditions, as the Deputy will know.  We will carry out in-depth audits of all the organisations in future.  That has been agreed with the organisations.  We do not need legislation to do this if we agree with the national governing bodies that it is what we are going to do, based on consent.  That is what we are doing.</p></speech>

As we said earlier, we are going to audit 14 sporting organisations next year.  We will continue to do that.  We have increased the number of audits we carry out over recent years.  We will do a thorough job.  We are doing a lot of training on corporate governance with the national governing bodies as well.  By and large, when we carry out audits - and we have lots of experience in this - we do not find a great number of significant issues.  If we find significant issues, we sit down with that organisation over the course of a year to ensure that such issues are addressed.  The national governing body has to verify that with us.  That process has been in place for quite some time.</p></speech>

It might be a question to which Mr. Treacy can find the answer.  I do not see how it could impinge on Garda investigations in any way.  I may help give us a clearer picture.  With regard to the current state of health of the FAI, notwithstanding the confidential figure that was inadvertently revealed by the Minister here a short time ago, do we have a sense of the FAI's overall position for 2019 as a going concern?  We are getting to the end of the year.</p><p>Presumably, its position has eroded significantly further from when the 2018 accounts were published.  There is a view that it is continuing to erode as time passes, for example, as a result of losing its main sponsor.  Does the Department have a view on this?</p></speech>

I gave a figure of &euro;62 million earlier in the context where the debt stands.  It is not good, but there are income opportunities as well that the directors are hopeful will result in an improved scenario.  The reason we are meeting UEFA is to see if we can get this matter resolved, but the FAI will need serious assistance if it is to avoid a very stark situation in 2020.</p></speech>

Is that the limit of the measures the Government is willing to undertake or will there be further direct interventions?</p></speech>

Under the youth field sports programme, we announced today that we are getting that money out to the front line.  We are working with our partners and the relevant stakeholders.  Again, we are talking to UEFA and will meet its representatives.  The key thing to resolve this is to get the proper personnel in place in the FAI.  Without the independent directors in place, it will be very difficult to resolve and it will be difficult for the Government to do what it potentially could do into the future.  At present, there is no public trust in the organisation.  KOSI Corporation Limited has stated quite clearly that the organisation is not in a position to receive public moneys.  As long as that continues, it will be difficult for the Government to assist.</p> <p>  We are doing what we can and trying to resolve as much we can where that is within our power.  Personally speaking, my priorities are the players at every level, the volunteers throughout the country who, in some cases, have given decades of service to soccer in Ireland, the staff in the organisation and the hundreds of thousands of passionate Irish soccer supporters of the League of Ireland, the international team or any other team.  I am a passionate supporter of soccer so I want to help and try to get this resolved, but it will be very difficult.  Nobody should be under the illusion that this will be easy because it will not be.  It will be a massive challenge for all of us to get this fixed.</p></speech>

Does the FAI have the money to pay the senior team ahead of the UEFA Euro 2020 matches?  I presume there would be a conflict with UEFA intervening in respect of that tranche of funding.</p></speech>

I do not wish to reveal too much of what was presented to us as a confidential document on Monday, but it is not in a good place at all financially and significant assistance will be required to perform all of the ordinary tasks of a football association.  I will not get into the business of where it would cut back or where it would or would not pay.  That is a matter for the FAI and its directors, but they will need serious financial support to function.</p></speech>

I have some questions for the Minister of State.  One relates to funding of the League of Ireland and the prize money for clubs in the future.  This is a huge concern for clubs.  I have been a lifelong supporter of Sligo Rovers.  Clubs are struggling to survive each year.  Deputy MacSharry and I are big supporters of Sligo Rovers, and there is only one Rovers.</p></speech>

There are many other clubs in the country in a similar situation.  As we move forward will the overall structure of, and investment in, the league be part of the Government's role in the restructuring of the FAI?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1698" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1318" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#HH01000"><p>First, I acknowledge how important Sligo Rovers FC is to soccer in the north west.  The team has a proud and strong tradition.  We spoke earlier about Limerick FC and there is also Cork City FC in the case of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  Clubs are very important to their fans and to the people who live locally.  The structure of the League of Ireland and the prize money are matters for the FAI, not for the Government.  We had a stakeholders forum in May and there were discussions about the league and all the things that need to happen.  Ultimately, however, the FAI must have its house in order for all these matters to be resolved.</p> <p>  I have my own ideas on how I would like to see the league proceeding, what I think might be a better way forward for the league and so forth.  It is not the role of the Minister or the Department to set preconditions or to advise on the league, however, it is a matter for the FAI to get it right.  We know it is not performing next or near where it could be performing.  I believe there is far greater potential for the League of Ireland, but this is something that would have to be done internally.  That is why it is so important that there are proper structures in place and that the voice of the grassroots, supporters, volunteers and all the people who make soccer possible in this country would be heard and have an avenue to impact on decision making.  It is clear that has not been happening and that is a big problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1699" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1343" speakername="Tony McLoughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#HH01100"><p>That is true.  My next question is about outstanding payments promised by the FAI to grassroots clubs.  A commitment of &euro;50,000 was given to Ballisodare United recently.  Also, there are payments to be made by the FAI in respect, for example, of developments where there has already been an announcement of sports capital funding.  There is another one in place with regard to the redevelopment of the MacSharry development in Sligo town.  This money was allocated under the sports capital programme along with FAI funding.  Will these go ahead while audit investigations are taking place?</p></speech>

The FAI is trying to get a handle on what has been promised, what facilities have gone ahead based on promises and so forth.  That work is under way.  I am keen to find out about that.  I have made contact with a number of clubs in my constituency to ask about the situation in that regard.  There appear to be different models of draw-down and different models regarding who is paying back the money or where the money comes from.  In one club the funding was provided to the club from a finance agency and the FAI was due to pay back the agency, with the club only paying interest.  A development went ahead on the basis of that set-up.</p> <p>  These are matters we are trying to get on top of in order to find out exactly what has been promised and what the implications will be if clubs have factored projected income they had been promised in the future into their business plans and if that income is not available now.  The reason is that I am keen to help and make life easier for the clubs and the volunteers.  We will see what we can do to help them because the last thing we want is clubs and volunteers who have been audacious enough to put facilities in place for their communities to then find themselves in difficult financial situations as a result of what, effectively, would be a broken promise.  It is difficult to find a pattern even in terms of how those decisions were made, but we are trying to get on top of that.</p></speech>

There may be matters that we do not know about and I do not want to be sitting here in three months.  I merely wanted to clarify that we are going off what we know at present.  Everyone can use hindsight at some stage in the future.</p></speech>

Exactly.  We need to work with those who are there to try to resolve the issues, but I must emphasise how important it is that the independent directors get in place quickly and that we get an independent chief executive in place without further delay.  Every day that is wasted here increases the risk to the organisation.</p></speech>

I have only a couple.  One of them, which was in the media recently, is that Mr. Brian Kerr and Mr. Niall Quinn have proposals.  Has the Minister of State met them or is he aware of their proposals?  Would it be helpful to meet them?</p></speech>

It is separate.  It is a whole rescue.  I want to make the point because I told Mr. Niall Quinn that we would be discussing these issues in the public domain today.  As a Member of the Oireachtas, I have a keen interest in it.  I am not asking the Minister of State to commit to anything, but has he met them?  That is it, really.  It seems they are trying to separate the community from the commercial aspect of the game.  Would that be fair?</p></speech>

We have not met them on it, to answer the question.  In terms of everything we do around having strong organisations, when one fragments an organisation it goes against the grain.  Sport should be governed by the national organisation and that is why one does not fragment it.  It all should fit in, one piece after another.  The development leads to talent identification.  Talent identification leads to high performance.  Fragmenting an organisation probably is not the way forward.  Obviously, as was said here, the new organisation needs to give a great deal of time to the League of Ireland and to the underage development of the game and lift the whole organisation up now.</p></speech>

I want to make a point.  My understanding, to helpful with the Chairman's first question, is that to split an organisation like that is against FIFA's rules.  It will only recognise one federation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-18a.1746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121800002#JJ04500"><p>It might well be so.  All I am saying is that a Member of the Oireachtas had the courtesy of inviting me to a meeting I could not attend on Monday last and I contacted Mr. Niall Quinn stating that I would be happy to invite them in here.  I spoke to the clerk to the committee about it.  What I am getting at is there is a great deal of goodwill out there.  I want to make this point clearly.  There is a crisis in the football association and I want to make sure that everybody who wants to have an input has a vehicle for doing that.  Perhaps through here might be the way.</p> <p>  The question on the crisis management is that while I have every confidence both in the Minister and in Sport Ireland, in reference to Deputy Catherine Murphy's point, if there are any additional skills and expertise needed, these should be made available and the Minister should find a way to get these to them.</p> <p>  The other point is one I made earlier.  I acknowledge the wish of the Minister to meet UEFA before Christmas.  The fact that the meeting will not take place until 14 January concerns me.  That is not a criticism.  It seems the quicker that meeting can take place, the better.  The downside of all of this is coming at us like an express train.  Any time that is lost in getting a solution worries me.  UEFA needs to be at the table.  It needs to be there now.  I agree with the Minister of State that it should meet him before Christmas.  This will not get better.  It will get worse.  The implications for the national team, the league and young people are considerable.</p></speech>
