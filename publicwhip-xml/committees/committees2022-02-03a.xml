Deputies Carroll MacNeill and Sherlock have advised that they will be late arriving due to other engagements.</p> <p>  I welcome everyone to the meeting.  While Covid-19 restrictions have been relaxed, it is open to members and witnesses to attend in person.  They should continue to wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness.</p> <p>  This morning we shall engage with officials from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to examine its financial statements for 2020.  TII has been advised that the committee may also wish to following matters during the course of the engagement: TII's role as a sponsoring authority for MetroLink; public private partnerships, PPPs; and matters relevant to TII's remit in recent correspondence from the Department of Transport to this committee.  That correspondence is item R0967.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from TII: Mr. Peter Walsh, chief executive; Mr. Nigel O'Neill, director of the capital programme; Mr. Pat Maher, director of network management; Ms Audrey Keogh, director of business services; Mr. Cathal Masterson, director of commercial operations.  Attending remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Transport: Ms Ethna Brogan, assistant secretary; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer, who was with us last week; Mr. Andrew Ebrill, principal officer in the national roads, greenways and active travel division; and Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal adviser in the regional and local roads division.  They are all very welcome. </p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask Members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that mobile phones are on silent or switched off.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of the Parliament is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  A number of today's witnesses, however, are to give their evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If a question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.  This applies mainly to those contributing online from a remote location.</p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022020300002#A00500"><p>TII was formed in 2015 through a merger of the former National Roads Authority, NRA, and the Railway Procurement Agency.  TII&rsquo;s primary function is to provide an integrated approach to the development and operation of the national roads network and light rail infrastructure throughout Ireland.</p> <p>  TII&rsquo;s income in 2020 totalled &euro;1.435 billion, up from &euro;1.340 billion in 2019.  The majority of this income comes from Exchequer grant funding.  As a result of the impact of Covid-19-related travel restrictions, road toll income fell from &euro;192.6 million in 2019 to &euro;138.5 million in 2020.  There was also a drop in other income due to a fall in passenger numbers on the Luas system.  This resulted in TII making a &euro;30 million payment to the Luas operator, which was funded through a public service obligation, PSO, grant it received from the National Transport Authority, NTA.</p> <p>  TII&rsquo;s expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.466 billion, of which &euro;1.349 billion was related to expenditure on the road network.  The majority of this was in the form of payments to local authorities, including &euro;427 million provided in relation to the national roads system and payments of &euro;546 million made on behalf of the Department of Transport in relation to regional and local roads.  The Department retains decision-making power over the allocation of that funding and is responsible for the oversight and monitoring function for those roads.  Expenditure related to PPP contracts for parts of the national roads system amounted to &euro;173 million in the year, comprising operating and finance charges.</p> <p>  I certified the 2020 financial statements on 28 June 2021 and issued a clear audit opinion. However, I drew attention to a disclosure in the statement on internal financial control regarding non-compliance with procurement rules in respect of a contract for technical design services.  The statement also sets out the actions being taken by TII to address the issue.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms. Audrey Keogh, director of business services, Mr. Cathal Masterson, director of commercial operations, Mr. Nigel O'Neill, director of the capital programme, and Mr. Pat Maher, director of network management.  I understand that the committee wishes to examine TII's financial statements of 2020 and the area of public&ndash;private partnerships.  Before I make some general comments about 2020 and the area of public&ndash;partnerships, I would like to describe briefly the duties and functions assigned to TII through legislation.</p> <p>  The NRA, operating as TII since 2015, was established under the Roads Act 1993.  It is the general duty of the authority to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads, having regard to the needs of all users.  TII is the approving authority for national road projects.  In 2015, the NRA was merged with the Railway Procurement Agency, and the Roads Act of 2015 added the function of securing the provision of, or providing, such light railway and metro railway infrastructure as may be determined by the NTA.  The NTA is the approving authority for metro and light rail projects.  In September 2021, TII became the approving authority for greenways.</p> <p>  In relation to 2020, the onset of the global pandemic had a significant impact on TII.  In March 2020, the Government classified the national road network and the Luas network as critical transport infrastructure.  Luas and national roads continued to operate, without interruption, throughout all the restrictions that Government put in place to combat the spread of Covid-19.  All staff who could moved to remote working.</p><p>The measures imposed to combat the spread of the virus reduced the volume of vehicles on national roads and passengers on Luas, with a consequent reduction in revenue to TII.  Revenue from national road tolls for 2020 was &euro;56 million less than originally forecast.  The reduction in toll revenue was managed to ensure that all activities were kept going and fully funded.  The Luas revenue shortfall was addressed by the provision of &euro;30 million in PSO payments by the NTA.  This was the first time TII received PSO payments since the commencement of Luas services.  I am happy to report that the Comptroller and Auditor General expressed an unqualified opinion on the 2020 financial statements.<br/><br/>On PPP contracts, I would like to outline why TII entered into them, how TII's PPP contracts are structured and what the outcome was.  Why did TII develop and enter into PPP contracts?  In 1999, the Government decided to adopt a PPP approach on a pilot basis in order to fund public capital projects.  In the national development plan, NDP, for the period  2000 to 2006, the Government set a minimum indicative target of &euro;1.27 billion for private sector investment into national road projects.  The use of PPP contracts was identified as an essential component in contributing to the financing and delivery of the national road improvements.  The stipulated that funding structures, including road user tolls, where appropriate, were to be examined.<br/><br/>Section 4.109 of the NDP in question stated that the pilot projects announced by the Minister for Finance in June 1999 would all be developed as PPP projects within the period of the plan, namely, 2000 to 2006.  These included, subject to statutory procedures and negotiations where appropriate: a new western river crossing in Limerick on the N7; the Waterford by-pass, including a new bridge over the Suir, on the N25; the second West-Link Bridge on the M50.  In addition, the potential for a PPP to develop the Kilcock-Kinnegad section of the N4 was to be actively explored.<br/><br/>The Government established the central public private partnership unit in the Department of Finance at the beginning of 1999, to lead, drive and co-ordinate the process and in mid-1999 the Government established a Cabinet committee on infrastructural development, including public private partnership.  The Cabinet committee focused initially on transport, notably the core interurban road network.  In response to these policy decisions, TII established a PPP unit and developed a bundle of nine PPP contracts which, following competitive tendering, were entered into during the period 2003 to 2007.  Details of the nine projects are in an information note I provided to the committee.  In total, &euro;1.75 billion of private finance was raised by the PPP companies and used in the delivery of these nine road projects.  The NDP for the period 2007 to 2013 reiterated Government policy that PPPs would have an important role to play in the delivery of that plan.  It stated that a PPP approach would be considered for appropriate projects.<br/><br/>On 31 January 2008, the Minister for Transport informed the chair of the NRA that:</p><blockquote>	... the Government recently reviewed the financing arrangements for Transport 21.  Arising from that review it is now proposed that a number of national road projects, involving capital expenditure of the order of &euro;1 billion euro, should be undertaken as unitary payments public private partnerships. </blockquote><p>In compliance, TII developed a bundle of four PPP road contracts and two motorway service area contracts.  In total, &euro;1.22 billion of private finance was raised by the PPP companies and used in the delivery of these four road projects and six motorway service areas.<br/><br/>How are national roads PPP contracts structured?  There are three types of PPP contract that TII has entered into.  Eight are road toll concession contracts.  Five are availability, design, build, operate, maintain and finance, DBOMF, road contracts and two are motorway service area concession contracts.  There are two key features of PPP contracts that make them different from the traditional form of civil engineering contracts which are used to deliver road infrastructure for the State.  The first is risk transfer and the second is the commitment to the long-term operation and maintenance of the asset.<br/><br/>In terms of risk transfer, there are two types of risk which are transferred from the state to the PPP company.  The first is construction risk.  I have been involved with civil engineering for more than 40 years and I know that construction risk does manifest and when ground conditions or weather conditions do not turn out to be what had been anticipated it costs money to rectify or mitigate the consequences.  Construction risk is transferred to the PPP company in all 15 of TII's PPP contracts.<br/><br/>The second area of risk occurs where the funding structures include road user tolls.  In these contracts, the risk relates to traffic forecasts.  Of TII's eight toll concession PPP contracts, the traffic risk has been fully transferred to the PPP company in six and partially transferred in two.  The traffic volumes that were forecast by the PPP companies in the years 2003 to 2007 did not materialise.<br/><br/>The second key feature of PPP contracts is the commitment to the long-term operation and maintenance of the asset.  TII's eight toll concession contracts have contract durations of 30 years for six of them, 35 years for one and 45 years for the remaining one.  TII's five availability contracts have contract durations of 25 years for four and 35 years for one.  The two motorway service area concessions have 25-year contract durations.  During those years the PPP company must operate and maintain the road or service area.  At the end of the period, the road or service area must be handed back with a minimum residual life.  The minimum residual life varies for different elements of the asset.  For example, for pavements it is ten years.  The payments relating to these services are strictly controlled by the contract conditions.<br/><br/>I will outline what was delivered by PPP contracts.  The major interurban motorway network, connecting Ireland's five major cities to Dublin was completed by 2010.  The PPP contracts delivered key elements of that network.  In total, PPP contracts have delivered more than 400 km, approximately one third, of Ireland's motorway network and six motorway service areas.  The contracts have proven to be robust, with the successful transfer of construction risk and traffic risk to the PPP companies.<br/><br/>The operation and maintenance requirements are appropriate for the safe operation of the motorways and the maintenance of the value of the assets which will handed back to the State at the end of the contract durations.  Today, the PPP companies employ 540 full-time and 400 part-time staff in the operation and maintenance of the 400 km of motorway and the provision of services at the six motorway service areas.<br/><br/>The operating standards have been maintained.  The motorway network remained open and safely operational throughout extreme weather events and Covid-19 necessitated public health restrictions.  PPP contracts have delivered, and continue to deliver, very good value for money for the Irish taxpayer and have contributed in a very significant way in the creation of a safe and efficient motorway network for Ireland.  That concludes my opening statement.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions that members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

Taking all of those factors into account, including the income that is being received by the private contractor, can we say here is a balance sheet outlining how much the road costs, how much it costs to maintain, how much income the private operator received and this is how much it would have cost for the State to have done all of those things and compare the two of them?  Has that been carried out for each of the projects at this stage?</p></speech>

However, whenever it is postponing or suspending projects, that is on TII.  I want to try to figure out where the line is drawn in terms of political decisions versus TII's input.  For example, are roads that would be included in the national development plan, NDP, decided by the Ministers and the Department or does TII tell the Department and Ministers which roads need to be included in that NDP based on an objective criteria?</p></speech>

We would identify areas of the network that we believe require and warrant intervention.  It is a matter then for the Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the elected representatives to approve an NDP, which we will then deliver.

There are policy decisions set down by Government that need to be honoured and followed.  For instance, if the commitment to the protection and renewal of the network is placed as a very high priority, then that, obviously, becomes a first priority for us.</p></speech>

Therefore, we would need to meet those costs or advise Government and the Department of those costs.  Where there is a commitment to projects at construction and there are contracts in place and those bills have to be met, that then becomes a priority that needs to be met.  Where there is Cabinet approval to proceed with a project into planning, as part of expending code process, such as, for example, the Galway ring road or Foynes-Limerick, then those projects have a priority because there is a commitment to it.  Therefore, the consequences of those need to be dealt with.  Where there is a policy that says that we need to upgrade the access to ports, then the likes of Cork to Ringaskiddy, Foynes-Limerick or Oligate to Rosslare has a priority.  The current 2022 allocations reflect the upcoming commitment to the Government's Town Centre First policy that is imminent.  All of those priority areas, as identified by Government, have to be reflected in the projects that we bring forward.</p></speech>

It has brought its analysis of the Government commitments and the projects, I presume, from its own members of staff or input from local authorities.  It has outlined other national areas that perhaps the Government would like to consider.  However, at the end of the day, it is the Department that sits down with the Minister to decide what will actually include in the NDP from that list.  It then comes back to TII, which finds out what the NDP is.  There may be, I presume, projects that TII has not considered on the top if its list, but all of a sudden, they are in shining lights in the NDP.</p></speech>

We allocate the funds required to meet the commitments that each of those projects will have in 2022.  As things stand, we have quite a number of projects at construction, so they are at first priority in terms of ensuring that all the bills arising out of them are met.  Whatever is left after that is what we allocate in accordance with those priorities of connections to ports, Town Centre First and so on.</p> <p>  It is then a matter of how much we have.  It could be a case that a particular project is very large and the bills that are likely to arise in the short term in order to do ground investigations or topographical or environmental surveys could be very expensive and we cannot afford it that  year.  However, as we understand the funding profile from the Department, it improves dramatically in the year 2026.  Therefore, those projects will be progressed at that time.</p></speech>

For an example that I would know of, the N2, has two pieces, which are Carrickmacross to Ardee and the Clontibret to the Border road schemes.  Nobody who has ever driven that road would say anything other than the priority would be the northern end, because that road is in a more dangerous position than the southern road.  However, TII made a decision to proceed with the southern stretch.  Why was that?</p></speech>

Both were considered and the one that was better able to progress in 2022, as I recall, was the section to Castleblayney.  Clontibret to the Border does not have the same accident history and, as such, the prioritisation was given to the more southern section.</p></speech>

I apologise to Deputy Carthy for walking in front of him.  The witnesses are welcome.  We have met a number of times.  Mr. Walsh must be sick of me at this stage.  We have many important things to talk about.  On a positive note, it is important to acknowledge that many of the points I wanted to make around the finances of TII have in some degree been clarified.  That has to be welcomed.  I have a couple of points to make about the structuring of the organisation's finances, as a State agency.  I strongly believe in seeing an end-of-year budget put in place to allow visibility of all the capital projects being undertaken, to see how much capital is being spent on those projects and to give us a clear idea of which projects are experiencing overruns.  I am concerned at the enormous rise in construction inflation, which obviously has a knock-on impact on the work being done by TII and will affect current development plans that are in place.  The issue of road construction is important to me.  Are the current projects being undertaken, including the Dunkettle upgrade and the Macroom-Baile Bhuirne bypass, on budget?  Are they over budget, based on expenditure over the past 12 months?  How is that looking?</p></speech>

An allocation is given to a project at the beginning of a year but depending on the progress that can be made during the year it may end up as a different number.  It could be more, or it could be less.  If significant progress is made, if we have a good summer for instance, more money will be spent on that project.  For that reason additional funding was provided to Ballyvourney-Macroom during 2021 and Dunkettle because more progress was made than originally forecast.  However the overall project for the project is determined at the beginning of the approval to enter into the contract and that remains unchanged.  We are within that budget for both projects.</p></speech>

Over the past year, an issue arose with regard to expenditure on the N73.  TII's use of the term "funding uncertainty" has grown over the course of the past six months.  Is there any update on the delay that happened in September?  Will that project be going ahead?  Has Mr. Walsh any information for that committee on that?</p></speech>

Regarding the uncertainty, the circumstances are unusual.  It was a brand new NDP.  The annual funding profile had not been clarified.  Until we had clarity, we needed to be prudent.  It ended up with us not being in a position to approve Cork County Council proceeding to tender with that N73 project.  We did this out of caution.  We will never leave a local authority stuck with a bill for a contract that we have approved.  We do not want to incur cost for the civil engineering industry in tendering for a project with which we cannot proceed.  At that time, with the uncertainty prevailing, we could not give approval.  We got certainty later and we have profiled accordingly.  We have given approval to Cork County Council to proceed this year with the tender for the N73.</p></speech>

Is TII currently in a financial position to undertake what has been underlined in the NDP as it stands?  Does it have the funding to proceed with the projects that are listed?

We operate under section 19 of the Roads Act to deliver on our mandate through the local authorities.  Allocations are given to local authorities for specific projects that reflect what we believe to be the progress that can be made on that project in the coming year.  In their original selection, the projects reflect the prioritisation given by Government and set out in the national development plan.  For an individual year, the allocation reflects what we believe - in conjunction with the local authority - is achievable within the next 12 months.  That allocation is the one that goes into our allocation book and is communicated to the local authorities.  </p></speech>

At that time, I raised the issue of roadside parking of heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, in Rosslare.  My next comment is not aimed at Mr. Walsh.  In general, the solution is not very satisfactory.  I know it is an interim solution.  We continue to park these vehicles on the roadside albeit they are off the main thoroughfare on a link road.  We have a serious commercial driver shortage.  It is a worldwide shortage.  As an island nation, Ireland depends very much on road transport.  None of the stakeholders that have been engaged in this - everybody from the Office of Public Works, OPW, to Wexford County Council to TII, the NRA, Rosslare Europort and even Revenue - have given consideration to the health, safety and well-being of the driving population.  That no consideration is given to their sanitary provisions is a poor reflection on how we regard what I would regard as front-line workers.  If you were to enter the OPW facility and tell the customs officers they would not be able to use a toilet, you would not get the same level of co-operation.  I want it on the record that we are doing nothing as a country to support our front-line workers in that regard.  I thank Mr. Walsh for his engagement because it is not his primary responsibility.  TII is a stakeholder and I expect that there will be further engagement but my criticism is not aimed solely at Mr. Walsh.</p> <p>  I refer to what previous speakers have raised.  Mr. Walsh will have received a letter from the chair of the South East First Citizens' Forum regarding projects on the N24 and N25.  It appears that the next phase of funding will not go ahead.  Is this correct?  </p></speech>

Should we not get funding up to 2025?  We might as well just flush that money down the toilet.  Would Mr. Walsh agree with that?</p></speech>

My experience of it is the N11.  In three years, environmental progress would dictate that we do new studies and all of those routes may be cast aside because of some new regulation or legislation.  This is what tends to happen.  We have spent &euro;5 million and what is required here is &euro;1.5 million to ensure that phase 2 of the N24 goes ahead and &euro;2 million to ensure that phase 4 of the N25 is completed.  It is completely counterproductive not to fund phases 2 and 4 of these respective projects when we have already invested &euro;5 million.  This is the region that is now supporting a 400% increase in traffic out of Rosslare Europort.  These are the connecting roads.  It does not seem as though due consideration has been given to this.</p></speech>

Due consideration was not given.  We are in the throes of Brexit.  We are now hearing that the Northern Ireland protocol is not going to be operated.  There has been a substantial increase in traffic on these routes from Rosslare Europort and yet these routes are being sidelined.  I do not understand the methodology.  These are primary routes to the development of what is now Ireland's busiest and most strategic port and yet they are being sidelined for the want of &euro;3.5 million.  It makes no sense.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that this is about value for money for the Exchequer, about road safety and about critical roads infrastructure to support an entire region, the south east, and it is &euro;3.5 million.  I think it is foolhardy, and I mean foolhardy, of TII to think that if it waits until 2025 to provide this funding, we will still be at &euro;3.5 million.  Would Mr. Walsh agree with that?</p></speech>

If there is a commitment to funding in 2022, it is to carry the project on to the next phase of development, which has a higher bill associated with it.  We are profiling to 2025, and the profile to 2025 will not allow us to progress to grand investigations, topographical surveys and the more expensive elements of the development.  These are the ones that would potentially have to be done again.  The expenditure that has been incurred to date on those two projects will be largely reusable.  Some stuff cannot be reused but some stuff can.  I appreciate the frustration.</p></speech>

It is the level of the lack of consideration for the public purse and value for money.  The reality is that Mr. Walsh just commented to one of my colleagues that the longer projects are delayed, the more they cost.  Whether we are talking about them being in construction phases or not, that is the reality.  We have seen it with the N11.  What we are calling climate greening is changing rapidly, and every day is a different day and every study is different.  There are many incidents of having to undergo new environmental studies which are putting down routes we have already determined as being available.  They are no longer available because there is a snail or a bird or just a new environmental study to be carried out.  We are just flushing money down the toilet.</p> <p>  I come to the roads budget.</p></speech>

From a safety point of view, there are two programmes of work.  One is reactive and the other is proactive.  As for the reactive one, we take all the accident statistics and analyse them, identifying accident clusters and then reporting those back to the local authorities for them to comment as to whether an engineering intervention is an appropriate way of responding to that particular circumstance or whatever other comment they wish to make on it.  That informs our safety programme, and that could then end up in either a minor improvement, which could be a realignment of the road or a much lower level intervention or a widening of sight lines or whatever the issue might be.  That is one programme of work.</p> <p>  The second is a proactive one, whereby we undertake an investigation.  We inspect the routes and pick up what we think might be hazardous circumstances, which then make their way into a programme of works.  The structural or operational performance of the network is something Mr. Maher and his people in network management survey continually.  That is largely done by machines.  A vehicle drives the road and picks up everything from cracking to deflection to surface deformation and so on.  Those are all indicative characteristics of pavement in distress and warranting intervention.</p></speech>

As for the breakdown for minor works projects, what I am trying to understand is, out of that &euro;405 million that was allocated in 2020, how much was accounted for by minor works, how much was to address bottlenecks and how much was to address safety concerns?  It is important we understand this.  Is that &euro;405 million separate from what is currently being allocated to NDP projects or is it part of the whole pot?</p></speech>

My colleague Mr. O'Neill might be in a position to elaborate on the numbers, but basically they break down in the following way, and probably the easiest way to see this is in our annual plan and budget.  The protection and renewal money is identified, and that includes minor projects because it is part of the safety programme.  The new roads money for significant interventions, that is, major schemes, is a separately identified number.  Would the Deputy like us to give him those numbers now?</p></speech>

One project on the N84 bypass in Ballinrobe has stalled for the past number of years due to issues around getting allocated funding through TII and the selection of a preferred route.  In order to get that project up and running - it is now back at phase zero - it needs to get to a stage where they can allocate resources and get early planning in place as well as going for the existing plan.  How does TII support local authorities in getting past phase zero and getting the project up and running?</p></speech>

It is staffed by Mayo County Council personnel and they take projects through the various phases.  Our regional manager and regional inspector meet with them on a monthly basis.  Projects that can be brought forward within the capacity of the office are identified and brought forward.  Westport-Turlough was a major scheme that required a significant level of resource commitment and there is only so much an office can take on.  We got that project up and running thankfully.  The N59 from Westport to Mulranny project has been on the books for quite some time.  They successfully got planning for that.  We have been delivering that under a series of minor projects.  I think we are now on our fourth one with them.  Again, that is a significant requirement.  We have Cloongullane bridge on the N26.  We are aware of projects of that nature.  We want to bring them forward.  Some have more of an imperative.  The Westport-Turlough project was definitely one that was part of the NDP and needed to be delivered as quickly as possible and that requires a lot of resources.  There is only so much they can do in the office and that is part of the issue.</p></speech>

We are entirely dependent on buses for public transport.  Therefore, these projects are keenly awaited.  Last October, reports emerged that the Government was to make a strategic decision to delay the construction of the metro for ten years.  That subsequently proved not to be true.  It emerged there were delays in the metro project and it has been quite difficult for public representatives to get to the bottom of that.  What are those delays and what are the reasons for them?  I will concentrate on that.  Will Mr. Walsh outline how much has been spent on the metro project to date?</p></speech>

How long it takes through the planning process is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the challenges there.

We could then commence the procurement process.  The procurement process would take at least two years.  We are suggesting that an element of the project could be in a public private partnership, PPP.  In our experience of PPPs is that they have quite a long procurement period because there is a lot of due diligence and it is a complicated contract.  It is important to get that right.  One would want to be thinking in terms of two or two and half years for procurement.  To commission and construct the project then would take between eight and nine years.</p></speech>

With an optimistic version, we are talking about 2024 to come out of planning and 2026 to 2027 to come out of procurement.  It would then take another nine years, at most, so we are talking about 2035 for an operational date.  Is that a ballpark date given that it could also be longer if there is a judicial review?</p></speech>

The Government has not made a decision to delay this project by ten years but it looks like it will be delayed by ten years.  This comes to the very core of these projects.  Across north Dublin people have completely lost faith in the metro north project.  The reason is that this saga has been going on for 20 years.  The decision is out of the hands of TII because it was delayed in 2012 when a decision made, which I imagine added costs to the project.  There was the route alignment, which I would love to investigate further with Mr. Walsh.  I imagine increased costs arose as a result of representations made by me and many other people about that route.  I would also say they arose because an unresearched proposal was made to locate a station on St. Mobhi Road.  All of that said, and for all of those good reasons, the people of north Dublin are facing a situation where at best we are talking about 2035 for the delivery of a project that the Government is willing to fully fund now.  Does Mr. Walsh accept that people are frustrated about this and have lost faith in this project?  They will then lose faith in all of the other good projects that TII may deliver in our area, for example, a Luas line, which I believe will have a much faster track, but nobody believes that.</p></speech>

The approach we have taken and put in the business case that is with the Government, in terms of, say, cost forecasting around it, is as comprehensive as we can bring to it.  We engaged in a reference class forecasting exercise for the project, engaging with Oxford Global Projects, to give the Government the best understanding of what the cost forecast might be.  We have engaged with the construction methodology to the extent of having a good understanding of that construction period.  People are entering this with their eyes open.</p></speech>

Now we have a timeline of at least eight years after that.  Effectively, this is a doubling of the duration of the project.  I do not see from the significant information Mr. Walsh has given me anything to indicate this information was not available when TII published the timeline in 2018.  Therefore, we compound the disappointment again by having a timeline that was not realistic in the first place.</p></speech>

It is only then that he would realise just how awful a stretch of road it is.  It is arguably one of the worst national secondary routes in the country.  Be that as it may, I welcome that there is an allocation in respect of Annakisha South, Clogher Cross and Waterdyke.  I am disappointed, however, that the parcel for 2022 is only &euro;900,000.  I am seeking reassurances that a notification will be sent by TII to Cork County Council to give formal notice that Cork County Council can move to go to tender on that project.

If Cork County Council gets stuck in the gap, having spent &euro;900,000, but cannot go to tender, it cannot proceed to spend up to the figure of &euro;10 million.  I am seeking a commitment that following 2022, we will see the tender issued, boots on the ground, a shovel-ready project and that TII is proceeding with the commitment.  That is what I am seeking here.</p></speech>

As I explained to Deputy O'Connor earlier, the reason we hesitated, or did not give approval in the third quarter of last year, was to have certainty around the funding.  We have that now.  For that reason, we will be approving Cork County Council to go to tender, and it can rest assured that we will be with it as partners in the delivery of the project.  Once we are committed to it, we are committed to it.</p></speech>

He could not be any clearer than that, which I appreciate.  That gives us great hope.</p> <p>  I refer again to the N73 and other such projects.  Has TII given consideration to the budget line for major schemes in relation to County Cork?  For instance, the Ballyvourney to Macroom project is coming in this year at approximately &euro;60 million, or &euro;61 million if one wants to round it up.</p><p>The perception held by people like me is that the effect of all of the moneys going into the Dunkettles and Macroom bypasses of this world, which are the subject of national priority, is to suck the marrow out of the bone for other smaller projects.  I acknowledge that they are smaller roads and lesser priorities, but this means that people like me are fighting on our backs for projects that are in abeyance for five, ten, 15 or 20 years.  Is it not incongruous that, if a road is a national priority under a national development plan and so on and it is politically prioritised at Government level, it should have a negative bearing on a local authority's ability, in partnership with TII, to deliver on national secondary routes, tertiary routes and so forth?  Does Mr. Walsh believe that there should be a rebalancing of priorities so that Exchequer funding for national secondary routes, which are usually the main routes serving counties, do not get caught up in a Samson versus Goliath struggle where, for example, the N73 is completing with the Macroom bypass?</p></speech>

It will provide a safe and efficient network element that bypasses Ballyvourney and Macroom.  It was necessary to deliver the project that is being constructed; there was no alternative.  A lesser intervention would not have performed the functions and met the objectives required.  It is expensive.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made mention of the efficacy of relief roads.  I hail from the great town of Mallow.  There is a budget allocation of &euro;900,000 for the Mallow relief road, which is welcome and we are delighted.  It has been a long-running campaign, as has the N73 campaign.  These are decades-old campaigns.  What will the &euro;900,000 that TII has allocated for the Mallow relief road get us?  Once spent, will it buy a further commitment that the relief road will actually be delivered?  This is a bit like my N73.</p></speech>

My colleague Mr. O'Neill could provide more detail if required.  The notion that major projects are in some way taking from the minor ones is something that the Department is addressing to a certain extent, in that protection and renewal work is a classification of funding that is protected as of this year's allocations.  It is the first time we have come to this level of designation.   Bearing in mind that the Department has determined that there should be a specific amount for protection and renewal and a specific amount for new roads, the split in the funding we are receiving for the years 2021 to 2025 is 54% for protection and renewal, including minor interventions, and 46% for new roads.  The significant increase in funding in the second half of the national development plan will change the balance to 29% versus 71%.</p> <p>  This approach can be interpreted as protecting the protection and renewal money, including for minor interventions.  If there is anxiety that new roads are in some way drawing away from those interventions, let me say that we do not swap between pots.  Where we have an annual allocation under the protection and renewal element, we make every effort to ensure that those moneys are spent within that classification and do not go to subvent expenditure on major projects.  We budget for the major projects elsewhere.</p></speech>

First, I have looked up the figure in respect of metro north that was provided by the NTA under a freedom of information request.  The figure is &euro;165.6 million in addition to the &euro;83 million that TII has spent.  I wanted to put these figures on the record.  We are at nearly &euro;250 million.  There have been political changes and commitments have changed, but we must at some point take a meaningful look at this entire project from beginning to end and see what lessons we can learn.  I am unsure as to how much of the &euro;165.6 million can be carried forward into the project.  I am sure that some can, but if there is waste, we will not have learned lessons.</p> <p>  One local authority area in one part of the country - Fingal - doubled its population between 1996 and 2016.  We have not undertaken a more recent census.  In terms of climate change, it is difficult to see how TII can deliver on some of the transport obligations in a part of the country that is expanding so rapidly.</p> <p>  I am just making a point about the metro project.  Some of it predates the establishment of TII-----</p></speech>

I imagine there are people around the country who are not familiar with that part of Dublin who believe that the project has been partly delivered already and the almost &euro;250 million is just some sort of augmentation, but it is being spent without a single shovel having gone into the ground.  At some point, it would be worthwhile to examine this matter in a little more detail to see where we can learn some lessons.</p> <p>  Regarding tolls, it is what TII does not say that sometimes raises questions.  Mr. Walsh mentioned that revenue from tolls was &euro;56 million less than originally forecast and that this was "managed to ensure that all activities were kept going and fully funded."  The word "managed" jumped out at me.  What does it mean for the taxpayer?  Mr. Walsh also mentioned that, of TII's eight toll concession PPP contracts, "the traffic risk has been fully transferred to the PPP company".  How does one align with the other?  Do we retain an obligation in respect of any of the toll roads, tunnels or bridges to compensate for a shortfall in the traffic volumes forecasted?</p></speech>

That seven-week shutdown produced a reduction in the projected expenditure on those 20 sites.  We changed allocations and moved them around - we could do 2,000 changes of allocations in the past six weeks, or the latter part of last year - to ensure we would avail of the funding and keep the projects moving that were moving.  We were lucky, in a way, that the CIF made huge efforts to put in place operating procedures the Government regarded as suitable for suppressing the transmission of Covid-19 and they were able to get up and running again after seven weeks, on 18 May.  As such, they nearly balanced each other out-----</p></speech>

In 2019, the value that was payable on those schemes was &euro;3.9 million excluding VAT, while in 2020, it moved from &euro;3.9 million to &euro;13.2 million excluding VAT.  That was, obviously, linked to the decline in traffic during the pandemic.  In 2021, although we have not finalised the accounts, we expect the figure to be in the region of &euro;10.4 million, which would reflect some recovery in the traffic in 2021 versus 2020.  There is-----</p></speech>

Apart from anything else, it is completely at odds with our climate obligations.  It is a very sizeable sum.  The figure of &euro;3.9 million is effectively the baseline, while the figure for 2020 is almost &euro;10 million higher and for 2021, over &euro;6 million higher.  That is what the taxpayer will have paid in compensation for those two years.</p> <p>  On value for money, I am sure we will all raise examples with which we are familiar.  I refer to the M7 project and the widening of that road.  In addition, there was the Sallins bypass, which was built in tandem with the M7.  Kildare is the gateway to the west and the south, and I imagine there is more motorway in Kildare than in any other county.  Certainly, there are very high traffic volumes.  Those roads are Kildare local roads as well as being national primary roads.  The Sallins bypass was originally expected to cost &euro;61.7 million and it came in at &euro;85.5 million, an increase of about 39% in what was forecast.  There was a contractor dispute, there were design amendments and there was Covid, although that was only for part of it because the road was already largely in place.  The road that was delivered has no public lighting and has only part of a cycleway and a footpath.  Is TII satisfied that what is being delivered for that money is satisfactory in that context?  I accept this went to conciliation, but can the witnesses give a view on whether they believe that was value for money?  It is a significant overrun.</p></speech>

The part of that contract that was TII's responsibility was the M7 element.  I will have to hand over to the Department to take questions about the Sallins bypass because we worked together to have a single contract and delivered both projects under the same contract.  We worked together to deliver it, but the Sallins road element is non-national and, as such, I should not comment on it.</p></speech>

A lot of difficulties were encountered on site.  I do not really want to start talking about the contractor or who might be to blame for the difficulties.

There is a lot of pressure to take the lowest price.  That is a major factor in any contract.  TII has examined the issue of trying to take a median price and I think it has that in two contracts.  The outcomes from those two contracts will be very useful in determining whether that is a better approach for the future.</p></speech>

I do not intend to go over some of the questions that have already been asked.  I agree with the comments Deputy McAuliffe made about the perception of delays in the MetroLink project and what that means for its delivery.  I remember a lot of publicity about the Metro green line.  I also remember going to various public consultations.  Can our guests tell us how much has been spent to date on that public consultation?  How detailed were the plans in the end?</p></speech>

On the question of how detailed the plans were, we had to look at the impact of the construction on the existing green line because it is a valuable piece of infrastructure that carries an awful lot of people.  We needed to identify the length of time it would be disrupted and the mechanism by which we could facilitate the onward journey of passengers.  Such a project would be done in pieces and people would have to be bussed around.  The detail of that had to be worked out and it was through that process that we were able to be definitive about the level of risk we were bringing.  There was also the fact that we were going to an automated system.  In the original thinking, the use of line-of-sight vehicles, similar to the Luas, was envisaged.  The efficiency and appropriateness of the automated system then changed that.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh might come back to us with a note on that.  I would like to know the cost expended in recent years on that particular proposal.  Is there a timeframe for the extension of the existing green line Luas to Fassaroe or Shankill  We know the line will run south although we are unsure of where it will ultimately go.  Is there a timeframe for when that will be decided and constructed?</p></speech>

There are passenger figures for the Luas on the TII website for 2004 to 2014 but the figures have not been updated since.  Our guests might send the committee a note on that point because I would be interested about the capacity of the Luas and the numbers of passengers as we exit the pandemic compared to the numbers pre-pandemic.  Some people may have got used to trams being less packed.  We need to ensure we have the correct capacity.  The passenger numbers would help so Mr. Walsh might send those on.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions about the national road network.  Mr. Walsh mentioned motorway service areas.  I note the M1, M6, M9 and M11 are included.  There are 25-year leases or contracts associated with those.  As I understand it, they will come back to Transport Infrastructure Ireland and will be subcontracted out again.  What plans are there for further service stations or service areas along the motorway network?</p></speech>

We have a motorway service area policy in development.  The original thinking was that private enterprise would provide those services.  It did not materialise and it was felt necessary that the State should intervene.  That is where our current six come from.  There have been significantly increased levels of provision from private enterprise and if that continues and is meeting the need, we have no intention of competing with it.  A number of possibilities have been looked at.  It would be a matter for our board and for the Department to identify what progresses.</p></speech>

I would argue there are gaps in the network which is a cause of concern for people who travel.  In the same vein, there are issues around charging points for electric vehicles.  These all feed into a common and recurring theme, which is that people need those service areas.</p> <p>  I have another question about rest stops and lay-bys, which came to me via a constituent.  I ask our guests to review the safety of those lay-bys.  That is a concern, particularly from a female perspective.  The complaint made by my constituent was that she would not use lay-bys, even if she had to, because they are isolated and dark.  There is no lighting, public toilet facilities or even something as practical as a tyre pump.  Nothing is provided in those lay-bys and I ask our guests to review that as a matter of urgency.  A landline telephone would also be useful.  I am talking about the practical necessities for people who might be travelling on their own, who may be vulnerable and need those lay-bys.  They are well placed but there is nothing in them.  We need to examine that.</p> <p>  I note that fines and evasions of the M50 tolls are mentioned in the report.  I thank our guest for that documentation.  How many evasions or non-payments of tolls have there been for the M50, in particular, over the past three or four years?  Do our guests have those figures to hand?</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh advised that the risk related to toll income or road volume as well as construction costs that had been removed from the State and placed within those companies.

On the former CEO's salary, it was &euro;183,000 in 2019.

Is that correct?</p></speech>

I can clarify that when Michael Nolan retired, his closing salary would have been &euro;186,000, <i>pro rata</i>, year-on-year.  The &euro;183,000 would have increased by the 2% public sector pay rise that happened in the interim.  Mr. Nolan was CEO up to 30 September.  Given that we had gone through Covid, we had received approval for an extension to his contract.  He was due to retire on 31 July but to give us time to have a replacement CEO and a short handover period, we were granted a six-month extension for Mr. Nolan.  It ended up lasting three and a half months.  Therefore, the figure of &euro;194,000 for Mr. Nolan that was disclosed in 2020, which is the correct figure as approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General, would be the <i>pro rata</i>base of &euro;186,000 salary for the year, along with a six-week additional payment for his term after Mr. Walsh took over as CEO and holiday pay in addition to that.  In the year under review, the Covid pandemic meant he was not able to take leave until we had a new CEO in place so we made a holiday payment to him for annual leave approved.</p></speech>

He finished his term as CEO on 30 September but he continued in employment until mid-November.  Therefore, he still had leave accruals up to that date.  He would have entered the year with some holiday leave carried forward - I do not have that figure to hand - and then he would have accrued leave for the year under review in addition to that.</p></speech>

I should start by saying, with no disrespect to our witnesses, but between TII, the National Transport Authority, NTA, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, even I find it hard to keep track of what the plans are.  It is very useful when groups like the Dublin Commuter Coalition engage in the way they have on the detail of these plans.  My understanding is that TII had originally planned a walking and cycling infrastructure route along much of the new Finglas route but that the NTA have asked that much of the Luas side walking and cycling infrastructure be removed from the plans.  Is that a fair assessment and summary of what has happened?</p></speech>

The co-ordination of the provision of cycling infrastructure within our project, the Luas extension to Finglas, with that cycling strategy is something that we will do and have done.  That has resulted in a change in the amount of cycling and walking provision in the Luas Finglas project.  It reflects the completion of the NTA's cycle and walking strategy for the greater Dublin area and we will comply with that.</p></speech>

In fairness, the Chair is pulling me up on getting into policy.  I have the maps here, Chairman.  This is not necessarily about policy.  This is a very direct route and I would describe the 2013 plan as a network or warren of routes.  As we are discussing a great deal about female use of public transport and of active travel, a direct well-lit route on a public transport avenue is completely different to a warren of back streets and cycle lanes.  I would be very interested to know if any of the organisations involved costed the impact of building all of the infrastructure in one go versus having it built in pieces by various organisations?  Has anyone done that work?  Has there been a decision where this provision has been taken out of their very direct route.  I am wondering, therefore, if there has been a cost-benefit analysis of this choice in doing it in one go along a direct route or doing this network, much of which has not been built.</p></speech>

When many of the public private partnership agreements were put in place in recent years, interest rates were far higher.  Given that money is cheaper now, is there any provision in those agreements to look at those costs as part of the overall agreement?  We also need to look into this issue for future agreements.  For example, in 2008 and 2010, the cost of borrowing was extremely high and it is now a much lower figure.  Regarding the cost of projects, obviously the public private partnerships would now be paying out a return on the investment.  Is that taken into account?  Is there any process to review that cost as an overall part of the agreement?</p></speech>

What I can say is that in general there are mechanisms within the contract for refinancing the project.  The refinancing benefit is shared with the State through the provisions of the contract.  For the details on that, I will hand over to Mr. Masterson.</p></speech>

In that case, where the PPP company believes it can access a better value funding package for the remaining term of the contract, it may seek to do that.  As the contracting party, we are entitled to a share of any of the benefit it gets from that, what might simply be called a remortgage.  That is a provision within all the contracts.</p></speech>

The counterparties would not be keen for the contracting authority to have that type of power or mechanism.  If we were to try to insist on something like that, we would find they would price that into their proposals back to us.  I do not think, from our experience anyway, that that would have worked very well in our favour.</p></speech>

The route for the Ringaskiddy bypass was announced in 2014 and we are now eight years on.  I know many of the delays were outside TII's control.  Are there lessons to be learned on the planning processes and the entitlement to judicial review?  I accept people have a constitutional right to judicial review.  Does Mr. Walsh believe there can be a better way than the current process?</p> <p>  For instance, on the Cork to Limerick road, I recently spoke to someone in the office in Limerick.  Once the route is announced, there will be a full consultation of about 12 to 18 months to engage with individuals and organisations along the route.  Once the route is signed off on, there is a further process, the planning process.  If someone decides they are not happy with the planning process there is the judicial review process.  Does Mr. Walsh believe we could do a better job in the way we are progressing projects?  After eight years no real work has been done on the Ringaskiddy bypass.</p></speech>

It is pretty much the same project management process we have used since 2000.  We were getting projects through and constructed in a five-year period at times then; it is now taking significantly longer.  The Cork to Ringaskiddy project was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2017.  There was a result in 2018 and it took until March 2021 for that approval to be finally free of the court system.</p><p>We suggested in a submission to the NDP that properly resourcing the courts might be one aspect of it.  There is definitely a constraint there.  I would not for a moment suggest we should be curtailing people's rights to challenge processes but the burden on the courts seems to be quite significant and seems to take quite a long time to get through.  I can only assume that is a constraint of resources but I do not know for sure.</p></speech>

As it takes up quite a bit of time before all the documentation from each side is put together, that must be taken into account.  I am in no way saying anyone who wants to take a judicial review should be restricted.  It is a constitutional right.  However, it is about the whole process.  From the time the route was decided, which I think was November 2014, it took seven years, as Mr. Walsh said it was signed off on in 2021.  Surely we are able to put something in place?  For instance, it was 2017 before it went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Why could that not have been done at an earlier stage?</p></speech>

That was a quick turnaround by Cork County Council.  I would not suggest that could have been done any more quickly.  That is a very complicated scheme.  You were going through many properties and there was an awful lot of detail to be worked out.  I think the council performed very well there.  It would compare with any of the projects.  I should point out there was never any fault found with the project.  It is not as if the challenges resulted in any changes.  However, the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2018 to approve the project went through a process of challenge that took until March 2021, so no progress could be made during that period.</p></speech>

Take the Cork-Limerick road for instance.  A decision was taken to not proceed with it.  Then, when it was decided to proceed with it, it appears as though we started with a clean sheet and went through the whole process all over again.  Is there a mechanism for dealing with that?  If a project is parked, why must we start with a clean sheet if we go back to it two or three years later, as if there had been no work of any description done?  I ask that with particular reference to the Cork-Limerick route.</p></speech>

It was a different process.  It was a multimodal process.  We had to look at public transport, as well the road options, or I should say Limerick City and County Council had to.  These directives and the requirements for investigations are there for very good reasons.  I would be reluctant to suggest we could skip any of those.</p></speech>

Members should indicate if they want to come in for the second round of questions.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for Mr. Walsh myself.  On the eight major road projects scheduled for this year being delayed, why would there be insufficient funding?  What has happened to the funding for them?  Has it been transferred to other areas such as greenways, blueways, cycleways and active travel?</p></speech>

When Building on Recovery was announced in 2015 the Department of Transport gave us a multi-annual programme and a multi-annual funding profile and we developed all the projects in accordance with that.  There was then a mid-term review of that and there was a profile of funding.  In the original one, it was funding until 2022.</p></speech>

I have limited time, several questions and a few members who want to come back in for the second round.  On the eight projects, I understand the competition and the logic for why we need greenways, cycleways, blueways and all that but I am asking whether the provision of active travel impacted on some of those falling back.  It is a "Yes" or "No" question.</p></speech>

However, there has been a substantial shift in funding with a greater emphasis being put on active travel.  I get that but there is a balance as well because we must get goods to and from ports, people have to get to work and there are long distances as well.</p> <p>  I raise the N80 bypass at Mountmellick.  By the way, the Maidenhead work is complete.  That was a good job.  That was going on for a long time.  On Mountmellick, two routes were proposed back in the 2000s.  One was a very long one that started back way out in Derrycloney and went a long way cross-country.  It was too long.  Then there was a very short one that came in over the bridge into Irishtown in Mountmellick.  However, it cut across through the car park of a restaurant and a business.  It was not good.  It had a right-angle junction on it.  That was too short.  TII has come up with another route which is better.  This is what I wanted to ask about.  The feasibility studies have been done and I am concerned there may be a move away from providing those relief roads.  This relief road shortens the journey distance and the journey time.  It is not getting traction in the sense of getting the priority it needs.  Mountmellick itself is congested with trucks.  There is a junction at Glanbia with Pearse Street where the road comes into the centre of town.  There are trucks trying to manoeuvre around that from both directions.  It is very difficult.  They are travelling up and down narrow streets.  It is a very difficult situation.</p> <p>  I refer to Rosslare Europort and Brexit, which Deputy Verona Murphy obviously will have a special interest in.  Instead of a lot of west of Ireland and midlands freight going to Dublin, it is now travelling down the N80 through Mountmellick and on to Rosslare.  I live further down on the N80 and have no complaints about that.  Does Mr. Walsh believe that now needs greater priority in terms of ramping up the need for that because this will go on forever?  The feasibility study will be out of date and so will the preferred route.  There is talk of a second bypass linking the road over to the Portarlington and Emo road.  That is important within the greater scheme of things but it is the N80 project that is really the big deal for shortening journeys and getting traffic, especially HGVs, out of the town centre.  Would Mr. Walsh see this as a major priority when it comes to carbon reduction and also trying to deal with the impact of Brexit and the greater importance Rosslare Europort now has?  That is my question.</p></speech>

There a number of national secondary routes we recognise as being of particular importance.  The N52 and N80 are two of them.  The transfer of traffic to Rosslare Europort from Dublin is real.  That said, the proportions are small.  Rosslare is tiny by comparison with Dublin but it is happening nonetheless.  The town centre first policy which will, I believe, issue soon will create a policy context we will have to respond to.  We have the feasibility report on what we might call the Goldilocks route that seems to be meeting a number of needs.  It is certainly one we will be looking at in the context of those considerations.</p></speech>

I do not want to be too local because it is local details I am talking about.  Mr. Walsh might come back to me with a little bit more information.  I know exactly where it is at because I have got his replies before.  What is the cost for that type of inner relief road in Mountmellick where there is a bridge?</p></speech>

The TII might wrap up the project because there is huge local concern about it.  Also, the commercial status of the centre of the town of Mountmellick is not good.  If we got the HGVs out of the centre, we might get more people walking and cycling in Mountmellick and get more businesses going because there would be more footfall on the street itself.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh mentioned that PPPs reduce risk for the public purse, which is good.  He mentioned the two areas of construction risk and traffic risk.  I will deal with that briefly.  On the construction risk, let us say a 10 km or 20 km route must be built and has difficulties similar to what the TII had near Limerick, where the road had to go through a bog, or the tricky territory on the N7 and N8, a construction company would have a fair idea of the implications before submitting a price.  Mr. Walsh mentioned weather as well.  A lot of these roads were built before climate change became a major factor.  I am not convinced of that argument.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh also mentioned the issue of traffic risk.  My understanding is that, for many of those roads, there is a built-in provision, what I think is called a varied operational payment.  I have read the advance briefing notes from cover to cover to get to the bottom of this issue.  There is a built-in mechanism where traffic volumes fall, for example, because of Covid in 2020.  Am I correct in saying in respect of the N7-N8 Kildare-Laois bypass that there is provision for a variable payment clause if traffic volumes drop below a certain point?</p></speech>

With the exception of Covid, which we hope is a once in a 100 year event, there has not been any reduction and it is unlikely there will be because we are moving freight and goods along those routes.  Is if fair to say the risk been talked up a bit too much in terms of construction risk and traffic risk?</p></speech>

The New Ross bypass was more than a year late in construction from the programme the contractor had originally presented and worked to, or tried to.  It had various difficulties but it bore all of that cost.  Until such time as that road was finished, the taxpayer paid nothing.  So the availability of the road was key and it was up to the contractor to manage that, and it did.</p> <p>  I know from our own experience of design-build and in terms of the alternatives, we have gone through various contract forms.  We would have had the third edition of the IEI contract first, and there were various clauses there for the claiming of additional costs associated with ground conditions, adverse weather and so on.  We had FIDIC, which is an internationally recognised contract type that had areas of allowable risk, areas where the risk fell back on the employer - the State.  Those claims were pursued in each case.  We always pursued a policy of lowest price tendering so the lowest price won the contract.  For that reason they have to price it optimistically.  Even under the current public works contract there is a schedule K of compensation events, which if any of those events occur, the contractor is entitled to payment.

I am concerned about what I heard about taking the lowest tender and whether we are properly evaluating that.  I think that is something we are going to have to look at.</p> <p>  Regarding a project where we do not have the kind of expertise we have with roads, namely, the metro, will the TII give details on the expertise it has in-house that can evaluate these projects rather than outsource them?  Without that expertise, how can the TII properly evaluate what projects come to it, or does the agency have the expertise?</p></speech>

We have identified 18 posts within the structure of the client organisation.  Let us refer to TII as the organisation that will be delivering the project.  We have identified 18 posts, following advice that we got from Sydney, London and other metro operators.  These positions should be State employees whose first loyalty is to the State and who will help us build up the rest of the client organisation.

Dublin Bus, for example, has a scheme, a community initiative to which overpayments go.  This is not legitimate revenue, really.  I have received replies indicating that this is happening and the toll operators are putting this money into their own revenue.  Will the TII structure into future contracts that this revenue is not retained?  This is quantifiable and it is over the amount that is legitimately expected.  We fund two organisations operating tolls in Limerick and on the M3 where the forecast is for less.  It seems odd that they can collect more and that there are no consequences for that.</p></speech>

Customers can get refunds but I accept what the Deputy says - there are still overpayments.  We provided detail on that.  To be fair to the companies, they engage in local activities and charity activities but I do not have information to hand.  I would not like to characterise all PPP companies as negative in that respect.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  We can look at that in our own activities too.  However, if someone overpays and carries on, it can be hard to make that refund.  Refunds are available to customers who want them.</p></speech>

It was cut back from 2008 onwards.  We were getting &euro;18 million in 2008 but that was cut back to &euro;12 million and then to &euro;9 million.  Now, we are back up to &euro;18 million.  However, in the interim, a deficit of &euro;68.9 million has been accrued.</p></speech>

It is not as if we have a county allocation or anything of that nature, whereby the budget used to be X and now we have to get back up to it.

When that project was announced, I thought it would cause chaos.  I was not long elected at the time.  A commitment was given on day one that six lanes of traffic would be kept open, except  at night-time when that would be reduced to one or two lanes.  I acknowledge that work was difficult to do during busy daytime hours when six lanes were kept open.  That was impressive.</p> <p>  Moving a little bit further south to the Naas bypass, I am one of those who has been around long enough to remember sitting in a car in Naas for an hour and a half while travelling in either direction.  When the bypass was built I was struck by the two-lane carriageway to funnel traffic to Dublin from four cities, namely, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork and Limerick.  From day one, the road became a bottleneck and it was then retrofitted.  I suffered as a result of that retrofit.  I remarked to somebody earlier that I spent three hours and 50 minutes travelling to the Houses one day.  I arrived here at 1.50 p.m. after leaving my office in Portlaoise at approximately 10 o'clock.  The road is now much better but from day one it was clear there was going to be a problem.  Within a matter of weeks of its opening, traffic was congested.  It was better than going through Naas but it was still a problem.  How much did the additional lane cost in the retrofit?</p></speech>

It means taking them out of use.  Contractors try to work around it by using middle aisles and all that sort of stuff.  I thought this was a terrible gap in the planning at the time.  While the bypass solved the problem by getting the traffic out of Naas town, which was good, there was another problem in the making.  Could Mr. Walsh come back to me with that figure?</p></speech>

What did it cost at the time and what would it have cost to provide an extra lane?  The bridges were left wide enough, thank God, so space was left to do it.  From the point of view of cost-benefit at the time, it would have been a hell of a lot better if three lanes had been provided in both directions from day one.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that magical work was done to keep traffic moving through Newlands Cross.  The minute people heard that project was going to happen, they were in dread of it, including the 12,000 commuters from my county.  Many people acknowledged it so I pass that on.</p></speech>

How much of that would be in respect of fees for examinations?  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced earlier that the fees will be waived this year.  The questions most people have are how the hell did we ever charge people to sit the leaving certificate in the first place and what happens if somebody cannot afford the fees?  Could Mr. McCarthy give us an indication of how much that would be?  What would the shortfall be if the decision to waive were made permanent?</p></speech>

The overall turnover was down by approximately &euro;40 million on the prior year because of Covid-19 and the suspension of examinations.

Moving to correspondence, as previously agreed, items not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in respect of correspondence are recorded in the minutes of our meetings and published on the web page.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee.</p> <p>  No. 1017B is correspondence from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice, dated 20 January 2022.  It provides further information requested by the committee in respect of non-compliant procurement in the Irish Prison Service.  The Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for the Department and the Prison Service.  The initial response we received, No. R0932, contained very little detail on the reasons for the non-compliance and this is a more thorough response.  It is proposed to note and flag the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It has been flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

It seems that some of these are fairly regular items.  How far in advance does the Prison Service look at cleaning services, for example?  If it has a three-year contract, does it look at it in year two and work out when it needs to do a tender or that kind of thing?  If it does not do so, that is where difficulty arises in the context of procurement.  It would be worth going back to the Secretary General to ask what the processes are for predictable contracts that are due to expire.</p></speech>

There are things that are known.  For example, if there is a contract with a company, the length of the contract is known.  What is the process in advance of the review such that there is time to include a tendering process?</p></speech>

Once there is a procurement in place, there is a need to be planning for the next one for the same service.  Three years is a very short period in that regard.  That is where mistakes get made.  The difficulty is that a tendering process is a very elongated process in itself.  If one makes a mistake at some point and has to go back to the start, that is when one ends up having to extend contracts or roll them over.</p></speech>

The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, was established to try to short-circuit some of that so that not everybody had to start from the very beginning.  Having framework contracts, it should be a shorter period, but sometimes there is not a framework in place when one wants a particular service.  Members will see the explanations that are given.  An explanation often put forward is that there was not an OGP framework in place, so a contract was extended for six months or a year to await the contract being put in place.  It is very complex and a challenge, but it has to be approached professionally.</p></speech>

It is in response to our request for quarterly updates on the investigation of the employment status of workers engaged by RT&Eacute;.  The Secretary General outlines the information provided to the committee to date and how the investigation will proceed, but states that the Department does not normally comment publicly on the status of any individual claim or investigation.  This is to respect confidentiality and data protection obligations and to protect the integrity of the decision-making process. The Secretary General also raises concerns that "any public comment on specific cases could lead to any decision being challenged or could undermine the sustainability of any decision that may be appealed".  However, he does offer to provide the committee with an update on completion of the investigation later this year or early in 2023.  It is proposed to note and publish the item and to accept the offer of a further update on completion of the investigation.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

We know a substantial payment has been made to Revenue and that there will be claims from individuals involved, albeit RT&Eacute; has not confirmed it will resolve those issues.  We know the Department is carrying out this work.  The point I am making is that this is different from other cases.  It is not the same as the Department carrying out an examination of a private individual, or even a private company, because at the end of the day it is essentially the public who will be expected to meet whatever the shortfall is.  My concern is the timeframe that is given at the end.  There is reference to completion of the investigation later this year or early in 2023.  I fear we are into how long is a piece of string territory there.  In general, when we get vague timeframes such as that, it means these things roll on even longer.  I propose the committee write again to the Department.  We can take it from this letter that it will not give us quarterly updates on the investigation.  We should ask it to provide us with the step-by-step process of the investigation or what elements the investigation will take up and a likely timeframe for each stage of the investigation so that we can have a sense of when the work will be completed and will be able to adjudicate at various points whether it is on track to meet the target date.</p></speech>

The letter states:</p> <blockquote> 	By way of background the Committee will be aware that the Department does not normally comment in public or at committee on the status of any individual claim or investigation - whether that be in respect of an individual's entitlement to a benefit, a fraud investigation or an employer inspection. </blockquote> <p>The committee never looked for the details of any individual or any particular worker.  The Secretary General states the Department has to respect confidentiality, and rightly so.  We agree with Mr. McKeon on that, but he seems to be mistaken in that I certainly do not want to see a worker-by-worker account of what is happening in this investigation.  I do welcome the fact that he goes on to state in the letter that:</p> <blockquote> 	I also advised that as all decisions of the inspectors will be retrospective in impact to the correct date without limitation as to time, all workers in respect of whom social insurance status might be modified will get the full benefit of that changed social insurance status notwithstanding that adherence to due process in the investigation may mean that it will take some time to reach any determination. </blockquote><p>I suppose, in fairness, they are going back a long way.  He goes on to state: "In addition, the Department will pursue recovery of any social welfare insurance contributions due for the full period where social welfare insurance status may have been misclassified."  I welcome that because we want it clarified how far this would go back, for example, three years or five years.  What the Department is saying here is there is no limitation.  Whatever they deem to be the correct time that the wrong classification started, they can go back to that.</p><p> I take on board the Deputy's point regarding a timeline.  It is a little vague.  We should look for something more definite, but there is obviously a big piece of work being done here.  Workers certainly will welcome that there is no limitation on how far they are going.  The committee should look for a more definitive timeline.</p><p> I would request as well with the agreement of the committee that we would point out to them - I do not know if any other member of the committee was looking for it but I thought the committee had reached a consensus - that we were not looking for any individual's details.  If I am wrong on that, I am open to correction.</p></speech>

It is confirming in writing what most of us probably knew.  It is welcome to have that.</p> <p>  The process is they will go through 500 individual employment files.  That is a piece of work they should be left to do but we should definitely put it on the work programme coming towards the end of the year to ask for an update about whether they will meet the target of having this concluded towards the end of this year or the beginning of next year.  That is probably as much as we are realistically likely to get that is additional.</p></speech>

We will ask for a more definitive timeline and also point out the committee's position regarding confidentiality.</p> <p>  No. 1021B from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General, Department of Justice, is dated 21 January 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee into reports of unofficial strike action by senior officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and its impact on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's, GSOC, investigations.  This was raised by members here.</p> <p>  The Secretary General states that while both GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are statutorily independent, the Department is engaging with stakeholders with a view to resolving the issue.  The Secretary General advises that the Labour Court has held a hearing on the matter and recommended further engagement between the bodies with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.</p> <p>  I remind members to bear in mind that this is a live dispute and it is important that we do not prejudice it.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.  Deputy Carthy had flagged this item.</p></speech>

The Department of Justice will come back and say these are independent bodies and at the same time indicate that it is engaging Garda management on the issues without specifying what "engaging" means - it is a broad term.</p> <p>  The WRC was scheduled to meet on 26 January.  Perhaps we could seek an update.  I do not know who we ask for the update - maybe the Chair can give us clarification on that - as to whether this issue was resolved.</p> <p>  The particular issue relates to the operation of GSOC.  From the correspondence we received, people make a complaint to GSOC, GSOC then "employs" - I use that term broadly as well - members of the Garda to carry out parts of the investigation and, in some cases, the commission has its own investigators.  It would be useful, because we have the commission coming before us in a number of weeks, to ask it for a breakdown of the complaints that it dealt with and the investigations that it carried out, for example, even last year, as to how many were carried out by the commissions internally and how many were carried out by members of the Garda at its request.  Clearly, in this instance, when there are senior garda&iacute; who have been refusing to engage with GSOC, it is having quite an impact on the delivery of GSOC's already poor timeframes for addressing investigations.</p></speech>

The next correspondence, which I mentioned earlier, is No. 1023 B from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 24 January 2022, providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department on 9 December 2021.  It provides information on: applications for disability allowance in 2020 and 2021; the public services card and MyGovID; and the extent of welfare fraud since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.  It has been flagged by Deputy Munster.</p></speech>

We will all be aware of the cumbersome process from our constituency offices.  My recollection of the hearing was that a fairly decent number were approved after additional information was sought.  The Department, given the volume of refusals, needs to look at updating its systems and not have it as cumbersome as it is.</p> <p>  Perhaps we should write to the Department to see if it is putting a plan in place to make the application process less cumbersome and more efficient.  The delays when people are applying for disability allowance that they are entitled to can go to six or eight months at times.  It would be no harm if we asked if the Department had a plan in place to reduce the number of applications that are required to go to appeal before they are even accepted and to speed up the process in general, even if it was only a further letter with the application if they made that available in the application form itself specifying all of the additional to be submitted with the form.  It is so cumbersome and so frustrating for people.  I just thought it might be an idea to write to the Department to see if it has such a plan in place or it is putting a plan in place for that.</p></speech>

One I saw recently had the same question asked a number of times.  Members of the public will be handed these application forms in an office or be sent them by the Department.  It is not that long ago that I remember most of those forms were two or three pages.  They are now looking at 24 to 26 pages.  While I understand the necessity, we might ask the Department, in the interests of efficiency and fairness, to try and make the form more concise.  There is good reason for many of the questions and it is important that the Department gets as full a picture as possible but people ask why are they are asked the same question, again and again, throughout the form.  They could be simplified for applicants.</p> <p>  Other government forms have been simplified.</p><p>Work was done with the National Adult Literacy Agency on putting them into plain English and removing jargon.  While that is welcome, further progress could be made on claim forms for disability and invalidity payments.  We will seek that.</p><p> No. 1025B, which is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General-----</p></speech>

Despite the number of people on jobseeker's allowance, the figure in this context is just over &euro;7 million for a whole year.  Obviously, fraud should not happen.  The figures in respect of the State pension and carer's allowance are &euro;1.5 million and just over &euro;1 million, respectively, and include overpayments.  People would be surprised to learn that fraud does not amount to hundreds of millions of euro.  It comes to approximately &euro;19 million across all schemes.

I am still trying to understand what the future of arts and antiquities storage will look like for the State.  We were given chapter and verse on the current regime in north County Dublin, but what I am failing to understand is where future-proofing is taking place, given the involvement of local authorities, local museums, national museums, national collections and so on.  Is there anything in the language of the letter that gives us, as per our questions, comfort in respect of the future-proofing of what I euphemistically call the national collection, be that arts and antiquities, statues or anything else?

I suspect that it will fall into the same category as Leinster House.  With an historical building, one cannot predict some of the issues that will arise.  The amount that is allowable for contingency is limited in every contract.  It may well be that there will be an underestimate with every historical building because something that has not been predicted will always be found.  Can we have a breakdown of the figures from the OPW?  It was a nice job and I am glad it is done.</p> <p>  I wish to make a point about the National Archives.</p><p>I am not sure where we are with the building for the National Archives.  There was to be a big new section at the back on Bishop Street.  A lot is held off site and some of it is held in Portlaoise.  It costs money to retrieve that and some of that will not be necessary because, if things are digitised, people are happy to take documents in that format.  If records are held in several different locations, it is not just the building they are going to be in in terms of retrieving them.  Sometimes they will have to be audited and retrieved from a distance away.  That is the same with the local authorities.  A lot of Kildare County Council's documents are stored in Cork and you have give notice to retrieve them.  I know there was a bigger project with Trinity College regarding a different approach to holding records.</p><p> It would be well worthwhile getting some updates from the Department regarding that because there are potential savings and efficiencies in digitising, where records are stored, how they are retrieved and whether we do it in a facility wholly owned by the State or rented in perpetuity.  There are probably other things relating to the future in terms of digital format, how we keep records and how people will be able to go back and look at things in years to come, because that will be a real challenge.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for holding this item over until this week.  I wanted to get a deeper understanding of how the service level agreements operate between nine Departments that are funders through the education silo of An Taisce.  When I looked at the 2019 accounts and the various circulars relating to the operation of the relationship between the line Departments and An Taisce, the correspondence coming back to us reflected a concern in respect of seeking clarification regarding the 2019 accounts.  An Taisce's 2019 financial statements stated that a change in An Taisce policy will result in a stipulation for a small allowance for organisational costs and innovation in all funding agreements going forward.  That set off an alarm bell in my mind because I was not sure whether some of the funding that is specifically for programmes that are well notified to us, such as the Green Flag, Investigate Forests, Clean Coasts and the Blue Flag, was being brought out of the educational silo of An Taisce, which delivers many of the programmes, and into the main An Taisce body.  That was the concern I had and I wanted to seek clarification.</p> <p>  Based on the correspondence we received back, it seems there are very specific engagements between the funders and An Taisce in respect of buttressing or strengthening service level agreements or reviewing current service level agreements or contracts in respect of that funding.  That provides one with a degree of confidence.  In the case of one Department, which I think was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department clarified this was not compatible with public financial procedures, stating the grant moneys must be spent entirely on the programmes the Department has agreed to fund within the specific conditions of those grants and that failure to adhere to these conditions could result in funding being withdrawn and possibly the recoupment of unapproved expenditure sought or other legal enforcement.</p> <p>  The impression I had was that, quite literally, An Taisce was taking a bit of a tranche of some of that funding-----</p></speech>

When we look at the delivery of the programmes I referenced, we can see they are excellent programmes and we are very lucky to have an organisation like An Taisce to deliver them.  I just wanted to seek clarity on that.  Based on the correspondence, it seems individual line Departments are taking a rigorous approach to interrogating that relationship and the 2019 accounts.</p> <p>  I am not a financial or management accountant.  If An Taisce is a membership organisation, from a public purse and financial probity point of view, do each of those line Departments, the State, the Government or, ultimately, the taxpayer have a right to look at the financial strength or otherwise of the parent organisation when they are funding that organisation?</p><p>In other words, does the parent organisation have to be in a solvent position before it can receive funds?  That is just a curiosity of mine.  The reason I am curious about that is because if, on An Taisce's previous year's financial accounts, auditors were saying that - and I am quoting from its financial accounts - for organisational costs and innovation and all funding agreements, that an allowance would be made and there would be a movement of some of the moneys then, one wonders, why that is the case if An Taisce is a financially robust organisation.  Hopefully, that can be clarified for me.  It may not be within the remit of this committee to have that clarified.  Again, I seek the Chair's wisdom on that.  </p><p> It serves a vital function in terms of the delivery of its excellent programmes, and it permeates out with citizens proactively involved in delivering those programmes.  It has built a consciousness and awareness and set of programmes that have had a massive impact in communities at the most local level.  It is important that we preserve that and protect it in every way that we can.  It does a vital piece of work.  However, at the same time, I imagine that we should satisfy ourselves that everything that is being done is absolutely with financial probity in mind.</p></speech>

The nub of the point the Deputy is making is that, before the parent organisation would provide funding to a body such as An Taisce, it would check the financial position of that body.  My dealings in seeing money coming from Departments to bodies such as this show they can be fairly rigorous.  Is it in all cases?  I do not know but I would imagine so.</p><p>I will read the note:</p> <blockquote> 	Following on from the committee&rsquo;s request for information on Exchequer funding provided to An Taisce, the Committee has now received all the necessary responses. <br /><br />The responses from the 11 bodies vary In the detail provided due to the level of funding disbursed to An Taisce by these entities.  The Secretariat have reviewed all of the responses and have ascertained that the level of oversight of An Taisce by the entities is proportional to the level of funding that they provide, and the required service level agreements in place are in line with Circular 13/2014 [this is the important one] - Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds. <br /><br />The responses also vary in relation to the funding entities&rsquo; knowledge of the restatement of the 2018 figures within the 2019 financial statements. The entities that provide the higher levels of funding to An Taisce were aware of the restatements and placed reliance on the unqualified auditors opinion.  The remaining entities that were unaware of the restatement have made enquiries of An Taisce and will be carrying out the necessary reviews in order to ensure required compliance.  In some instances Departments noted that they withheld funding from An Taisce until they were satisfied with the responses received from their enquiries into the 2018 restatement. <br /><br />Finally, in relation to the funding authorities satisfying themselves as to the intended use of the Exchequer funding, the responses received stated that regular meetings were held and An Taisce&rsquo;s reporting requirements under the various agreements were proportionate to the level of funding provided to An Taisce.  Some responses also noted that the majority of the funding on certain schemes run by An Taisce was on the basis of vouched expenditure.  </blockquote> <p>I thank the secretariat for scrutinising that and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That gives us a very good level of assurances.  I hope that answers the Deputy's point.  It was a valid point he raised.  If he is happy with it or, if he need something additional, could he please tell me?</p></speech>

I believe there are nine Government Departments that provide funding to An Taisce, for very specific and distinctive reasons, it has to be said.</p> <p>  I wrote to the Chair on this yesterday, so perhaps we can deal with this now.  Just to get clarification, does the secretariat's briefing note cover the Government Departments and the non-departmental public agencies as well?  I am aware, for example, that the National Transport Authority provides substantial funding to An Taisce as well.  If it does not, could we incorporate that in terms of having an overall view, as we would with any organisation that is in receipt of substantial State funding?  The word that is being used in terms of oversight is that it is "proportional".  What we are dealing with is a large number of relatively small funding mechanisms.  However, together, it is quite a substantial funding mechanism.  If the funding was coming from one source, perhaps the oversight arrangements would need to be broader so it would keep that in.  </p> <p>  It is all the context of public probity, that we ensure that any body receiving taxpayers' money is ensuring that it is going for its intended purpose and that everything is fully accountable.  I am not aware, just be very clear on the record, of any suggestion that is not happening in this case.  Within the remit of this committee, it is important that we can satisfy ourselves that is the case. </p></speech>

It was very helpful.  From the 2018 restatement, I have to say it does not appear to be a major financial issue, rather a kind of accounting error.</p><p>Just for clarity, we are talking about many agencies.  We made inquiries and we got responses back from them as follows.  The Department of Rural and Community Development had no significant issues and was satisfied as was the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which had no significant issues.  None of the following raised significant issues either - the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Education, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Failte Ireland.  Usually, when something comes to this committee, it is because there has been a significant issue identified.  </p><p>This week, and I think it is important to have this on the record, a senior EU official, Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea, who oversees governance, enforcement action and compliance on EU environmental legislation, called Ireland out not only - and I know it was well reported - on the cost of observations in terms of environment protection but he also talked about the climate of discussion in Ireland when it comes to environmental protection.  </p><p>That is what we are really talking about here.  It is the work that An Taisce does, funded by its members.  As we all know, it does not use Government funding for this.  It funds this from its members to observe on issues such as cheese factories and environmental projects that might go ahead.  One of the things he said that is of particular concern to the EU is an increasingly aggressive stance being taken against environmental campaigners in Ireland.  I quote:</p> <blockquote> 	There is evidence not only of increased use of (strategic lawsuit against public participation) SLAPP suits, but also negative reporting in mainstream media, and even from politicians &ndash; like threatening to cut off funding to certain NGOs... or negative reporting (of such).  </blockquote> <p>Just in today's session, we have had discussions around whether it is solvent and the financial strength, or otherwise, of parent organisations.  There has been a characterisation of the strengthening of the legislation or the wording in SLAs, as arising from something that has happened within An Taisce, which is absolutely not the case.  </p><p>Here we are today, watching this being played out.  We have not identified any wrongdoing in terms of public funds and An Taisce.  What we are doing today is undermining that organisation and fomenting suspicion around the operation of a body for wholly political reasons.</p></speech>

I welcome the information.  I do not know of any member of the committee that did not welcome it.  It is appropriate that any organisation receiving State funding be open to scrutiny.</p></speech>

Some of the programmes An Taisce runs are excellent.  That is a bigger political issue on all sides of the debate.  I am not going to allow to be opened up here a debate between people who believe the earth is still flat and people on the other side.  I am not going to go into that or allow it.  The point, however, is that legitimate questions be asked.  Every committee member, including me, has welcomed the very comprehensive responses that have come back.  Simply asking a question about funding is not casting any aspersions.  Deputy Carthy actually prefaced his remarks by saying he was not casting any aspersions in respect of the misappropriation or alleged misappropriation of funds.  That is the-----</p></speech>

Therefore, I am wondering what exactly is going on.</p></speech>

There is a very strong debate between both sides.  We do have to reduce our carbon emissions but that is a bigger issue and it is not for this chamber.  There is a fair amount of political consensus in this country on it.  It is a matter of how we do it.  Most sensible people agree that we have to move on with it.  There is no disagreement on that, but that is for another day.</p></speech>

I feel I have to put that on the record.  Clean Coasts Ballynamona is in my constituency.  I raised many a green flag myself when I was a Minister of State.  The Chairman will know from the tone of the language of my questioning that it was not with a view to seeking to undermine any organisation.  I stated very clearly on the record the great work that An Taisce does in respect of the delivery of the programme but since I am not a financial or forensic accountant, I have to rely on the guidance we receive from the secretariat and the correspondence we receive from the Departments.  We are fully entitled, as I understand it, to ask a question of any organisation.  I am merely posing the questions and am entitled to do that.</p></speech>

I take grave exception to that.  It is wrong that it should be inferred from my questioning; it is unfair.

We have a very fragmented body of information.  It is not coming from one Department but from many.  It is legitimate in relation to State agencies.  It is worthwhile putting the jigsaw together to determine the funding profile; it is absolutely of value.  I do not believe there is any motive behind an overview, nor do I believe there is anything jumping out that I would be concerned about.  If there is, it will be reflected in our work programme.  If not, I expect we will not be spending time on it.</p> <p>  I certainly do not want to include Deputy Sherlock in saying there will be people looking at this as undermining an organisation.  It may not be occurring within this committee but there is no doubt that it is a feature.  Calling for a shutting down of debate is part of the discussion in relation to things that people do not want to hear.  That is just a fact of life.</p></speech>

I would like to think that if there are items of clarification that might be of use to us in ensuring public money is spent to deliver value for money and for its stated purpose, we would ask the relevant question regardless of the issue or organisation before us.  I am an agriculture spokesperson.  I do not get involved, and have not passed public comment on, legal cases, even where there were Ministers on both sides, with one criticising and another supporting the legal action.  I do not pass judgment one way or another; I never have done.  As agriculture spokesperson, I deal with farm organisations whose objectives and mission statements I support but I would never consider those bodies to be above questioning by me on any matter requiring clarification.</p> <p>  Part of the problem we have had in this State for too long is that when politicians support the objectives of an organisation, they move to the point where they believe the organisation is beyond question.  That is a dangerous and unfortunate position.  I hope this committee is above that.  I do not believe that, in my time as a committee member, the questions asked and inquiries made were for anything other than to pursue the stated aims of the committee.  In most instances, I have been pleasantly surprised by the fact that Government representatives on this committee have been willing to support reports, questions and lines of inquiry that are very critical of Government Departments.  That is the way we should pursue our business here.  We should deal with every organisation in a courteous manner and ask questions when necessary.  We should accept the assurances that are given, but I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that, when talking about public money, we have a right to know whether an organisation is drawing down substantial amounts such that members of the committee can be absolutely satisfied regarding it and say with hand on heart that we have done our job without fear or favour.  That is how I approach all these issues.  I will continue to do so.</p></speech>

Our dealing with that does not mean we are trying to undermine any organisation.</p></speech>

It was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>last week that some information is contained in those minutes about the projected date of completion.  That would be important information for us to have.  As the newspaper has it I do not see why we would not have it.</p></speech>

If we could just ask for those.  I also wish to highlight an issue about which I have written to the committee.  It will not be dealt with until next week but there is a particular timeline attached to it.  It is about Benefacts, a not-for-profit organisation that was set up and provides a very useful, open and easy to use database.  The database gathers information on grants and such things.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is looking to cease that and the Charities Regulator will replace it, but what will be available is not as open or as flexible.  In advance of the discussion on this, I ask that the clerk write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and find out whether there is something we cannot see to explain their making this decision.  It is time sensitive.</p></speech>

Next week, on 10 February we will examine the expenditure on the national broadband plan with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Please note, as previously agreed we will engage with NBI, and this is the part members need to watch, from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and with the Department from 1.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.  Correspondence will be circulated as normal but will be held over to the following week, 17 February.</p> <p>  We then have a series of housing related meetings scheduled, starting with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 17 February, the Residential Tenancies Board on 24 February and Home Building Finance Ireland on 3 March.  I will ask the clerk - I raised this at last week's meeting - domestic refuge provision is an issue that cuts across several Departments.  There are nine counties, including County Laois and County Offaly, that do not have a domestic refuge.  I will use that opportunity.  It is an important issue.  We all know why it is important that at least we give advance notice and that we get an opportunity to deal with it, with the agreement of the committee.</p></speech>

We will come back to that.  Next week we have that, 10 February.  The timeline is 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and the afternoon session with the Department.  The agenda for the engagement with the Department is the 2020 appropriation accounts and from the Comptroller and Auditor General is the 2020 report on the Accounts of Public Services, Chapter 3 on the central Government funding for local authorities and Chapter 8 on the oversight of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  The Department has also been advised that the committee may wish to discuss the cost rental expenditure, expenditure on women's refuges and EU findings on the Derrybrien windfarm.  Briefings will be requested on these areas.</p> <p>  In regard to the engagement with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and Home Building Finance Ireland please let the clerk know if there are any particular areas of concern or interest to be brought up in regard to their financial statements.  This will allow a briefing to be requested in advance of the meeting and allow the witnesses to prepare for the engagement in those areas on the day.  Availability has been confirmed for all these engagements.  Is it agreed to proceed as outlined?  Agreed.  Thank you.

No doubt everyone on the committee recognised that mental health services in this State are wholly inadequate.  We have seen in the media coverage of the report on south Kerry CAMHS that 227 children were exposed to risk of significant harm and that 46 children suffered significant harm.</p><p>We have seen coverage in the media of the report on CAMHS in south Kerry and the 227 children who were exposed to risk of significant harm and the 46 children who suffered significant harm.  I expect there will be an inquiry into what occurred there.  </p><p> The committee could play a role concerning our mental health services more broadly.  We could invite representatives from the HSE to appear before us to address specific issues in the mental health services.  We could seek to get detailed notes on those aspects beforehand, as well as having the relevant senior officials here, to allow us to engage on this subject.</p><p> I recall that it was only in December that we heard that &euro;1.8 million of mental health funding was diverted to purchase electric vehicles for the HSE.  If the committee agrees, I think we should make this issue a priority and ask HSE officials to appear before the committee at the earliest opportunity to address it.  It is up to the committee, but perhaps we could set aside one of our meetings on a Thursday afternoon in the next few weeks for that purpose, if that might be possible.</p></speech>

With the agreement of committee members, we will ask that representatives be invited from the HSE and, presumably, from the Department for a session to discuss our mental health services.  We will have to try to work out the schedule, because there can be problems with what we have planned when it turns out that people cannot attend.  Perhaps a slot like that could be filled with the session Deputy Munster proposed.  Her request is that we should bring in witnesses to discuss this issue soon.  Is it agreed that we will invite representatives from the HSE to discuss the mental health services?  Agreed.  Equally, we should try to do this in a timely manner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.  </p></speech>

There are nine CHO areas.  This should not end up being a discussion on the clinical end of things, although that facet obviously comes into it.  We could look at the HSE nationally, but what goes on is a postcode lottery.  We are continuously being told the problem is not a shortage of funds.  Yet we still see, for example, &euro;10 million being diverted from the mental health services into other services.  We must try to get an understanding of how the finances are distributed in this context, if it is done objectively and how the process has worked to date.  We must make up our own minds about the money spent, if it has been spent efficiently and if we delivering in respect of what is being spent in this area.</p></speech>

We must ensure this proposed slot is used well and that we know precisely the areas we want to cover in it.  Of the overall health budget, &euro;1.1 billion is for mental health services.  Will this proposed session be specifically related to CAMHS or will it seek to cover mental health in general?  How broadly do we wish to address this issue?  It is a short timeline for a broad subject.  Equally, a significant amount of public spending is allocated to this area.  A sum of &euro;1 billion is not small, so how can we act in a precise way that will allow us to get into the meat of this topic?</p></speech>

Part of the problem here was evident when we met representatives of the HSE for two or three sessions last year to deal with the health services in their entirety.  Therefore, there is no way any one area would get the level of scrutiny it probably deserves.  In talking about bringing in witnesses to talk about the mental health services, Deputies Catherine Murphy and McAuliffe have rightly pointed out that even within that category we could probably use all our meetings for the rest of the year to scrutinise a specific topic.  The first thing we must do is to expedite this endeavour as quickly as possible, because there has been serious public interest in this topic.</p> <p>  This week alone, I have heard four senior Government representatives say in the D&aacute;il that money is not an issue in this regard.  Clearly, then, we must find out what is happening with all this money that is apparently being allocated to our mental services if we as public representatives are dealing with people every day of the week who are telling us they cannot access them.  I suggest that we invite the senior management of the HSE, including the CEO, to appear before the committee as soon as possible, as proposed by Deputy Munster.  We can clarify in our private sessions what aspects we will be dealing with.  I do not envisage this being a once-off meeting.  We will probably need to follow it up with more sessions.</p></speech>

As others said, we are continuously told that money is no object, and yet it is not transferring down into the delivery of services.  Regarding the massive budget we are told is there, we must find out, not only from the perspective of service provision but also that of the public purse, where the money is going and why it is not delivering services on the ground.  The crisis in mental health is increasing weekly.  It is imperative to have representatives from the HSE appear before the committee.  As Deputy Carthy suggested, we could have a private meeting ourselves to set out what exactly we need to know.  The general topics, however, would include the budget, a breakdown of it and information on the delivery of services, including details of service provision in each CHO area.  We will need all that type of information.  It will be a minefield, but despite the amount of money we are told is being thrown at the mental health services, not one person could honestly put up his or her hand and say that he or she can see the results on the ground.</p></speech>

In accordance with international best practice, that should be increasing to 11% or 12%.  I just note that.

That is the best thing to do, and may be helpful.  Several difficulties arise when trying to schedule meetings.  As we have seen over the last year and a half, we can have difficulty scheduling meetings with representatives from organisations because of availability, diary conflicts or the time needed to prepare.  It is difficult to arrange the schedule as we would wish it to be.  The secretariat works diligently in this regard.  It is not something done just once a month.  The secretariat works not only weekly but daily, indeed, to engage and to try to keep things moving along.  They do that six, seven and eight weeks in advance.  It will be noted that it was difficult to schedule meetings at different times during the pandemic because we were not even sure if we would be able to have meetings.  Arrangements cannot be made fortnightly or every three weeks, because if representatives from one organisation do drop out, then it will not be possible to fill that slot at short notice.  It is necessary to give people a month's notice to allow them to prepare.  I ask the committee members to bear that point in mind.  Moving one meeting will have unintended consequences for people in other areas.  I ask the members to be mindful of that aspect as well.</p> <p>  To outline the schedule, we have matters nailed down until 3 March.  Commitments have been sought and given, and the preparation work has been done.  To allow the secretariat to make the necessary arrangements and to avoid any potential scheduling difficulties, I will set out the work programme up to 5 May, as outlined in the work programme document circulated for today's meeting.</p><p>From 10 March, we will move into a series of justice-related meetings.  We are scheduled to engage with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, on that date.  Last week, we agreed to engage with the Policing Authority the same morning.</p><p> The following week, beginning 14 March, is a non-sitting week.  On 24 March, it is proposed to schedule an engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and on 31 March, with the Department of Justice.  If, for example, we schedule the meeting on mental health issues for 10 March, it will mean changing that arrangement again.  I hope I am reflecting accurately that it is the committee's wish to get those issues relating to justice and the Garda, that is, with GSOC, the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, within the same block.  We agreed last week that we will try to do it over two weeks.  If we move the meeting of 10 March, it will mean kicking the can down the road on meeting those three bodies again.  I do not know whether the committee wishes to do that, but I am just pointing out that it could create a difficulty.</p><p> I am also mindful of the point raised by Deputy McAuliffe, namely, that it may be better to try to cover this mental health piece in a series of meetings.  There may have to be two or three related hearings on mental health-related issues.  I ask members to bear that in mind, although I am open to suggestions about how we deal with it.  As it stands, we will start those justice-related meetings on 10 March.  L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile P&aacute;draig is 17 March and the next public meeting after that will be held on 24 March, when we will deal with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will then conclude that set of meetings.  I appreciate the urgency of this and I agree with Deputy Munster on the area of mental health services.  We have had representatives of the HSE before us a number of times and, unfortunately, we have not had an opportunity to deal with mental health services.  The issue requires and deserves a proper examination.  We need to be careful that we do not knock everything else off the schedule.</p></speech>

That would not negate following through on what Deputy McAuliffe mentioned, namely, holding more in-depth meetings as a later stage?</p></speech>

To get a proper hearing, we will have to have the witnesses before us in the morning also.  If it is an important issue for us - I think that is accepted - we do not want it to be pushed onto the tail end of the day.  That would not do it justice, for want of a better term.  I suggest we try to slot in the meeting for 10 March and push everything else back by one week, if that is agreeable.</p></speech>

It is not open to the clerk to the committee to contribute right now but dealing with two issues in one day would create difficulties and I am conscious of that.  We need to be realistic about what we can cover.  The preparation for a meeting in any given week is considerable, as members will know from the work they put into meetings along with their personal assistants, the secretariat, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and everyone else involved.  It is not as simple as just scheduling a meeting and the meeting happens.  Weeks of work go into the build-up.</p> <p>  We need to move on.  The option is there and I propose we return to it when we can allow the secretariat to comment.  We will try to deal with it that way.  For now, the schedule up to 3 March has been nailed down and there is a provisional schedule beyond that.</p></speech>

Provisionally, there is a suggestion we go with that.  It is widely recognised that what the Deputy has proposed is worthy and needs to be dealt with as an urgent issue.  I ask her to bear with us until we deal with the rest of the meetings.  I think she will be happy with what we decide.  We will come to a conclusion that will meet the needs of the committee, which is the important thing.</p></speech>

It is such a serious issue that we could even examine community mental health as a stand-alone issue, dealing with the various organisations where there are service level agreements with the HSE as well as dealing with CAMHS.  It is too broad an area to cover in one meeting.  Is the suggestion that we would have the meetings on 10 and 24 March?  There was a separate proposal that we would discuss in private session which areas we will cover.  I am worried about agreeing to a time for a meeting whose scope we have not yet outlined and for which we have not decided who will appear before us.</p></speech>

I will return to it soon, given it will not take very long if we allow it to happen.  There was a suggestion that we would have two meetings but that would add a further complication.  I ask members to bear with me while we nail this down conclusively.  I qualify this by saying that, if we decide to take 10 March as the meeting on mental health and if we accept the Deputy's suggestion to hold a further meeting on 24 March, that will push other issues a week or two down the road.</p> <p>  I reiterate what has been agreed.  Last week, we agreed we would schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick, UL, and include in our invitation a request that the chancellor, Mary Harney, would attend, given the nature of her position and the duration of her tenure, along with the president, who is the accountable person.  That is on 7 April.  UL's financial statements for the year 2019-20 should be available to us at that point.</p> <p>  In accordance with our work programme, we would then engage with the Department of Finance on 14 April and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the Easter break, on 5 March.  I ask members to agree to that on the basis that we will sort out later what we will do about the meeting on mental health, that is, whether we should introduce it for the meeting of 10 March or whether we should schedule a double meeting for 10 and 24 March.  I am not asking members to agree on the exact dates but rather I propose we take them in that order, subject to sorting out of the business of the mental health issues.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I propose we go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 10 February, when we will engage with National Broadband Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of expenditure on the national broadband plan.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Senator Buttimer.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the committee, I send our condolences to Senator Buttimer on the death of his father yesterday.  May he rest in peace.</p> <p>  The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, have published a Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community, January 2022.  Masks, preferably FFP2 grade, should always be worn during the meeting except when speaking.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 including the Delta and Omicron variants.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation.  </p> <p>  I propose that we approve the minutes of the private and public meetings held on 19 and 22 January, which have already been approved at a virtual meeting.  We must do this for procedural reasons.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>   I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  This committee will observe fair procedures in these meetings.  If any other persons identified in evidence before this committee is of the opinion that a mistake or a fact of misstatement, including a misstatement by the omission of necessary or relevant context, has been made affecting him or her, they are invited to give a statement of evidence in writing and relevant documents to this committee.  They will also be given an opportunity to appear before the committee if they so wish.  </p> <p>  Today we resume consideration of public petition No. 9/21 which relates to unauthorised development in the name of Michael Barrett and No. 23/21 in the name of Mr. Jamie Forde Kelly.  </p> <p>  I extend a warm welcome to the representatives of Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council.  From Waterways Ireland we are joined by Mr. Andrew Nixon-King, marketing and development director, Mr &Eacute;anna Rowe, western regional manager and Ms Sin&eacute;ad Mallon, head of administration for property and legal.  From Westmeath County Council we are joined by Mr. Barry Kehoe, director of services transportation, planning and economic development and Mr. Cathaldus Hartin, senior planner.  </p> <p>  I propose that we publish the witnesses' opening statements on the committee website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Witnesses should make their opening statements for around ten minutes, after which we will have questions and comments from members.  I ask them to keep to around five minutes so that members can get in more than once to speak.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.669" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Nixon-King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022020300002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a brief opening statement on behalf of Waterways Ireland on public petition Nos. 9/21 and 23/21.  My name is Andrew Nixon-King, I am the marketing and development director in Waterways Ireland.  I am joined by my colleagues Mr. &Eacute;anna Rowe, our western regional manager and Ms Sin&eacute;ad Mallon, our head of administration for property and legal.</p> <p>  Waterways Ireland is the cross-Border navigational authority responsible for more than 1,000 km of inland navigable waterways across the island of Ireland.  It is the largest of six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good-Friday Agreement.  Its statutory function is to manage, maintain, develop, and restore specified inland navigable waterways, principally for recreational purposes.  Last year, more than 3.2 million people used the waterways, creating social, economic, and environmental well-being valued at &euro;560 million annually.  </p> <p>  Waterways Ireland was established through the transfer and consolidation of assets of multiple agencies, including the Shannon Navigation Commissioners, CI&Eacute;, OPW, Rivers Agency and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht, and the Islands, inheriting properties that were previously the responsibility of these organisations.  Very little of this property was registered in the Land Registry.</p><p>Waterways Ireland is before the committee to provide information in respect of petitions 9/21 and 23/21.  These relate to developments at Lough Ree.  There are several statutory provisions dealing with the River Shannon and Waterways Ireland property ownership.  An 1839 Act appointed and empowered the Shannon Commissioners to determine and define the limits of the River Shannon and to produce 45 maps known as the Shannon jurisdiction maps, which show property boundaries and jurisdiction.  Subsequent legislation transferred this ownership to Waterways Ireland.  The immediate focus of Waterways Ireland on its establishment was to ensure waterways were open and accessible.</p><p> In 2009, Waterways Ireland established a land recovery team, comprising two staff members, to secure the property portfolio on the Royal Canal.  This took four years to complete.  In 2021, we established a dedicated small group of staff to focus exclusively on recovery and first registration.  We continue to examine encroachments, including the alleged encroachments referred to in these petitions.  Currently, 52% of our property portfolio is registered or at an advanced stage of registration.  We anticipate completing the programme to secure the property portfolio transferred to Waterways Ireland will take significant resources.  The detail involved in registering our property portfolio is complex with significant administrative and legal inputs.</p><p> In relation to the leasing of Waterways Ireland property, planning permission is typically a prerequisite to considering any development and granting leases on our property.  In relation to Portaneena, this development began in the 1950s and has taken place incrementally since then.  Waterways Ireland was notified in 2012 about a development at Portaneena, parts of which were alleged to be unauthorised and encroaching on our property.  Since then, Waterways Ireland has conducted inspections and written to the occupiers.  We understand the same development was also brought to the attention of Westmeath County Council in 2012.</p><p> In 2017, Tidebrook Limited, of which the petitioner Mr. Michael Barrett is or was a director, applied to the Circuit Court for an injunction under section 160 of the Planning Acts in respect of the alleged unauthorised development, naming The Portaneena Company Limited and Waterways Ireland as respondents.  The Circuit Court made an order in 2019 refusing the application and dismissed the proceedings.  Waterways Ireland deferred completion of its own investigations of alleged unauthorised development at Portaneena until the planning authority had completed its investigations into the planning status, and until all litigation under the Planning Acts had been determined.</p><p> It is important to note that the Circuit Court has now ruled on this matter.  The court found no evidence that Waterways Ireland had engaged in any alleged unauthorised development or had consented to or facilitated any alleged unauthorised development and had acted in good faith in relation to all aspects of the matter.  The judge stated she "was not satisfied that the applicant demonstrated proof of any adverse environmental or planning impact".  Tidebrook Limited filed a notice of appeal to the High Court and later withdrew the appeal in July 2020.  We are not in a position to go into the specifics of any alleged encroachment at this time as it may pre-empt the outcome of any investigation and risk prejudicing any future action Waterways Ireland might wish to pursue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.671" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022020300002#B00200"><p>By way of introduction, my name is Barry Kehoe and I am director of services for transportation, planning and economic development at Westmeath County Council.  I am accompanied by Mr. Cathaldus Hartin, senior planner with responsibility for delivering the daily planning functions of the local authority.  I welcome the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Public Petitions and to provide assistance on matters related to the aforementioned petitions.  In this regard, it should be noted that the council has engaged extensively with respect to all developments to which the petitions relate.  Such engagement constitutes prolonged enforcement and associated legal actions and in this regard a brief summary of the history associated with the sites is set out in appendix 1.  This is included for the record but does not form part of the council's statement to the committee today.</p> <p>  Westmeath County Council has been engaged in planning enforcement activities in this area for many years and it is acknowledged that there are several developments on and adjacent to the lakes and the River Shannon that do not have the benefit of planning permission.  In some cases, the development in question predates the Planning Act of 1963 and in other cases, development took place on an incremental basis over the years without recourse to the planning authority.  Other development may have been undertaken in blatant disregard of planning laws and it should be noted that the council remains actively engaged in enforcement proceedings in suspected cases of unauthorised development, save for circumstances in which the Statute of Limitations applies.</p> <p>  The council monitored the hearing of the committee held on 9 December 2021 and welcomes this opportunity to give the council's perspective on the general planning issues raised.  By way of opening, it is considered that an Oireachtas committee is not an appropriate forum to ventilate legal arguments on particular cases, which have already been subject to court hearings and may be subject to ongoing legal action now or in the future.  Furthermore, this is a public meeting, none of the affected parties is present or represented and the council does not benefit from the protection of privilege that is in place for Members of the Oireachtas.  It has been noted that Tidebrook Limited, to which one petitioner would appear to be associated, is listed in the Legal Diary as having an ongoing High Court action against Portaneena Marina Limited, which is the subject of the petition.  Rather than discussing the individual cases, I refer members to the factual position from a council perspective, which is set out in the appendix to this statement.</p> <p>  In terms of general planning enforcement issues, having regard to the general issues raised at the previous meeting of the committee, the council comments as follows.  While the local authority is charged with the implementation of the Planning Acts, including planning enforcement, it is important to note that the council is not all-powerful in this respect.  The successful implementation of the planning system requires the co-operation of a large number of stakeholders, including the council but also landowners, developers, business people, the courts, Departments, State and semi-State agencies and local communities.</p> <p>  It is the case that the council has, on many occasions, prosecuted individuals and companies to the full extent permitted under the law and has nonetheless failed to achieve planning compliance.  While the legislation provides for the council to take direct action, this is not always practical or reasonable.  The process associated with securing these orders can be lengthy and costly and can carry significant risk for the council.  In this context, the council must, in all matters, be mindful of consequences associated with interfering with citizens' rights, property rights, proportionality and legal and financial risk.</p> <p>  We recognise the concerns expressed by the petitioners in respect of the current legislative provisions in this area.  Planning legislation has evolved significantly since the introduction of the Planning and Development Act 2000, undergoing extensive and incremental amendment.  Significant challenges have been presented in terms of alignment between national and European legislative frameworks, as evidenced in the increasing rate of challenge to planning decisions, many of which are based on environmental matters.  As such, the frameworks within which the council operates are complex and subject to legitimate challenge.  In this regard, the council welcomes a recent initiative by the Department to carry out a full review of the Planning Act.</p> <p>  A lacuna exists in our planning legislation in that it is not possible to regularise development in instances where an environmental impact assessment report, EIAR, or Natura impact statement, NIS, is required as part of an application for retention permission.  Previously, a mechanism existed under the substitute consent process, as set out under Part XA of the Planning Acts, which allowed parties to apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for permission to regularise permission for certain developments considered to be non-compliant with provisions of EU law.  However, following the Supreme Court decision of 2020 in the matter, certain provisions of this substitute consent legislation were struck down regarding the requirement to demonstrate "exceptional circumstances" for regularisation.  The decision also highlighted the requirement that members of the public should be able to participate in the process from the initial stage.  Consequently, the conditions under which substitute consent can be availed of are extremely limited and apply in exceptional circumstances only, as must be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>  It should be noted that the removal of development in such circumstances can have further unintended and unwanted negative environmental impacts.  It is the case that a conviction for contravening the Panning Acts constitutes a criminal offence and, as such, there is a significant burden of proof attaching to the prosecuting authority.</p><p>This burden makes planning enforcement a much slower and more complex process than is realised by some observers and leads to delays that are very frustrating for impacted third parties.  It is also the case that the defendants in such cases often mount vigorous defences due to the seriousness of the charge.  In addition, some courts can be reluctant to convict, having taken all of the circumstances into account.  As with all matters, the council must make decisions on the action that is appropriate in any case based on a careful consideration of the issue, its local and wider impact, bearing in mind the human and financial resources available to it as well as the risk in terms of legal and other costs.</p><p> Westmeath County Council is actively engaged with and committed to the enforcement of the Planning Acts, as determined by the Oireachtas.  It is actively engaging in the legislative review that is under way under the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

I understand the witnesses cannot comment on any issues that are the subject of ongoing legal proceedings.  We all respect that.</p> <p>  I would like to know who is responsible for whatever is on or adjacent to the River Shannon.  Having read the correspondence on the matter from various parties, there seems to be an issue with policing the river and the developments along the River Shannon.  One of the statements lists various bodies, including Waterways Ireland, the councils, landowners, developers, business people, the courts, State and semi-State agencies, local communities, etc.  It is impossible to police anything, whether on a river, on land or anywhere else, if so many organisations and community groups are involved.  For what are Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council responsible on the River Shannon?  Is their authority confined to the body of water and riverbed or does it extend to the riverbank?  I ask my questions against the backdrop of developments that lead out into the river.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Chairman is trying to clear this up but I have reservations.  I would prefer if the committee sought legal advice before proceeding.  I will not have an issue if the legal advice indicates it is safe enough to go ahead.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.684" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022020300002#C01300"><p>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am very familiar, as is the clerk and the other members of the Oireachtas staff, with Standing Order 218 and the implications that an Oireachtas committee, albeit a different one from this one, had for the nature and course of engagement of Oireachtas committees with witnesses.  I am struck by two other aspects.  One is the correspondence that we have received, which we went through in private session.  It has a lot of content and background information which I was certainly not <i>au fait</i>with or aware of at our December meeting.  A lot more information has also come to light.</p><p>The opening statement of Westmeath County Council states that &quot;an Oireachtas committee is not an appropriate forum to ventilate legal arguments&quot;.  I accept what the Chairman has said and obviously we may want to discuss the history of this issue.  However, if we are not sure that there is, potentially, a challenge to any previous legal case or if a new legal case could emerge, this could have an unintended consequence and implications for either of the State organisations represented, be it the county council or Waterways Ireland, the Oireachtas and, potentially, us.  I confirm that I am on campus but the fact we are even having this conversation shows that members are uncertain and unsure.</p><p>I ask the Chairman to deliberate on whether we should proceed and indicate whether he feels comfortable that we proceed.  I would also like to hear from the clerk because Standing Order 218 has changed all engagement with the Committee of Public Accounts, for obvious reasons.  We have given notice to the witnesses and I appreciate that they have come in and given their time.  From the correspondence that we went through yesterday in private session and from what I have heard today in the opening remarks made by both organisations, there seems to be a very grey area and a narrow point in which we can continue a discussion.  I ask the Chair to rule on whether we should proceed and indicate whether he is comfortable that we proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.685" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022020300002#C01400"><p>I am a brand new member of this committee and this is my first full meeting.  I am shocked by what we are discussing at this meeting.  We seem to be here to discuss a matter that has already been before the courts and on which a Circuit Court determined there is no evidence for the claim.  A court of law made that determination.  Westmeath County Council, in its statement, summed up my gut feeling on this matter when Mr. Kehoe said that this committee is not an appropriate forum to ventilate legal arguments on a particular case, which has already been subject to court hearings.  As Waterways Ireland said, that may prejudice potential future actions.  The Chairman spoke about fair procedure and the right of people affected to be invited before committees.</p><p>He spoke about our statutory obligation to ensure we do not identify anyone in such a way as to make him or her recognisable.  My understanding, however, is that at the previous meeting, many allegations were made, references to maps were held up and this did help identify people.  That is at odds with the rules of any Oireachtas committee and it is simply unacceptable without a right of reply being offered.  We are here as legislators and we make laws and policies, but we do not interfere in or prejudice the administration of live or individual cases.  That is not our role and it would be inappropriate.</p><p> What is being done to afford a right of reply to anybody who may have been identified at earlier meetings, as per the fair procedure clause the Chairman read out earlier?  Otherwise, we will be denying people natural justice.  The theme of this petition seems to seek to ride roughshod over the ability of local authorities and the courts to do their jobs and I am not comfortable with that.  I thank our guests for their time and their remarks, which capture exactly why this case should not be something we are discussing.  I am certainly not comfortable with it.</p></speech>

That has not happened since this committee was set up.  I said in my opening remarks that we were giving a right of reply to everybody and that an invitation would go out to the other party that was involved.  It was agreed the other people who were involved would be asked either to write to the committee or to appear in front of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.688" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022020300002#D00300"><p>I thank our guests for attending.  The initial petition on this referred to unauthorised development on the River Shannon.  Waterways Ireland's statement struck me in that it indicates very little of this property is included on the Land Registry.  I am not talking about any individuals or court cases; this is about the River Shannon in general.  The bodies that controlled this matter before it was handed over to Waterways Ireland, namely, CI&Eacute;, the OPW, the then River Agency and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, surely had some paperwork to say who owned the land or whether they were just minding it for somebody.  In my constituency, in Youghal and east County Cork, there are agreements going back to 1604.  The Duke of Devonshire still holds the rights to the seabed in Youghal.  Waterways Ireland stated, &ldquo;Currently, 52% of our property portfolio is registered or at an advanced stage of registration.&rdquo;  This was supposed to be about unauthorised development on the River Shannon.  We are not here to catch anybody out.  In fact, this is a way of assisting our guests&rsquo; organisations.  Waterways Ireland seems to be overstretched, at only 52% capacity in regard to the properties it controls.</p><p>One term appeared repeatedly in the opening statements.  The statement by Westmeath County Council refers to &ldquo;several developments on or adjacent to the lakes and the River Shannon that do not have the benefit of planning permission&rdquo;.  It goes on to state:</p> <blockquote> 	In some cases, the development in question pre-dates the Planning Act of 1963 [so there is an issue there] &hellip; development took place on an incremental basis over the years without recourse to the Planning Authority.  Other development may have been undertaken in blatant disregard of planning laws and in this regard it should be noted that the Council remains actively engaged in enforcement proceedings in suspected cases of unauthorised development, save for circumstances in which the statute of limitations applies. </blockquote> <p>The committee is not pointing the finger at anybody, but is there a possibility, because of the limitations on the Land Registry or because of historical planning issues, that unauthorised development is still happening on the River Shannon over which the council does not have control?  Is it possible private companies are moving in without the council's knowledge or control?  That is the question we are trying to get at.  It is not about individuals.  Individual cases were raised as a red flag, but it seems Westmeath County Council, while trying to do its best with enforcement measures and so on, lacks power.  Similarly, Waterways Ireland is at an infancy stage whereby it is trying to gather all the information, statistics and what it can control and use.  In between, there are, possibly, people or entities taking advantage of the planning structure or the flawed planning laws that exist.</p><p>That is the case we are trying to highlight here.  It is not to point the finger at anyone but rather to get a collective picture, assist the organisations and flag it with the Government in case more resources are needed to deal with the issue.  Last night, I noted the term &quot;unauthorised development&quot; appears repeatedly in our guests' statements and in the appendix supplied by Westmeath County Council.  It is possible someone could come in with a caravan and put it on concrete blocks for seven years.  After seven years, the limitation period will have expired and he or she could install a solid structure and get away with it.  Is this a planning issue?  Is it possible this behaviour is still going on?  That is what I want to know.  It is a calamity at the moment because Waterways Ireland does not have all the information in respect of the portfolios and so on that it controls.  Westmeath County Council is trying to enact enforcement orders when it can but it is caught in a crux between archaic planning laws and seven-year rules.  Is it possible today that there are unauthorised developments all along the River Shannon over which our guests' two entities have no control?</p></speech>

We are all aware of which one it is.  Plenty of county councils border the River Shannon and, presumably, have unauthorised development along it, but this is very specific.  Before we proceed, I, along with colleagues who have spoken about this, would like to hear whether this meeting should proceed, in the Chairman's view, and I would like to hear also from the clerk to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.690" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022020300002#D00500"><p>Deputy Buckley continually used the term "unauthorised development".  It is my firm belief this matter will find its way to the courts for resolution at some stage.  I am deeply concerned about it.  I fully appreciate where Deputy Buckley was coming from and I support most of what he said.  If we had these two entities before us today to discuss the general topic, that would be fine and I would be very happy with that.  As was pointed out by Deputy Devlin, however, this is a specific issue that was raised with us.  It may end up having to be resolved in the courts.  I am not comfortable with it and I do not believe we should stray into it.  We should watch where we are going here.   We know what happens when an Oireachtas joint committee gets something wrong.</p></speech>

It is about an individual case.</p><p>The committee has already heard a presentation from individuals and we were shown maps.  This is really dangerous territory.  Whatever is agreed, that is fine, but if we do not get a resolution, I will be proposing that we suspend debate on this to another day until we get legal advice.  The Chairman will offer his point of view, but we have to take into account what Deputy Higgins said.  At the beginning of every meeting of this committee the Chairman or whoever is in the Chair reads a long spiel about what members should and should not do.  That is made quite clear to us.  We have to take all of that into account.  </p><p> Mr. Kehoe is a very reputable man, which I know because I do not live too far from Westmeath.  However, on the basis of what I have heard from Mr. Kehoe, I am not happy to proceed to an open public debate on the issue at this time.  </p></speech>

I again apologise to the witnesses for throwing a spanner in the works on this one, but I believe it is in everybody's interest.</p></speech>

I do not believe there is need to progress with any further statements at this point.  It is a matter for the Chairman and other individuals, but why should we proceed with further statements?

The summary notes and recommendations in regard to the petitions were circulated and discussed in private session with a view to the decisions on them being taken in public session.  I suggest that we consider petitions 42/21 and 48/21 together.  Petition 42/21 is in regard to saving the services at Owenacurra Centre, Midleton, County Cork.  Petition 48/21 is in regard to a similar matter.  Following on from the discussion on these petitions in private session, it was agreed to invite the HSE in on this matter, but be fair to the Owenacurra Centre and St. Brigid's hospital committees, I think we should invite them in first.  It is the function of this committee to allow organisations and committees to petition it on particular issues.  We can invite the HSE in at a later date.  Would anyone like to add to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.700" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022020300002#E00800"><p>We spoke about this in private session.  The matter is ongoing.  The committee is supposed to be open to every member of the public.  As I said in the last session, it is about fairness and listening to both sides of the story.  As is often said, there are two sides to every story and then there is the truth.  I agree we should first invite in the witnesses from the Owenacurra Centre and St. Brigid's hospital.  I should declare at this stage that the Owenacurra Centre issue is of personal concern to me because it is located in my home town.  I have been fairly vocal on the matter.  It is important that the committee hears the witnesses' statements with regard to the impact of closure of these services on communities and families.  That would also be a bonus for those who are not aware of the services.  The HSE is also entitled to come in and offer its take on the matter.  That would be a fair way to proceed.  It would open up a lot of other avenues.  It is the fair way to go.</p></speech>

Given they are health services, is there a reason the petitions are not matters for the health committee?  Even if we bring in the groups, followed by the HSE, I cannot see any resolution.  The HSE is probably the best option if we are to proceed, but I believe the best route for a petition of this nature is the health committee, not this committee.</p></speech>

I am not sure of the position with regard to the St. Brigid's service.  As mentioned by Deputy Buckley, we had a discussion earlier about bringing in the HSE.  As the Committee on Public Petitions, our function is to hear petitions from people in regard to issues arising in their local areas.</p></speech>

Some local issues could have a national impact as well.  I take on board Deputy Devlin's remarks with regard to the matter being one for the health committee.  It did go to the health committee and it was agreed that some members of that committee would visit the Owenacurra Centre this month.  I am well aware of that.  As I said, I see where the Deputy is coming from.  The petitioner has submitted a very lengthy petition setting out the pros and cons and detrimental effects of the closure of this service.  This committee is the only platform that these people have to tell their story.  Having been a member of the previous Committee on Public Petitions and of this committee, I have listened to petitions from the disability sector, the mental health sector and so on.  This is the best committee to afford people an opportunity to explain their case.  Following on from our discussion with the witnesses, we can take stock and then invite in the HSE which is entitled to an opportunity to offer its spiel.  It is from that process we will get a better picture of what is happening.  I am on record as saying that this committee is different from the previous one in terms of party politics.  It is more of a collective group and it is more empathetic.</p><p>It is in the rules of the committee that we can submit our findings or decisions back to the Committee on Health.  Obviously, if that has not been dealt with within three months, it comes back.  I think it is very important to give witnesses an opportunity in our committee to tell their story.  As I said at the start, we listen to the two sides and somewhere in between, hopefully, we get the truth.</p></speech>

If this subject has already been discussed by another committee, does that not seem like a lot of duplication from the Houses of the Oireachtas on one particular topic?  Until that field trip Deputy Buckley has spoken about happens and we get the findings from that, would we not be better to wait and then make a more informed decision as to whether or not we need to look at this, in addition to the other committee or perhaps alongside it?  If it is already looking at this, I suggest that we wait and see how that pans out before we make any determination.  That is my feeling on it.</p></speech>

Having had a quick look at a few items with regard to St. Brigid&rsquo;s, I think the group is quite political.  If we have questions about the centres, we should ask the HSE ultimately.  We thank the petitioners for their petition and for raising the issues and bringing it to the attention of the committee, but we should bring in the HSE and discuss it with it directly.  That would be my proposal.</p></speech>

The Committee on Petitions is for the general public.  With no disrespect to Deputy Devlin, I take offence at the suggestion it is political.  We have three Government party members who are also working to save that centre.  Whether he is using &ldquo;political&rdquo; as in politically motivated or as referring to the Opposition, I have been on the record in my own town of Midleton, with the other Deputies in east Cork, to say that we would not be politicising it and we will not play party politics on it because it is a local issue about local services.  I want that on the record.  That is why I think it is the important to get the witnesses in.</p> <p>  I understand where the Deputy is coming from in regard to the HSE and it will get its turn too.  However, the Committee on Petitions is open to every single citizen in the country and they can come in and at least ask for their voices to be heard.  That is the point I was trying to make.  It certainly will not be political points scoring.  I am not on the media about it as much as others.  I will go on the record and say it here again.  I have reminded people at previous meetings of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health that there are three Members fighting for the same thing who sit in the present Government and I have not been throwing anything that is inappropriate.  As I said at this committee a while ago, this committee is very different.  We can put politics aside to address local issues and to help everybody.  That is the way it should be.  That is my take on it.</p></speech>

I am in the beautiful position that I am an Independent here and answerable to nobody but God.  At the end of the day, key to the Committee on Petitions is that the citizen has access to the Oireachtas and the citizen has the opportunity to bring his or her case here, when everything else has failed him or her.  From that perspective, leaving party politics out of it, I do not care if they kill one another down in the constituency, and that is all fair game as far as I am concerned, but let us put the citizen at the centre of everything we are doing today and make our decisions based on the needs of the citizen.</p></speech>

We said at the start that we would all leave party politics at the door.  Before I let in Deputy Higgins, I suggest that we have a meeting with Owenacurra and the St. Brigid&rsquo;s committee and then have a separate joint committee meeting with the HSE.  I think it will get very messy if we try to have in two committees, the HSE and the two petition groups.  I propose that we have two separate meetings, one with the two petition groups and a separate meeting with the HSE as a joint meeting with the Committee on Health.  I call Deputy Higgins.</p></speech>

Are we not pre-empting the failure of the Committee on Health to address this?  Should we not just let it do its work?  If we feel it is not adequate or if people feel they have been failed, at that point, we can step in.  I am conscious of the phrase the Chairman has just used that it might get &ldquo;very messy&rdquo; if we have too many parties involved.  Surely to have too many committees involved has that same risk.</p></speech>

My feeling is that the Committee on Health would prefer it if the Committee on Public Petitions took this because it was referred to it.  Given the amount of work the Committee on Health takes on at the moment, it feels it is more appropriate for us.  Our committee is a listening committee, to go back to what Senator Craughwell said.  It is supposed to be the most easily accessible committee that every Irish citizen can access.  If they have concerns, fears and worries and they feel they are not getting anywhere, we should afford them the chance to be listened to.</p><p>We should afford them the chance to speak.  If it does advance from that and the Chairman feels that it is beyond our grasp or that we are out of our depth and it is a major health issue, we can then refer it to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  That recommendation can sit in limbo for three months and then be referred back to us.  At least this way, we are addressing it.</p><p> In terms of background information on the Owenacurra centre, it is a very urgent matter and we do not have time to let it go.  That is my opinion.  This is a nice committee and we agree to disagree at times but it is the only committee through which we can collectively bargain on behalf of the citizen and not for our own kudos.</p></speech>

If the issue is not resolved here, we can refer it on to the Joint Committee on Health or any other Oireachtas committee.  The first port of call should be this committee.</p> <p>  I have a dilemma because I do not know which of the two candidates for the role of Vice Chairman indicated a desire to speak first.</p></speech>

Deputy Higgins has made a good point there.  As I said, I believe the health committee should be the first one to examine this and then, as Deputy Buckley said, if it is not examined, it can come to us.  I still stand by what I said earlier, that if the HSE were to come in we have already received a petition to put before it.  Obviously Deputy Buckley is familiar with his local area and the local issues there and I accept what he is saying.  It is not a political issue.  Other members are more aware of the issues with St. Brigid's.  If the HSE were to come in, we could put the questions from the petitioners to it, short-circuit the whole thing and hopefully get a resolution.  That would be a good day's work.</p> <p>  Does the Chairman or the clerk to the committee know if the petitioners have written to the Joint Committee on Health?  As I understand it, Deputy Buckley is a member of that committee or a substitute member.  If the petitioners have done so, we should see what that committee does first and then offer to look at it jointly or come back to the issue at our next meeting.</p></speech>

Perhaps Deputy Buckley knows.  Regardless, I still come back to the point that this committee gives people from communities all over the country an opportunity to bring their concerns to a public platform in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  If we bypass them with the HSE, there is a possibility that the people of south Tipperary, south Kilkenny, north Waterford and Midleton in Cork will never get to put their case for their own communities and their services in front of anybody here.  That is the worry I would have.</p></speech>

I ask Deputy Higgins to drop me a text before I speak in future so that I do not walk myself into trouble.  The problem we have here is that Deputy Buckley on one side, and Deputies Higgins and Devlin on the other side, are all making perfect sense.  What I would say about the Committee on Public Petitions is that it should be the last chance saloon for everything.  If people have been through the system and the system has let them down, if they have tried everything possible to put something to rights but to no avail, then this committee is for them.  This committee is the last chance saloon where people can come and put their case on the public record.  They may not get the support of the committee at the end of it, but we should defend to the death the right of any citizen to come here with a case.  I understand the urgency of the case that Deputy Buckley is concerned about and that conflicts me slightly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the statement I just made.</p><p>If it is possible to hold a joint meeting with the Joint Committee on Health, we should do that.  However, if there is still scope for the health committee to do something here, then I would side with Deputies Higgins and Devlin and say we should get that committee on the game but if it is not up to the game within a short space of time, then we will take it over.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.731" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022020300002#G00700"><p>May I clarify something?  To my knowledge, the Owenacurra centre has approached the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The centre has exhausted most avenues.  It has called for meetings with the HSE.  It has exhausted the avenues open to it which is why I feel that this committee dealing with it is so important.  In fairness to the health committee, it has said that it will facilitate a visit to the centre so that members can see it with their own eyes and compare what they see with the reports from the HSE.</p> <p>  Despite what people may think, it has not been disjointed.  There has been good dialogue between some of the worried families, the HSE and the health committee.  As I said, some of the petitioners want the Committee of Public Accounts to get involved because public moneys are involved here.  The investment of public money in the centre is the crux of the issue.  When committee members hear the petitioners' statement on this, it will totally clarify the situation that patients and their families are in.  It will also give members a clear picture of the impact that the choices being offered by the HSE will have on patients.  Then when we hear the HSE's side of the story, that will give clarity in terms of the whole picture.  Questions may remain at the end of that process but it will be up to the committee as a whole to decide on that.  I would go back to the statement I made at the outset, which is that we have to hear both sides of the story and then decide where the truth lies.  </p> <p>  Deputies Devlin and Higgins have asked why the health committee is not dealing with this.  That committee has facilitated those involved to the best of its ability but it is swamped with work because of the current situation with regard to health, Covid-19 and so on.  We are in a very privileged position at this committee in that we can afford these people the opportunity to air their views.  Where there is an action, there is always a reaction and we can also give the HSE an opportunity to tell its side of the story.  Then it will be up to us to decide.</p></speech>

The same is true for the St. Brigid's petitioners who would argue that they have the backing of 11,000 people in the south Tipperary, south Kilkenny and north Waterford catchment area.  They feel they have exhausted all available options and that appearing before this committee is an opportunity to put their case.</p></speech>

Listening to them might bring in extra work but if we start putting obstacles in front of community groups like the St. Brigid's hospital committee and the Owenacurra centre committee, we will finish up having nothing to do because no one in the public will have any faith that an issue will be dealt with in this committee.  There will be a perception that we want to keep holding them off.  The two hospitals in question are closing.  St. Brigid&rsquo;s hospital is closed and the Owenacurra centre is closing.  Time is of the essence.  There are 11,000 people involved in the petition for St. Brigid'&rsquo;s hospital, for example.  They want this matter progressed and have signed a petition to get it in front of the committee.  It has come through the secretariat to the members and we should afford them the opportunity to appear before us.  Let us make the decision, bring in the HSE and members of the Joint Committee on Health and see where we go from there.  We should not put obstacles in the way of any group just because it might create extra work for members, who are elected representatives.</p></speech>

I am saying they should use every available forum before they come here.  We all accept that this committee is almost a last resort.  We get very little media coverage because many of the cases have been raised all over the place before getting here.  We are the last resort.  I am asking for clarification from the Chairman and Deputy Buckley on whether these groups have gone through the regional health forum.  If they have, I am sure we can agree to meet them.  I do not have any issue with that.  I am not putting any obstacles in anybody&rsquo;s way or objecting to their case or the concerns they have about the two hospitals.  I asked a simple question on whether they have gone through the regional health forum and met its members to make their case.</p></speech>

Is it not prudent to ask that committee for a report on what progress it is making in order to put pressure on it to ensure it deals with this matter adequately?  As Senator Craughwell said, if we cannot get those reassurances, we should look at the matter then.  I agree with Senator Murphy.  If this is a committee of last resort, we do not want a dual process with two committees looking at the exact same issue.  I appreciate that the two committees could be brought together but the HSE has already been before the Joint Committee on Health to discuss this issue.  Asking it to appear before this committee would be a total duplication of work from our perspective and that of the HSE.  If there are other petitions that should be considered, we would be deprioritising them to deal with a matter that another committee is already examining, which would not make sense.  We should ask the Joint Committee on Health for a report on its work and keep the pressure on it to ensure it deals with this.  I know it a time-sensitive issue but that committee has agreed to visit the sites.  If it does not do that or if we feel it is not progressing the matter, we should by all means look at it.  Until then, this seems to me to be a matter for the Joint Committee on Health and it is on its agenda.</p></speech>

I know we have had a long discussion on this and I am conscious that there is a third petition to examine.  We should defer the matter until we know what the Joint Committee on Health is doing.

That is one of the reasons the centre is being closed.  The petitioners are raising a separate issue relating to the same premises, namely, the social impact of all the services being lost forever.  The centre provided long-term and short-term respite, mental health services and day-care services.  The HSE is saying the building is not fit for purpose and it has to close it.  The Joint Committee on Health is looking at the structural report and asking why we cannot improve the centre rather than knocking it down and losing its services.  The petitioners want to appear before this committee and ring-fence the argument that while the structural issue can be addressed, once those beds and services are gone in their area, they will be gone forever and that will have a social impact.  That is the issue.  I hope I have clarified the matter.</p></speech>

We can check if the petitioners have met the regional health forum and we can even ask the regional health forum to appear if we so wish.  Do we wish to defer the matter or send an invitation to the two petitioners, the Owenacurra centre and St. Brigid's hospital committees, ask that they come in and give their take on the issue?</p></speech>

That would be simple enough if Deputy Buckley were to bring a letter to the next private meeting indicating he has confirmation that the petitioners have exhausted all avenues open to them.  In that case, then we would be in the last chance saloon and we could get them in straight away.  All we would be doing is deferring the matter for a few days if Deputy Buckley would agree to that.</p></speech>

As I said, I am not acting as a go-between for the Owenacurra centre.  I am a public representative and I take the same amount of punishment or credit as others.  My feeling from working on this, talking to the service users and listening to the petitioners is that they have exhausted all avenues.  That is why they need this opportunity to tell their stories, nail down what the social impact of this closure will be and try to cut across the bureaucracy.  That might show that there is a bigger picture here.  They are only asking for their voices to be heard, although I understand what other members are saying.  This is only my view.  We can vote on the issue because that is what democracy is about.  This is urgent.  The people who are personally affected by this are hurt and they have exhausted every other angle.  If they had not done so, they would not have come to the Committee on Public Petitions.</p><p>Some of the witnesses' statements on the documents we got are of major concern.  It is a matter of urgency.  I feel that as a public representative it does not matter if it happens in Midleton, Kilkenny or whatever other county.  They should be all afforded the same respect and the same opportunity.  It is a matter of urgency.  We are lucky enough to be in a position to afford those people the opportunity to express their issues, it is only fair that we should listen to them.  That is my argument on the point.</p></speech>

I will shortly allow Senator Murphy and Deputy Devlin to come in.  Before I do, I suggest that we ask the secretariat to write to both petitioners and get clarity.  If we get that clarity, we will bring the matter up again at our next private and public meetings.  If we get clarity and we have exhausted that process, we will put out an invitation to the representatives from Owenacurra and St. Brigid's to attend our next public meeting.

Of course there is a social fallout.  Of course people are hurt.  We have Sl&aacute;intecare and all of these things happening.  I want it to be clear that I and my colleagues want what is best for the people.  When I was a member of the previous Committee on Public Petitions, another committee was dealing with an issue and we were told we could not deal with it.  I will try to find the minutes of that meeting.  I clearly remember that I wanted to bring up an issue and was told that the health committee or the Committee of Public Accounts was dealing with a matter and the Committee on Public Petitions could not have the relevant people before it.  Perhaps that has changed.  If, as Deputy Higgins said, the health committee is going to visit one of those sites, and that was what I understood her to say, that committee is dealing with the issue.  Would we be crossing another committee?  I clearly remember the point arising when I was a member of a previous Committee on Public Petitions.  If a particular committee of the Houses was dealing with an issue, no other committee could cross it.  We were seen as the last resort.  If another committee failed in what it was trying to do, the matter came to the petitions committee.  I know I am correct in that because I remember it clearly.</p></speech>

In fairness to Senator Murphy, this committee certainly wants to hear about the concerns of constituents and their local centres.  There is no question about that.  To the point that Deputy Higgins made earlier, we also must be cognisant of our work and duplication with other committees.  The Chairman suggested that the clerk would seek information from other committees and I would not limit that to the health committee.  From listening to colleagues, nobody seems to be certain which committee is involved.  This group is obviously very active and I commend its members on their work to date.  If they have corresponded with other committees and subcommittees of the Oireachtas, we need to find out.  Perhaps they have been in touch with the Sub-Committee on Mental Health or another Oireachtas committee.  We need to be sure whether a site visit is happening.  Deputy Buckley says the visit relates to the physical building, and that is fair enough.  It might not be about the services.  I cannot imagine an Oireachtas committee attending a site and not discussing the services in tandem with discussions of a building.  Why would a building be repaired if there are not to be services?  They will have a discussion around everything.  We need to have that report, as Deputy Higgins rightly said.  I would also like for this committee to inquire of all other Oireachtas committees to see is this on the agenda for any other committee.  When we establish that, Senator Murphy's point about the regional health forum is a very good suggestion.  It is more targeted.  The regional health manager would be at those meetings, along with the other professionals within the HSE.  We might not actually get that audience at a meeting of ours but that is not to say we should not try.  We must ensure there is no duplication happening in the Oireachtas.  We have learned today that a site visit is happening, which I welcome.  Following on from that, we can discuss it at the next meeting.  That is why I agree with Senator Craughwell's suggestion.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy very much.  I apologise to Deputy Buckley but I think we need to do this quickly.  These people are suffering and we should not do anything that would prolong that suffering.  We should get to it quickly.  I ask Deputy Buckley to explain that to them because I know he will be working with them.  I know that colleagues in other places and members of other political parties will be working with these people.  Please explain to them we are not disregarding their needs.  We are trying to ensure they get the best possible outcome in the quickest possible time.</p></speech>

If we find no other committee is doing anything, then we must step in.  That can surely be accomplished in a few days.  It is not rocket science.  I appreciate that the health committee is busy at the moment, with all that is going on, and it is quite possible it could not deal with this matter.  If that is the case, we should deal with it as a matter of urgency.  We should be telling the petitioners that we are suspending consideration for the moment because we need to check with the other committees but if no other committee is dealing with the matter, we will tell the other committees we are taking over the issue and we will call the petitioners before us and they will have a chance to make their petition as a matter of urgency.  We are not going to leave them swinging in the wind for much longer.

I thank the committee for hearing me out.  I understand the issue about duplication.  If the suggestion is that the secretariat writes to the Sub-Committee on Mental Health, the health committee and others, and asks where the issue is at or if those other committees are finished considering the issue, at least then we will know what action to take.  I am happy enough with that.  It is a commonsense approach and a way of meeting in the middle.  No one is being ostracised at the same time.  I would ask for a bit of urgency because there is anxiety.  An issue like this will affect people.  I urge urgency.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Elaine Dennehy and Ms Anna Levin from LightAware and Ms Finola Cassidy and Ms Jacqui Browne from the Irish Thalidomide Association.  I am not sure whether Dr. Angela Unufe-Kennedy from the Migrant and Minority Disability Network Europe has joined us.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  If members are joining remotely, I ask that them to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex prior to contributing to the meeting.  For anyone watching these proceedings online, witnesses or anyone accessing the meeting remotely, due to the unprecedented circumstances, I ask everybody to bear with us if any technical issues arise.</p><p>I understand there are some issues with Microsoft Teams this morning.  I ask the representatives to bear with us.</p><p> On privilege, witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings should be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on or criticise any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses giving evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on this.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should be mindful of that statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that decision.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I call Ms Dennehy to make her opening remarks. </p></speech>

I also hope that this can help, in many ways, the others who are suffering around the world from light emitting diode, LED, sensitivity and artificial light sensitivity.  I have been made ill from LEDs since 2007.  It is more than a sensitivity; it is a disability.  I am disabled by my environment, like so many others, and excluded from society.  This is also an accessibility issue.</p> <p>  It makes more sense for me to start from today and work my way back, as briefly as I can.  In doing so, I hope committee members will understand the enormity of the situation and the devastating impact it is having on my life.  The straw that has broken the camel&rsquo;s back is the change over from halogen to LED traffic lights and pedestrian lights, in addition to the newer driver feedback displays in our town.  LED is continually evolving and this new form is something my brain cannot cope with.  I cannot get into town.  If I do so, I will suffer the consequences.  It only takes a moment&rsquo;s exposure to these particular LED sources, even from far away, for the pain and symptoms I experience to continue to escalate for up to two days.</p> <p>  The most distressing symptom from these newer sources is a burning sensation in the occipital area of my brain.  It does not start immediately and it builds in the hours that follow.  It is a chain reaction and not just a moment's discomfort at the time.  This is the final straw as I am already in constant pain on a daily basis due to the LED in my environment from passing cars, farm machinery working in the fields around me with flashing LED beacons or neighbours near and far with outdoor lights on during the day.  Even some LED lights inside others&rsquo; houses are problematic.  Wavelengths of light travel many kilometres.  They are visible and invisible.  We can see LED from space so it makes sense that someone sensitive, like me, is affected from hundreds of metres away without seeing the source directly.</p> <p>  If someone told me this would be my life 14 years ago, I would have found it very difficult to believe.  I can only speak about my experience but there are so many others in the same boat.  It first started in 2007, when I opened a mini Nintendo DS game backlit with LED.  I was immediately ill and ran to the bathroom.  I had got a searing headache that quickly escalated to migraine with eye pressure.  LED was easy to avoid then and I did not think much more about it.  I travelled in Australia for two years after that, where there were a few supermarkets I could not go to due to the overhead lighting from which I experienced similar symptoms.  On my return in 2009, I could no longer find a phone or laptop without LED or sit in some newer cars due to the LED dashes.</p> <p>  LED slowly crept in to most environments and by 2014 the monitors in my workplace were changed to LED.  I could not tolerate them for a second.  I was already working under LED lighting and living on painkillers and anti-sickness tablets. I thought that if I somehow could just keep going I would become immune, but I was wrong.  I only got worse.  I had no choice but to leave my job once the monitors changed.  That same week, in December 2014, the sodium streetlights outside my home changed to LED so I was confined to my house at night for a year.</p> <p>  I moved to the countryside in late 2015 and now I find myself in the exact same position again.  Due to the phasing out of all other light sources, most neighbours have gradually converted to outdoor LED.  I have not seen the night sky in 16 months since September 2020.  Before that, I was confined to particular areas in my garden and it would have to be for brief periods.  I am now confined to the house for up to 18 hours a day in winter, with blackout material covering the windows as the wavelengths of light from distant lights come in around the blinds.</p><p>It has been many years since I have been able to go to a bar or restaurant.  Shopping for essentials is as quick as possible since intense diodes lining the freezers and LED monitors on most checkouts add to the pain, but now none of that is even possible.  Due to the changeover to LED pedestrian and traffic lights, and the newer feedback displays, I cannot get into town.  I cannot get out of my area and into the next villages for the very same reasons.  I am stuck in limbo.  I am trapped on the outskirts of the town between villages.  I cannot get to the GP, the vet or the shop.  I am excluded from the park, the church and visiting my parents&rsquo; grave.</p><p> My eye health is perfect and I do not need sunglasses.  The problem is neurological.  The LEDs of today are very different from any other light source.  I have been living in lockdown for many years.  Most people know the relief that was felt with the easing of Covid restrictions and the toll they have taken on everyone.  I may never experience that relief, as is the case for people like me who are in constant lockdown.  I am exhausted.  My lockdown may never end.  I experience ill health around all LEDs, including blocked ears, ringing in my ears, eye pressure, head pain, headache, head pressure, nausea and migraine.  Migraine is a complex neurological condition and one of the most disabling worldwide.  Even a person using their phone, or their LED watch, near me can cause symptoms.  What I endure from LED traffic lights, LED pedestrian lights and the newer feedback displays is intolerable.  It is not worth the exposure.</p><p> A life of isolation and lockdown is the only alternative if something does not change.  It is not acceptable for me or anyone to be forced to live like this for the next 50 years due to an artificial light source that has not been adequately tested.  We cannot say with certainty that LEDs are safe for everyone.  Life is passing me by, I cannot work or travel and I cannot visit friends or attend special occasions with family.  I cannot take part in recreational activities.  Some days are a complete write-off.  If there are LEDs on nearby or in the distance, the pressure just continues to build in my head.  I must cover up my windows again or go to a dark room.  I am impacted from the minute I wake up until the minute I go to sleep.  The effects are cumulative so I have to weigh up what I can tolerate; it is a negotiation.</p><p> Nothing in my life is left untouched by LEDs.  Over the past few years, I have been trying to limit exposure and retain some quality of life, even though that meant being locked down at night and excluded from indoor spaces during the day.  I had been scraping by, through travelling into town during quiet periods on brighter days, getting in and out of essential services as fast as possible and not stopping to speak with anyone.  It was a lonely, isolating life, but now none of that is even possible.  Streetlights and floodlights are generally off during the day, but there is no negotiating LED traffic and pedestrian lights and newer feedback displays.  I use a 14-year-old Nokia phone and a third party has helped me to connect a modern laptop to my old TV today so I could join this meeting.</p><p> The problem is global.  It is not just a concern for those who are immediately affected, like me, and are locked in blackened out homes.  We do not know the long-term consequences of this light source.  Senior medics have been raising concerns for years.  I know people all over the world, some with perfect vision, who are getting around with blackout glasses and a walking cane.  How is it morally okay to enforce a product that causes so many people ill health?  The phasing out of all other light sources raises concerns for the human rights of those affected by LEDs.  How do we live our lives?</p><p> Solutions to allow me access to the town during the day would include simply retaining halogen traffic lights and pedestrian lights.  The bulbs are still available and the phase-out only started in September 2021.  It is possible that they can be stockpiled until we know more.  The older driver feedback displays on our local roads could be easily swapped with models from towns further afield.  The older models were installed less than three years ago and cause me no adverse reactions.  I ask to be consulted in advance over any changes so that I am not living on edge that something will change in my environment and I will need to suffer for days.  Should our councils be doing impact and disability assessments before making changes on our public roads, as is expected in other countries?</p><p> I also want to mention that I understand the transition to LEDs is being done with good intentions on the basis of energy efficiency, but this adds to the frustration.  Something can claim to be economical due to one measurement, but LED light is not what we believe it to be.  We have not achieved what we set out to do.  It was expected to generate a drop in energy consumption and light pollution, while research shows us that what is happening on a global scale is the opposite.  Ecologists tell us LED light is having a devastating impact on the ecosystem, insects and wildlife.  It could also be classed as hazardous waste due to the copper and nickel it leaches into landfill.  It is using rare earth minerals and putting pressure on natural resources.  It is not just the production process.  LEDs are difficult to recycle.  Even more resources will be used to recover valuable materials, if measures can eventually be put in place.</p><p> Finally, on 9 November 2021, the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions met to discuss three petitions submitted by a man in Germany regarding LEDs.</p><p>The committee called for it to be referred to the EU's IMCO stating, "Experts in medicine do raise alerts concerning the damage LED can cause.  We need to be alert to what could happen."  The EU's Scientific Committee for Health, Environment and Emerging Risks, SCHEER, 2018 report also acknowledges this technology is new and not enough research has been done yet.</p><p> New legislation has just been passed in 2021 to allow sensitive people like me obtain incandescent bulbs to light our homes.  LightAware lobbied for this for many years.  The bulbs are for domestic purposes.  This is an acknowledgement in itself that something is not quite right with LED.  However, how do we access civic life?  </p><p> In 2017, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, showed that we can use incandescent bulbs and they can be four times more efficient than LED.  Healthy light is an important ethical issue.  Nobody should live in pain and suffer social exclusion due to an artificial light source.</p></speech>

The Irish Thalidomide Association, ITA, welcomes the opportunity to be here today.  I am the spokesperson for the ITA and I am joined by my fellow survivor and committee member, Ms Jacqui Browne.  We thank the committee for the invitation and this great opportunity to tell it, from our point of view, what is going on.<br/><br/>The ITA represents the majority of about 40 survivors of the biggest pharmaceutical tragedy the world has ever seen who live in Ireland.  The drug, thalidomide, when taken for morning sickness, crossed the placenta barrier and damaged the baby in the womb.  We are thalidomide &quot;survivors&quot;, but we do not use that word lightly and the committee will understand why.<br/><br/>During the period 1959 to the mid-1960s, of the 100,000 babies injured <i>in utero</i>, 90,000 died as miscarriages.  Of the 10,000 babies born, 5,000 did not survive the birth or their first year of life due to their catastrophic injuries.  Today, 60 years later, there are approximately 4,000 survivors worldwide.  In Ireland, we number approximately 40 survivors, which includes both acknowledged thalidomide survivors and yet to be acknowledged survivors, who we call &quot;the unacknowledged&quot;.<br/><br/>It is a recognised medical fact that the late sequelae of thalidomide-related damages has brought a crop of unplanned, unprecedented and acutely painful further injuries over the past 60 years.  That is because of the overuse and misuse of our disabled limbs, missing limbs and shortened limbs, etc.  These ongoing injuries, along with the progressive internal damage that we have, as well as deterioration in our nerve endings, have resulted in many of our members living with daily and chronic pain.<br/><br/>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, provides a unique opportunity to improve the quality of life of disabled people, which includes Irish thalidomide survivors.  Article 5.1 of the convention seeks to recognise that all persons are equal before and under the law and are entitled to equal protection and benefit of the law.  Thalidomide survivors have been failed by this ideal, now and in the historical aspiration of Irish State law, when the child was purported to have the protection of the State.<br/><br/>It is difficult to understand how the non-ruling by the High Court of payments in the mid-1970s to Irish survivors, who were about 12-years-old at the time, happened, except to say that the State knew the court was unlikely to rule the settlements as adequate for catastrophically disabled children.  In the spirit of Article 5, at least in more modern times, the High Court ruled that an offer of &euro;62,500 to one of our members with severe intellectual and physical disability was wholly inadequate. <br/><br/>Article 5.3 of the convention is, to some extent, covered by the provision of reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities under the Equal Status Acts.  For the purposes of these Acts discrimination includes a refusal or failure by the provider of a service to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability by providing special treatment or facilities, if without such special treatment or facilities it would be impossible or unduly difficult for the person to avail of the service.</p><p> While I have a number of examples of this failure, I will just mention a couple of basic ones.  My first examples are the taking of blood samples in hospital and the taking of blood pressure.  When we present ourselves to doctors or hospitals, in particular, any medical professional person trying to take blood, blood samples or blood pressure from a person with no arms is faced with an immediate challenge; likewise, with our shortened arms.  The blood pressure machine does not work on our limbs.  Therefore, there is a challenge.  We have concrete evidence that survivors have been refused blood tests because staff in some public hospitals are not insured to take it from other parts of their bodies, such as legs.  Similar issues have arisen in relation to blood pressure and other medical devices to assess what our problem is and how ill we are.  Sadly, one of the most painful things that a thalidomide survivor undergoes is giving blood samples.  The nerve ending damage adds enormous pain to these simple medical necessities.  This process and, indeed, many medical procedures cause absolute terror and anxiety to our thalidomide family.  This is because we remember the trauma of years of medical intervention and investigation into our unique bodies as children, and that has left a legacy of fear in our adult life.  It is extremely hard in a chronically understaffed health system to expect the medical professional to deal with us adequately when we just walk in.</p><p> Our health and care system is extremely fragmented; it is disease-centred, difficult to navigate and does not consider the whole person.  As a result, many thalidomide</p><p>survivors have experienced poor quality care, often in the wrong settings and with undesirable outcomes.</p><p> There is also a significant variation and inequity in the way that services are organised, especially geographically, with unco-ordinated appointment scheduling, a lack of communication between providers and a frequent lack of capacity and resources within the required services.</p><p> Thalidomide survivors need a continuum of services, according to our unique needs over time and across different levels of the health system.  For healthcare and support to be integrated, it must be person-centred, co-ordinated and tailored to the needs and preferences of the individual.  This means moving away from episodic care to a more holistic approach to meeting our unique health and support needs.</p><p> The recent cost of disability research report published by the Department of Social Protection states that there are significant additional costs faced by individuals with a disability and that they are currently not being met by existing programmes or disability allowances.  On average, a disability can cost a disabled person from &euro;9,600 to &euro;12,300 per year.</p><p> Taking the 40 Irish thalidomide survivors as a microcosm of all that Article 5 and, indeed, the aspirations of the health service in Ireland aim to achieve, never has there been a more perfect example of a group of disabled people - a small group - now in their 60s, who have experienced significant barriers and inequality in their lifetime.</p></speech>

I lament that it is necessary.  I appreciate how courageous they are today and the nerves of being in a forum that can be seen on television.  I thank them most sincerely for that.</p> <p>  We have two very distinct groups here today.  However, we have a commonality of experience, in that there is a lack of accommodation and proper provision for "minority groups", to borrow a term from my own area of employment law, where we have a small distinct group that has distinct needs, and yet these needs are not being accommodated.</p><p>I will first turn to Ms Dennehy.  In the course of my political career, canvassing doors, I came across a lady who had a similar lived experience.  I had to put away my mobile phone and divest myself of everything to go into her home and sit and chat and listen to her.  It is a challenge to try and describe it to people outside that environment to get them to believe and accept that this is a reality.  I welcome this platform and others.  I am glad to see that it went to the EU.  We need to take seriously people's experience.  While Ms Dennehy's experience is of a more pronounced reaction there is probably a sliding scale of people who do not even realise that they are affected by LED devices.  They might dismiss it as migraine, headaches or mild experiences.  I would be interested to hear from Ms Dennehy and Ms Levin what we can do to accelerate that.  I have raised it with the joint committee on housing because that includes local government so there is a conversation going on behind the scenes there.  However, what would Ms Dennehy like from us?  Obviously, we need testing before there is a national or international roll-out of any system.  How do we ensure that testing where there is a small minority affected?  How do we bridge that gap?  It seems to me there is a shortfall in our test to establish symptoms and experience as a disability in order to empower people with the ability to have even a legal claim.  I would be interested in any advice that Ms Dennehy could give on that.  </p><p> I thank the Irish Thalidomide Association so much.  Its recent campaign at the Leinster House gates in particular brought home the association's case to everyone.  There is a direct connection between that day and today in airing its views.  I am horrified by its members' experience.  Ms Cassidy picked an example with blood testing and blood pressure that is so everyday for everybody.  It was exactly the right example to capture the survivors' experience.  I want to acknowledge that there is no such thing as post traumatic stress disorder, here, it is stress disorder and trauma all of the time.  From reading, documentaries and my attempts to educate myself over the years, I can only imagine what might have begun as test cases, ignorance and a life-long experience of that.  They are still experiencing it.  I do not understand how we do not have a specialist thalidomide care unit that can go on circuit around the country in order that a small group of specialists could come and visit.  As we can get the High Court to sit in circuit, I do not see why we could not apply that to medical care to make sure we have that universality of experience wherever people are living in the country.  The patients should not have to come to them, the services should come to the patients.</p><p> We are airing the issues but we need to turn it in to practical things that we seek.  What would the association like the committee to call for?  What would it like us to highlight?  From my experience, this committee will be more than delighted to do that for it.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.802" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jacqui Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022020300002#G00100"><p>I thank all the members for the opportunity to present before the committee today.  Ms Cassidy expressed the concerns and issues and highlighted the main facts for the thalidomide survivors very well.  The Senator asked what the committee can ask for on our behalf.  There are three key things.  Despite Article 5 of the convention and measures in Irish law, which was referred to, we still do not enjoy reasonable accommodation to enjoy a life of equality and equal access in Irish society.  I can give further examples to the ones which Ms Cassidy gave earlier.  Access is an issue.  Many disabled people do not have the right car or mobility transport and do not have the appropriate adaptations in their homes despite making applications and seeking such supports.  There are also people who are still fighting for justice in terms of access to appropriate medical supports and interventions but geographic issues get in the way.  I will give a practical example which is not unique.  Take someone who has a medical card.  We were meant to have the medical card since 1975.  It was given to all thalidomide survivors irrespective of means on an <i>ex-gratia </i>basis, that is, not on a statutory basis.  The problem is twofold.  First, some thalidomide survivors are still working.  Most of us are not.  Those who are not working tend to hold onto the medical card but those who are working and are in receipt of an income beyond the means are being denied their full medical card.  Even if you have the medical card, it can be difficult to get supports.  For example, I live in Kerry.  Some of the specialist supports that I need simply are not available in Kerry.  I fully appreciate that.  With respect, bringing the specialist units to Kerry will not work in some scenarios because the equipment and everything else is in Dublin so sometimes we do have to go to the centres of excellence, where they exist.  Getting the team to travel around the country is not a quick-fix solution.  If it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago.<br/><br/>The problem is the medical card.  For example, I had a very long fight, a ten year fight, with all my dental and oral issues, having that accepted.  Obviously, I went for treatment over the ten years to the Dublin Dental Hospital and paid out of my own pocket but I fought tooth and nail for a reimbursement of that.  However, it was a long fight and no one else was going to do the fight for me.  Why should it be up to people like me?  I am fortunate; I do have the capacity and am like a dog with a bone.  I will follow things up and follow the procedures but that should not have to be the case.  I am using myself as an example because it is my example and I can use it.  I know there are other instances of this geographic issue around accessing supports outside of one's county or health authority area or whatever other language they are going to put on the regions.  We currently have community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas, there is talk of local community care areas.  The language changes but does the service change?  To highlight that need for access would be great.  The committee could call out inequity of access and highlight the need for a genuinely full medical card and access and the problem of the inequity around reasonable accommodation.  That is a matter that is particularly crucial for thalidomide survivors.  Housing adaptation can be unique to everyone but especially thalidomide survivors.  The supporting documentation that we sent to the committee gives a perfect example where a professional expert was in someone's house and trying to enforce on them their opinion of what they thought the survivor wanted when the survivor did not want that at all.  We need to be listened to and respected.  It goes back to what Ms Cassidy said of the person-centred approach.  There are specialist supports available in other countries, such as Germany.  We need to have access where appropriate to either bring in external supports or that we can go for European supports ourselves too.  Those are the key things that I would highlight.  To enjoy equality sometimes we have to be treated differently.  That is a reasonable accommodation measure under Article 5.3 of the convention.</p></speech>

We have been in touch with Ms Dennehy for about five years and we have just seen how that noose has been tightening and that pressure has been increasing.  She had to move out of town because of the streetlights.  She could not go out because of the neighbouring lights.  Now she cannot get out of where she lives because of these traffic lights.  She is quite clear what she needs is help and a mechanism by which the older version of these lights and displays can be retained in the area around her and that there is support and advocacy for that.</p><p> That is one specific request but it is part of a bigger issue, namely, acknowledging Ms Dennehy is light-disabled and that light is a disability issue.  People like her are unable to work, socialise, access education or healthcare or really participate in society.  We are in touch with people all over the world.  In some countries, like Britain where I am, people are using the Equality Act, in some areas, to access and retain the lighting they need.  In Germany it has now been acknowledged as a disability and one individual has been given assistance so that if he cannot drive, he can be taken or accompanied to places.  This is a really big issue that is happening all over the world.  I feel what Ms Dennehy needs most is advocacy and a mechanism she can go to for support and to find how she can get help because, as the representatives of the Irish Thalidomide Association said, it is not always for the people suffering to be the ones campaigning.  People who cannot use computers or smartphones like Ms Dennehy especially need somebody they can go to when they have a problem with something who will help access the help they need.</p></speech>

It is good to see them all here this morning.  I have two questions that I will go straight into because I want to hear as much from our guests as possible.  Ms Cassidy mentioned in her statement the acknowledged and unacknowledged thalidomide survivors.  I would like to know a little more about the practical consequences that has for the survivors.</p> <p>  My other question is for LightAware.  I have family members who have light sensitivity though it is not to LEDs but compact fluorescent lamp, CFL-type lights.  It would be the same sensitivity, that is, an inability to operate within that environment.  There was a battle at her workplace for a change of lights.  It is really hard.  You almost feel like you are being gaslit or not believed.  I ask LightAware what are the best lights, on an international level?  I do not use CFL lights in my home for my family member and my friend.  It was touched on earlier but what can we do, as a committee, to ensure people are believed?  What are the best steps to take?  Are there any countries that have "shone brightly", for want of a better phrase, in looking after people with light sensitivity?  How long did it take for Ms Dennehy's condition to be acknowledged?  I can imagine many people said it was just her imagination.  That this was a real issue for her was not believed for an awfully long time.  The disability and condition she has must take an enormous toll on her as a person.  I suppose that is a personal question.  Ms Dennehy should feel free to be as candid as she wishes.</p></speech>

It was easy enough to avoid in the beginning but there came a time when I was completely overwhelmed.  That was probably about four to five years after that.  My close family and the people in my network understood and believed me because they saw it escalate from the very beginning and so it did not seem that unbelievable to them.  However, for somebody hearing it for the first time - it was maybe four or five years later before I started to tell people - it was considered unusual.  I felt uncomfortable about whether I would be believed or whether I would be considered crazy and about how I was picking up on this form of light when others were operating perfectly fine underneath it.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned CFLs.  I am not good under those and do not have them in my home either but I am fine with them from a distance or for short periods of time.  For me, there is a contrast between those two forms of light.  Fluorescent lighting has been mainly in workplaces and we had a choice of what light source to use in our homes up until very recently.  Whereas CFLs were being pushed in the 1990s they are now being phased out for health reasons as they are toxic in landfill.  However, with LEDs we are now replacing one problematic light with another.  LEDs are causing a whole host of other new symptoms people were not experiencing with CFL.  I was sensitive to CFL, just mildly.  The difference with LEDs is they are in every environment, unlike CFL.  Now we cannot obtain the normal light sources like halogen or CFL for consumers who are okay with it.  LEDs are in every appliance, including televisions, dishwashers, washing machines and microwaves and they are in power-on buttons and people's phones and watches.  They are absolutely everywhere on the streets and in car lights and more public spaces are now lit with LED now.  It is nearly a step-up from the CFL issue as we had more choices.  People who are sensitive to LEDs have no choice now as LEDs are the main source of lighting across the globe.</p></speech>

We would particularly like to raise the issue of what we call the "unacknowledged" thalidomide survivors.  I will explain.  The drug thalidomide was sold in Ireland, for example, in 1961.  Thalidomide is the ingredient in the drug that causes the damage.  Here it was sold under various trade names.  There were about ten.  One was packaged under the brand name Softenon.  In 1961, 51,000 packages of that drug were sold here in that year alone.  As I said, there were other forms of the drug in syrups, perhaps for a baby's soother to help with teething or for nerves.  A man could take it.  It was specifically the crossing of the placental barrier that caused the damage.  To give more detail, the specific days of the pregnancy on which the drug was taken caused specific damage.  For example, my mother probably took it on day 22 and day 23 and the arms were affected, as were my ears and there was the internal damage.  It depended on what you took.  That is why I was saying if somebody took it very regularly, they were one of those 90,000, sadly, who probably miscarried.</p> <p>  In the 1970s, when it was eventually agreed thalidomide was the cause of all these disabilities - and that was a long haul from birth to around 12 years of age - the State advertised and asked if children wanted to come forward.  It brought some experts from Germany and they set up the Irish Thalidomide Medical Board.  To this day, we are not sure how many people could have been affected in Ireland because there was a report undertaken, dictated by the Department of Health, around 1963 to look back at birth defects in Ireland.  It was done by a lady called Dr. Victoria Coffey and never published, so we cannot be sure of the numbers.  When we were 12 years of age people came forward.  We know from Government records that more than 100 children came forward.  These experts decided that 32 were recognised as thalidomide survivors.  However, in the intervening years, there has been huge medical investigation into the drug thalidomide, especially because it has some good qualities.  Members may have heard of its use in cancer treatment.  Medical knowledge of the working of thalidomide has improved in leaps and bounds.  We can now categorically say, and it is evidence-based, that there are other issues related to thalidomide that were just not picked up in the 1960s.</p><p>The medical board in the 1960s had the knowledge it knew then and disregarded many of the applicants because it was dealing in that knowledge at that time.  We know that for a fact because our unacknowledged survivors have been examined by world experts and told categorically that they are thalidomide survivors.  The committee could help us with something we need by explaining to the Government that there is new medical evidence and it would only be reasonable to allow those whom we call our members who are unacknowledged to come forward for a better and newer evaluation.</p><p> There are more records in Britain.  Here, sadly, when we were 12 our parents had to show evidential proof to that committee that our mothers had taken thalidomide.  I have sworn affidavits from the prescribing GP to my mother and the administration chemist down in Cork.  All of this evidential proof had to be shown to the committee.  How many people had the packet of a tablet 12 years after the event, especially when nobody was joining the dots to know that thalidomide was the cause of the damage at the time of the birth?  That was not a fair criterion to have put on them.</p><p> I have spoken to a few people in the UK about how mothers felt enormous guilt about taking this drug.  In some cases, they never admitted that they took it.  We know of cases where, on their deathbed, mothers broke down and apologised.  It was the first the survivors knew of their disability being caused by thalidomide.  For all of those reasons, it is only timely, 60 years later, to correct all those errors and allow these unacknowledged survivors to have a fair assessment using modern medical knowledge.</p><p> The State, through D&aacute;il questions and answers, regularly says it is open for all unacknowledged survivors to go to Germany to be assessed and the State will automatically accept those assessments.  However, I must stress an important point because we cannot seem to get it across to the Department of Health.  We now know that the criteria the Germans use in their assessments of thalidomide survivors are still very much based in that time of the 1960s criteria.  Those criteria have not moved with the times and do not embrace the more modern knowledge.  It is very important that we stress that the Department of Health cannot continue to suggest unacknowledged survivors go to the special Contergan Foundation in Germany for assessment.  We know it is flawed and it would only add insult to injury if the Department kept stressing that this was the mechanism open to the unacknowledged.  I hope that gives the Deputy some idea of the answer.</p></speech>

Their insights are invaluable in helping us understand the lived reality of disability and discrimination.  Unfortunately, we know disabled people are more likely to experience discrimination and for it to occur to them more frequently and it is more likely for it to have a serious impact on their lives.  Most worryingly, it is a reality that people with disabilities mostly encounter discrimination in our health services.</p> <p>  My questions are for the Irish Thalidomide Association.  There are no words for everything its members have endured throughout their lives, especially the discrimination they have all faced at the hands of the State.  At all stages, all they have asked for is justice.  Their statements today were a list of how the State and successive Governments have failed them with references to the UNCRPD.  In their opening statements, the witnesses discussed the failure to provide for equality under the law and referenced Article 5.1 that "all persons are equal" and how that has failed them.  It seems to be fundamental to the disgraceful treatment.  Would the witnesses mind elaborating on how they and other survivors have been failed by this principle and the impact it has had on their lives?</p> <p>  I hope that some good can come out of this meeting.  We have people come before committees all the time and, ultimately, something has to come from them taking the time to appear before us.</p><p>Would the witnesses mind outlining the supports they receive at present and the gaps and unmet needs there?  What changes are needed in the services to appropriately meet their needs?  That would give us an insight.  The witnesses referenced the principles of the UNCRPD.  We often discuss in this committee the need to ratify the optional protocol to the convention.  We have heard from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the UN special rapporteur on disability that we could ratify tomorrow.</p><p> When we have these public hearings, it is important for us to know what difference that would make to the witnesses' lived experience, when we hear about everything that is going on and how outrageous it is.  If the UNCRPD was ratified and the State was obliged to meet their needs, how much of an impact would that have and what unmet needs would be met?</p></speech>

I thank her for her insightful questions that show a depth of understanding and respect for the position in the Irish Thalidomide Association, which is most helpful.  The Deputy hit the nail on the head regarding the optional protocol.  What that would do for all disabled people, including Irish thalidomide survivors, is allow any individual to follow up and take a case or an issue to the UN, but only in the event the individual had exhausted all options in the State first.  One still has to go through all the mechanisms for seeking a resolution.  The optional protocol would be hugely helpful.</p> <p>  It would also allow for people to come together, although there is no such thing as class actions under the Irish legal framework.  The Deputy knows that better than I do.  At the same time, it would allow people to coalesce and work together.  We were promised originally that once the first State draft report to the UN convention was issued and presented to the UN, the optional protocol would be signed.  That was issued last year by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and we are still waiting.  It has not happened yet.  It is hoped that will happen soon.  We are waiting on the Minister to sign the optional protocol.  That is a game changer for all disabled people, including Irish thalidomide survivors, but people must appreciate one has to start locally before one can avail of it.</p> <p>  To come back to the gaps in the list, it would be great if we could give the committee the rest of the list with the services we need.  Ms Cassidy highlighted several times in her presentation and answers that our needs our unique.  One cannot come up with a shopping list that applies across the board to all 40 of us, but the number is small.  This is why we emphasise the issue of non-discrimination.  While our needs our unique, the solutions can be found and provided within this country.  However, it is not a one size fits all.  That is for sure.  Different people have different impairments and restrictions in day-to-day life.</p> <p>  Some of them are very easily dealt with but we need people to sit down and talk to us, meet us and respect our lived experience of 60 years.  We know the way we have lived for the past 60 years and what the issues are, where and how we get pain and what causes more pain for us, such as not having a piece of equipment, a motorised chair or the right adaptations in our houses.  However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.</p> <p>  To come back to where the Deputy started on equality before the law in Article 5.1, it is still the case in this country, and rightly so, that any settlement made in favour of a minor has to be adjudicated upon by the High Court.  An arrangement was issued before the High Court but the problem was that it was never ruled upon.  The "settlement" that was offered and given to our parents, albeit small lump sums of money, was never ruled upon by the High Court.  That is one of our big issues.</p><p>We cannot speak any more to that issue today but those are the historical facts.  We, as adults now at the age of 60, do not believe we have yet experienced equality before the law.  They would be the main factors I would like to bring to the committee's attention.  I would point to inequity, including geographic inequity, and lack of access.  Ms Cassidy rightly stated that there are other experts in the world to whom we need to have access, as appropriate, for both the acknowledged and unacknowledged thalidomide survivors.</p></speech>

Members of the committee would all be aware of the requirements to qualify for primary medical certificate to qualify as a disabled driver.  The wording of the primary medical certificate is specific.  To qualify for the certificate the applicant must not have the whole use of one hand, arm or leg.  As a result of the variety of disability in the arms of our members, ridiculously, we cannot say their whole arm is missing, but given how catastrophically disabled their arms are, it would be ludicrous such an applicant would fail to qualify for the primary medical certificate to enable them qualify as a disabled driver.  The simple provision of small adaptions or being able to purchase an automatic car, which our members could drive with their arms, is such a basic simple need.  When I used to drive a manual car, my good arm had to cross over the my body to lift the parking brake, etc.  It was a game changer to qualify to become a disabled driver.  I have helped other members complete an application to qualify for the primary medical certificate and it is a simple process, but their applications have been refused because, technically, they have two arms and account is not taken of how disabled those arms are.  The simple provision of that certificate would be a game changer for this small group of people.</p> <p>  The county councils award grants for house adaptions.  Due to the lack of funding in county councils throughout the country, we have almost no evidence of any thalidomide survivor qualifying for some of those grants.  In fairness to the Department of Health, there are attempts to help with certain provisions.  Some of us have got a few items.  However, there are ludicrous situations, for example, where somebody with virtually no arms or with little fingers from their shoulders are getting some house adaptions to use motorised aids similar to a television remote control which they could use with their teeth and some of their fingers, for example, to open and close curtains or blinds.  We have a case where the blind was approved but the material in the blind was not.  The silliness of the minutiae of the daily living in the applications to be made and the fights and struggles become really tiresome when our members are physically not well and in pain.  Sometimes for our members it is easier just not to ask because the fear of refusal and being declined is wearying and we have experienced it for years.  As Ms Browne said, if we were listened to, we have very simple solutions to many of our needs.  They would be able to be taken off the list so simply.</p></speech>

They would be the old incandescent bulbs and for our streets generally it would be the sunbeam street lights we have had for decades.  They are considered the most healthy light sources.  I will pass over to my colleague, Ms Levin, who will comment further on this as she would have more expertise in that area than I would have.</p></speech>

LightAware, which is a small charity, campaigned very hard to get an exemption included in EU law in order that people who cannot tolerate the current forms of lighting can at least access incandescent or halogen bulbs to light their homes.</p><p>It is not a mechanism whereby a person suffering from this sensitivity would to be able to work or go out but it is an acknowledgement that people need to be able to light their own spaces.</p><p> We were asked what are the best types of light?  Sadly, they are not widely available.  One action the committee could take would be to examine the exemption in EU law for people who need alternative forms of light to enable them to access those and see how that could work in practice.  For Ms Dennehy and many other people we hear from, whether they go to their doctor or pharmacy, while it is all very well having this written in the law, how do they get a light bulb to light their homes?  The committee could take on that challenge.</p></speech>

I especially welcome Ms Dennehy to the meeting.  She is a very brave person whom I met probably ten years ago.  She worked in a jewellers in Tuam at one stage, which is where my wife and I first met her.</p> <p>  I have had conversations with Ms Levin from LightAware in recent years.  I will speak to this issue first.  Ms Dennehy articulated what her life is like.  From my perspective, as a local person, I know the terrain of the environment in which she lives.  I have been in her house.  I know where she was living in Tuam from where she had to move.  They are all very nice places to live.  For Elaine, there seem to very few places where she can live and have a life.  The sensitivity issue Ms Dennehy suffers from is so severe that when the council was carrying out roadworks and put up temporary lights, it closed off an access avenue for her while that work was taking place.  The difficulty with the local authorities is that they will say these are the lights that are now available.  There is some old stock of lights available but there is a great lack of awareness of the actual issue.</p> <p>  This issue has been discussed in Europe and elsewhere.  There seems to be a drive to install energy-efficient lights everywhere, but that policy may be leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.  It is an issue for the specifiers of public lighting, temporary lights and driver feedback display signs.  Ms Dennehy had to deal with forecourt lighting, which was being left on all day, a few weeks ago, which meant she could not go into a shop to buy groceries or put petrol in her car.  For those who cannot tolerate this lighting, it comes down to very simple things that we take for granted.  </p> <p>  There is a large of body of work to be done by legislators to make people aware of this issue.  This discussion today is only a step in that direction.  I thank the committee for inviting Ms Dennehy and Ms Levin to participate in this session.  We need to continue to highlight this issue to bring about change where it needs to be made.  The Departments of Transport and the Environment, Climate and Communications, as well as the local authorities, need to be made aware of what is wrong in this respect.  In addition, with respect to the lights Ms Dennehy mentioned, we should return to the old-fashioned lights we had for years, which gave light and were effective.  We must examine the issue in the context of the impact it will have on people's health if we do not address it.  That will be a major task.  It may have to be addressed in Europe again but until it is tackled nationally, the local authorities will have to follow whatever policies are in place.</p><p>I do not have any questions for Ms Dennehy because I know exactly what the situation is.  I cannot imagine the entire situation but she has articulated it to me so often that I do not need to ask any questions.  LightAware is an advocacy group based in the UK and maybe we need to encourage it to form a branch in Ireland or take on the Irish situation and try to get it on to the national agenda.  No matter how Ms Dennehy describes it, it still does not give the full picture of what she is living through, has lived through and continues to live through.  Today is just about telling legislators about it, so well done to her on that.</p><p> Ms Cassidy and Ms Browne also spoke about thalidomide and the issues they have.  I understand that the housing adaptation grants funded by the local authorities do not cover the cost fully and are also means tested.  Someone working and with an income of over &euro;40,000 cannot get any support.  It goes back to the UN Convention on Human Rights and the protocols that need to be brought in.  Having a person-centred approach to support is the key.  Both Ms Cassidy and Ms Browne made that point and I wrote it down.  We have been raising the issue of transport support schemes, their demise and the cancellation of some schemes since 2011.  Now we find that the primary medical certificate scheme is in disarray as the appeals board has resigned because the scheme was not fit for purpose.  We have been doing work on that.  We as a committee are putting pressure on but we also need to continue to meet people like the witnesses, who can articulate exactly what they are experiencing in such a comprehensive way.  I compliment them on that.</p><p> My questions have already been asked so I will not ask the witnesses to answer any questions.  I just want to say to them that I and all the members are on this committee because we want to be on it.  We were not nominated by anybody.  We want to be on it.  That is our strongest motivation.  I would also say to Ms Dennehy not to lose hope.  Sometimes we find that we cannot make progress, and it is going to be a struggle to make progress, but this committee has a better understanding following her presentation and Ms Levin's contribution today.  I thank them for that.  I do not have any questions as such, unless someone wants to make a comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.829" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jacqui Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022020300002#O00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He has reflected very well the support we feel we are getting from members of this committee.  That is hugely appreciated by the members of the Irish Thalidomide Association.  I assure him that his kind words of support are appreciated by all of us.  I agree with everything he has said.  All the questions that have come from members of the committee have illustrated very clearly that there are significant gaps in the intersections between Departments that must be addressed.  We are so siloed in this country.  Everything is siloed into different Departments and never the twain shall meet.  That is a big issue and we are the ones who lose out around the pots of money.</p> <p>  The core concern for thalidomide survivors is in the area of transport.  The Deputy has already highlighted some of the issues there.</p><p>Housing is another issue, as is health.  The means testing is disingenuous.  It flies in the face of what we were promised in 1975 by the then Minister for Health, Brendan Corish.  He said that all our needs would be met irrespective of means.  Some of the meagre allowances we get are tax-free under the Finance Acts.  Logically, if that income is tax-free then why do we have to go through means testing at another level?  There is a total conflict there that needs to be resolved.  Thalidomide survivors are a very small and unique group.  There will not be more of us.  It happened during a very specific period of time, three or four years in Ireland, so it is not like there are 2,000 or 5,000 people behind us waiting to come in the door.  For the sake of 40 people I strongly ask the committee to consider calling for the removal of means testing for thalidomide-specific grants, be those related to housing, health or transport.  That would be huge.</p><p> I will make an observation, in order to emphasise that are need are unique.  This is based on my personal experience, although I do not often talk about personal experiences in public forums because my personal life is my personal life.  I had a massive fight over ten years ago, which boiled down to trying to gain access to something that is generally available to the population at large, namely, the treatment abroad scheme.  I have had several surgeries over my lifetime but this time I needed extremely complex orthopaedic surgery as I had been carrying a number of fractures for a number of months.  I ended up visiting more than 13 different surgeons in this country.  Every single one of them agreed what needed to be done but none of them would touch me because they did not have the expertise and the surgery would be beyond them.  They said I needed to go abroad.  I went to Germany and found a team there that would resolve the issue and offered to do this surgery - or surgeries, as it turned out.  I came back to Ireland and applied for the treatment abroad scheme but I was refused.  I was turned down.  I ended up paying for that myself privately out of my own pocket.  Being the dog with a bone that I am, I pursued it after I came back, while I was also quite ill.  There is the trauma of dealing with your own health and the trauma of dealing with the State and trying to justify what you believe is your right to the treatment abroad scheme.  That scheme is open to any member of the public, not just thalidomide survivors.  It eventually got settled but it went all the way to the High Court.  However, it did not end up in court because as usual, after both the State and I having spent an awful lot of money, it settled.  I just wanted to share that simple example.  Why do we still have to keep fighting and fighting?  It is exhausting.</p></speech>

We spoke about Ms Dennehy's case but it is not just her.  There are many people in Ireland and all over the world dealing with this issue and it is important that we broaden this.  Ms Dennehy has been very brave in coming here and speaking today.  There are big accessibility issues with coming here.  I have just received an email from someone dealing with the European Parliament and it has acknowledged this issue and spoke about lessons learned.  It is also very important from the disability and accessibility angle to realise that not everybody can do screens.  In this current Covid environment, people are even more disabled by not being ale to participate on Zoom and Teams.  Ms Dennehy has a friend helping her today but someone who did not have a friend to help could not do that.</p><p>It is an accessibility issue for the committee to be aware of in that this LED technology is also our means of communication and that is what people are cut off from.  I am grateful for this opportunity to share these stories and to Deputy Canney for acknowledging what has been going on.</p></speech>

I have been in contact with him for many years.  He has been a source of support and has helped me have my voice heard.  I also thank LightAware, of course, for all the support it has given me in the past few years and even for the acknowledgement that there are many other people around the world just like me.  I guess I do not feel as crazy.  From the start, I wondered if it was just me and why everybody else was okay with this technology.  I am thankful to all the members of LightAware and to Deputy Canney for the opportunity to be heard today.</p></speech>

I apologise that I had to leave the meeting to take oral questions with Ministers in the D&aacute;il.  I was here for some of the witnesses' statements and I read them prior to the meeting.  I apologise if I repeat what others have said or if I ask the same questions.  If I ask a question that has already been answered, the witnesses do not have to answer it again.  I can watch the recording of the meeting.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Dennehy for sharing her personal experiences with LED lighting.  It is an issue that the majority of people are not aware of.  I discussed it with my party spokesperson on climate action.  He was not aware of this issue.  He had thought, as many of us do, that LED lighting was the way to go and that it was a climate-friendly action to replace lights with LED lighting.  I suggest that we share this information, on the effect of LED lighting, with the Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  It was said that it has an effect on wildlife and the ecosystem.  It is important that we also share information on that.  If there are any reports on that, I ask that the witnesses send them to us and we will share them with the committee.  There is not sufficient knowledge on this issue.  I am not sure how many are affected or how prevalent it is but it does not matter if it is a small or a large number.  It needs to be taken into account when we look at our LED lighting system.  Has it been considered by the National Disability Authority, NDA, universal design team?  When it draws up universal designs, is it aware of LED lighting and is it factored in to what it is doing?</p> <p>  I thank Ms Cassidy and Ms Browne for sharing their stories.  It is heartbreaking to hear that they still have to fight for supports.  It is the same story we hear from every family where there is a disabled person.  Individuals or families with a disabled child are still fighting for supports.  There should be a system whereby everybody is told what they are entitled to.  They should not have to look for it.  They should not have to fight for it.  If people are entitled to something, they should know they are entitled to it and be able to access it.  I refer to the issue of being promised something.  It was indicated that Brendan Corish - we are going way back - promised supports and they were never implemented and people are still fighting.  It is dreadful.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses find that medical professionals are more knowledgeable of thalidomide?  Obviously, they work with a number of medical personnel, but are all medical personnel aware of this?  It was said that it is a small number and it, therefore, should not be difficult to ensure those who need to know, know.  It was described how difficult it is to give blood.  That is something very basic and it should be understood.</p> <p>  I have a couple of comments and questions.  I understand if the witnesses have already covered them.  They do not need to come back to me.</p></speech>

As she said, we do not like to have to tell our personal stories but that is the problem when you are one of so few people in the country, nearly everybody knows the individual in their parish who is a thalidomide survivor and then they end up explaining</p> <p>  I refer to the medical care, I know Ms Browne might have an addition to this.  When we talk about Brendan Corish in the 1970s, there was an idea at that stage that we were the survivors of this catastrophic event and we were not expected to live much past our 20s or 30s.  There was no plan.  Many of our parents were told that their children would not survive that long and that they should make the most of the life they had etc.  To our credit, when we reached our 20s, many survivors led phenomenally independent lives as disabled people.  I spent virtually my whole life pretending I was not disabled.  We tried very hard to do normal things our normal way.  In fairness to us, we go on with that.  It was the onset of middle age that brought us back together, as well as the crop of unprecedented reactions in our bodies.  Our bodies began to cave in.</p> <p>  The Department had not heard from us in 35 years.  We were a bit of a surprise when we came back out of the woodwork because very little had needed to be done in the interim years because of the independence of the disabled persons in our little group.  The Department needs to realise that aside from the thalidomide issue, it is the overuse and misuse of those disabled limbs, doing things that the bodies with disabilities were never expected to do, that has taken this later toll on our bodies.</p> <p>  Deputy Tully asked about the medical professionals.  The problem is that some of us are actually quite healthy.  We are in a lot of pain but we are not ill.  When we go to see a doctor, it is usually because of acute pain and bone-related issues.  If we have to apply to the local area care unit or the HSE, there are waiting lists for physiotherapy and everything for years.  When we have made that strain, the pain is exacerbated there and then multiplied hundreds of times, and we need to access services immediately.  It is safe to say that among our group many of us have, maybe locally, worked with our own physiotherapists that we have been paying our own money to because they take the time to understand and assess our needs, as private clients, and work with us continually.  If we go to the HSE and ask for physiotherapy, I know in my area there was a two-year waiting list.  That will not work for anybody on any level.  A person attending will not get the same person consistently.  It will be a twenty-minute slot whereas we have invested personal time and personal money in many cases to find the experts in our area who can relieve our pain and manage our condition.</p> <p>  I remember a story of one of the more disabled people in a wheelchair who had dislocated a shoulder.  The person presented to accident and emergency but the orthopaedic surgeon on duty that night wanted to relocate the shoulder in a normal way.  The surgeon got the bright idea that if they X-rayed both shoulders, they would copy whatever was on the other so that they would match.  They could not understand that both shoulders had unique bone deformities and were completely different.  The bones could not be corrected in that way.  Many of us have experienced that.</p> <p>  We need a scheme where we are in charge of our own destiny.  We have invested the best resources of ourselves in finding the solutions.  The fragmented HSE system is not working and sadly is not a fit for us.  The Government and the Department, as well as Members of the Oireachtas, need to understand that.  Our solution is more cost effective because it is direct.  It does not need a lot of paper work or bureaucracy.  As Ms Browne said, we know what will fix us and when it will fix us.  That is where we need that support.  Has Ms Browne something to add?</p></speech>

There might be at most a straddle of three years.  We will not be around an awful lot longer.  The exposure for the State, in terms of costs, is not much in the big scheme of things.  Where is the justice in terms of affording us some dignity and quality with the rest of our lives, considering, particularly in the past ten years, as Ms Cassidy highlighted, the ever and rapid decreasing physical capacity among many of our survivors?  We may not be physically ill, but our physical abilities and physical strength, for example, is rapidly declining.</p> <p>  We need a lot more support, including, by the way, which we had not mentioned her - and it was remiss of me to forget to mention it - personal assistant, PA, supports.  I know the committee will be well aware, because I am involved in another space, and, indeed, I have been at committee meetings here previously, of the area of personal assistance scheme.  That needs to be legislated for.  There is a good campaign, that the committee will be well aware of, working with the Independent Living Movement Ireland.  If that is brought in, that would also be very much available to us as thalidomide survivors.</p> <p>  There are things that, like that, are creative, unique and flexible, for instance, a system such as a personal assistance scheme.  Indeed, there was reference to Ms Elaine Dennehy having support here today to be at this meeting.  A personal assistant would and should be equally available to somebody such as Ms Dennehy.</p> <p>  There are things that are universal solutions for all of us that we would love to see the committee pushing for on a legislative basis.  They would be the main points.  We must be allowed the choice.  The UN convention clearly identifies choice, control and independence, especially, for us, when it comes to matters such as health assessing.</p> <p>  To address Deputy Tully's final question around the medical profession, the problem with the medical profession is they change.  They go through GP training schemes and hospital training schemes.  They are ever-changing these teams of doctors as they go through their training practices after basic medical training.  You might have just educated a group of people in a hospital setting but you could be back six months later and have a whole other new group of people looking at you as if you had ten heads.  I am very fortunate.  Personally, I have a wonderful GP.  Every year, because he is involved in the GP training scheme, he contacts me and asks me to come over and I do an education class with some of his trainees on site.  I am involved in a way with the GP training scheme.  Indeed, I have been invited to do more work with them in due course.  In any event, there is awareness there but, because the numbers are so small and we are dotted right around the country, it would not be practical or possible for every medical professional to know everything about thalidomide because it is not that simple.  Part of the training of any medical professional is about communication skills.  Once they have the communication skills and once they have the capacity and the willingness to stop, listen and hear what we have to say, then we are on the right road.</p></speech>

There is a whole body of research and reports that I can forward to the committee as requested.  That would be no problem.  For example, a recent study found it expected to observe a drop in illuminated areas captured by the satellite.  Among those countries observed, 20 of them had an increase of 150% or more of their light at night since the introduction of LED street lighting and outdoor LED.  Another 60 countries saw increases between 110% and 150%.  That research is important because it proves that light pollution continues to grow despite the transition to LED.</p> <p>  It is also a case of what you measure.  Some people can claim to be economical due to the measurement of watts per lumen in the light fitting, but if you look at the total environmental impact, the resources used, the difficulties in recycling it and all of the disposal issues, and anything leaking into landfill such as copper and nickle, LED is not what you think it is.</p><p>We are just measuring watts per lumen.  There are many other studies that I have in front of me as well and I can send that all on to the committee.  This impact on wildlife, insects and nature is growing.  We all need darkness at night, including animals, plants and trees.</p><p> Ms Levin may be able to answer on the design part of the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.843" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Levin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022020300002#T00200"><p>I thank Ms Dennehy.  To add to that, there is an irony that this transition to LED lighting was purported to be on environmental grounds but it has caused an environmental problem throughout the world because the perception of it being cheap and energy efficient means we have much more lighting.  Light is time in the natural world.  Every creature on earth is light sensitive.  It is not just Ms Dennehy but every tree, flower and bird.  When we have too much light, it messes with those systems and cues.  Ironically, the most energy-efficient form of LED lighting that we have in many of the street lights is very blue and bright and is the most environmentally damaging.  There is something that needs to be addressed here.</p> <p>  There was a question contained in the question about how many people are affected as well.  One of the previous members answered that to some extent by talking about the sliding scale.  There are people, such as Ms Dennehy, who are very severely sensitive to light and who we describe as light disabled.  They are unable to continue to live a normal life.  There are people lower down the scale who get headaches, have sleeping problems or skin disorders or may exhibit anxiety.  It affects them in different ways but they are pretty much able to function.  Then there are people who do not even know or think they are affected but those blue lights that are upsetting the natural world are also changing human sleep patterns and circadian rhythms.</p> <p>  Circadian rhythm governs not only waking and sleeping but every physiological process in the body from the salve neural to blood sugar.  Therefore, light needs to be taken much more seriously.  The Irish Thalidomide Association is talking about how things are seen in very separate departments and this is one of the problems that has happened with light.  Maybe it is seen as a product, like a kettle or a fridge, and we are regulating on those grounds, but it should be treated with the respect and care shown when we develop medicines because it affects every cell in the body.  There is a big issue here of taking light more seriously.  We cannot say how many are affected unless we qualify what we mean by affected.  There is a significant body of people who are adversely affected and it is impacting on their quality of life.  It is a big question of their human rights.</p> <p>  Could the design question be repeated?  I was not sure which member asked it.</p></speech>

The drive for energy-efficient products was about working with the designers to make sure things are designed but it comes back to the same issue that they were looking at one measurement, which is watts per lumen.  Even that is contested.  When we look only at energy efficiency, we are not looking at the environmental impact, the materials, recycling, the disposal issues or the wider impacts on ecosystems.  It was a well-intended process that has to some extent gone wrong.</p></speech>

I have certainly learned a great deal, in particular from Ms Dennehy and Ms Levin, because I would not really have been aware of the issues they have spoken about regarding direct exposure to LED.</p><p>LED is everywhere and will increasingly come onstream so I can only begin to imagine its impact in terms of trying to carry out the functions of daily life.  Ms Dennehy has said that she had to move home and that is really a difficult situation to be in.  I imagine that local authorities have a big role to play, particularly in terms of street lighting, etc.</p><p> Deputy Tully made a point about universal design.  This committee has had presentations here and we, as a committee, have been very strong advocates for the introduction of universal design to meet the challenges and issues concerning people who have types of disability.  Sensory disability is a different type of disability that has come within our scope.  I believe that sensory disability needs to be incorporated and I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  </p><p> I am aware of issues that had an impact on the lives of people with thalidomide, and of course I am aware of the history and background.  A number of years ago I met a young man, who is the same age as me, with thalidomide and I worked with him to address some of his challenges and issues.  At that time I was quite shocked to learn that there were not more State supports available.  I was absolutely shocked that people with thalidomide did not have automatic access to a medical card and had to fight for it every two years.  This particular gentleman sought free travel as he lived 60 miles outside of Dublin city and needed free trade to access medical appointments, etc.  We fought his case on a number of levels but did not get anywhere so I totally understand the needs and challenges.</p><p> The unmet costs of living with thalidomide are quite high.  Perhaps the association could comment on that.  Please also outline the appropriate care interventions that are needed and the existing gaps.  These matters may have been covered when I stepped out of this meeting to attend to another duty and I am interested in hearing all responses.   </p></speech>

So straightaway we have a health light source that could be used easily in homes and workplaces.  It would be more difficult to get it into springs and homes but it could be used to supply street lighting.  So we can do something, it just has not been examined yet.  I have nothing else to add.</p></speech>

Some people think that energy efficient technology means we can put lights everywhere but we may achieve greater savings if we make sure that the energy used comes from a renewable source and that we used less light.  Therefore, we must guard against focusing too much on one measurement.</p><p>Senator O'Loughlin asked a question about unmet costs.  I had a hip replacement so I had to access physiotherapy twice a week and this was during a time of Covid, which did not help.  The only thing to do is to have the person who knows your body to help one recover and come to one's home.  As this was during Covid, a home session cost &euro;75.  The Government, every time it replies to a D&aacute;il question, loves to state how much thalidomide survivors receive.  The bottom line is that we get &euro;16 a day or if one has no arms and no legs the sum is &euro;37 a day.  What happens when one requires physiotherapy that costs &euro;150 every week, which is a basic cost, and must pay for all of the other costs?  That is the finer detail.</p><p> I am the spokesperson for the group and I know our members very well at this stage.  We are very proud of our friendships because we are so unique.  We can feed off each other in terms of what works and what does not work.  In fact, we have a very big connection with international thalidomide survivors.  What I find with the geographical spread, which we mentioned, is that some of our people are very out on the margin and do not think that it is an automatic and basic need to get preventative physiotherapy and preventative treatment to help maintain the level that they have now deteriorated to.  People are not inclined to spend their money on that because they find it hard to accumulate money.</p><p> I will refer to another matter.  The Irish State, in its dealings with us, mentions in D&aacute;il answers, which are in the public domain and I am not saying anything that I should not, the money we get from Germany because we have a separate thing going on there.  More recently, in 2013, the German Government did not feel the need or took a very narrow view of the survivors who live outside of Germany and the Irish beneficiaries of the German foundation.  They brought in a law and said that if people get a payment from another jurisdiction or source, then they deduct the equal amount from our pension.  We have had to take a separate issue to the German courts and that fight is ongoing.  At the moment, and for many it is at least eight years, the German Government, under the auspices of the foundation, insists that we need to send a letter from the Department of Health to say that we get &euro;16 or &euro;37 a day and then the Germans deduct that amount from our payment.  They view this money as a double payment - one from German and one from Ireland - but in fact it is not, which is why we have brought a case all the way to the supreme court in Germany because in Germany the supports are far better.  The physio needs and alternative medicine needs are almost mandatory for thalidomide survivors, plus people can access them with very little bureaucracy.  We found a complete difference here Ireland.  We have had to fight that as well as conduct our ongoing campaign.</p></speech>

We are very fortunate in the thalidomide community and internationally that we have a couple of very interested epidemiologists who have spent their entire professional lives researching, among other issues, the epidemiology of thalidomide survivors worldwide.  One interesting medical fact, and we know it because we are living it, is that while we are all roughly 60 years of age, our bodies are like those of people who are 80 or 85 years.  Therefore, one must factor that aspect into our ongoing future needs, be they physiotherapy, occupational therapy, equipment, new cars or whatever.  It is impossible to give a nice list of the care and intervention needs.</p><p>This goes back to us being unique.  Each one of the 40 people is unique.  Some have very high-level needs.  One member and survivor needs a very high level of care and support while there are others who might appear to have fewer care and intervention needs.  It concerns very practical matters.  I cannot do a weekly shop on my own because I cannot lift stuff.  I live on my own so I need support to do that.  I could pay &euro;8 for home delivery and might not get what I want because I have to pick it off a menu on a computer.  That does not represent choice, freedom and control.  They are the practical simple examples.  It would be wrong of us to prescribe, suggest and give the committee a list of our care and intervention needs today.  We wish to highlight our need to have choice and control over our lives and the need for the State to show flexibility in its response to meeting us where we have identified our unique needs.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for appearing before us.  Listening to Ms Dennehy really opened my eyes to the little things we take for granted on a daily basis.  I heard the figure of 40 people.  For me, that is 40 people too many living in inequality due to disability needs.  I would not use the word "easier" but the State could put something in place to make 40 people's lives much easier.</p> <p>  Ms Browne spoke about reports and laws from 1975.  I am 32 years of age.  I am even trying to think about 1975.  We need to update our policies and review them in this committee.  I live in rural Ireland and know how difficult life can be there.  Funnily enough, I was born and reared in Dublin where there are hospitals all over the place.  Trying to get to a hospital that is 50 minutes away from where one lives is very difficult for people who can drive or get lifts from friends.  It is very difficult to get buses in rural Ireland.  Ms Browne spoke about being listened to.  People want to be listened to.  It is grand that we as politicians and legislators listen but it is not just about listening.  It is about listening but the recommendations the witnesses give us today are extremely important for going forward.  We may be talking about 40 people but this is an awful lot of people who have this issue and they need to be listened to.  I do a lot of work with independent living.  It should be included in independent living programmes and care assistants who support people on a daily basis because there are no better people to speak than the people who are living through it.  I thank Ms Dennehy so much for being honest and open with the committee.</p> <p>  I do not have many questions.  One question is really important but I am sure it has already been answered.  Do the witnesses think there is enough protection under Irish law for people like them?  I have heard them speak about accommodation and transport and, obviously, the witnesses do not feel protected.  It would be nice to hear from people about what this committee could do to make life easier.  I again thank the witnesses for coming before us today and educating me about the effects of LED light because I did not have a clue about it.</p></speech>

I am not sensitive to the sun and I do not need sunglasses on the brightest of days but LED technology is so new that there is no legislation for something as specific as that.  At the end of the day, I suffer from migraine and new daily persistent headache, NDPH, which are considered disabilities.  There are people with disabilities who are covered under Irish legislation but there is nothing specific for LED or artificial light sensitivity.</p></speech>

Fair dues to her.  We respect that immensely - no better woman than Senator Flynn, who has years of fighting on behalf of the Traveller community behind her.  We have an awful lot in common.  One of our thalidomide survivors comes from a Traveller background so that is very important and I know it is very close to the Senator's heart.</p> <p>  We have answered some of the Senator's questions about how we resolve the issues around access to transport and hospitalisation.  I also live in rural Ireland.  I live in County Kerry in the south west, which is the guts of 200 miles from Dublin.  Most of my medical interventions had to happen in Dublin.  Some happened abroad.  I spent my childhood in a special setting in Dublin.  I spent two and a half years in a school for the deaf so my family and I know all about being isolated from your family in a residential setting.  </p> <p>  There is a lot of history that we can share but the Irish Thalidomide Association is much more focused on the here and now and the future.  We all own our history so we can do what we wish with it but I am much more focused on us living the rest of our lives as best we can with dignity, independence and respect for our rights and being able to enjoy those rights.  Under Article 5, it is not just about securing our rights.  We are meant to be able to enjoy rights.  That is the core principle behind non-discrimination legislation.  This is very specific - having the right to enjoy your life.  We are getting too old to be fighting all the time.  The committee's support is hugely appreciated.  We keep saying "please go fight the good fight and represent us".  We did it for Covid.  We removed walls of bureaucracy.  We removed barriers left, right and centre to address Covid.  Why can we not do the same for people experiencing discrimination, trauma and an ongoing uphill struggle?  It is very simple.  </p></speech>

I draw attention to the social model of disability and how people can be disabled by their environment.  There are people who are disabled by specific forms of lighting.  Somebody mentioned CFLs earlier.</p><p>That is also problematic for many people who have no other physical issue or no precondition, but who have been disabled by the environment around them.  That is something that needs to be taken seriously.  It has been acknowledged in German law now.  Precedents are coming.</p><p> I wanted to put the question to the committee.  We were asked if we feel there is enough protection under Irish law.  LightAware is a small charity run by volunteers.  Most people are light sensitive and struggling with computers themselves.  It is a question we have been trying to ask and find answers to for five years, whether there is any protection under Irish law for somebody who cannot work, cannot live without extreme pain and suffering, cannot travel, cannot access medical care, and really cannot function and do the basic things.  I was moved when Ms Dennehy said she was unable to go to the park, to church or to visit her parents' grave.  I am no expert in the law of any country but I would like to put that as a question.  Is there any provision for the human rights of somebody who is disabled and tortured by lighting?</p></speech>

I met our guests a while ago.  I am not sure if I missed some of the questions or if I am repeating some of them. Can they discuss what supports survivors of thalidomide receive and the gaps in the unmet need?  Where does Ms Browne feel there are big gaps?  Ms Browne might have discussed this.  What changes are needed in the disability service to appropriately meet survivors' needs?  Does Ms Browne feel this is recognised as a disability or what does she feel about that?</p> <p>  I have one other question in regards to the migrants and the integration policies and how policies need to be strengthened to allow individuals live in communities.  Is there a lack of funding?  Is there a lack of supports working through local authorities or other groups?  If these questions have not been asked, maybe the witnesses could come back to me with answers to them.  I thank our guests and apologise for being in and out of the meeting.</p></speech>

Out of fairness, I do not want to repeat myself too much.  Ms Cassidy outlined the current supports.  There are money-based supports and then there are supports that we are meant to have.  The problem is that these supports are not universal around the country.  We highlighted geographic issues.  We know that this is an issue generally, particularly with the health service in Ireland, that some barriers are often geographically based.  Even if you have a medical card, and you are living in Kerry, it is difficult to access the same service in Dublin with your medical card because that is a community healthcare organisation, CHO, area.  There are practical so-called "systemic bureaucratic" barriers as opposed to inherent ones.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's question about whether we believe that we are accepted and identified as disabled people, absolutely and quite definitely, thalidomide survivors very much are disabled people.  We are disabled people in the context of the social model of disability, which is that the societal and political legal framework is what disables us, but - to create the distinction, clarity and understanding - our impairments are based on being thalidomide survivors.</p><p>We all need to live with impairments but our disability derives from the way society interacts with us, including the State and its institutions.  Those are the main comments and I do not want to repeat everything we said.  We have described in some detail the unmet need, the lack of joined-up thinking and the lack of response to a very small group of unfortunate people in this country. </p></speech>

There was discussion on the ecosystems.  I would appreciate if all that could be made available to the committee.  The Irish Thalidomide Association has again put the spotlight on the primary medical certificate and the costs involved for people living in rural communities to access services in the large urban centres.  Commitments given 40 or 45 years ago still have not been met.  We need to follow up on the issues relating to that.  We need to ensure we are giving a voice to them through our committee and we intend to do that.  We will reflect on the evidence given this morning.  If the witnesses want to add anything further, no matter how insignificant they may feel it is, I ask them to send it to us and we will ensure it is forwarded.</p> <p>  I thank our members for their dedication to the committee and their work on it.  We are in a new setting now; I believe this is the first meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters that is actually physically meeting.

We are joined from An Taisce by Mr. Gary Freemantle, interim chief executive officer Mr. Ian Lumley, head of advocacy, and Dr. Mark Clinton, monuments and antiquities.  We are also joined from Archaeology Ireland by Dr. Sharon Greene, from the Local Authority Archaeologist&rsquo;s Network by Dr. Ruth Johnson, network chairperson, and from Transport Infrastructure Ireland by Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Swan, head of archaeology and heritage.  I thank them all for their attendance here today, for their submissions and opening statements in advance, and for assisting us in trying to craft this legislation so that it is fit for purpose.</p> <p>  On privilege, I must remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in the public meetings.  For those attending the meetings remotely from within the Leinster House complex, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I will ask our expert witnesses to make their opening statements and we will then move to a questions and answers session with members.  To keep the meeting flowing we will keep those segments to seven minutes, which is seven minutes in total for the question and the answer.  We have much expertise both online and in the room so if members wish to put a question directly to one of our witnesses, that would also be helpful.  If any of the witnesses wish to contribute they may raise their hands to indicate that they wish to come in on an answer and I will try to accommodate that as best as possible.</p> <p> I now turn to Mr. Freemantle, on behalf of An Taisce, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.872" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gary Freemantle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020300002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  The National Monuments Act was passed in 1930.  Over the ensuing years, there have been periodic amendments with one motivation, that is, to perfect, strengthen and streamline the protection of our national built heritage.  As a result, the heritage protection legislation of this State reached the point of being the envy of colleagues from most other European jurisdictions, that is until the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 undid all the good work of previous generations and cast us, in legislative terms, back into the Stone Age.</p> <p>  In 2001, the Heritage Council published Archaeological Features at Risk: A Survey measuring the Recent Destruction of Ireland&rsquo;s Archaeological Heritage.  The survey established that 34% of the State&rsquo;s archaeological monuments had been destroyed since 1840, and that the destruction was continuing at an alarming rate with land "improvement" work bearing a large responsibility for the ongoing destruction.  However, despite this warning, the 2004 amending Act determined that: "The consent of the Minister ... shall not be required where the works [relate to] an approved road development".  In the case of a national monument, the Minister could: "issue directions to the road authority concerned" to: A: "preserve it", B: "renovate or restore it", or C: "demolish or remove it wholly or in part...".  It is of great relief to find that this latter clause will be consigned to the dustbin.  We are left, however, with an enduring negative impact and legacy by the ethos created by the 2004 amending Act.</p> <p>  This State has never failed to promote and trade on the great history and heritage of the island.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland relentlessly sells it abroad, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East being one example.  Tourists are encouraged to visit our ancient monuments and historic sites.  However, as tourism has constantly grown, our menu of sites to visit remains static.  Clearly, we need more new sites to cater to an ever-growing number of visitors to our shores.  Yet, while archaeologists are finding these new monuments, the State has been busy facilitating their systematic removal, resting on the full support of blatantly discriminatory legislation.  However, even if the legislation is rectified, there would still be residual problems.  How can it be appropriate for a Minister who has granted an excavation licence on strict archaeological conditions, to be the authority who can subsequently issue the</p> <p>destruction order for the same monument, in direct contravention of the terms of the original licence?  Surely, it should be unacceptable that the fate of a monument is subject to the decision of the Minister of the day.  The current Act states that, in considering the fate of a monument, "the Minister ... is not restricted to archaeological considerations [alone] but is entitled to consider the public interest".  The relevant Minister will arguably be guided by political expediency.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials and employees will inevitably have to service the agenda of the incumbent.  </p> <p>  Archaeology is a broad church.  It would be generally accepted that most of the recognised leading authorities on the various elements of archaeology are to be found outside the public service.  How can it be acceptable that there is no cultural-heritage court of appeal or ombudsman to adjudicate on the fate of disputed sites and monuments of note?  The original monuments Act clearly advanced the concept of having authoritative expert advice readily available to the Minister responsible for heritage in the form of an advisory council.  In these modern times the composition of a re-activated advisory council should have a broader representation but be drawn exclusively from a pool of suitably qualified independent candidates, with no conflicts of interest.</p> <p>  Having the input of an advisory council would facilitate openness and transparency.  It would create checks and balances, and ultimately confidence and trust in the system.  Opposition to the advisory council in the Republic of Ireland would bear a striking resemblance to the opposition generated against the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The subsequent work of that agency is now regarded as an essential aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s protection of the environment.</p><p>The 2004 amendment to the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994, in the words of the Supreme Court, &quot;removes a bundle of protections&quot; from the Act.  This was made crystal clear in the decision by the Court of Appeal on the 1916 Moore Street site.  It was ruled that, despite the monument having been declared a national monument, its full extent or historical landscape could only be defined by the relevant Minister.  The Court concluded that, as the law stands, it was a matter of &quot;a purely political assessment&quot;.<br/><br/>Circa 1,000 monuments at approximately 750 sites are in the ownership or guardianship of the State, that is, in the care of the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The remaining approximately 129,000 monuments are in private ownership and vast numbers of them are not accessible to the public.  Climate change will inevitably have an adverse effect on many of these monuments, especially those that are of purely earthen construction or located on exposed coastlines.  Given the scientific reality of climate change, should the proposed legislation not incorporate the necessary legal procedures under which these increasingly degrading monuments will be properly safeguarded and cared for?<br/><br/>Since 2007, nine prosecutions have been taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, on the recommendation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for alleged offences under the National Monuments Act 1930 and the National Monuments (Amendment) Acts 1954 to 2004.  The proposed Bill contains counterproductive defences that could be employed by a person accused of damaging or destroying a monument.  It would also:</p><blockquote>	Provide for the establishment of civil enforcement procedures in relation to contravention of the Act, including powers for the Minister ... to issue enforcement notices requiring the remedying of contraventions of the Act, subject to a right of appeal to the courts. </blockquote><p>The former proposition is unwelcome.  The latter innovation may prove very useful.  It is commendable that the proposed Bill will assist in implementing the 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.  This convention was ratified by Ireland in 1991.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, informed this committee on 27 January that objective D was to provide for the ratification of key international conventions in heritage protection.  However, this begs the question of whether this is the correct time and opportunity to implement the 1992 Valletta Convention.  It is a valuable heritage protection instrument and has already been adopted by Ireland on 16 January 1992.  It came into force on 25 May 1995 and was formally adopted by Ireland in 1997.  The convention makes clear that archaeological or historical landscapes must be given full recognition and legislative protection; the &quot;protected monuments and areas&quot; and &quot;archaeological reserves&quot; referenced in Articles 2 and 4 of the convention.<br/><br/>Monuments that can be thousands of years old and are, by their geographical and cultural affinities, intrinsic elements of the very fabric of this nation can reasonably be defined as national resources.  Ownership of national resources is vested in the Irish people under the Constitution.  These cultural treasures deserve our respect and protection, even if it is against our own agents.<br/><br/>It is time to restore the credibility of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 2004 and introduce checks and balances into the system.  Failure to do so would be unforgivable.  The broad thrust of the proposed monuments and archaeological heritage Bill will clearly go a long way to achieve that objective.  It might be reasonable to suggest that with adjustments and additions, it could easily achieve more.<br/><br/>An Taisce proposes that the Valletta Convention should be incorporated and implemented into the proposed legislation; that the enhanced legal protection and potential penalties could be seriously offset and largely avoided by the notification of the relevant parties at the earliest opportunity, that is, to prevent destruction rather than to subsequently have to prosecute and to reactivate the monuments advisory council to integrate checks and balances into the proposed legislation.</p></speech>

At the time it was put together, archaeological heritage played a significant role the building of national identity.  By necessity, changing times gave rise to a number of amendments.  It has long been acknowledged that a new Bill is required.  Both Irish society and the practise and discipline of archaeology have changed in the meantime.  However, archaeology is still relevant to Irish society.  It plays a role, for example, in promoting a connection with your local area and a pride of place that does not rely on family connections and it can be used to help people to engage on important issues such as climate change.<br/><br/>Continued availability of information on places recorded in existing registers, such as the sites and monuments record, in the proposed new register is essential.  The National Monuments Service should be applauded for the accessibility of the current registers and much other important information on its website.  Included under head 9 of the general scheme is, &quot;promotion of public awareness of [this] Register&quot; and promotion of knowledge and awareness is key to other aspects of the scheme, especially Part 8 which explicitly refers to the promotion of public knowledge and awareness.<br/><br/>It will be essential that the details of this new legislation reach the general public when the time comes.  From our perspective, as communicators of archaeology, it is important to be aware that while there are many ways to make such information available, we must always ask whether it is actually reaching the intended audience.<br/><br/>It is clear that this proposed Bill continues to value our archaeological heritage and prioritise protection of sites, monuments, artefacts and related archaeological evidence.  Despite stretched resources, the National Monuments Service, the OPW and the National Museum of Ireland do excellent work in this regard and are always willing to make themselves available to members of the public who seek information or to report new discoveries or damage.  Our nationwide network of local authority heritage officers also deserve recognition, as they are recognised as the local point of contact on heritage matters.<br/><br/>My first year as editor of <i>Archaeology Ireland</i>coincided with the drought of 2018 and the widely publicised discoveries of new sites afforded by the resulting crop marks.  It was also the year of the discovery of the four impressive Bronze Age gold rings by a family in Donegal.  The public and media interest surrounding both of these events provided the opportunity to raise awareness not only of archaeology but of the obligations of the public in reporting discoveries and to explain how and why this should be done.  The result was a marked increase in numbers of newly discovered sites and artefacts reported.<br/><br/>Archaeologists might get the opportunity to share this information.  However, the audiences they meet tend to have already encountered or have an interest in archaeology.  Yet, archaeology is everywhere and belongs to everyone and we have an obligation to spread awareness of this heritage to all, both for their benefit and its protection.  The protect our past code for caring for monuments developed by the National Monuments Service last year is a valuable tool for those engaging with the public.  However, advice such as this and the 2014 advice to the public on the use of metal detection devices need to be continually shared and redistributed to ensure they do not become yesterday&rsquo;s news.<br/><br/>There is considerable public thirst for knowledge about archaeology.  However, when the public looks for information on archaeology, this is not generally the kind of information it seeks out.  This is why the provision in the proposed Bill for the requirement to label packaging of metal detection devices with a warning about the law with regard to their use is especially welcome.  It informs at the point of contact.<br/><br/>Irish archaeologists can be excellent communicators.  Many individuals and organisations have excellent publication records using books.  Archaeologists also engage with communities nationwide to share knowledge and research by giving tours or presenting talks.  A 2018 Heritage Council-Red C survey examined public perceptions of archaeology.  It was heartening for those involved in the profession to learn that 91% of respondents saw supporting archaeology as economically important.  However, the questions about the ways in which people engage with archaeology provided those of us dealing with communication with pause for thought.  The most common medium used is documentaries, with 45% of respondents watching them several times a year.  When one adds news reports on television and radio to this, the proportion rises to 71%.  Only 54% use the Internet and only 28% use publications.<br/><br/>While respondents agreed that archaeology is important for tourism, they were relatively evenly split when it came to awareness of the impact of high tourist and visitor numbers on sites.  Of greater concern, considering the high level of awareness within the profession and the efforts to make the information available, only 30% of respondents were aware that metal detection for archaeological objects without licence is illegal.  Consider the importance of the documentaries to which I refer.  It is inevitable that most of these are not Irish and, as a result, are potentially misinforming an Irish audience on some of these matters.<br/><br/>Clearly, while community engagement has increased in recent years, some vital information regarding care, conservation and legislation fall by the wayside.</p><p>Did the survey results suggest a way to combat this?  Perhaps they did.</p><p> There are high levels of interest, over 60%, in meeting archaeologists to learn more about what we do and to better understand archaeology&rsquo;s usefulness to the community.  Embedding archaeologists in the community would allow for a proactive as opposed to reactive approach.  It might be argued that this role is being filled by local authority heritage officers and there is no question that they have a role.  However, the remit of heritage officers is a very broad one that covers archaeology, biodiversity, natural heritage and more.  The heritage officers can come from any of these backgrounds.  It would be preferable to have a team of heritage professionals in all local authorities.</p><p> Recent increased funding for archaeological projects, such as the community heritage fund, are very welcome.  However, the capacity for those administering and supporting local funded projects at a local level also needs to be increased.  For this reason there is a need for archaeological professionals embedded in communities whether they be local authority archaeologists or some other form of regional community archaeologists.</p><p> As communicators of archaeology, we would make the following observations or recommendations to the committee.  When including provisions that directly deal with areas where the public engage with archaeology be it with monuments, artefacts or equipment, full consideration should be given to how people encounter and engage with archaeology.  This includes the fact that information and equipment can be sourced from outside the State, and that visitors to the State may need advice on Irish law.  A fully informed public can play a role in this.  Additional resources need to be made available to improve the capacity of existing organisations and institutions to deal with the increasing engagement of the Irish public with archaeological heritage.  As shown in 2018 and more recently during the pandemic, opportunities to raise awareness of public obligations can, when taken, result in a marked increase in workload for the authorities responsible for engaging with the ensuing engagement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.877" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruth Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020300002#C00200"><p>As spokesperson for the Local Authority Archaeologist Network, LAAN, I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to attend.  Today's meeting is held in advance of the network's scheduled briefing on the Bill with the National Monuments Service.  In light of this, and given the relatively short time that we have had to prepare, our response is going to be brief and high level.  We would welcome the opportunity to provide the committee with more detailed comments, through correspondence, following the briefing next week.<br/><br/>In 2018, the establishment of the Local Authority Archaeologist Network was approved by the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  Our members currently comprise 13 archaeologists working in seven local authorities, which are Cork city and county, Dublin city, and the counties of Kerry, Limerick, Mayo and Meath.  The network enables local authority archaeologists to share their professional expertise and join together to engage in communications with other agencies.  Local authorities deliver a broad range of services pertinent to that Bill, including planning and development management and care of the local heritage resource.  The archaeological resource is largely managed in accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.<br/><br/>The county development plans, and local area plans, provide the strategic framework and policy context for local planning decisions.  They provide the opportunity to protect, manage and promote archaeological heritage for public benefit at a local level.  Many development plans afford safeguards to archaeological sites discovered since the publication of the Record of Monuments and Places.  We ask that the new Bill will be designed in such a way as to interact effectively with the Planning and Development Acts, and support the role of local authorities in terms of our archaeological heritage protection.<br/><br/>The Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill is an important and very much anticipated piece of legislation.  As stakeholders, many of the network members have participated in previous working groups towards the preparation of this scheme.  We look forward to seeing a modern, consolidated and legal framework enacted that will meet the many challenges of today's operating environments.<br/><br/>A number of heads in the Bill directly concern local authorities.  The network will need more time to consider their implications in this regard and consult.  I refer, in particular, to where local authorities may be appointed as guardian by the Minister, in terms of enacted by-laws, and where the Bill refers to burial grounds under head 27.<br/><br/>The network will seek clarity and greater detail on a number of the heads in our forthcoming discussions with the National Monuments Service.  In particular, the interpretation and definitions of registered and prescribed monuments, the term &quot;relevant thing&quot;, and the levels and mechanisms for monument protection.<br/><br/>There are many practical considerations regarding the interface between architectural heritage and archaeology.  We note that there are both overlaps and gaps between the relevant legislative instruments with which we work today that leave gaps for industrial heritage and vernacular architecture.  We also have questions on the performance of functions, expenses, landowner consultations, dangerous buildings and environmental impact assessments.<br/><br/>The network welcomes specific aspects of the Bill, including Part 10, which concerns enforcement, and Part 4, which concerns objects.  We welcome the heads that concern activities, licensing and inventories.  We especially welcome the inclusion, and wish to emphasise their importance, of national guidelines and codes of practice to the committee as these are key to the Bill's successful implementation.<br/><br/>As an addendum to my statement, I wish to take this opportunity to draw the committee's attention, under Parts 8 and 9, to some personal considerations to resources, sustainability and managing the loss of archaeological heritage.  This is particularly an issue that affects subsurface archaeologists or archaeology in urban regeneration areas.  The principle of preservation <i>in situ</i>is enshrined in the existing legislation.  It is provided for in this Bill but it can be difficult to achieve, especially in urban settings.  Will provision be made for the reporting and evaluation of things of interest that are discovered during, for instance, licensed rescue excavations?<br/><br/>Further, where preservation by record is the agreed option, the project design excavation and post-excavation dissemination strategies are currently variable in rescue excavations.  We would like to see a levelling up to those standards currently implemented, perhaps, by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  Finally, I wish to refer to excavation results in the loss of the archaeological resource and the creation of a paper record, collection of artefacts and interpretative grey literature.  We ask that the committee considers whether the Bill can make provision for the dissemination of grey literature for public benefit as seen in initiatives such as the County Dublin Archaeology Government Information Service, GIS, and TII's web resource.</p></speech>

To answer her comment that LAAN would welcome the opportunity to submit more detailed comments, that option is open to everybody who attends because sometimes witnesses, after they have left a meeting, think of something that they might want to furnish to the committee.  I assure everyone that we would find that very helpful.</p> <p>  I do not know if the addendum was sent to us as part of correspondence but it does contain recommendations.  That is helpful to us and I note that Dr. Greene, and An Taisce, listed recommendations on the back of their submissions, which is very helpful.  We will proceed to publish a pre-legislative scrutiny report with recommendations and then the Bill will be put together.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Swan of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.879" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Swan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020300002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend.</p> <p>  My name is R&oacute;n&aacute;n Swan and I am head of archaeology and heritage with Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  Prior to that I was head of archaeology with the National Roads Authority from 2007 to 2015.  In total, I have 27 years postgraduate experience as an archaeologist.</p> <p>  I understand that the committee is undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the revised general scheme of the monuments and archaeological heritage Bill.   In my submission, I will highlight TII&rsquo;s purpose and outline our approach to managing archaeology and heritage.  I will then briefly refer to our consultations with the National Monuments Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding this Bill.  Finally, I will highlight some of the important aspects of the Bill from our perspective.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, TII&rsquo;s purpose is to provide sustainable transport infrastructure and services delivering a better quality of life, supporting economic growth and respecting the environment.  TII delivers new national roads, light railway and metro, as well as active travel and greenway projects.  Furthermore, we operate these networks as appropriate.</p> <p>  Regarding archaeology and heritage, our primary objective is to minimise the archaeological and heritage impacts associated with our projects and programmes.  TII ensures this through legislative and policy compliance, and proactive risk management which, in turn, helps to build public trust.  TII is a key stakeholder within Irish archaeology in terms of commissioning works, promoting best practice, and developing guidelines and standards.  TII frequently engages with both statutory and non-statutory stakeholders concerned with heritage matters.</p> <p>  To ensure legislative compliance, we work in close partnership with the National Monuments Service and operate under an agreed code of practice for archaeology.</p><p>The most recent code was agreed with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2017.  The purpose of the code is to provide a single framework within existing legislation and policy to enable TII to progress with its programme of work in accordance with the Government's transport plans, for example, the National Development Plan 2021- 2030.  TII carries out appropriate archaeological assessment and mitigation having regard to an agreed set of principles.  The code requires regular communication between the National Monuments Service and TII with respect to the general approach taken to archaeology, as well as reporting on specific projects.  The code is applicable to all TII projects where TII is the approving authority, sponsoring agency, or both.  In managing risk, TII considers archaeology from the project's inception to the end of construction.  Where practical, TII undertakes advance archaeological works and, when this is not feasible, a bespoke archaeological strategy is developed.  This approach is reflected in TII's project management guidelines.  Furthermore, we use a suite of contract documents specifically designed for archaeology and heritage services in accordance with the Government's capital works management framework.</p><p> In building public trust, TII ensures that the results of archaeological and heritage works on TII's many projects are disseminated widely.  For example, making excavation and other heritage reports available through the TII digital heritage collections, which are publicly accessible on the Digital Repository of Ireland; engaging with the public at seminars and presentations; producing web-based story maps and audiobooks; and publishing books on the archaeological and heritage aspects of TII projects - accessible through the TII website.  TII is also actively involved in several research initiatives with archaeological partners both here and abroad.</p><p> In the context of the code of practice, TII has met the National Monuments Service on a number of occasions to discuss proposed legislative changes.  In October 2021, the Department of Transport invited TII to provide comments for the draft memorandum for observation in relation to this Bill.  Following this, TII met with the National Monuments Service to review our comments.  From TII's perspective, it appears from the revised general scheme that the Bill aligns well with current best practice in the assessment and management of archaeological and historic heritage in the context of delivering transport infrastructure projects and programmes.</p><p> TII believes this new Bill is timely, and we consider the following heads to be of particular relevance: head 3, which articulates broad policy principles at the outset; heads 13 and 15, which provide the Minister with the ability to prescribe exemptions in the case of non-damaging works; head 59 on bringing clarity as to which activities are licensable; head 60, which is about introducing an integrated licensing system to replace the multiple approval systems for the conduct of archaeological works, that is, section 26 licences, ministerial consents and ministerial directions for approved road schemes; head 68, which emphasises the importance of research and the promotion of knowledge; and head 70, which provides a statutory basis for the code of practice for archaeology and placing a general obligation on public authorities to have regard to historic heritage in the exercise of their functions.</p><p> In addition, TII notes the requirement to report "finds of prescribed monuments" in head 8, and considers that a structured system of reporting should be established, which does not become an administrative burden.  TII is of the opinion that there may be a need for secondary legislation to allow for the full implementation of Part 7 licences, which relates to heads 60 to 65.</p><p> Finally, regarding inventories, head 66, it is important that all relevant data sets are made available in accordance with open data policies.  As the National Monuments Service moves towards completion of a draft Bill, it has agreed to explore with TII how the Bill is anticipated to work in practice.  I will endeavour to answer any questions that the committee may have.  If I cannot provide a comprehensive answer today, I will provide a response as soon as practicable.  That concludes my opening statement.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

We appreciate the time they are giving us in providing opening statements and for their promise of further documentation.  It is most helpful to us in our pre-legislative scrutiny.  As the witnesses stated, this is very important legislation and we want to get it right.  Archaeology is something that sounds dusty and old, but I agree with Dr. Greene's point that it is important to our everyday lives.  It reminds us that we are all just passing through, there are those who came before us and those who will come after us.  At this moment in time our job is to try to help the Government to get this legislation right.  I very much agree with the points that have been made.</p> <p>  I acknowledge An Taisce's reference to the previous Ministers, Michael D. Higgins and S&iacute;le de Valera and others who have worked on the legislation in the past.  In this slot I will turn to An Taisce and I hope to have an opportunity later to ask more questions.  An Taisce has made three specific requests.  One relates to the Valletta Convention, which it was stated has been adopted.  It would be helpful if the witnesses could explain in more practical terms what specifically would be the benefit of incorporating the Valletta Convention into the proposed new legislation.</p> <p>  An Taisce specifically seeks a reinstatement of the monuments advisory council.  I would appreciate if the witnesses could elaborate on what they think the value of reinstating the council would be, what the make-up of the council should be in terms of numbers, the skills and experience individual members should have and what the benefit of that would be.</p></speech>

There were parallel conventions on landscape and architectural heritage.  The Granada Convention on architectural heritage in 1985 was very effectively transmitted into Irish law in 1999 and incorporated into the 2000 planning Act.  Despite having adopted the 1992 Valletta Convention in 1997, we have not adopted its key provisions.  Like a lot of international conventions, the Valletta Convention is simply named for the place where, in this case, the final signatory meeting took place.  It takes its name from the remarkable, historic, fortified city of Valletta in Malta.  The convention expanded on previous archaeological conventions in putting new emphasis on the overall context of setting up monuments.  I have a copy of the convention here.  In particular, Article 1 iii makes specific reference to defining the architectural heritage as not just structures and features themselves but their context, whether situated on land or under water.  The wider context is the land or physical setting of the monument.  Article 5 iii sets out the principle of the environmental impact assessment process and states that it should involve full consideration of archaeological sites and settings.</p> <p>  An Taisce is one of the many prescribed consultee bodies for archaeology under the planning legislation.  I have had oversight of that function for quite a long time.  When we get applications of a particular sensitivity, we call in local members, people with expertise, academics and others in particular on more complex projects like road schemes.  What we found is that over the years there has been a systemic failure to consider the wider landscape setting and context of a monument or the relationship of monuments and features to their being part of a wider complex, like Tara and Rathcroghan, which I cited in our submission.  There was in fact a significant court judgment on this about 30 years ago concerning a dump on the sensitive area of the megalithic complex at Carrowmore in County Sligo.  The court judgment concerned the impact on the setting of the archaeological monuments in the landscape.  The court recognised that it was not just the archaeological features that were of significance - the structure that could be clearly seen on the ground &ndash; but the wider context and setting.  That has been increasingly recognised in the archaeological world.</p><p>As an article in the magazine, <i>Archaeology Ireland</i>, showed, the drought in 2018, when we had that low rainfall period, dramatically revealed through drone footage and aerial photographs previously unknown sites, and showed that many isolated archaeological sites and features were in fact part of larger complexes surrounding them.  This recognition of the setting of complexes that relate to each other, and the setting of monuments, needs to be properly addressed and incorporated into legislation.  Looking at planning applications, there is this unwritten rule about 20 m, and there is an emphasis on test trenching and examining the individual site, but not enough consideration is being given to the setting and context of the site.  That applies to all categories of development, whether these are big infrastructure or the building of a farm shed structure near a ringfort, where the landscape setting is simply not being properly addressed.</p></speech>

We use the phrase "cultural ombudsman".  I looked into it a little more.  Currently, there are seven wings or divisions of the Ombudsman covering the Garda, Defence Forces, the press, financial services, etc.  I noted that we have An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, which "enquires into complaints from the public where it is alleged that public bodies may have failed to comply with the Official Languages Act 2003."  One option is to go down the road of an ombudsman, such as an teanga Gaelach has.  In many ways, the culture and heritage of Ireland is built on two pillars.  There is the language, which is for discourse, but also contains within it sagas, stories and legends and is the vehicle for the oral tradition.  In respect of monuments, for the people who spoke this language and told these stories, etc., these are the buildings and places they lived in.  These are the two pillars of Irish culture.  As Dr. Greene said, Ireland is built on its cultural uniqueness.  That is why we are a republic.  As such, if there is a Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, quite rightly looking after Gaeilge, where is its correlation?  There should be a court of appeal of either an ombudsman or an advisory council.  The neighbouring jurisdiction has a Historic Monuments Council in Northern Ireland, which is up, running and contributing very nicely.</p></speech>

Dr. Clinton might be able to continue that in his answers to me because it is an area where we could have North-South co-operation, given that the Border is a modern construct and we have the whole island in respect of archaeology.  The hinterlands people stood in at the time did not have the political boundaries we have now, but different political boundaries.  Much of that is to be discovered.  They spoke French, Norse and whatever else as well.</p> <p>  I deal with An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga a lot and it would not be the model to follow, in my view, in respect of an ombudsman, because we do not want it to be a complaint after the fact but before it.  The model in the North would probably be much better.  It would be useful for the committee if a piece of work was done and circulated.  Maybe the Oireachtas Library and Research Service could be asked about how different advisory councils work in different jurisdictions.  That might be able to feed into the work in preparation for this. </p> <p>  I welcome the quote from the Heritage Council's study that 34% of the State's identified archaeological monuments, and there are so many more as we have seen, have been destroyed.  I have not read the report, but does it have a list, or examples, of the destruction and where it is?  I know of some but, again, it would be useful if that report was circulated.  If it does not have a list, will the representatives provide us with examples of this destruction?</p> <p>  On foot of that, would the representatives accept that the vast majority of people who are owners, holders or protectors of national monuments in fact care for and protect them, given that we have 130,000 or so of such monuments?  They do that with little or no help from the State or local authorities and are put in an invidious position where they are expected to look after something for future generations, yet we do not do any work.</p> <p>  I have many other questions, but the final one relates to the identification of these sites.  Looking at the defences that can be used, ignorance is one of them.  Do the witnesses agree, and this is relevant to the archaeologists, local authorities and the representatives here today, that a lot more needs to be done by the State to identify these sites, whether it is through Google Maps, a cue card or some type of signage, which states that this a national monument and cannot be interfered with, or whatever warning sign?</p> <p>  The Supreme Court judgment in the Moore Street case was mentioned and the finding that the Minister can dictate the full extent of the historical landscape.  Do the representatives think, from what they have read so far, that issue is addressed in this legislation?</p></speech>

Unless they had &quot;Star Trek&quot; facilities, they did not beam up out of the GPO and end up in this building on Moore Street.  They obviously had to make their way along these back alleys and laneways, that are still there, which were very fraught with danger.  They had no idea what they were going to run into.  That would be a good example of a historical landscape, just like a battlefield, such as the one at Aughrim, where all the various forces were aligned and who moved where.  On the Moore Street site the Deputy specifically raised, the interconnectivity between the GPO and Moore Street is part of the battlefield landscape and to exclude the laneways means asking how the hell they got from A to B, or A to C in this case, B being the laneways.  In a case like that, the historical landscape includes the routes they took between the GPO and Moore Street.<br/><br/>On signage along the route, the laneways still have a bearing.  I know them well and they are well known short-cuts on the northside.</p></speech>

As we know, technology has made leaps and bounds and the data allows us to look up who owns what field.</p><p>It would be a laborious but one-off operation to work out where the known monuments are.  As the register is to be updated, let us start with the updated register and seek to identify where the monuments are and on whose land they are situated.  The Land Registry Office could then issue to the landowners a short and concise note informing them that they have a ringfort or a megalithic tomb on their land, telling them a little about it, that it is a legally protected structure and what they should do if they propose to sell the land.  There have been examples of where land was sold and the new owner has pleaded that he or she did not know anything about the structure.  Everybody who has a monument on his or her land needs to be notified of its existence and given information about it.  Where a ringfort is demolished, there are subterranean features and objects within the trenches that enjoy their own legal protection under the National Monuments Acts.  A preservation order placed on the land where the monument once stood removes the motivation, people are aware of its existence, they know what it is, that it may not be damaged and that if damaged there will be no gain in it.  In doing this, the destruction of monuments would reduce to such a level we would never have to discuss the issue again.  </p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  This is important legislation, which I broadly support.  It seeks to provide legal protections for newly discovered archaeological sites, to establish a single register of monuments, to provide a clear statutory basis for the Commissioner of Public Works or relevant local authorities to manage monuments and to establish a clear basis for the Minister for the local authority for legal title and ownership for the guardianship of monuments.  As currently drafted, the legislation allows for things to fall between two stools and for ambiguity.  This is important, encompassing legislation.</p> <p>  I come from a very archaeologically rich city, Waterford.  I understand the need to protect, record, report and display our rich archaeological heritage.  There are fantastic examples of this in my own city.  The Medieval Museum encases undercrofts within a modern structure, but this was done in such a sensitive way by the local authority that it has future-proofed the security of that for many generations to come.  However, a balance has always to be struck.  In many cases, there is a perceived lack of a pragmatic approach, in particular, to buildings, whereby the demands that are placed on the owners of a property in terms of, as mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, the costs involved are such that they result in buildings becoming vacant, derelict and ruins, rather than a pragmatic approach to saving a building with some modification that allows it to be preserved for future generations.  I would welcome the views of An Taisce with regard to that balance of demands.  Unfortunately, at times because the view is taken that it must be done in a such a strict manner, the costs are so prohibitive that ultimately it results in the loss of the building for future generations.  </p> <p>  I am sure the witnesses are familiar with section 57 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which allows for the owner or occupier of a protected structure to apply to the planning authority for a declaration as to the type of works it considers would or would not materially affect the character of the structure or any element of it.  There are considerable delays within local authorities with regard to applications that are made under section 57.  Is there benefit in exploring the possibility of a suitably qualified person, such as a graded conservation architect, being permitted to sign-off on works in consultation with the conservation architect within the local authority in order to speed up the process?  I am not suggesting that anything should be discarded but that we seek to streamline the process in the context of body of work currently under way in regard to dereliction and vacancy and bringing buildings back into productive use.  I would welcome the witnesses' views.</p></speech>

As he rightly said, Waterford city has set a national example in the care of its heritage, the management of archaeology, The Viking Triangle and in the development of the city as a major cultural centre.  An impressive number of beautiful museums have been developed in Waterford, which tell the story from prehistoric material to the Vikings, the Anglo-Normans and, moving into the 18th century, the specialist collections of silver and clocks.  It is a model that other European cities far larger than Waterford could not remotely match.</p> <p>  In our detailed submission, we have highlighted the challenges that arise for a landowner with a ruinous masonry structure, such as the remnant of a medieval castle, where mortar is exposed to wind and weathering and the building of the ruin may often be just part of the original structure, the survival of which in many cases represents quite a challenge for the landowner or property owner.  Support needs to be given in those circumstances.  </p> <p>  The wider issues raised by Senator Cummins relate more to the buildings that would be deemed to be protected structures under the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p></speech>

I was a member of the Heritage Council for a number of years.  The resourcing of local authority conservation officers is important.  Having employed in all of the local authority areas a well-informed conservation officer employed who can deal promptly with property owners, architects and others doing building works on protected structures is very important.  That resolves issues.  A great deal can be done by way of discussion that can avoid delays in the planning process.  The Senator's suggestion that the determination as to whether work can or cannot be done on a building without going through the process of section 57 determinations is a useful one.  Section 57 is a very useful part of the legislation.  It means that a determination can be issued that works such as re-roofing or other structural repairs can be carried out without the requirement to go through the planning process.  That also creates transparency and there is a public record of that.  I would have some reservations in regard to the conservation officer or architect for the local authority and the architect for a property owner being able to do things internally.  That certainly is something that would-----</p></speech>

Could I bring Dr. Greene in on that point?  Having visited Waterford and Kilkenny, those two cities, to my eye, have preserved well many of their archeological and heritage aspects.  I know very little about this.  I have no expertise in this area.  To my uninformed eye, this looks good.  How does the preservation of a site or artefact and constructing around it, in a sympathetic manner, fit in with the Valletta principles in terms of preserving the landscape around it?  How do we get to a position where we get that balance right?</p></speech>

Under the scheme the wider local community, including the schools in the area, through engagement with the property owner, if it is privately owned, can arrange visits, assist in conservation work and formal apply for funding towards conservation work in terms of protecting and enhancing the monument.  It means the burden of having a monument on one's land becomes a privilege if one is working with a local community on its care.  It is a positive project and I could not commend highly enough that it be emulated nationally.  An Taisce, through its membership, promotes active interest in monuments and appreciation of heritage.  We are about to host a webinar on Waterford city to highlight to people nationally the example that city has set in urban archeological heritage in the presentation of monuments.</p></speech>

My response to that would be in terms of place-making and forward planning.  It is all grounded in baseline data initially and really understanding the place.  Master plans and forward planning need to robust and well researched, employing all the best practice, mapping, place-making and layering of information to understand what is significant about a place, what the vulnerabilities are and then trying that to work that into the design for a development of place, whether that is place-making in the urban realm or development of the new buildings in an archeological environment.</p></speech>

A crucial element is the requirement for people to report a prescribed monument.  In essence, I would want to explore how that will work in practice.  The principle of where researchers or archeologists carrying out development works or scoping works for Eir, etc. will provide an option to identify a large range of monuments.  If we can capture those monuments and sites, from a development point of view, those may be considered as constraints we are trying to avoid in the course of the design of our cities.  Capturing those monuments at the outset will be important as it will inform research for future design and make people aware of the monuments in their locality.  Currently, we do not have a system where monuments can be easily updated and in that way inform future developments.  If we can get that right in this Bill, it would be a major achievement.</p></speech>

There will be a subset of sites which we will recommend for preservation <i>in situ</i>and a subset of sites which will be recommended for preservation by record.  Those are sites which we know about in advance.  I stress they can be either designated or undesignated sites and they can be sites related to archaeology, architectural heritage or cultural heritage in general.  They need not be put in as being a record of monuments and places, RMP, or a record of protected structures, MPS.  We can take on board a wide range of them.  Once we identify those sites, we would move on to the construction of a scheme and carry out advanced works.  To pick up on a earlier point of how we address sites in the areas between sites, in our work we assess 12.5% plus of a scheme.  We do a great deal of additional works through survey work, LiDAR technology, trenching and investigation test exhibition to identify as many sites as possible and that helps us inform risk.  We often do these works under ministerial direction or with respect to an archeological strategy and we provide that to the Minister, and, ultimately, it would come under an approved road scheme.  It is the Minister who will decide whether we should proceed with such developments.</p></speech>

I note Dr. Clinton also wanted to come in on that point.  I hope we can return to it in a later round of questions. I cannot continue on it now as I must bring in Senator Boyhan.</p></speech>

I want to direct all my questions to Dr. Clinton.  I welcome all our guests.  I read all the submissions and they are excellent.  I have got a very positive vibe frorm them.  I soldiered with Dr. Clinton on an issue related to Carrickmines Castle a long time ago, therefore, I know of his work and expertise in this area.  I want to pick out a number of questions, technically, posed in An Taisce&rsquo;s collective submission.  How can it be appropriate for a Minister - it ties in with what he was about to say - who has granted an excavation licence on strict archeological conditions to be the authority that can subsequently issue the destruction order for the same monument, in direct contravention of the terms of the original licence?  That is taken word for word from the An Taisce's submission.  It is an important point.  I have serious concerns about the powers of a Minister with responsibility for heritage or any other Minister.  I want to clearly state I am not directing that comment at the current Minister as we have a really good committed Minister on the job at the moment, but we do not know who will be coming down the line.  I say it in a measured way.  I have thought about it.  I pay tribute to the current Minister and I do not doubt his commitment.  An Taisce's submission goes on to state: "How can it be acceptable that there is no cultural-heritage court of appeal or [cultural] ombudsman to adjudicate on the fate of disputed sites and monuments off note?"  That is a good point and one on which I will ask the committee to consider making a strong recommendation.  The submission also comments on the value of having the input of an appropriate and qualified advisory council.  That is an excellent idea and one I would fully support.</p> <p>  We all know about the Valletta Convention and I will not go into the detail of it.  We know its importance and significance.  I would suggest an acknowledgement in the Long Title of the Bill with respect to the Valletta Convention would cover us.  I would like to hear Dr. Clinton's view on that.  I think it is an important aspect.  </p> <p>  An Taisce, in its submission, also raised a concern about archaeologists working in the private sector and conflicts of interest with respect to developers, etc, and that is a very valid one.</p><p>First, they are not in a position to rule in favour or against their paymaster.  If one is an archaeologist employed by a massive developer that wants to carry out some destruction, there is a conflict of interest.  I am not saying all developers do or seek to do that.  I am just saying there are cases where it happens.  The witnesses say that a National Monuments Service and National Museum of Ireland-employed or accredited archaeologist answering to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is important.  </p><p> In summary, the Valletta Convention is critically important.  Regarding reactivating the monuments advisory council, the witnesses make three good sharp and concise asks, which I acknowledge.  I am directing my questions to An Taisce because I know its vast experience in this area.  This relates specifically to issues it posed in its submission to us today.  I thank everybody who made submissions.  I am generally supportive of this piece of legislation.</p></speech>

We are very fortunate to have a very interested and committed Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage at this point in time.  It is such a relief.  In my tenure, I think I have fielded against seven Ministers.  Theoretically, the Minister with responsibility for heritage, however it is designated at the time, has this brief and responsibility but the differences between the seven were notable.  Right now, we have a good Minister.  We are all afraid of what is coming next.  One hopes for the best.</p> <p>  I think we covered the Valletta convention well.  It is a great agreement.  I have been reading it for years.  When Ireland ratified, I had been waiting for the opportunity.  We have been waiting for the Bill to finally arrive.  I was amazed when I read the heads.  The convention is there, which is excellent, but where is its friend?  Where is the Valletta Convention?  Anyone who reads it will see how good it is.  It addresses points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh earlier about landscape and the context, as Mr. Lumley said.  Dr. Greene referenced the dry summer.  Suddenly one realises that the monument over there and this one here are actually connected but it takes a lot of detailed study, analysis and expert input.  One can gather the data but then it is a question of who quantifies and qualifies it.  Archaeology is like a running gag.  If one does not know the answer to the question, one just says "not my period" but within the joke, there is the truth.</p> <p>  I would like to think I know a lot about certain aspects of archaeology but I do not know that much about things like wedge tombs.  I certainly would not be qualified to give a lecture on one.  Therefore, we must draw on as many experts as possible.  If experts are out there, we should use them.  We certainly saw that when the Irish economy was under threat.  The late lamented former Minister, Brian Lenihan, consulted and availed of the expertise of anyone he thought had a valuable input that could come to the rescue of the State.  We have all these serious archaeologists in the universities etc. outside of the public service.  We must draw on their knowledge otherwise what are we doing - ignoring it?  Having a degree in archaeology is only a starting point.  One then has to specialise.  Specialising gives one the authority on that subject.</p></speech>

Northern Ireland has one.  Otherwise we could go the parallel route with a companion ombudsman to go with An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga - An Coimisin&eacute;ir D&uacute;chas - so we would handle and protect the two pillars of Irish culture - the language and its traditions contained therein and the physical manifestations of the monuments in the field.</p></speech>

The first is the survey showing that 34% of the State's archaeological monuments have been destroyed since 1840.  That is very stark.  The destruction is continuing at an alarming rate.  Since 2007, only nine prosecutions have been taken by the DPP on the recommendations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for alleged offences under the National Monuments Act.  What are the views of An Taisce regarding the heads of this Bill and ignorance as a defence?  Is it aware of any other jurisdictions where this is the case?  How does that compare in terms of international best practice in valuing archaeology and monuments?</p></speech>

We can pat ourselves on the back.  Metal detectors are <i>verboten</i>here, we are pretty good at it and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will pursue it whereas in England, one will often see programmes stating &quot;valuable Saxon coin hoard found by somebody&quot;.  Of course, the object is important in its own right but it is also about the context.  If one finds something wonderful on an excavation, one does not just put it in a box and say &quot;we found this on site.&quot;  One would be fired in the morning.  One would be asked where it came from and whether it came from feature A or feature B.  One will often date a monument by an associated object.  In other words, we are better than some-----</p></speech>

What is Dr. Clinton's view on ignorance as a defence?</p></speech>

That has been tried a few times.  This is why we were stressing that monument destruction prevention is the road to take.  When the register is updated, one should get out one's data file and let everybody know that one has got one, what it is, how important it is, that it is protected and that if it is demolished in any way, the ground it formerly stood on is subject to a preservation order so, therefore, there is no gain in destroying a monument.  One cannot do it out of ignorance and one cannot do it for gain so the monument is safe.  Forget all these prosecutions because I see the Bill allows for fines of up to &euro;1 million.  It is some astronomical figure.  Who will be able to pay that?  What are we going to do - confiscate the farm?  It is about preventing destruction rather than acting after the fact.</p></speech>

What is An Taisce's view on that?</p></speech>

There is no evidence the same process is in place regarding this legislation.  Despite the long-standing concern that has been raised about the focus of our system of protection, particularly in the planning system when the development and impact of a site is evaluated, it is very narrowly focused on the site and there is no proper consideration of the relationship of that one monument to the wider site, a complex or its landscape setting.  Those are very explicit provisions in the Valletta Convention and that is a serious weakness in the legislation that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

What is An Taisce's view on that?  Would the Heritage Council be sufficient to get the expertise referred to by Dr. Clinton?</p><p>It is a very valid point.  If people have expertise, they should use it.  Is the Heritage Council good enough or do we need an advisory council?</p></speech>

Senator Fitzpatrick asked earlier about composition.  In the original advisory council, for example, we had representatives from the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, which are just three examples.  The Minister would not be appointing this advisory council and, in other words, the Royal Irish Academy would decide who should represent it, the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland would decide, and so on, and we would have an independent advisory council representing the objectives of their own base camp.  As such, it would be truly independent, without conflicts of interest.  Taking a leaf out of the 1930 Act, as amended in the 1954 Act, and the relevant sections such as section 21, that is a good starting point.  Those are three obvious members of the advisory council.</p></speech>

They are the recognised bodies and it is up to them to say, for example, that for this new monument that seems to be very important, "To this meeting, we are sending Professor whoever".  If it is prehistoric, they could send someone like Professor Emeritus John Waddell or Professor William O'Brien of UCC, but it would depend on the monument.  These organisations could send along totally independent experts on the particular monument, so it can be monument-specific.  In this day and age, of course, there should be other bodies on it, but only so long as they are independent, with no conflicting interests and a recognised expertise in that field.</p></speech>

In Dr. Clinton's experience, how busy would they be and how well resourced would they have to be?  We will come back to that question at the end.  I call Senator Moynihan.</p></speech>

I want to focus on the definition of a national monument and this question is specifically for An Taisce.  Does An Taisce think the definition is broad enough to incorporate more recent national monuments in order to protect both heritage and built heritage for future generations?  It is something we might not consider to be particularly special but future generations might.  I am going through the list of national monuments in Dublin, and I note Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s presence and his long campaign to have Moore Street designated as a national monument.  My question is specifically around the designation of a national monument and whether An Taisce has any suggestions about how to broaden that.</p> <p>  My second question is not directly related and I am going to relay some of my own experience of trying to get things onto the record of protected structures.  I imagine An Taisce runs into the same difficulties when it comes to national monuments.  One example was in regard to a building which is part of our industrial heritage, which Ireland does not have lot of, and that is the Player Wills building in Dublin 8.  The first line that came from developers was that it is not an important building, it is not architecturally significant and it did not need to be put on the record of protected structures.  Of course, the developer paid for a developer's report and the developer&rsquo;s report came back and said that, no, it had no architectural significance.  It was very difficult for me to push the local authority to do its own conservation report on it when the developer was not letting the local authority onto the site.</p> <p>  When it comes to problems and issues like that with regard to national monuments, what are the suggestions of An Taisce?  How could this Bill be amended so it is almost taken out of the hands of a local authority, for example, if it does not want to add anything because it sees it is impacting on an infrastructure project, or if the developer does not want to act?  How could this Bill be strengthened so that places that should go on the record do go on the record?</p> <p>  Does the Local Authority Archaeologists Network think the local authorities are sufficiently supported and staffed to take on the amount of current work in terms of national monuments or heritage protection?</p> <p>  I will leave it at that.  There is a lot in those questions but if I have some further time, the Chair can come back to me.</p></speech>

As things stand, although I believe the terminology is about to be altered, to qualify as a national monument there are five alternative criteria, including archaeological, architectural and historical.  As such, the definition was quite good, but as to getting into the specifics, I will ask Dr. Johnson to come in.</p></speech>

They are engaged in different kinds of work, such as providing professional advice and expertise to the executive and councillors.  In the meeting on 27 January, the Minister and the Chairman both expressed an interest in seeing more officers in local authorities across the country to supplement the work of conservation officers and heritage officers, and supplement that expertise across the board.</p> <p>  Our members do different kinds of work.  Most of us are engaged in planning and development advice to local authorities and we work between the Planning and Development Act, with cognisance of the National Monuments Act, and the record of protected structures, the national inventory of architectural heritage and the other inventories that are applicable.  We find that some types of monuments or features fall between legislative stools.  For instance, our industrial heritage was raised by Senator Moynihan.  It is our experience across the board of the network that this is a problem we would like to see addressed in this new Bill, if possible.</p> <p>  In terms of the definition of a monument, the current definition is broad but there is a lot of confusion on the current legislation among members of the public as to what is a national monument, what is a recorded monument, what is a registered monument and so on.  We welcome the clarity in the new Bill but we have a lot of questions about the new terminology that is being introduced.  Hopefully, that answers the question.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Johnson.  One of the areas that is overlooked is our industrial heritage.  When we look at heritage, we often focus on older sites, but to protect our industrial heritage for future generations is important.</p> <p>  I have a further question for the local authorities on the provisions around metal detectors.  Is there a huge incidence of people using metal detectors and disturbing sites?  I know there is provision in the Bill for that.  Perhaps one of the witnesses would like to give some background on that.  Unfortunately, I was not able to attend last week and it was probably more appropriate at that time.</p></speech>

I will not take the full time, but I want to tease out the question I asked in the first round on the opinion on section 57.  I think Dr. Clinton previously used the words "conflict of interest" in response to another question.  I suggested that a suitably qualified graded conservation architect could sign off on such works under section 57.  Is there an inherent suggestion in what has been said in response to other questions that we would doubt the bona fides of a qualified graded conservation architect, depending on who is paying the individual?</p></speech>

Is Dr. Johnson there?  Does she wish to come in?  As opposed to one person being responsible for the whole thing, from natural to archaeological to architectural, etc., we need more of a team in these different areas and different authorities.  I think it was Dr. Johnson who suggested that.  Am I correct in that, Dr. Johnson?</p></speech>

I am going wider and I appreciate that.  However, it is relevant to the work we are doing as a committee on dereliction and vacancy.  Yes, under section 57 of the Planning and Development Act, it provides for that with approval of the local authority, obviously, with the architect.  At the moment, as Dr. Johnson well knows, there is under-resourcing in that space, which causes lengthy delays.  The benefits of going that route versus a planning application that has statutory timelines built into it is not beneficial.</p> <p>  As Dr. Johnson knows, this is the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we are trying to speed up the delivery of units.  I am looking at avenues whereby we can ensure the structure, integrity and protection of the a building's heritage while also trying to speed up that delivery.  I believe there is an avenue there for oversight by a registered conservation graded architect to do that work.  It would, obviously, have to be approved finally by the local authority conservation officer.  What is the view on that?</p></speech>

It varies dramatically between different local authorities.  In other words, if there is well resourced administration support and professional advice accessible to a local authority in terms of a conservation officer or a consultant conservation architect, it can respond quickly.  The answer to the concerns that the Senator raised, and this applies to other arenas of the public administrative process, is that things are done efficiently and expeditiously.  We would all agree with that.</p> <p>  Section 57 relates to protected structures.  We all have a huge concern about the level of dereliction in towns and villages and, indeed, rural dereliction.  There are so many abandoned houses and old mill buildings and such.  However, the overwhelming majority of derelict or unutilised buildings are not protected structures.  Therefore, protected structure legislation is not a major factor.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Lumley not believe that would be appropriate, given the resources constraints that are there?  We have to acknowledge that it is all well and good to present the utopian view that we should have X, Y and Z.  However, given the constraints that we have, is this not an avenue that we can use in order to try to speed up delivery while also being cognisant and mindful of protecting the integrity of the structure?</p></speech>

The issue is there is not a public record of communications between the conservation architect and the conservation officer or architect, or whoever it is who is representing the council.  There is then the issue of the letters that are all in a file, meaning that if somebody is looking at planning a file for building, if a new property owner becomes involved, if the building changes hands and if there is a sale, that everything that has been to the building is transparent.

We are talking about heritage.  I live in Cork and perhaps the witnesses can comment on a situation with one of the main streets on the north side of Cork city centre, namely MacCurtain Street.  It was named after Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain, who was a former Lord Mayor of Cork and was murdered in his home in March 1920 by the Black and Tans and British soldiers.  Cork renamed the street after him.  Then, a number of years ago, a group of businesspeople carried out a survey to see how they could get people to come to this street.  The English company they employed suggested to rename and re-market the area as the Victorian quarter.</p> <p>  They did that but they did not get it passed by Cork City Council.  It has not been passed by the people of Cork.  Not all of the traders in the area agree with it.  It is an unbelievable insult to the memory of Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain and his family.</p> <p>  It is on Google Maps and Tripadvisor and in Cork City Council and in the media.  It is everywhere.  Can just a couple of people come together and rename part of a city?  This is part of the second city in this State.  These people have done this with no oversight.</p> <p>  I have contacted Google but I cannot get an answer.  I have contacted other people.  This should not be up anywhere.  It was never passed and it was never agreed.</p><p>I have raised this in Cork City Council and I have not been the only one to do so.  From a heritage point of view, what can be done to stop things like that from happening?  There might be some buildings in the Victorian quarter but the other thing is that she was the Famine queen.  We cannot do anything about existing streets that might carry English names on them but we certainly should not be naming any more streets or areas after people like the Famine queen.</p></speech>

If that is under the Local Government Act 2001 then is it relevant to this Bill?</p></speech>

What rights do individuals have to make these decisions for people?  As far as I am concerned they do not have the right to do it and they should have been taken to task for it.  I was listening to some of the earlier contributions when recourse to action was mentioned.  Can we get these people to cease and desist?  Is there something in place for that in this Bill and if there is not, should a section be put into this Bill to protect people and places from this happening?</p></speech>

In a rural context, when an area has a name that has been long-standing and everyone associates themselves with that place, to come along and change it arbitrarily seems unacceptable because it is going against the history and tradition of the place.  Hence, we have ludicrous names like &ldquo;Tuscany Avenue&rdquo; where it becomes surrealistic.  I would have thought Cork City Council would have to authorise these things.</p></speech>

There should be some recourse to get someone to stop.  I have written to the Department and the council to say there should be no documentation with that name on it.  I will again take it up with them.</p> <p>  There is one other issue I wanted to raise to see if it might be included in this Bill.  Last year a motion was put forward in Cork City Council by Sinn F&eacute;in councillors to rename Anglesea Street, where Cork City Council is, to MacSwiney Street, after the other Lord Mayor of Cork, who died in Brixton Prison in October 1920 on hunger strike.  It was passed and it was to be done but I heard from councillors yesterday in Cork about it.  They told me it is straightforward to name a new street or area but it is not straightforward to change a street name.  Cork City Council is saying the existing legislation is so old and archaic that it is not able to do it.  Should there be a provision in this Bill for local authorities and county councils to rename areas if it is the wish of that local authority or of the people of the area, providing it is passed at a meeting?</p></speech>

Great study has been done on placenames and there is a record of placenames that are historic and all the rest of it.  It could be done.  For example, to take it into an archaeological zone it would be like proposing to rename Newgrange.  That would be a bit bizarre and nobody would accept it but it would not be possible to get away with that.  That is the name that is on the Ordnance Survey Ireland map, it is in all the Irish Folklore Commission documents, it is in the Ordnance Survey name books and it is in all the data from John O&rsquo;Donovan and others who went around the country gathering all these placenames and old names of streets.  There is that body of information and maybe the Bill could say that placenames should have some resonance in history and heritage.</p></speech>

It is a small anomaly but it happens from time to time.  Surely this Bill provides us with an opportunity to rectify this.  We are not talking about a substantial change but about repairing a problem that is there already.  If a local authority with 31 councillors votes to rename a street, they are elected so they have a democratic right to do something like that and that should be possible.  We should not be getting letters from officials saying the legislation is old and archaic.</p></speech>

Dr. Johnson has covered the resources and the committee has a wide remit on planning issues, water management and everything that goes through here.  Are there sufficient resources at local authority level and at planning level, etc.?  Dr. Johnson said that seven local authorities have an archaeological officer.  How is that decision made?  Is it relative?  Does it make it easier to get an archaeological officer if the county is well-endowed with archaeological sites or is it a chief executive&rsquo;s decision based on staffing levels?  How did these seven local authorities get lucky enough to have archaeological officers?</p></speech>

It was copper-fastened then by the Valletta Convention and the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 that followed.  That provided a platform and the councillors and executives understood the need to have professional and in-house archaeological advice within the organisation.  Since 2018, we have two officers working in Dublin City Council.  It is a big development area as well and we are engaged in different types of archaeological advice and activities within that local authority.</p> <p>  Cork is another city that has had long-standing archaeological advice and expertise.  I do not know the exact ins and outs of how that came about to be honest.  Mayo County Council has five archaeologists working for it at present and their appointment came about through the road's schemes.  It was a peculiar and unusual arrangement but it is lucky to have a team of five archaeologists and they work in different areas of the local authority.</p><p>Some of them carry out archaeologically licensed activities on behalf of the local authority and others have engaged in planning and other internal advice and project management.  In Limerick, one is based in the roads office.  To answer the question, it is currently at the discretion of each local authority and its chief executive, depending on staffing levels.</p><p> There would be a good argument for a full suite of heritage professionals to work alongside conservation officers, who are supported in the Bill, and the heritage officers, who are supported by the Heritage Council, and to have local authority archaeological expertise to advise on planning and development.  In local authorities where there are local authority archaeologists in place, the National Monuments Service often leaves the planning to us, for the most part.  It would be quite a busy role given that we also carry out advice for local authority development.  The planning authorities are also sometimes the developer.  We are also sometimes a heritage resource manager.  We have accrued new roles in some cases, such as the community monument fund, which we have been delighted to see in place for the past two years.  That is the situation.</p></speech>

Are UNESCO sites, their management and protection, covered in this Bill?</p></speech>

The two UNESCO world heritage sites we have, Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and Great Skellig, would come under archaeological protection.  There is an obligation when signing the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, which designates world heritage sites, that there be a periodically reviewed management plan for world heritage sites which meets certain standards.  There was a consultation process for the Skelligs world heritage site process and we weighed a submission on that within the past year.  Those standards are progressively being developed.</p> <p>  One of the big challenges in world heritage sites is managing visitor numbers.  If one thinks of places such as Machu Picchu in Peru, the big challenge for world heritage sites is that the visitor pressure can have an adverse impact on the site and affect the integrity and wear and tear on the site.  That is a major consideration for the management of world heritage sites.  There is a parallel regime.</p> <p>  The real question we need to ask about world heritage sites in Ireland is why we have been such laggards in advancing additional designations.  There is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland and we have our two sites.  Other European countries have been progressively advancing nominations.  While there are many candidates and there have been consultation processes going on for the past 20 years that I can remember, there just does not seem to be the will to push them.  World heritage sites have moved from the original concept of having a single, very clearly defined site, such as Stonehenge, to having groups of monuments of a particular type in a wider geographical area.  It has been argued, for instance, that the key Irish early Christian monastic sites could be designated as a group.  It has been very disappointing that we have not seen any advance in further world heritage site nominations by Ireland.</p></speech>

He excavated Rathgall in east Wicklow.  He used to bring us touring around all these places.  You could tell he was the non-smoker because he would jog up hills while some of us needed ambulance lifting.  The Chairman is referring to a unique site with seven hilltops, focused on Baltinglass.  There are seven hill forts on seven hills.  Obviously, there is an interrelationship and interaction between them.  They are not all on top of small mountains, if you like.  There is an interrelationship.  To build anything on top of any of them would be ridiculous.  To put it in context, there are only approximately 100 hill forts known in Ireland, at the last count.  Dr. Greene might tell me if that is right.  For seven out of 100 to be in a neat little cluster is astonishing.  Some of them, such as the one in Baltinglass itself, are spectacular.  It is a damn fine suggestion that the hill fort cluster of Baltinglass deserves world heritage status.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the start of this meeting as I had another committee meeting to attend simultaneously, as is often the case, unfortunately.  I have read through the opening statements and it is good to get so many expert views on this issue.  I particularly loved Dr. Greene's idea about a communications campaign relating to the register.  I note there is provision for the promotion of public awareness of the register in the Bill.  I would love to hear her idea of how we could bring that to life.</p> <p>  I thought Mr. Swan's proposal for secondary legislation was interesting.  That legislation would allow for the full implementation of the Part 7 licences.  I am keen to learn a little more about that.</p> <p>  I thought the advisory council Mr. Lumley suggested was a particularly interesting idea.

I am pleased to talk about this.  It also ties in with the whole question of monument protection and questions that were asked earlier by Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Cian O'Callaghan.  There have already been opportunities to make people aware of the registers that are in existence and I spoke about those in my statement in 2018, with all the publicity about new sites, crop marks and that sort of thing.  We tend to have to wait for those opportunities for us to be in the news to promote these things.  We know from these particular cases that when we have the opportunity to tell members of the public to look at this wonderful stuff and show them how we report it and where they can find information about it, they react.  They go, report more and explore their landscapes, as we saw in recent years during the pandemic.  This is incredibly important.  It ties into what was said earlier about raising awareness of archaeological sites for their protection in the landscape.</p> <p>  It is important that we let landowners know what is on their lands.  It is very easy to say ignorance is not a defence when it comes to destruction and damage, and that is absolutely the case, but in some cases it is a fact that the landowners do not know what they have.  I have been listening to these discussions and the urban landscape has been to the fore.  However, a considerable amount of our archaeological record is in the rural landscape and not all landowners are aware of what they have on their land or what it means.  One way to raise awareness of the register and awareness of our archaeology, as I mentioned in our suggestions, is to have archaeologists embedded in the community, be they in local authorities or be they regional community archaeologists.  Such archeologists would engage with people and can proactively go out into the landscape and engage with landscape stakeholders.</p></speech>

The advisory council provision was a key part of the National Monuments Act 1930.  It comprised a number of external advisory bodies including the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, but it was allowed to fall into abeyance.  We pointed out that there is a very effective advisory council regime applying in Northern Ireland.  There is an opportunity now with this legislation to match what is being done in Northern Ireland, to look at what is being done in other jurisdictions, to revive that concept of independent oversight and to consider a wider potential number of nominating bodies including for example, the Local Authority Archaeologists Network.  We strongly recommend that such a provision is incorporated into this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.1012" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020300002#N00800"><p>Thank you, Mr. Lumley.  We will go back to Mr. Swan now.</p></speech>

However, that does not necessarily have a basis in legislation.  Incorporating that and an appeals process into this Bill is important and would be really useful.  We can then bring that into our suitability assessment criteria and our quality procurement procedures.  That will allow us to reinforce and strengthen them in terms of ensuring that we get very highly qualified people to do the work.  I want to stress that the level of qualification and professionalism in the industry is fantastic.</p> <p>  Another key provision is the ability of the National Monuments Service and the Minister to take into possession the records of companies which went into liquidation.  During the crash, several archaeological companies went into liquidation and there was no mechanism by which the archaeological and archival records of those companies could be taken in.  That is a really important provision to ensure the security of the archaeological archive of the State into the future.  I hope that addresses the question.</p></speech>

I would just like to second what Mr. Swan said about the importance of the archive.  The paper record is the record of the destroyed monument after an excavation and in so many cases, it is not available.  If that is not available, we only have the archaeological licensee's interpretative report and there is no opportunity to go back and revisit the findings.  In that context, I would really welcome a provision in the Bill to enable the State to have powers to take those archives back.</p></speech>

I studied the latter in first year and my father was in the National Museum.  There have been a wide range of influences on my life that have made me interested in this area.</p> <p>  In terms of rural Ireland in particular, I understand a lot in terms of where the finds are and where they should be because the logainmneacha, the placenames, tell the story.  They point to the facts.  Sometimes farmers will claim ignorance whereas the name of the field will suggest exactly what is in that field although the specifics of it may have been lost in the fog of time, so we need to be careful.  People might not know exactly what is on their land and there are out-of-the-blue finds, with no history behind them.  That is why it is important that we understand our language or our heritage, although one does not have to have Irish to understand it.  It is written and informed by superstitions.  Why is it that they are called ring forts?  Why did generation after generation not go near them?  They understood the value of the history and they built up superstitions around it.  The superstition was that ring forts were fairy forts and anyone who touched them would have bad luck.  There are other superstitions related to burial grounds and so on.  This is not just relevant to this country but to every country in the world.</p> <p>  It is important when we are putting the register together to make sure it is not just are register of monuments and their location.  We must also include the context because that is the key.  This is true of the hill forts in Wicklow or of Newgrange, for example.  I remember going to Newgrange as a child.  I only visited it once because my parents were more interested in Knowth and Dowth.  I remember, before there was any excavation, going into a tunnel there, even though we were not supposed to.  We saw a dog coming out of it.  We were only kids and could fit in and health and safety issues were not a concern in those days.  It was not designated, there was no signage, there was nothing.  Now, thankfully, the State has invested money in it but the State does not have the money to invest in 130,000 sites so what do we do?  How do we prioritise?  We are drawing up legislation to provide protection but how do we go beyond that?  How do we give the State the power, through this legislation, to provide that protection?  How do we provide encouragement to the State to do more than just list monuments on a register, to go beyond that?  Some of the monuments are underground and they should be left there.  We do not have the archaeologists to dig them up and we do not want to do so either.  </p> <p>  I mentioned Google Maps earlier and signage is important.  However, signage does not have to mean huge monstrosities.  I attended a presentation a few years ago on the QR code card and that is all that is needed.  If we put a QR code on every site, then when people want to find out about it, they can scan the code.  They can be directed to a website, with audio and visuals, containing information on that site and links to other sites.  That would be a lot cheaper than putting up a brass plaque.  Sometimes that is a concern of local authorities.</p> <p>  We have an opportunity, when drafting this legislation, to be imaginative.  We must imagine using today's technologies for our benefit.  That feeds into TII's concerns about the register of finds becoming an administrative burden.  Nobody wants this to be an administrative burden.</p><p>There has to be some type of administration and it is hoped that type of approach may help those such as TII, in order that there is not a delay when there is a find and we have the wherewithal to address it in a way in which a decision is made early enough on whether it is to be protected <i>in situ </i>or whatever and if a road, railway or cycle track needs to be protected <i>in situ</i>, that we quickly then find our way around it or find an alternative together, as often should have been the case.<br/><br/>The local authorities were concerned in their presentation about the burial grounds.  There is a mention on page 33 of the legislation that the Minister could &quot;vest in local authorities similar burial grounds the status of which was not finally resolved under the 19th century legislation&quot;.  Local authority archaeology officers were already concerned about additional work on them without additional resources.  Will they elaborate on that?</p></speech>

We have not had time for a nuanced discussion about it and I am cautious about trying to paraphrase that discussion at this point.  All I got was notes from them.  Many of these historic burial grounds, especially in rural areas, are still in use for burial.  It is about management of that and how burials can be accepted into historic settings and so on and so forth.  However, I need to come back to the committee on that with more detail after I have met with the members.</p></speech>

Head 45 refers to the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects.  The next one is the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.  Many of these are quite old.  The latter convention is from 1970.  The final one of which I could find mention was the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.  They are all useful to have and protect, but have we signed up to other conventions or not incorporated them properly or are there others to which we have not signed up?  There was mention of the Granada Convention among a number of others when we were in the Moore Street advisory committee.  People had raised a similar convention to protect built heritage and the likes.</p></speech>

There is very much an overlap between these conventions that all relate to cultural heritage.  The Deputy quite rightly highlighted some other ones which are a major issue, especially in conflict zones such as Afghanistan where there is major pillage and theft of artefacts which then appear on the international antiquities market.</p> <p>  Indeed, we have some of those concerns in Ireland, where sheela na gigs and early grave slabs were being stolen from sites and there was stuff going to the US that was certainly a concern.  I remember it was very serious back in the 1990s.  Fortunately, we seem to hear less of that now.  What we should look at in Ireland as a developed country - whether through the Paris Agreement on climate action, the UN Convention on Biodiversity and these cultural heritage conventions through the United Nations or the Council of Europe - is to take leadership in the most active implementation of those conventions.  The overriding one here is to properly endorse and recognise the Valletta Convention and to explicitly incorporate the specific, most relevant provisions of the convention that are needed to give that wider protection, in particular, to archaeological complexes and landscapes and considering the settings of archaeological monuments, be they urban or rural.</p></speech>

I do not know who will take the questions I have but ask that the witnesses indicate.  It was suggested earlier on that the Department may have suggested that it was not necessary to include Valletta in this legislation.  Are we not still bound by the Valletta Convention, even if we do not mention it in this legislation?  I say that because we had previous legislation in which people wanted to put in every directive and all legislation.  We are bound by the Valletta Convention, anyway.  Putting it into the Act does not mean we are any more bound by it.  Will somebody clarify that for me?</p></speech>

They do not have a direct application in national law unless transposed into national legislation.  We signed up to the Valletta Convention in 1992 and adopted it in 1997, but then there is an obligation on the Government to implement the provisions of that convention in its domestic law and administration.  We have clearly been laggard in doing so with Valletta because when one goes back to the Granada Convention on architectural heritage in 1985, we introduced the legislation in 1999 and it was incorporated into the Planning and Development Act 2000.  We are clearly way behind in addressing Valletta.</p> <p>  I remember, after the whole controversy over the M3 motorway in the Skreen Valley between Tara and the Hill of Skreen, the big issue there was that the definition given to the archaeological landscape was too narrow and not enough consideration was given to the relationship of the archaeological complex at the Hill of Tara between the Skreen Valley and the Hill of Skreen on the eastern side.  Of course, exactly as predicted, it was a fiasco because while a geophysical survey was done, proper site investigation was not and it was only in the course of the road construction that the Lismullin henge was discovered.  A henge is a generally circular enclosure.  Everybody knows Stonehenge in Britain but most Irish henges are earthen-bank henges and would have been-----</p></speech>

We cut the motorway through that henge by not properly identifying and evaluating the significance of the overall archaeological complex.  That is where failure can have a practical impact.

The Valletta convention specifically refers to the environmental impact assessment process.  The decision should involve consideration of archaeological sites.  It is not just about the site and its physical structure or material but the wider setting and context of the site.  That is something we are not doing properly in our planning and environmental impact assessment process.</p></speech>

All too often a planning application will just look at the site itself, such as a ring fort or a standing stone in a rural area.  Particularly in some of western seaboard county landscapes, there are monuments that relate to each other in the wider landscape.  There might be some standing stones but their significance is in how their geographical position relates to another site across the valley.  That is not being given proper consideration in the planning process.</p></speech>

I just wanted to highlight that.  That was done by archaeologists under archaeological supervision, in advance of the commencement of road construction there.  With regard to the treatment of archaeological sites and their landscape settings, we deal with it from an archaeological perspective, where the archaeological consultant will comment on the landscape.  We absolutely take into account the landscape setting of monuments and the inter-relationship between monuments that are either within a scheme or surrounding a scheme.  Separately, we also have landscape consultants and landscape specialists who address the issues of landscape in very great detail.  I wanted to highlight those points for the committee.</p></speech>

It simply was not identified in the geophysical survey because it was a wooden henge structure where the different nature and material of the wooden post deposits would not have been identified.  The full significance of the Lismullin henge was only discovered after the road consent, when the excavation work for the road project proceeded.  That was too late.  It should have been identified as part of the planning process and not afterwards.</p></speech>

That is done in order to identify as many known sites as possible.  However, we are very cognisant and very aware that there may be many more unknown sites.  That is why we put together a comprehensive programme of test excavation, archaeo-geophysical surveying etc., to ensure we can identify as many sites as possible after approval but well in advance of the commencement of construction.  I had the privilege of serving on the Lismullin advisory committee along with various other archaeologists.  We went into details and considered whether the road could be diverted but it was just not practical to do it in that context.  There is a huge amount of consideration.  I was invited to sit on that committee by the former Minister, John Gormley, and it was a great privilege.</p></speech>

Management plans were mentioned.  Management plans for SACs and various things like that have been called into question previously.  Have our management plans for UNESCO sites been the subject of any scrutiny?  Who decides whether our management plans for our UNESCO sites are adequate or are being implemented?</p></speech>

There is a unit in Paris that has oversight of world heritage sites in Europe, although I am not sure about internationally, and it reviews draft management plans.  We had a very serious situation some years ago when major filming for an international franchise took place on Skellig Michael and there was no provision for that in the management plan.  It is the same situation for special areas of conservation but we are way behind having management plans in compliance with the habitats directive.  An intervention of censure is possible and world heritage status can be removed if the site is not being managed appropriately.  That threat has been used in some locations.  In Vienna, for instance, a high-rise development was mooted that would have affected the character of the historic city centre of Vienna and the views of St. Stephen's Cathedral.  The world heritage committee intervened and said it would undermine the status of the world heritage site.  There were similar concerns about the world heritage site designation of the buildings on the waterfront of Liverpool and the impact of development there.  There are standards to be met in management plans and the protection of the setting of world heritage sites.</p> <p>  World heritage sites have a core area and a buffer area and that is a very significant issue that is still simmering in relation to the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne site.  The location of the incinerator outside the eastern side of the buffer area has already been controversial for aircraft navigation due to the height of the chimney and the red lights and so on.  There is a much more serious issue now with the proposal to build a high-level bridge to the east of Slane, between Slane and the tumulus of Knowth, which is to the west of Newgrange.  That would have an impact on the setting of the world heritage site.  That is part of the larger agenda for a dual carriageway or motorway from Dublin to Derry, which is something that should no longer contemplated as we need to move away from car-based transport and development.</p></speech>

It is up to the Minister to decide whether to preserve this find on-site as it is and move the road, or change the building layout, or whatever it will be.  Alternatively, it can be decided to preserve it by record, which means you just bury it, go through it, destroy it.</p></speech>

The crux is that one can "demolish or remove it wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter, or in any [way] injure or interfere with it".

I will let Mr. Swan come in soon but I want to follow on with this question.  The suggestion is that if we had an advisory council, it would be the best body to make a determination on what we should do here.  Earlier, I asked if we had an advisory body, how busy would it be?  How many times would it be called into action?  Would it be constantly having a look at sites?  There are approximately 130,000 monuments.  We are obviously going through another cycle of construction and development.  It is possible that not as many roads will be built as there have in the past, but roads maintenance will continue.  How resourced would the advisory council have to be and how quick would it have to be in order to react?  When someone has to wait a long time for a determination, that is when damage can be done.  That is when people get frustrated and they say that they might not go into this process at all and find another way of doing this, as we have seen happen at various historical heritage sites.</p></speech>

This is appropriate because the existing N5 goes through the complex at Rathcroghan.  The road was moved north of that scheme and is off the plateau there.  We did a lot of advanced archaeological work in terms of archaeological geophysical surveying to identify sites along the scheme.  We did either assessment or top work and so on.  We went to the board with comprehensive detail of the number of archaeological finds that we knew about.</p> <p>  On the approval of the scheme, as it is under the Act of 2004, we needed to seek ministerial direction.  Ministerial directions are sought from the Minister to allow for additional archaeological works to take place post-approval.  That included an additional archaeology geophysical survey, test trenching and test excavation along the entire length of the scheme to identify what had not come to light previously.  In addition to that, we did test excavations on a number of sites along the route previously and, subsequently, directions for registration numbers were included.  Those were excavated as part of the scheme.  There was a huge body of work in this one scheme.  Some 101 sites came from that body of work along that scheme.  Along this new corridor, post the environmental impact assessment, we have the post planning-assigned part of construction.  We had a wide body of sites to come across.  One can imagine the situation if there was an advisory council that had to deal with 100 sites.</p> <p>  At the moment, we have the ministerial directions coming in and we do not have registration numbers.  Ministerial directions provide the scope for all the works while going along.  We do similar things for our public transport projects in regard to developing our archaeological culture strategies.  There is a significant body of work that goes into this.  For each individual element of the works, one has to apply for a registration number, section 26 licence.  On one level, that is the role of the National Monuments Service on behalf of the Minister.  We would be creating another national monuments service in addition to the National Monuments Service and the work it carries out.  I am only focusing on my role in road schemes, etc., but there are also water schemes, infrastructure developments, utilities, as well as a whole range of housing schemes.  There is a whole other body of work.  We would be duplicating and creating another set of works in that regard, and that could be problematic.</p></speech>

Where local authority archaeologists are in place and have robust conditions attached to grants of permission, there is oversight through compliance.  There is a lot of pressure on us to make decisions in relation to finds on sites that might constitute a relevant thing or a thing of interest.  There is an assumption, where an archaeologist is employed by a developer to do rescue excavation for a development site in an urban regeneration area, that feature of a potentially relevant thing does not get evaluated.  In some cases, we have clauses in our conditions that we have to exercise, and that is pressurised and difficult.  Obviously, there is a huge risk for the developer and we have to be cognisant of that as well as the fact that they have a valid permission to develop the site and that we are managing loss.  Where there is a national monument, one might find something one considers to be related to that archaeological monument but it is subsurface and it is on a site 50 m away.  That decision-making process falls on the local authority archaeologists.<br/><br/>I refer to a previous point Senator Moynihan raised in terms of resourcing and the decision making that happen in local authorities at that level.  With regard to the architectural offices, a provision was made in the Planning and Development Bill 1999 on architectural heritage for the appointment of conservation officers.  That might be something the committee might like to consider in relation to archaeological heritage too.</p></speech>

They will not be running in saying that they found half of a fulacht fiadh, that it should be a national monument and that the road should be stopped.  There are exceptional discoveries as was said<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Lismullin - we are rehearsing the whole thing again - where it arose.  As my colleague, Mr. Lumley, said, if that henge was found on the top of Tara Hill it would have been hailed and glorified as another aspect of the Tara complex.  It was actually in an interesting position.  Through the sagas, we know there was a processional route from the Hill of Skryne down to the valley and up to the tomb complex on the Hill of Tara, much of which cusps on the relevant brow overlooking the valley.  What would one expect to find in the valley but a ritual temple site?  This was an astonishing discovery and could have been reconstructed easily.  It was in a natural dell.  Seriously large post holes were found where the beams could have been recreated.  If one is looking for parallels, it was covered by the current legislation to renovate and restore it, as per the words of the Act.  It could have been done just as was done in Knowth.  If one visits Knowth today, one will see a reconstructed wooden henge dating to the late Neolithic period, going by the grooved ware.  The Lismullin henge site should have been preserved, renovated, reconstructed and the road should have been moved.  Unfortunately, the then Minister, John Gormley, did not get to make that call.</p><p>I should not be quoting him but the point is that should have been preserved.  That is what is needed.  If we do not want the advisory council, we could have a coimisin&eacute;ir d&uacute;chais to deal with the heritage of exceptional sites.  We cannot tell people, to use the words of many a judge I have heard, not to bring a vexatious case and to be serious lest they will be quickly dismissed by a commissioner.  Imagine approaching the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and saying you needed to register a complaint.  You would be shown the door very quickly if you complained about your call not being answered in ten seconds.  The advisory council will comprise serious people who will not welcome their time being wasted.  There should be a bit of respect for the potential members of this potential advisory council.</p></speech>

It was mentioned that Northern Ireland is a good example of where an advisory council works.  Is Dr. Clinton suggesting the advisory council would be brought in only for potentially exceptional sites, whereby at some stage some sort of preliminary assessment would have been carried out by somebody else?  It could be the network of archaeological officers at local authority to try it out and make an assessment.</p></speech>

They relate to something Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked earlier.  Many monuments have no signage and we do not know where they are.  In a way, that offers them some protection until something goes wrong.  We do not attract heavy footfall to them, we do not need landscape management plans and there is no great demand for car parking.  How can we protect that kind of hidden nature of some of those sites if we were to provide signage and information and perhaps attract footfall?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.1073" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sharon Greene" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020300002#R01300"><p>I might comment on that.  This harks back to what Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh was saying earlier.  As we have identified, there are many thousands of sites throughout the country.  We cannot practically provide a sign for all of them, even if it is a small one with a QR code, given a QR code leads to a website someone has to manage, upload information to and so on, so it is not necessarily a practical answer.  Moreover, we do not want people to end up with the impression that no signage means no protection.  We need people to understand that all our archaeological heritage is protected at some level, and some archaeological and heritage sites are more readily recognised as such.  We all know what Newgrange looks like and we gravitate towards using examples of monuments such as tombs and so on that people can readily recognise, but some sites are not recognisable to people who do not already have an interest or who are not familiar with the locality.</p> <p>  I recognise the work being done throughout the country through schemes such as the Adopt a Monument scheme that was mentioned earlier and the Irish Walled Towns Network, as well as work done by the Heritage Council and local authority community heritage grants.  Many communities are taking this on themselves, getting funding and expert advice and putting signs on monuments in their localities.  Of course, the OPW also provides a certain degree of interpretative information at national monument sites.  We need to clarify, because it is not always clear to people, that not every monument that stands above the ground is a national monument.  National monuments are in the care of the State or a local authority.  Most of our monuments are just recorded monuments and are protected under the legislation as such.  In the vast majority of cases, they do not have signs.  It is more important that we, on a more general level, raise awareness and knowledge of the types of sites in our landscape and promote an appreciation of what they are, what they mean and how we should treat them.  We should not just worry about, for example, a farmer deciding a bump in his field has been a pain for too long and he is going to plough it out.  The same is true of places that are open to the public where people walk over ramparts and force a path that causes erosion, or where people are involved in hobbies such as mountain-biking, scramblers and so on, which also cause inadvertent damage to monuments.  What we need is a campaign of public education on this front.</p></speech>

Dr. Greene or any of the other guests can revert to me on that if they wish.</p></speech>

It provides for national monuments and other bodies to promote, publish and so on but I think we can go further with the provision, as I said earlier, of having archaeologists in the landscapes and within the communities whom people will know to talk to.  We should not just wait for the public to say they have found something to be identified or that they are interested in.  We need people who can go into the landscape, meet landowners and educate them.  As I said earlier, it is important that we inform landowners about what they own, which is allowed for, and tie that information to the property in order that if someone buys a property, he or she will know what is there.</p></speech>

If that register becomes available and a site is registered as attracting 130,000 visitors a year, whether there is a sign on it or not, the public will be entitled to know there is something there.  The site will then get an archaeologist, a person with a metal detector or just somebody who decides he or she cannot go to Newgrange, given an appointment is needed to get in there, so he or she will visit another one, without understanding the delicate nature of some of these monuments because they have not been looked after and are exposed.  Traipsing over a monument that has not had the care and love of archaeologists or whomever can damage it.</p> <p>  Once a monument is included on a register, it raises another question, namely, how to protect it even if it is not in State hands.  In the case of a farmer who owns lands on which there are a number of sites, the farmer will look after them, so we can just leave them there.  Farmers do not have the money to look after them but nature will look after them on their behalf.  If, all of a sudden, the monuments are included on a register, we will get people traipsing all over private land, and we have seen cases of farmers kicking up about that because of liabilities and so on.  Those who own a private property will argue the State is taking on a duty of care to the site or of protection for the landowner given the site will have been identified.  There are many questions in this context and I am not the expert.</p></speech>

Abbeys, for example, were built with mortar, not for the rainfall we are potentially going to get in the coming years.  If someone is unlucky enough to have one of these monuments on his or her land, it is reasonable that there would be a grant system because the OPW will not be able to deal with it.  Facilitating the protection of monuments on private land is being totally overlooked.  The OPW is always very vocal in defending its own patch and it is very good at that, but only about 700 sites are protected by the agency, which leaves more than 100,000 on their own.</p><p>As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh says, a farmer, landowner or whoever cannot be expected to pay for the stabilisation of an abbey, a castle site or an earthen structure that is not a national monument.  It is a lacuna.</p></speech>

I will not go into detail but there have been many schemes where the community-local authority model of heritage officer, local authority archaeologist, conservation officer and community liaison officer has delivered directly into the heart of communities.  These include the conservation management plan in Finglas that got under way under the community monuments fund, CMF, last year.  I flag that important role and the need for those resources for local advice and expertise to raise awareness.  The key message is that engaging with communities, especially with young people through schools, and local heritage groups that are already interested, is a fantastic way of raising awareness and getting ground-level support and protection for our monuments.</p></speech>

These monuments are already on the Record of Monuments and Places, RMP, etc., and are in the public domain.  In TII we are doing quite a bit of work making our information available on digital heritage collections.  In terms of bringing the past to life and making it accessible to people, there are many opportunities we can use online, including social media, story maps and videos.  One interesting area, which we have been discussing with the National Monuments Service, is our greenway projects, through which we bring people through the landscape, and bringing people towards monuments and places of interest.  Last year we were involved in the Athlone cycleway.  Its route is right beside Athlone Abbey.  It is great route for cyclists to go through.  It is opening up and giving many people the option to engage with the past in a way they perhaps have not done before.<br/><br/>The original National Monuments Advisory Council was established when there was no professional National Monuments Service in place.  The committee may, in its deliberations, wish to look at how the former advisory council worked originally and, after that, how it worked with the National Monuments Service and, later, with the Heritage Council that replaced it.</p></speech>

As Mr. Swan noted, these registers are already available, essentially.  The sites and monuments record, the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage and so on, are all already searchable online for anyone to use to find sites in their locality or wherever they want to go.  That is not really a concern about making this new register public.  However, I acknowledge the problem of land in private ownership where there are monuments and issues of access, as well as people's understanding of that.  There is often an assumption that if national monuments are in State care but located on private land, we must have a right of way to visit it because it belongs to the State.  That is not so in every case.  The whole question of private ownership, access and so on would have to be part of the programme of public education around access and conservation of monuments.</p></speech>

I thought we would wind up.  I notice that where a monument is on private land, the landowner has an option to ask the Minister to take it into guardianship or ownership.  Does that convey any rights to people to come and visit where the Minister then has responsibility for the monument?  Does that change the position as regards access?</p></speech>
