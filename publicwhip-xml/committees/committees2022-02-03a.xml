Deputies Carroll MacNeill and Sherlock have advised that they will be late arriving due to other engagements.</p> <p>  I welcome everyone to the meeting.  While Covid-19 restrictions have been relaxed, it is open to members and witnesses to attend in person.  They should continue to wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness.</p> <p>  This morning we shall engage with officials from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to examine its financial statements for 2020.  TII has been advised that the committee may also wish to following matters during the course of the engagement: TII's role as a sponsoring authority for MetroLink; public private partnerships, PPPs; and matters relevant to TII's remit in recent correspondence from the Department of Transport to this committee.  That correspondence is item R0967.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from TII: Mr. Peter Walsh, chief executive; Mr. Nigel O'Neill, director of the capital programme; Mr. Pat Maher, director of network management; Ms Audrey Keogh, director of business services; Mr. Cathal Masterson, director of commercial operations.  Attending remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House are the following officials from the Department of Transport: Ms Ethna Brogan, assistant secretary; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer, who was with us last week; Mr. Andrew Ebrill, principal officer in the national roads, greenways and active travel division; and Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal adviser in the regional and local roads division.  They are all very welcome. </p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask Members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that mobile phones are on silent or switched off.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the precincts of the Parliament is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  A number of today's witnesses, however, are to give their evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If a question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time he or she contributes.  This applies mainly to those contributing online from a remote location.</p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022020300002#A00500"><p>TII was formed in 2015 through a merger of the former National Roads Authority, NRA, and the Railway Procurement Agency.  TII&rsquo;s primary function is to provide an integrated approach to the development and operation of the national roads network and light rail infrastructure throughout Ireland.</p> <p>  TII&rsquo;s income in 2020 totalled &euro;1.435 billion, up from &euro;1.340 billion in 2019.  The majority of this income comes from Exchequer grant funding.  As a result of the impact of Covid-19-related travel restrictions, road toll income fell from &euro;192.6 million in 2019 to &euro;138.5 million in 2020.  There was also a drop in other income due to a fall in passenger numbers on the Luas system.  This resulted in TII making a &euro;30 million payment to the Luas operator, which was funded through a public service obligation, PSO, grant it received from the National Transport Authority, NTA.</p> <p>  TII&rsquo;s expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;1.466 billion, of which &euro;1.349 billion was related to expenditure on the road network.  The majority of this was in the form of payments to local authorities, including &euro;427 million provided in relation to the national roads system and payments of &euro;546 million made on behalf of the Department of Transport in relation to regional and local roads.  The Department retains decision-making power over the allocation of that funding and is responsible for the oversight and monitoring function for those roads.  Expenditure related to PPP contracts for parts of the national roads system amounted to &euro;173 million in the year, comprising operating and finance charges.</p> <p>  I certified the 2020 financial statements on 28 June 2021 and issued a clear audit opinion. However, I drew attention to a disclosure in the statement on internal financial control regarding non-compliance with procurement rules in respect of a contract for technical design services.  The statement also sets out the actions being taken by TII to address the issue.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms. Audrey Keogh, director of business services, Mr. Cathal Masterson, director of commercial operations, Mr. Nigel O'Neill, director of the capital programme, and Mr. Pat Maher, director of network management.  I understand that the committee wishes to examine TII's financial statements of 2020 and the area of public&ndash;private partnerships.  Before I make some general comments about 2020 and the area of public&ndash;partnerships, I would like to describe briefly the duties and functions assigned to TII through legislation.</p> <p>  The NRA, operating as TII since 2015, was established under the Roads Act 1993.  It is the general duty of the authority to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads, having regard to the needs of all users.  TII is the approving authority for national road projects.  In 2015, the NRA was merged with the Railway Procurement Agency, and the Roads Act of 2015 added the function of securing the provision of, or providing, such light railway and metro railway infrastructure as may be determined by the NTA.  The NTA is the approving authority for metro and light rail projects.  In September 2021, TII became the approving authority for greenways.</p> <p>  In relation to 2020, the onset of the global pandemic had a significant impact on TII.  In March 2020, the Government classified the national road network and the Luas network as critical transport infrastructure.  Luas and national roads continued to operate, without interruption, throughout all the restrictions that Government put in place to combat the spread of Covid-19.  All staff who could moved to remote working.</p><p>The measures imposed to combat the spread of the virus reduced the volume of vehicles on national roads and passengers on Luas, with a consequent reduction in revenue to TII.  Revenue from national road tolls for 2020 was &euro;56 million less than originally forecast.  The reduction in toll revenue was managed to ensure that all activities were kept going and fully funded.  The Luas revenue shortfall was addressed by the provision of &euro;30 million in PSO payments by the NTA.  This was the first time TII received PSO payments since the commencement of Luas services.  I am happy to report that the Comptroller and Auditor General expressed an unqualified opinion on the 2020 financial statements.<br/><br/>On PPP contracts, I would like to outline why TII entered into them, how TII's PPP contracts are structured and what the outcome was.  Why did TII develop and enter into PPP contracts?  In 1999, the Government decided to adopt a PPP approach on a pilot basis in order to fund public capital projects.  In the national development plan, NDP, for the period  2000 to 2006, the Government set a minimum indicative target of &euro;1.27 billion for private sector investment into national road projects.  The use of PPP contracts was identified as an essential component in contributing to the financing and delivery of the national road improvements.  The stipulated that funding structures, including road user tolls, where appropriate, were to be examined.<br/><br/>Section 4.109 of the NDP in question stated that the pilot projects announced by the Minister for Finance in June 1999 would all be developed as PPP projects within the period of the plan, namely, 2000 to 2006.  These included, subject to statutory procedures and negotiations where appropriate: a new western river crossing in Limerick on the N7; the Waterford by-pass, including a new bridge over the Suir, on the N25; the second West-Link Bridge on the M50.  In addition, the potential for a PPP to develop the Kilcock-Kinnegad section of the N4 was to be actively explored.<br/><br/>The Government established the central public private partnership unit in the Department of Finance at the beginning of 1999, to lead, drive and co-ordinate the process and in mid-1999 the Government established a Cabinet committee on infrastructural development, including public private partnership.  The Cabinet committee focused initially on transport, notably the core interurban road network.  In response to these policy decisions, TII established a PPP unit and developed a bundle of nine PPP contracts which, following competitive tendering, were entered into during the period 2003 to 2007.  Details of the nine projects are in an information note I provided to the committee.  In total, &euro;1.75 billion of private finance was raised by the PPP companies and used in the delivery of these nine road projects.  The NDP for the period 2007 to 2013 reiterated Government policy that PPPs would have an important role to play in the delivery of that plan.  It stated that a PPP approach would be considered for appropriate projects.<br/><br/>On 31 January 2008, the Minister for Transport informed the chair of the NRA that:</p><blockquote>	... the Government recently reviewed the financing arrangements for Transport 21.  Arising from that review it is now proposed that a number of national road projects, involving capital expenditure of the order of &euro;1 billion euro, should be undertaken as unitary payments public private partnerships. </blockquote><p>In compliance, TII developed a bundle of four PPP road contracts and two motorway service area contracts.  In total, &euro;1.22 billion of private finance was raised by the PPP companies and used in the delivery of these four road projects and six motorway service areas.<br/><br/>How are national roads PPP contracts structured?  There are three types of PPP contract that TII has entered into.  Eight are road toll concession contracts.  Five are availability, design, build, operate, maintain and finance, DBOMF, road contracts and two are motorway service area concession contracts.  There are two key features of PPP contracts that make them different from the traditional form of civil engineering contracts which are used to deliver road infrastructure for the State.  The first is risk transfer and the second is the commitment to the long-term operation and maintenance of the asset.<br/><br/>In terms of risk transfer, there are two types of risk which are transferred from the state to the PPP company.  The first is construction risk.  I have been involved with civil engineering for more than 40 years and I know that construction risk does manifest and when ground conditions or weather conditions do not turn out to be what had been anticipated it costs money to rectify or mitigate the consequences.  Construction risk is transferred to the PPP company in all 15 of TII's PPP contracts.<br/><br/>The second area of risk occurs where the funding structures include road user tolls.  In these contracts, the risk relates to traffic forecasts.  Of TII's eight toll concession PPP contracts, the traffic risk has been fully transferred to the PPP company in six and partially transferred in two.  The traffic volumes that were forecast by the PPP companies in the years 2003 to 2007 did not materialise.<br/><br/>The second key feature of PPP contracts is the commitment to the long-term operation and maintenance of the asset.  TII's eight toll concession contracts have contract durations of 30 years for six of them, 35 years for one and 45 years for the remaining one.  TII's five availability contracts have contract durations of 25 years for four and 35 years for one.  The two motorway service area concessions have 25-year contract durations.  During those years the PPP company must operate and maintain the road or service area.  At the end of the period, the road or service area must be handed back with a minimum residual life.  The minimum residual life varies for different elements of the asset.  For example, for pavements it is ten years.  The payments relating to these services are strictly controlled by the contract conditions.<br/><br/>I will outline what was delivered by PPP contracts.  The major interurban motorway network, connecting Ireland's five major cities to Dublin was completed by 2010.  The PPP contracts delivered key elements of that network.  In total, PPP contracts have delivered more than 400 km, approximately one third, of Ireland's motorway network and six motorway service areas.  The contracts have proven to be robust, with the successful transfer of construction risk and traffic risk to the PPP companies.<br/><br/>The operation and maintenance requirements are appropriate for the safe operation of the motorways and the maintenance of the value of the assets which will handed back to the State at the end of the contract durations.  Today, the PPP companies employ 540 full-time and 400 part-time staff in the operation and maintenance of the 400 km of motorway and the provision of services at the six motorway service areas.<br/><br/>The operating standards have been maintained.  The motorway network remained open and safely operational throughout extreme weather events and Covid-19 necessitated public health restrictions.  PPP contracts have delivered, and continue to deliver, very good value for money for the Irish taxpayer and have contributed in a very significant way in the creation of a safe and efficient motorway network for Ireland.  That concludes my opening statement.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions that members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

Taking all of those factors into account, including the income that is being received by the private contractor, can we say here is a balance sheet outlining how much the road costs, how much it costs to maintain, how much income the private operator received and this is how much it would have cost for the State to have done all of those things and compare the two of them?  Has that been carried out for each of the projects at this stage?</p></speech>

However, whenever it is postponing or suspending projects, that is on TII.  I want to try to figure out where the line is drawn in terms of political decisions versus TII's input.  For example, are roads that would be included in the national development plan, NDP, decided by the Ministers and the Department or does TII tell the Department and Ministers which roads need to be included in that NDP based on an objective criteria?</p></speech>

We would identify areas of the network that we believe require and warrant intervention.  It is a matter then for the Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the elected representatives to approve an NDP, which we will then deliver.

There are policy decisions set down by Government that need to be honoured and followed.  For instance, if the commitment to the protection and renewal of the network is placed as a very high priority, then that, obviously, becomes a first priority for us.</p></speech>

Therefore, we would need to meet those costs or advise Government and the Department of those costs.  Where there is a commitment to projects at construction and there are contracts in place and those bills have to be met, that then becomes a priority that needs to be met.  Where there is Cabinet approval to proceed with a project into planning, as part of expending code process, such as, for example, the Galway ring road or Foynes-Limerick, then those projects have a priority because there is a commitment to it.  Therefore, the consequences of those need to be dealt with.  Where there is a policy that says that we need to upgrade the access to ports, then the likes of Cork to Ringaskiddy, Foynes-Limerick or Oligate to Rosslare has a priority.  The current 2022 allocations reflect the upcoming commitment to the Government's Town Centre First policy that is imminent.  All of those priority areas, as identified by Government, have to be reflected in the projects that we bring forward.</p></speech>

It has brought its analysis of the Government commitments and the projects, I presume, from its own members of staff or input from local authorities.  It has outlined other national areas that perhaps the Government would like to consider.  However, at the end of the day, it is the Department that sits down with the Minister to decide what will actually include in the NDP from that list.  It then comes back to TII, which finds out what the NDP is.  There may be, I presume, projects that TII has not considered on the top if its list, but all of a sudden, they are in shining lights in the NDP.</p></speech>

We allocate the funds required to meet the commitments that each of those projects will have in 2022.  As things stand, we have quite a number of projects at construction, so they are at first priority in terms of ensuring that all the bills arising out of them are met.  Whatever is left after that is what we allocate in accordance with those priorities of connections to ports, Town Centre First and so on.</p> <p>  It is then a matter of how much we have.  It could be a case that a particular project is very large and the bills that are likely to arise in the short term in order to do ground investigations or topographical or environmental surveys could be very expensive and we cannot afford it that  year.  However, as we understand the funding profile from the Department, it improves dramatically in the year 2026.  Therefore, those projects will be progressed at that time.</p></speech>

For an example that I would know of, the N2, has two pieces, which are Carrickmacross to Ardee and the Clontibret to the Border road schemes.  Nobody who has ever driven that road would say anything other than the priority would be the northern end, because that road is in a more dangerous position than the southern road.  However, TII made a decision to proceed with the southern stretch.  Why was that?</p></speech>

Both were considered and the one that was better able to progress in 2022, as I recall, was the section to Castleblayney.  Clontibret to the Border does not have the same accident history and, as such, the prioritisation was given to the more southern section.</p></speech>

I apologise to Deputy Carthy for walking in front of him.  The witnesses are welcome.  We have met a number of times.  Mr. Walsh must be sick of me at this stage.  We have many important things to talk about.  On a positive note, it is important to acknowledge that many of the points I wanted to make around the finances of TII have in some degree been clarified.  That has to be welcomed.  I have a couple of points to make about the structuring of the organisation's finances, as a State agency.  I strongly believe in seeing an end-of-year budget put in place to allow visibility of all the capital projects being undertaken, to see how much capital is being spent on those projects and to give us a clear idea of which projects are experiencing overruns.  I am concerned at the enormous rise in construction inflation, which obviously has a knock-on impact on the work being done by TII and will affect current development plans that are in place.  The issue of road construction is important to me.  Are the current projects being undertaken, including the Dunkettle upgrade and the Macroom-Baile Bhuirne bypass, on budget?  Are they over budget, based on expenditure over the past 12 months?  How is that looking?</p></speech>

An allocation is given to a project at the beginning of a year but depending on the progress that can be made during the year it may end up as a different number.  It could be more, or it could be less.  If significant progress is made, if we have a good summer for instance, more money will be spent on that project.  For that reason additional funding was provided to Ballyvourney-Macroom during 2021 and Dunkettle because more progress was made than originally forecast.  However the overall project for the project is determined at the beginning of the approval to enter into the contract and that remains unchanged.  We are within that budget for both projects.</p></speech>

Over the past year, an issue arose with regard to expenditure on the N73.  TII's use of the term "funding uncertainty" has grown over the course of the past six months.  Is there any update on the delay that happened in September?  Will that project be going ahead?  Has Mr. Walsh any information for that committee on that?</p></speech>

Regarding the uncertainty, the circumstances are unusual.  It was a brand new NDP.  The annual funding profile had not been clarified.  Until we had clarity, we needed to be prudent.  It ended up with us not being in a position to approve Cork County Council proceeding to tender with that N73 project.  We did this out of caution.  We will never leave a local authority stuck with a bill for a contract that we have approved.  We do not want to incur cost for the civil engineering industry in tendering for a project with which we cannot proceed.  At that time, with the uncertainty prevailing, we could not give approval.  We got certainty later and we have profiled accordingly.  We have given approval to Cork County Council to proceed this year with the tender for the N73.</p></speech>

Is TII currently in a financial position to undertake what has been underlined in the NDP as it stands?  Does it have the funding to proceed with the projects that are listed?

We operate under section 19 of the Roads Act to deliver on our mandate through the local authorities.  Allocations are given to local authorities for specific projects that reflect what we believe to be the progress that can be made on that project in the coming year.  In their original selection, the projects reflect the prioritisation given by Government and set out in the national development plan.  For an individual year, the allocation reflects what we believe - in conjunction with the local authority - is achievable within the next 12 months.  That allocation is the one that goes into our allocation book and is communicated to the local authorities.  </p></speech>

At that time, I raised the issue of roadside parking of heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, in Rosslare.  My next comment is not aimed at Mr. Walsh.  In general, the solution is not very satisfactory.  I know it is an interim solution.  We continue to park these vehicles on the roadside albeit they are off the main thoroughfare on a link road.  We have a serious commercial driver shortage.  It is a worldwide shortage.  As an island nation, Ireland depends very much on road transport.  None of the stakeholders that have been engaged in this - everybody from the Office of Public Works, OPW, to Wexford County Council to TII, the NRA, Rosslare Europort and even Revenue - have given consideration to the health, safety and well-being of the driving population.  That no consideration is given to their sanitary provisions is a poor reflection on how we regard what I would regard as front-line workers.  If you were to enter the OPW facility and tell the customs officers they would not be able to use a toilet, you would not get the same level of co-operation.  I want it on the record that we are doing nothing as a country to support our front-line workers in that regard.  I thank Mr. Walsh for his engagement because it is not his primary responsibility.  TII is a stakeholder and I expect that there will be further engagement but my criticism is not aimed solely at Mr. Walsh.</p> <p>  I refer to what previous speakers have raised.  Mr. Walsh will have received a letter from the chair of the South East First Citizens' Forum regarding projects on the N24 and N25.  It appears that the next phase of funding will not go ahead.  Is this correct?  </p></speech>

Should we not get funding up to 2025?  We might as well just flush that money down the toilet.  Would Mr. Walsh agree with that?</p></speech>

My experience of it is the N11.  In three years, environmental progress would dictate that we do new studies and all of those routes may be cast aside because of some new regulation or legislation.  This is what tends to happen.  We have spent &euro;5 million and what is required here is &euro;1.5 million to ensure that phase 2 of the N24 goes ahead and &euro;2 million to ensure that phase 4 of the N25 is completed.  It is completely counterproductive not to fund phases 2 and 4 of these respective projects when we have already invested &euro;5 million.  This is the region that is now supporting a 400% increase in traffic out of Rosslare Europort.  These are the connecting roads.  It does not seem as though due consideration has been given to this.</p></speech>

Due consideration was not given.  We are in the throes of Brexit.  We are now hearing that the Northern Ireland protocol is not going to be operated.  There has been a substantial increase in traffic on these routes from Rosslare Europort and yet these routes are being sidelined.  I do not understand the methodology.  These are primary routes to the development of what is now Ireland's busiest and most strategic port and yet they are being sidelined for the want of &euro;3.5 million.  It makes no sense.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that this is about value for money for the Exchequer, about road safety and about critical roads infrastructure to support an entire region, the south east, and it is &euro;3.5 million.  I think it is foolhardy, and I mean foolhardy, of TII to think that if it waits until 2025 to provide this funding, we will still be at &euro;3.5 million.  Would Mr. Walsh agree with that?</p></speech>

If there is a commitment to funding in 2022, it is to carry the project on to the next phase of development, which has a higher bill associated with it.  We are profiling to 2025, and the profile to 2025 will not allow us to progress to grand investigations, topographical surveys and the more expensive elements of the development.  These are the ones that would potentially have to be done again.  The expenditure that has been incurred to date on those two projects will be largely reusable.  Some stuff cannot be reused but some stuff can.  I appreciate the frustration.</p></speech>

It is the level of the lack of consideration for the public purse and value for money.  The reality is that Mr. Walsh just commented to one of my colleagues that the longer projects are delayed, the more they cost.  Whether we are talking about them being in construction phases or not, that is the reality.  We have seen it with the N11.  What we are calling climate greening is changing rapidly, and every day is a different day and every study is different.  There are many incidents of having to undergo new environmental studies which are putting down routes we have already determined as being available.  They are no longer available because there is a snail or a bird or just a new environmental study to be carried out.  We are just flushing money down the toilet.</p> <p>  I come to the roads budget.</p></speech>

From a safety point of view, there are two programmes of work.  One is reactive and the other is proactive.  As for the reactive one, we take all the accident statistics and analyse them, identifying accident clusters and then reporting those back to the local authorities for them to comment as to whether an engineering intervention is an appropriate way of responding to that particular circumstance or whatever other comment they wish to make on it.  That informs our safety programme, and that could then end up in either a minor improvement, which could be a realignment of the road or a much lower level intervention or a widening of sight lines or whatever the issue might be.  That is one programme of work.</p> <p>  The second is a proactive one, whereby we undertake an investigation.  We inspect the routes and pick up what we think might be hazardous circumstances, which then make their way into a programme of works.  The structural or operational performance of the network is something Mr. Maher and his people in network management survey continually.  That is largely done by machines.  A vehicle drives the road and picks up everything from cracking to deflection to surface deformation and so on.  Those are all indicative characteristics of pavement in distress and warranting intervention.</p></speech>

As for the breakdown for minor works projects, what I am trying to understand is, out of that &euro;405 million that was allocated in 2020, how much was accounted for by minor works, how much was to address bottlenecks and how much was to address safety concerns?  It is important we understand this.  Is that &euro;405 million separate from what is currently being allocated to NDP projects or is it part of the whole pot?</p></speech>

My colleague Mr. O'Neill might be in a position to elaborate on the numbers, but basically they break down in the following way, and probably the easiest way to see this is in our annual plan and budget.  The protection and renewal money is identified, and that includes minor projects because it is part of the safety programme.  The new roads money for significant interventions, that is, major schemes, is a separately identified number.  Would the Deputy like us to give him those numbers now?</p></speech>

One project on the N84 bypass in Ballinrobe has stalled for the past number of years due to issues around getting allocated funding through TII and the selection of a preferred route.  In order to get that project up and running - it is now back at phase zero - it needs to get to a stage where they can allocate resources and get early planning in place as well as going for the existing plan.  How does TII support local authorities in getting past phase zero and getting the project up and running?</p></speech>

It is staffed by Mayo County Council personnel and they take projects through the various phases.  Our regional manager and regional inspector meet with them on a monthly basis.  Projects that can be brought forward within the capacity of the office are identified and brought forward.  Westport-Turlough was a major scheme that required a significant level of resource commitment and there is only so much an office can take on.  We got that project up and running thankfully.  The N59 from Westport to Mulranny project has been on the books for quite some time.  They successfully got planning for that.  We have been delivering that under a series of minor projects.  I think we are now on our fourth one with them.  Again, that is a significant requirement.  We have Cloongullane bridge on the N26.  We are aware of projects of that nature.  We want to bring them forward.  Some have more of an imperative.  The Westport-Turlough project was definitely one that was part of the NDP and needed to be delivered as quickly as possible and that requires a lot of resources.  There is only so much they can do in the office and that is part of the issue.</p></speech>

We are entirely dependent on buses for public transport.  Therefore, these projects are keenly awaited.  Last October, reports emerged that the Government was to make a strategic decision to delay the construction of the metro for ten years.  That subsequently proved not to be true.  It emerged there were delays in the metro project and it has been quite difficult for public representatives to get to the bottom of that.  What are those delays and what are the reasons for them?  I will concentrate on that.  Will Mr. Walsh outline how much has been spent on the metro project to date?</p></speech>

How long it takes through the planning process is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the challenges there.

We could then commence the procurement process.  The procurement process would take at least two years.  We are suggesting that an element of the project could be in a public private partnership, PPP.  In our experience of PPPs is that they have quite a long procurement period because there is a lot of due diligence and it is a complicated contract.  It is important to get that right.  One would want to be thinking in terms of two or two and half years for procurement.  To commission and construct the project then would take between eight and nine years.</p></speech>

With an optimistic version, we are talking about 2024 to come out of planning and 2026 to 2027 to come out of procurement.  It would then take another nine years, at most, so we are talking about 2035 for an operational date.  Is that a ballpark date given that it could also be longer if there is a judicial review?</p></speech>

The Government has not made a decision to delay this project by ten years but it looks like it will be delayed by ten years.  This comes to the very core of these projects.  Across north Dublin people have completely lost faith in the metro north project.  The reason is that this saga has been going on for 20 years.  The decision is out of the hands of TII because it was delayed in 2012 when a decision made, which I imagine added costs to the project.  There was the route alignment, which I would love to investigate further with Mr. Walsh.  I imagine increased costs arose as a result of representations made by me and many other people about that route.  I would also say they arose because an unresearched proposal was made to locate a station on St. Mobhi Road.  All of that said, and for all of those good reasons, the people of north Dublin are facing a situation where at best we are talking about 2035 for the delivery of a project that the Government is willing to fully fund now.  Does Mr. Walsh accept that people are frustrated about this and have lost faith in this project?  They will then lose faith in all of the other good projects that TII may deliver in our area, for example, a Luas line, which I believe will have a much faster track, but nobody believes that.</p></speech>

The approach we have taken and put in the business case that is with the Government, in terms of, say, cost forecasting around it, is as comprehensive as we can bring to it.  We engaged in a reference class forecasting exercise for the project, engaging with Oxford Global Projects, to give the Government the best understanding of what the cost forecast might be.  We have engaged with the construction methodology to the extent of having a good understanding of that construction period.  People are entering this with their eyes open.</p></speech>

Now we have a timeline of at least eight years after that.  Effectively, this is a doubling of the duration of the project.  I do not see from the significant information Mr. Walsh has given me anything to indicate this information was not available when TII published the timeline in 2018.  Therefore, we compound the disappointment again by having a timeline that was not realistic in the first place.</p></speech>

It is only then that he would realise just how awful a stretch of road it is.  It is arguably one of the worst national secondary routes in the country.  Be that as it may, I welcome that there is an allocation in respect of Annakisha South, Clogher Cross and Waterdyke.  I am disappointed, however, that the parcel for 2022 is only &euro;900,000.  I am seeking reassurances that a notification will be sent by TII to Cork County Council to give formal notice that Cork County Council can move to go to tender on that project.

If Cork County Council gets stuck in the gap, having spent &euro;900,000, but cannot go to tender, it cannot proceed to spend up to the figure of &euro;10 million.  I am seeking a commitment that following 2022, we will see the tender issued, boots on the ground, a shovel-ready project and that TII is proceeding with the commitment.  That is what I am seeking here.</p></speech>

As I explained to Deputy O'Connor earlier, the reason we hesitated, or did not give approval in the third quarter of last year, was to have certainty around the funding.  We have that now.  For that reason, we will be approving Cork County Council to go to tender, and it can rest assured that we will be with it as partners in the delivery of the project.  Once we are committed to it, we are committed to it.</p></speech>

He could not be any clearer than that, which I appreciate.  That gives us great hope.</p> <p>  I refer again to the N73 and other such projects.  Has TII given consideration to the budget line for major schemes in relation to County Cork?  For instance, the Ballyvourney to Macroom project is coming in this year at approximately &euro;60 million, or &euro;61 million if one wants to round it up.</p><p>The perception held by people like me is that the effect of all of the moneys going into the Dunkettles and Macroom bypasses of this world, which are the subject of national priority, is to suck the marrow out of the bone for other smaller projects.  I acknowledge that they are smaller roads and lesser priorities, but this means that people like me are fighting on our backs for projects that are in abeyance for five, ten, 15 or 20 years.  Is it not incongruous that, if a road is a national priority under a national development plan and so on and it is politically prioritised at Government level, it should have a negative bearing on a local authority's ability, in partnership with TII, to deliver on national secondary routes, tertiary routes and so forth?  Does Mr. Walsh believe that there should be a rebalancing of priorities so that Exchequer funding for national secondary routes, which are usually the main routes serving counties, do not get caught up in a Samson versus Goliath struggle where, for example, the N73 is completing with the Macroom bypass?</p></speech>

It will provide a safe and efficient network element that bypasses Ballyvourney and Macroom.  It was necessary to deliver the project that is being constructed; there was no alternative.  A lesser intervention would not have performed the functions and met the objectives required.  It is expensive.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made mention of the efficacy of relief roads.  I hail from the great town of Mallow.  There is a budget allocation of &euro;900,000 for the Mallow relief road, which is welcome and we are delighted.  It has been a long-running campaign, as has the N73 campaign.  These are decades-old campaigns.  What will the &euro;900,000 that TII has allocated for the Mallow relief road get us?  Once spent, will it buy a further commitment that the relief road will actually be delivered?  This is a bit like my N73.</p></speech>

My colleague Mr. O'Neill could provide more detail if required.  The notion that major projects are in some way taking from the minor ones is something that the Department is addressing to a certain extent, in that protection and renewal work is a classification of funding that is protected as of this year's allocations.  It is the first time we have come to this level of designation.   Bearing in mind that the Department has determined that there should be a specific amount for protection and renewal and a specific amount for new roads, the split in the funding we are receiving for the years 2021 to 2025 is 54% for protection and renewal, including minor interventions, and 46% for new roads.  The significant increase in funding in the second half of the national development plan will change the balance to 29% versus 71%.</p> <p>  This approach can be interpreted as protecting the protection and renewal money, including for minor interventions.  If there is anxiety that new roads are in some way drawing away from those interventions, let me say that we do not swap between pots.  Where we have an annual allocation under the protection and renewal element, we make every effort to ensure that those moneys are spent within that classification and do not go to subvent expenditure on major projects.  We budget for the major projects elsewhere.</p></speech>

First, I have looked up the figure in respect of metro north that was provided by the NTA under a freedom of information request.  The figure is &euro;165.6 million in addition to the &euro;83 million that TII has spent.  I wanted to put these figures on the record.  We are at nearly &euro;250 million.  There have been political changes and commitments have changed, but we must at some point take a meaningful look at this entire project from beginning to end and see what lessons we can learn.  I am unsure as to how much of the &euro;165.6 million can be carried forward into the project.  I am sure that some can, but if there is waste, we will not have learned lessons.</p> <p>  One local authority area in one part of the country - Fingal - doubled its population between 1996 and 2016.  We have not undertaken a more recent census.  In terms of climate change, it is difficult to see how TII can deliver on some of the transport obligations in a part of the country that is expanding so rapidly.</p> <p>  I am just making a point about the metro project.  Some of it predates the establishment of TII-----</p></speech>

I imagine there are people around the country who are not familiar with that part of Dublin who believe that the project has been partly delivered already and the almost &euro;250 million is just some sort of augmentation, but it is being spent without a single shovel having gone into the ground.  At some point, it would be worthwhile to examine this matter in a little more detail to see where we can learn some lessons.</p> <p>  Regarding tolls, it is what TII does not say that sometimes raises questions.  Mr. Walsh mentioned that revenue from tolls was &euro;56 million less than originally forecast and that this was "managed to ensure that all activities were kept going and fully funded."  The word "managed" jumped out at me.  What does it mean for the taxpayer?  Mr. Walsh also mentioned that, of TII's eight toll concession PPP contracts, "the traffic risk has been fully transferred to the PPP company".  How does one align with the other?  Do we retain an obligation in respect of any of the toll roads, tunnels or bridges to compensate for a shortfall in the traffic volumes forecasted?</p></speech>

That seven-week shutdown produced a reduction in the projected expenditure on those 20 sites.  We changed allocations and moved them around - we could do 2,000 changes of allocations in the past six weeks, or the latter part of last year - to ensure we would avail of the funding and keep the projects moving that were moving.  We were lucky, in a way, that the CIF made huge efforts to put in place operating procedures the Government regarded as suitable for suppressing the transmission of Covid-19 and they were able to get up and running again after seven weeks, on 18 May.  As such, they nearly balanced each other out-----</p></speech>

In 2019, the value that was payable on those schemes was &euro;3.9 million excluding VAT, while in 2020, it moved from &euro;3.9 million to &euro;13.2 million excluding VAT.  That was, obviously, linked to the decline in traffic during the pandemic.  In 2021, although we have not finalised the accounts, we expect the figure to be in the region of &euro;10.4 million, which would reflect some recovery in the traffic in 2021 versus 2020.  There is-----</p></speech>

Apart from anything else, it is completely at odds with our climate obligations.  It is a very sizeable sum.  The figure of &euro;3.9 million is effectively the baseline, while the figure for 2020 is almost &euro;10 million higher and for 2021, over &euro;6 million higher.  That is what the taxpayer will have paid in compensation for those two years.</p> <p>  On value for money, I am sure we will all raise examples with which we are familiar.  I refer to the M7 project and the widening of that road.  In addition, there was the Sallins bypass, which was built in tandem with the M7.  Kildare is the gateway to the west and the south, and I imagine there is more motorway in Kildare than in any other county.  Certainly, there are very high traffic volumes.  Those roads are Kildare local roads as well as being national primary roads.  The Sallins bypass was originally expected to cost &euro;61.7 million and it came in at &euro;85.5 million, an increase of about 39% in what was forecast.  There was a contractor dispute, there were design amendments and there was Covid, although that was only for part of it because the road was already largely in place.  The road that was delivered has no public lighting and has only part of a cycleway and a footpath.  Is TII satisfied that what is being delivered for that money is satisfactory in that context?  I accept this went to conciliation, but can the witnesses give a view on whether they believe that was value for money?  It is a significant overrun.</p></speech>

The part of that contract that was TII's responsibility was the M7 element.  I will have to hand over to the Department to take questions about the Sallins bypass because we worked together to have a single contract and delivered both projects under the same contract.  We worked together to deliver it, but the Sallins road element is non-national and, as such, I should not comment on it.</p></speech>

A lot of difficulties were encountered on site.  I do not really want to start talking about the contractor or who might be to blame for the difficulties.

There is a lot of pressure to take the lowest price.  That is a major factor in any contract.  TII has examined the issue of trying to take a median price and I think it has that in two contracts.  The outcomes from those two contracts will be very useful in determining whether that is a better approach for the future.</p></speech>

I do not intend to go over some of the questions that have already been asked.  I agree with the comments Deputy McAuliffe made about the perception of delays in the MetroLink project and what that means for its delivery.  I remember a lot of publicity about the Metro green line.  I also remember going to various public consultations.  Can our guests tell us how much has been spent to date on that public consultation?  How detailed were the plans in the end?</p></speech>

On the question of how detailed the plans were, we had to look at the impact of the construction on the existing green line because it is a valuable piece of infrastructure that carries an awful lot of people.  We needed to identify the length of time it would be disrupted and the mechanism by which we could facilitate the onward journey of passengers.  Such a project would be done in pieces and people would have to be bussed around.  The detail of that had to be worked out and it was through that process that we were able to be definitive about the level of risk we were bringing.  There was also the fact that we were going to an automated system.  In the original thinking, the use of line-of-sight vehicles, similar to the Luas, was envisaged.  The efficiency and appropriateness of the automated system then changed that.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh might come back to us with a note on that.  I would like to know the cost expended in recent years on that particular proposal.  Is there a timeframe for the extension of the existing green line Luas to Fassaroe or Shankill  We know the line will run south although we are unsure of where it will ultimately go.  Is there a timeframe for when that will be decided and constructed?</p></speech>

There are passenger figures for the Luas on the TII website for 2004 to 2014 but the figures have not been updated since.  Our guests might send the committee a note on that point because I would be interested about the capacity of the Luas and the numbers of passengers as we exit the pandemic compared to the numbers pre-pandemic.  Some people may have got used to trams being less packed.  We need to ensure we have the correct capacity.  The passenger numbers would help so Mr. Walsh might send those on.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions about the national road network.  Mr. Walsh mentioned motorway service areas.  I note the M1, M6, M9 and M11 are included.  There are 25-year leases or contracts associated with those.  As I understand it, they will come back to Transport Infrastructure Ireland and will be subcontracted out again.  What plans are there for further service stations or service areas along the motorway network?</p></speech>

We have a motorway service area policy in development.  The original thinking was that private enterprise would provide those services.  It did not materialise and it was felt necessary that the State should intervene.  That is where our current six come from.  There have been significantly increased levels of provision from private enterprise and if that continues and is meeting the need, we have no intention of competing with it.  A number of possibilities have been looked at.  It would be a matter for our board and for the Department to identify what progresses.</p></speech>

I would argue there are gaps in the network which is a cause of concern for people who travel.  In the same vein, there are issues around charging points for electric vehicles.  These all feed into a common and recurring theme, which is that people need those service areas.</p> <p>  I have another question about rest stops and lay-bys, which came to me via a constituent.  I ask our guests to review the safety of those lay-bys.  That is a concern, particularly from a female perspective.  The complaint made by my constituent was that she would not use lay-bys, even if she had to, because they are isolated and dark.  There is no lighting, public toilet facilities or even something as practical as a tyre pump.  Nothing is provided in those lay-bys and I ask our guests to review that as a matter of urgency.  A landline telephone would also be useful.  I am talking about the practical necessities for people who might be travelling on their own, who may be vulnerable and need those lay-bys.  They are well placed but there is nothing in them.  We need to examine that.</p> <p>  I note that fines and evasions of the M50 tolls are mentioned in the report.  I thank our guest for that documentation.  How many evasions or non-payments of tolls have there been for the M50, in particular, over the past three or four years?  Do our guests have those figures to hand?</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh advised that the risk related to toll income or road volume as well as construction costs that had been removed from the State and placed within those companies.

On the former CEO's salary, it was &euro;183,000 in 2019.

Is that correct?</p></speech>

I can clarify that when Michael Nolan retired, his closing salary would have been &euro;186,000, <i>pro rata</i>, year-on-year.  The &euro;183,000 would have increased by the 2% public sector pay rise that happened in the interim.  Mr. Nolan was CEO up to 30 September.  Given that we had gone through Covid, we had received approval for an extension to his contract.  He was due to retire on 31 July but to give us time to have a replacement CEO and a short handover period, we were granted a six-month extension for Mr. Nolan.  It ended up lasting three and a half months.  Therefore, the figure of &euro;194,000 for Mr. Nolan that was disclosed in 2020, which is the correct figure as approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General, would be the <i>pro rata</i>base of &euro;186,000 salary for the year, along with a six-week additional payment for his term after Mr. Walsh took over as CEO and holiday pay in addition to that.  In the year under review, the Covid pandemic meant he was not able to take leave until we had a new CEO in place so we made a holiday payment to him for annual leave approved.</p></speech>

He finished his term as CEO on 30 September but he continued in employment until mid-November.  Therefore, he still had leave accruals up to that date.  He would have entered the year with some holiday leave carried forward - I do not have that figure to hand - and then he would have accrued leave for the year under review in addition to that.</p></speech>

I should start by saying, with no disrespect to our witnesses, but between TII, the National Transport Authority, NTA, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, even I find it hard to keep track of what the plans are.  It is very useful when groups like the Dublin Commuter Coalition engage in the way they have on the detail of these plans.  My understanding is that TII had originally planned a walking and cycling infrastructure route along much of the new Finglas route but that the NTA have asked that much of the Luas side walking and cycling infrastructure be removed from the plans.  Is that a fair assessment and summary of what has happened?</p></speech>

The co-ordination of the provision of cycling infrastructure within our project, the Luas extension to Finglas, with that cycling strategy is something that we will do and have done.  That has resulted in a change in the amount of cycling and walking provision in the Luas Finglas project.  It reflects the completion of the NTA's cycle and walking strategy for the greater Dublin area and we will comply with that.</p></speech>

In fairness, the Chair is pulling me up on getting into policy.  I have the maps here, Chairman.  This is not necessarily about policy.  This is a very direct route and I would describe the 2013 plan as a network or warren of routes.  As we are discussing a great deal about female use of public transport and of active travel, a direct well-lit route on a public transport avenue is completely different to a warren of back streets and cycle lanes.  I would be very interested to know if any of the organisations involved costed the impact of building all of the infrastructure in one go versus having it built in pieces by various organisations?  Has anyone done that work?  Has there been a decision where this provision has been taken out of their very direct route.  I am wondering, therefore, if there has been a cost-benefit analysis of this choice in doing it in one go along a direct route or doing this network, much of which has not been built.</p></speech>

When many of the public private partnership agreements were put in place in recent years, interest rates were far higher.  Given that money is cheaper now, is there any provision in those agreements to look at those costs as part of the overall agreement?  We also need to look into this issue for future agreements.  For example, in 2008 and 2010, the cost of borrowing was extremely high and it is now a much lower figure.  Regarding the cost of projects, obviously the public private partnerships would now be paying out a return on the investment.  Is that taken into account?  Is there any process to review that cost as an overall part of the agreement?</p></speech>

What I can say is that in general there are mechanisms within the contract for refinancing the project.  The refinancing benefit is shared with the State through the provisions of the contract.  For the details on that, I will hand over to Mr. Masterson.</p></speech>

In that case, where the PPP company believes it can access a better value funding package for the remaining term of the contract, it may seek to do that.  As the contracting party, we are entitled to a share of any of the benefit it gets from that, what might simply be called a remortgage.  That is a provision within all the contracts.</p></speech>

The counterparties would not be keen for the contracting authority to have that type of power or mechanism.  If we were to try to insist on something like that, we would find they would price that into their proposals back to us.  I do not think, from our experience anyway, that that would have worked very well in our favour.</p></speech>

The route for the Ringaskiddy bypass was announced in 2014 and we are now eight years on.  I know many of the delays were outside TII's control.  Are there lessons to be learned on the planning processes and the entitlement to judicial review?  I accept people have a constitutional right to judicial review.  Does Mr. Walsh believe there can be a better way than the current process?</p> <p>  For instance, on the Cork to Limerick road, I recently spoke to someone in the office in Limerick.  Once the route is announced, there will be a full consultation of about 12 to 18 months to engage with individuals and organisations along the route.  Once the route is signed off on, there is a further process, the planning process.  If someone decides they are not happy with the planning process there is the judicial review process.  Does Mr. Walsh believe we could do a better job in the way we are progressing projects?  After eight years no real work has been done on the Ringaskiddy bypass.</p></speech>

It is pretty much the same project management process we have used since 2000.  We were getting projects through and constructed in a five-year period at times then; it is now taking significantly longer.  The Cork to Ringaskiddy project was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2017.  There was a result in 2018 and it took until March 2021 for that approval to be finally free of the court system.</p><p>We suggested in a submission to the NDP that properly resourcing the courts might be one aspect of it.  There is definitely a constraint there.  I would not for a moment suggest we should be curtailing people's rights to challenge processes but the burden on the courts seems to be quite significant and seems to take quite a long time to get through.  I can only assume that is a constraint of resources but I do not know for sure.</p></speech>

As it takes up quite a bit of time before all the documentation from each side is put together, that must be taken into account.  I am in no way saying anyone who wants to take a judicial review should be restricted.  It is a constitutional right.  However, it is about the whole process.  From the time the route was decided, which I think was November 2014, it took seven years, as Mr. Walsh said it was signed off on in 2021.  Surely we are able to put something in place?  For instance, it was 2017 before it went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Why could that not have been done at an earlier stage?</p></speech>

That was a quick turnaround by Cork County Council.  I would not suggest that could have been done any more quickly.  That is a very complicated scheme.  You were going through many properties and there was an awful lot of detail to be worked out.  I think the council performed very well there.  It would compare with any of the projects.  I should point out there was never any fault found with the project.  It is not as if the challenges resulted in any changes.  However, the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2018 to approve the project went through a process of challenge that took until March 2021, so no progress could be made during that period.</p></speech>

Take the Cork-Limerick road for instance.  A decision was taken to not proceed with it.  Then, when it was decided to proceed with it, it appears as though we started with a clean sheet and went through the whole process all over again.  Is there a mechanism for dealing with that?  If a project is parked, why must we start with a clean sheet if we go back to it two or three years later, as if there had been no work of any description done?  I ask that with particular reference to the Cork-Limerick route.</p></speech>

It was a different process.  It was a multimodal process.  We had to look at public transport, as well the road options, or I should say Limerick City and County Council had to.  These directives and the requirements for investigations are there for very good reasons.  I would be reluctant to suggest we could skip any of those.</p></speech>

Members should indicate if they want to come in for the second round of questions.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for Mr. Walsh myself.  On the eight major road projects scheduled for this year being delayed, why would there be insufficient funding?  What has happened to the funding for them?  Has it been transferred to other areas such as greenways, blueways, cycleways and active travel?</p></speech>

When Building on Recovery was announced in 2015 the Department of Transport gave us a multi-annual programme and a multi-annual funding profile and we developed all the projects in accordance with that.  There was then a mid-term review of that and there was a profile of funding.  In the original one, it was funding until 2022.</p></speech>

I have limited time, several questions and a few members who want to come back in for the second round.  On the eight projects, I understand the competition and the logic for why we need greenways, cycleways, blueways and all that but I am asking whether the provision of active travel impacted on some of those falling back.  It is a "Yes" or "No" question.</p></speech>

However, there has been a substantial shift in funding with a greater emphasis being put on active travel.  I get that but there is a balance as well because we must get goods to and from ports, people have to get to work and there are long distances as well.</p> <p>  I raise the N80 bypass at Mountmellick.  By the way, the Maidenhead work is complete.  That was a good job.  That was going on for a long time.  On Mountmellick, two routes were proposed back in the 2000s.  One was a very long one that started back way out in Derrycloney and went a long way cross-country.  It was too long.  Then there was a very short one that came in over the bridge into Irishtown in Mountmellick.  However, it cut across through the car park of a restaurant and a business.  It was not good.  It had a right-angle junction on it.  That was too short.  TII has come up with another route which is better.  This is what I wanted to ask about.  The feasibility studies have been done and I am concerned there may be a move away from providing those relief roads.  This relief road shortens the journey distance and the journey time.  It is not getting traction in the sense of getting the priority it needs.  Mountmellick itself is congested with trucks.  There is a junction at Glanbia with Pearse Street where the road comes into the centre of town.  There are trucks trying to manoeuvre around that from both directions.  It is very difficult.  They are travelling up and down narrow streets.  It is a very difficult situation.</p> <p>  I refer to Rosslare Europort and Brexit, which Deputy Verona Murphy obviously will have a special interest in.  Instead of a lot of west of Ireland and midlands freight going to Dublin, it is now travelling down the N80 through Mountmellick and on to Rosslare.  I live further down on the N80 and have no complaints about that.  Does Mr. Walsh believe that now needs greater priority in terms of ramping up the need for that because this will go on forever?  The feasibility study will be out of date and so will the preferred route.  There is talk of a second bypass linking the road over to the Portarlington and Emo road.  That is important within the greater scheme of things but it is the N80 project that is really the big deal for shortening journeys and getting traffic, especially HGVs, out of the town centre.  Would Mr. Walsh see this as a major priority when it comes to carbon reduction and also trying to deal with the impact of Brexit and the greater importance Rosslare Europort now has?  That is my question.</p></speech>

There a number of national secondary routes we recognise as being of particular importance.  The N52 and N80 are two of them.  The transfer of traffic to Rosslare Europort from Dublin is real.  That said, the proportions are small.  Rosslare is tiny by comparison with Dublin but it is happening nonetheless.  The town centre first policy which will, I believe, issue soon will create a policy context we will have to respond to.  We have the feasibility report on what we might call the Goldilocks route that seems to be meeting a number of needs.  It is certainly one we will be looking at in the context of those considerations.</p></speech>

I do not want to be too local because it is local details I am talking about.  Mr. Walsh might come back to me with a little bit more information.  I know exactly where it is at because I have got his replies before.  What is the cost for that type of inner relief road in Mountmellick where there is a bridge?</p></speech>

The TII might wrap up the project because there is huge local concern about it.  Also, the commercial status of the centre of the town of Mountmellick is not good.  If we got the HGVs out of the centre, we might get more people walking and cycling in Mountmellick and get more businesses going because there would be more footfall on the street itself.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh mentioned that PPPs reduce risk for the public purse, which is good.  He mentioned the two areas of construction risk and traffic risk.  I will deal with that briefly.  On the construction risk, let us say a 10 km or 20 km route must be built and has difficulties similar to what the TII had near Limerick, where the road had to go through a bog, or the tricky territory on the N7 and N8, a construction company would have a fair idea of the implications before submitting a price.  Mr. Walsh mentioned weather as well.  A lot of these roads were built before climate change became a major factor.  I am not convinced of that argument.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh also mentioned the issue of traffic risk.  My understanding is that, for many of those roads, there is a built-in provision, what I think is called a varied operational payment.  I have read the advance briefing notes from cover to cover to get to the bottom of this issue.  There is a built-in mechanism where traffic volumes fall, for example, because of Covid in 2020.  Am I correct in saying in respect of the N7-N8 Kildare-Laois bypass that there is provision for a variable payment clause if traffic volumes drop below a certain point?</p></speech>

With the exception of Covid, which we hope is a once in a 100 year event, there has not been any reduction and it is unlikely there will be because we are moving freight and goods along those routes.  Is if fair to say the risk been talked up a bit too much in terms of construction risk and traffic risk?</p></speech>

The New Ross bypass was more than a year late in construction from the programme the contractor had originally presented and worked to, or tried to.  It had various difficulties but it bore all of that cost.  Until such time as that road was finished, the taxpayer paid nothing.  So the availability of the road was key and it was up to the contractor to manage that, and it did.</p> <p>  I know from our own experience of design-build and in terms of the alternatives, we have gone through various contract forms.  We would have had the third edition of the IEI contract first, and there were various clauses there for the claiming of additional costs associated with ground conditions, adverse weather and so on.  We had FIDIC, which is an internationally recognised contract type that had areas of allowable risk, areas where the risk fell back on the employer - the State.  Those claims were pursued in each case.  We always pursued a policy of lowest price tendering so the lowest price won the contract.  For that reason they have to price it optimistically.  Even under the current public works contract there is a schedule K of compensation events, which if any of those events occur, the contractor is entitled to payment.

I am concerned about what I heard about taking the lowest tender and whether we are properly evaluating that.  I think that is something we are going to have to look at.</p> <p>  Regarding a project where we do not have the kind of expertise we have with roads, namely, the metro, will the TII give details on the expertise it has in-house that can evaluate these projects rather than outsource them?  Without that expertise, how can the TII properly evaluate what projects come to it, or does the agency have the expertise?</p></speech>

We have identified 18 posts within the structure of the client organisation.  Let us refer to TII as the organisation that will be delivering the project.  We have identified 18 posts, following advice that we got from Sydney, London and other metro operators.  These positions should be State employees whose first loyalty is to the State and who will help us build up the rest of the client organisation.

Dublin Bus, for example, has a scheme, a community initiative to which overpayments go.  This is not legitimate revenue, really.  I have received replies indicating that this is happening and the toll operators are putting this money into their own revenue.  Will the TII structure into future contracts that this revenue is not retained?  This is quantifiable and it is over the amount that is legitimately expected.  We fund two organisations operating tolls in Limerick and on the M3 where the forecast is for less.  It seems odd that they can collect more and that there are no consequences for that.</p></speech>

Customers can get refunds but I accept what the Deputy says - there are still overpayments.  We provided detail on that.  To be fair to the companies, they engage in local activities and charity activities but I do not have information to hand.  I would not like to characterise all PPP companies as negative in that respect.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  We can look at that in our own activities too.  However, if someone overpays and carries on, it can be hard to make that refund.  Refunds are available to customers who want them.</p></speech>

It was cut back from 2008 onwards.  We were getting &euro;18 million in 2008 but that was cut back to &euro;12 million and then to &euro;9 million.  Now, we are back up to &euro;18 million.  However, in the interim, a deficit of &euro;68.9 million has been accrued.</p></speech>

It is not as if we have a county allocation or anything of that nature, whereby the budget used to be X and now we have to get back up to it.

When that project was announced, I thought it would cause chaos.  I was not long elected at the time.  A commitment was given on day one that six lanes of traffic would be kept open, except  at night-time when that would be reduced to one or two lanes.  I acknowledge that work was difficult to do during busy daytime hours when six lanes were kept open.  That was impressive.</p> <p>  Moving a little bit further south to the Naas bypass, I am one of those who has been around long enough to remember sitting in a car in Naas for an hour and a half while travelling in either direction.  When the bypass was built I was struck by the two-lane carriageway to funnel traffic to Dublin from four cities, namely, Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork and Limerick.  From day one, the road became a bottleneck and it was then retrofitted.  I suffered as a result of that retrofit.  I remarked to somebody earlier that I spent three hours and 50 minutes travelling to the Houses one day.  I arrived here at 1.50 p.m. after leaving my office in Portlaoise at approximately 10 o'clock.  The road is now much better but from day one it was clear there was going to be a problem.  Within a matter of weeks of its opening, traffic was congested.  It was better than going through Naas but it was still a problem.  How much did the additional lane cost in the retrofit?</p></speech>

It means taking them out of use.  Contractors try to work around it by using middle aisles and all that sort of stuff.  I thought this was a terrible gap in the planning at the time.  While the bypass solved the problem by getting the traffic out of Naas town, which was good, there was another problem in the making.  Could Mr. Walsh come back to me with that figure?</p></speech>

What did it cost at the time and what would it have cost to provide an extra lane?  The bridges were left wide enough, thank God, so space was left to do it.  From the point of view of cost-benefit at the time, it would have been a hell of a lot better if three lanes had been provided in both directions from day one.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that magical work was done to keep traffic moving through Newlands Cross.  The minute people heard that project was going to happen, they were in dread of it, including the 12,000 commuters from my county.  Many people acknowledged it so I pass that on.</p></speech>

How much of that would be in respect of fees for examinations?  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced earlier that the fees will be waived this year.  The questions most people have are how the hell did we ever charge people to sit the leaving certificate in the first place and what happens if somebody cannot afford the fees?  Could Mr. McCarthy give us an indication of how much that would be?  What would the shortfall be if the decision to waive were made permanent?</p></speech>

The overall turnover was down by approximately &euro;40 million on the prior year because of Covid-19 and the suspension of examinations.

Moving to correspondence, as previously agreed, items not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in respect of correspondence are recorded in the minutes of our meetings and published on the web page.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee.</p> <p>  No. 1017B is correspondence from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice, dated 20 January 2022.  It provides further information requested by the committee in respect of non-compliant procurement in the Irish Prison Service.  The Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for the Department and the Prison Service.  The initial response we received, No. R0932, contained very little detail on the reasons for the non-compliance and this is a more thorough response.  It is proposed to note and flag the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It has been flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

It seems that some of these are fairly regular items.  How far in advance does the Prison Service look at cleaning services, for example?  If it has a three-year contract, does it look at it in year two and work out when it needs to do a tender or that kind of thing?  If it does not do so, that is where difficulty arises in the context of procurement.  It would be worth going back to the Secretary General to ask what the processes are for predictable contracts that are due to expire.</p></speech>

There are things that are known.  For example, if there is a contract with a company, the length of the contract is known.  What is the process in advance of the review such that there is time to include a tendering process?</p></speech>

Once there is a procurement in place, there is a need to be planning for the next one for the same service.  Three years is a very short period in that regard.  That is where mistakes get made.  The difficulty is that a tendering process is a very elongated process in itself.  If one makes a mistake at some point and has to go back to the start, that is when one ends up having to extend contracts or roll them over.</p></speech>

The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, was established to try to short-circuit some of that so that not everybody had to start from the very beginning.  Having framework contracts, it should be a shorter period, but sometimes there is not a framework in place when one wants a particular service.  Members will see the explanations that are given.  An explanation often put forward is that there was not an OGP framework in place, so a contract was extended for six months or a year to await the contract being put in place.  It is very complex and a challenge, but it has to be approached professionally.</p></speech>

It is in response to our request for quarterly updates on the investigation of the employment status of workers engaged by RT&Eacute;.  The Secretary General outlines the information provided to the committee to date and how the investigation will proceed, but states that the Department does not normally comment publicly on the status of any individual claim or investigation.  This is to respect confidentiality and data protection obligations and to protect the integrity of the decision-making process. The Secretary General also raises concerns that "any public comment on specific cases could lead to any decision being challenged or could undermine the sustainability of any decision that may be appealed".  However, he does offer to provide the committee with an update on completion of the investigation later this year or early in 2023.  It is proposed to note and publish the item and to accept the offer of a further update on completion of the investigation.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

We know a substantial payment has been made to Revenue and that there will be claims from individuals involved, albeit RT&Eacute; has not confirmed it will resolve those issues.  We know the Department is carrying out this work.  The point I am making is that this is different from other cases.  It is not the same as the Department carrying out an examination of a private individual, or even a private company, because at the end of the day it is essentially the public who will be expected to meet whatever the shortfall is.  My concern is the timeframe that is given at the end.  There is reference to completion of the investigation later this year or early in 2023.  I fear we are into how long is a piece of string territory there.  In general, when we get vague timeframes such as that, it means these things roll on even longer.  I propose the committee write again to the Department.  We can take it from this letter that it will not give us quarterly updates on the investigation.  We should ask it to provide us with the step-by-step process of the investigation or what elements the investigation will take up and a likely timeframe for each stage of the investigation so that we can have a sense of when the work will be completed and will be able to adjudicate at various points whether it is on track to meet the target date.</p></speech>

The letter states:</p> <blockquote> 	By way of background the Committee will be aware that the Department does not normally comment in public or at committee on the status of any individual claim or investigation - whether that be in respect of an individual's entitlement to a benefit, a fraud investigation or an employer inspection. </blockquote> <p>The committee never looked for the details of any individual or any particular worker.  The Secretary General states the Department has to respect confidentiality, and rightly so.  We agree with Mr. McKeon on that, but he seems to be mistaken in that I certainly do not want to see a worker-by-worker account of what is happening in this investigation.  I do welcome the fact that he goes on to state in the letter that:</p> <blockquote> 	I also advised that as all decisions of the inspectors will be retrospective in impact to the correct date without limitation as to time, all workers in respect of whom social insurance status might be modified will get the full benefit of that changed social insurance status notwithstanding that adherence to due process in the investigation may mean that it will take some time to reach any determination. </blockquote><p>I suppose, in fairness, they are going back a long way.  He goes on to state: "In addition, the Department will pursue recovery of any social welfare insurance contributions due for the full period where social welfare insurance status may have been misclassified."  I welcome that because we want it clarified how far this would go back, for example, three years or five years.  What the Department is saying here is there is no limitation.  Whatever they deem to be the correct time that the wrong classification started, they can go back to that.</p><p> I take on board the Deputy's point regarding a timeline.  It is a little vague.  We should look for something more definite, but there is obviously a big piece of work being done here.  Workers certainly will welcome that there is no limitation on how far they are going.  The committee should look for a more definitive timeline.</p><p> I would request as well with the agreement of the committee that we would point out to them - I do not know if any other member of the committee was looking for it but I thought the committee had reached a consensus - that we were not looking for any individual's details.  If I am wrong on that, I am open to correction.</p></speech>

It is confirming in writing what most of us probably knew.  It is welcome to have that.</p> <p>  The process is they will go through 500 individual employment files.  That is a piece of work they should be left to do but we should definitely put it on the work programme coming towards the end of the year to ask for an update about whether they will meet the target of having this concluded towards the end of this year or the beginning of next year.  That is probably as much as we are realistically likely to get that is additional.</p></speech>

We will ask for a more definitive timeline and also point out the committee's position regarding confidentiality.</p> <p>  No. 1021B from Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General, Department of Justice, is dated 21 January 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee into reports of unofficial strike action by senior officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and its impact on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's, GSOC, investigations.  This was raised by members here.</p> <p>  The Secretary General states that while both GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are statutorily independent, the Department is engaging with stakeholders with a view to resolving the issue.  The Secretary General advises that the Labour Court has held a hearing on the matter and recommended further engagement between the bodies with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.</p> <p>  I remind members to bear in mind that this is a live dispute and it is important that we do not prejudice it.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.  Deputy Carthy had flagged this item.</p></speech>

The Department of Justice will come back and say these are independent bodies and at the same time indicate that it is engaging Garda management on the issues without specifying what "engaging" means - it is a broad term.</p> <p>  The WRC was scheduled to meet on 26 January.  Perhaps we could seek an update.  I do not know who we ask for the update - maybe the Chair can give us clarification on that - as to whether this issue was resolved.</p> <p>  The particular issue relates to the operation of GSOC.  From the correspondence we received, people make a complaint to GSOC, GSOC then "employs" - I use that term broadly as well - members of the Garda to carry out parts of the investigation and, in some cases, the commission has its own investigators.  It would be useful, because we have the commission coming before us in a number of weeks, to ask it for a breakdown of the complaints that it dealt with and the investigations that it carried out, for example, even last year, as to how many were carried out by the commissions internally and how many were carried out by members of the Garda at its request.  Clearly, in this instance, when there are senior garda&iacute; who have been refusing to engage with GSOC, it is having quite an impact on the delivery of GSOC's already poor timeframes for addressing investigations.</p></speech>

The next correspondence, which I mentioned earlier, is No. 1023 B from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 24 January 2022, providing information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department on 9 December 2021.  It provides information on: applications for disability allowance in 2020 and 2021; the public services card and MyGovID; and the extent of welfare fraud since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.  It has been flagged by Deputy Munster.</p></speech>

We will all be aware of the cumbersome process from our constituency offices.  My recollection of the hearing was that a fairly decent number were approved after additional information was sought.  The Department, given the volume of refusals, needs to look at updating its systems and not have it as cumbersome as it is.</p> <p>  Perhaps we should write to the Department to see if it is putting a plan in place to make the application process less cumbersome and more efficient.  The delays when people are applying for disability allowance that they are entitled to can go to six or eight months at times.  It would be no harm if we asked if the Department had a plan in place to reduce the number of applications that are required to go to appeal before they are even accepted and to speed up the process in general, even if it was only a further letter with the application if they made that available in the application form itself specifying all of the additional to be submitted with the form.  It is so cumbersome and so frustrating for people.  I just thought it might be an idea to write to the Department to see if it has such a plan in place or it is putting a plan in place for that.</p></speech>

One I saw recently had the same question asked a number of times.  Members of the public will be handed these application forms in an office or be sent them by the Department.  It is not that long ago that I remember most of those forms were two or three pages.  They are now looking at 24 to 26 pages.  While I understand the necessity, we might ask the Department, in the interests of efficiency and fairness, to try and make the form more concise.  There is good reason for many of the questions and it is important that the Department gets as full a picture as possible but people ask why are they are asked the same question, again and again, throughout the form.  They could be simplified for applicants.</p> <p>  Other government forms have been simplified.</p><p>Work was done with the National Adult Literacy Agency on putting them into plain English and removing jargon.  While that is welcome, further progress could be made on claim forms for disability and invalidity payments.  We will seek that.</p><p> No. 1025B, which is from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General-----</p></speech>

Despite the number of people on jobseeker's allowance, the figure in this context is just over &euro;7 million for a whole year.  Obviously, fraud should not happen.  The figures in respect of the State pension and carer's allowance are &euro;1.5 million and just over &euro;1 million, respectively, and include overpayments.  People would be surprised to learn that fraud does not amount to hundreds of millions of euro.  It comes to approximately &euro;19 million across all schemes.

I am still trying to understand what the future of arts and antiquities storage will look like for the State.  We were given chapter and verse on the current regime in north County Dublin, but what I am failing to understand is where future-proofing is taking place, given the involvement of local authorities, local museums, national museums, national collections and so on.  Is there anything in the language of the letter that gives us, as per our questions, comfort in respect of the future-proofing of what I euphemistically call the national collection, be that arts and antiquities, statues or anything else?

I suspect that it will fall into the same category as Leinster House.  With an historical building, one cannot predict some of the issues that will arise.  The amount that is allowable for contingency is limited in every contract.  It may well be that there will be an underestimate with every historical building because something that has not been predicted will always be found.  Can we have a breakdown of the figures from the OPW?  It was a nice job and I am glad it is done.</p> <p>  I wish to make a point about the National Archives.</p><p>I am not sure where we are with the building for the National Archives.  There was to be a big new section at the back on Bishop Street.  A lot is held off site and some of it is held in Portlaoise.  It costs money to retrieve that and some of that will not be necessary because, if things are digitised, people are happy to take documents in that format.  If records are held in several different locations, it is not just the building they are going to be in in terms of retrieving them.  Sometimes they will have to be audited and retrieved from a distance away.  That is the same with the local authorities.  A lot of Kildare County Council's documents are stored in Cork and you have give notice to retrieve them.  I know there was a bigger project with Trinity College regarding a different approach to holding records.</p><p> It would be well worthwhile getting some updates from the Department regarding that because there are potential savings and efficiencies in digitising, where records are stored, how they are retrieved and whether we do it in a facility wholly owned by the State or rented in perpetuity.  There are probably other things relating to the future in terms of digital format, how we keep records and how people will be able to go back and look at things in years to come, because that will be a real challenge.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for holding this item over until this week.  I wanted to get a deeper understanding of how the service level agreements operate between nine Departments that are funders through the education silo of An Taisce.  When I looked at the 2019 accounts and the various circulars relating to the operation of the relationship between the line Departments and An Taisce, the correspondence coming back to us reflected a concern in respect of seeking clarification regarding the 2019 accounts.  An Taisce's 2019 financial statements stated that a change in An Taisce policy will result in a stipulation for a small allowance for organisational costs and innovation in all funding agreements going forward.  That set off an alarm bell in my mind because I was not sure whether some of the funding that is specifically for programmes that are well notified to us, such as the Green Flag, Investigate Forests, Clean Coasts and the Blue Flag, was being brought out of the educational silo of An Taisce, which delivers many of the programmes, and into the main An Taisce body.  That was the concern I had and I wanted to seek clarification.</p> <p>  Based on the correspondence we received back, it seems there are very specific engagements between the funders and An Taisce in respect of buttressing or strengthening service level agreements or reviewing current service level agreements or contracts in respect of that funding.  That provides one with a degree of confidence.  In the case of one Department, which I think was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department clarified this was not compatible with public financial procedures, stating the grant moneys must be spent entirely on the programmes the Department has agreed to fund within the specific conditions of those grants and that failure to adhere to these conditions could result in funding being withdrawn and possibly the recoupment of unapproved expenditure sought or other legal enforcement.</p> <p>  The impression I had was that, quite literally, An Taisce was taking a bit of a tranche of some of that funding-----</p></speech>

When we look at the delivery of the programmes I referenced, we can see they are excellent programmes and we are very lucky to have an organisation like An Taisce to deliver them.  I just wanted to seek clarity on that.  Based on the correspondence, it seems individual line Departments are taking a rigorous approach to interrogating that relationship and the 2019 accounts.</p> <p>  I am not a financial or management accountant.  If An Taisce is a membership organisation, from a public purse and financial probity point of view, do each of those line Departments, the State, the Government or, ultimately, the taxpayer have a right to look at the financial strength or otherwise of the parent organisation when they are funding that organisation?</p><p>In other words, does the parent organisation have to be in a solvent position before it can receive funds?  That is just a curiosity of mine.  The reason I am curious about that is because if, on An Taisce's previous year's financial accounts, auditors were saying that - and I am quoting from its financial accounts - for organisational costs and innovation and all funding agreements, that an allowance would be made and there would be a movement of some of the moneys then, one wonders, why that is the case if An Taisce is a financially robust organisation.  Hopefully, that can be clarified for me.  It may not be within the remit of this committee to have that clarified.  Again, I seek the Chair's wisdom on that.  </p><p> It serves a vital function in terms of the delivery of its excellent programmes, and it permeates out with citizens proactively involved in delivering those programmes.  It has built a consciousness and awareness and set of programmes that have had a massive impact in communities at the most local level.  It is important that we preserve that and protect it in every way that we can.  It does a vital piece of work.  However, at the same time, I imagine that we should satisfy ourselves that everything that is being done is absolutely with financial probity in mind.</p></speech>

The nub of the point the Deputy is making is that, before the parent organisation would provide funding to a body such as An Taisce, it would check the financial position of that body.  My dealings in seeing money coming from Departments to bodies such as this show they can be fairly rigorous.  Is it in all cases?  I do not know but I would imagine so.</p><p>I will read the note:</p> <blockquote> 	Following on from the committee&rsquo;s request for information on Exchequer funding provided to An Taisce, the Committee has now received all the necessary responses. <br /><br />The responses from the 11 bodies vary In the detail provided due to the level of funding disbursed to An Taisce by these entities.  The Secretariat have reviewed all of the responses and have ascertained that the level of oversight of An Taisce by the entities is proportional to the level of funding that they provide, and the required service level agreements in place are in line with Circular 13/2014 [this is the important one] - Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds. <br /><br />The responses also vary in relation to the funding entities&rsquo; knowledge of the restatement of the 2018 figures within the 2019 financial statements. The entities that provide the higher levels of funding to An Taisce were aware of the restatements and placed reliance on the unqualified auditors opinion.  The remaining entities that were unaware of the restatement have made enquiries of An Taisce and will be carrying out the necessary reviews in order to ensure required compliance.  In some instances Departments noted that they withheld funding from An Taisce until they were satisfied with the responses received from their enquiries into the 2018 restatement. <br /><br />Finally, in relation to the funding authorities satisfying themselves as to the intended use of the Exchequer funding, the responses received stated that regular meetings were held and An Taisce&rsquo;s reporting requirements under the various agreements were proportionate to the level of funding provided to An Taisce.  Some responses also noted that the majority of the funding on certain schemes run by An Taisce was on the basis of vouched expenditure.  </blockquote> <p>I thank the secretariat for scrutinising that and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That gives us a very good level of assurances.  I hope that answers the Deputy's point.  It was a valid point he raised.  If he is happy with it or, if he need something additional, could he please tell me?</p></speech>

I believe there are nine Government Departments that provide funding to An Taisce, for very specific and distinctive reasons, it has to be said.</p> <p>  I wrote to the Chair on this yesterday, so perhaps we can deal with this now.  Just to get clarification, does the secretariat's briefing note cover the Government Departments and the non-departmental public agencies as well?  I am aware, for example, that the National Transport Authority provides substantial funding to An Taisce as well.  If it does not, could we incorporate that in terms of having an overall view, as we would with any organisation that is in receipt of substantial State funding?  The word that is being used in terms of oversight is that it is "proportional".  What we are dealing with is a large number of relatively small funding mechanisms.  However, together, it is quite a substantial funding mechanism.  If the funding was coming from one source, perhaps the oversight arrangements would need to be broader so it would keep that in.  </p> <p>  It is all the context of public probity, that we ensure that any body receiving taxpayers' money is ensuring that it is going for its intended purpose and that everything is fully accountable.  I am not aware, just be very clear on the record, of any suggestion that is not happening in this case.  Within the remit of this committee, it is important that we can satisfy ourselves that is the case. </p></speech>

It was very helpful.  From the 2018 restatement, I have to say it does not appear to be a major financial issue, rather a kind of accounting error.</p><p>Just for clarity, we are talking about many agencies.  We made inquiries and we got responses back from them as follows.  The Department of Rural and Community Development had no significant issues and was satisfied as was the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which had no significant issues.  None of the following raised significant issues either - the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Education, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Failte Ireland.  Usually, when something comes to this committee, it is because there has been a significant issue identified.  </p><p>This week, and I think it is important to have this on the record, a senior EU official, Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea, who oversees governance, enforcement action and compliance on EU environmental legislation, called Ireland out not only - and I know it was well reported - on the cost of observations in terms of environment protection but he also talked about the climate of discussion in Ireland when it comes to environmental protection.  </p><p>That is what we are really talking about here.  It is the work that An Taisce does, funded by its members.  As we all know, it does not use Government funding for this.  It funds this from its members to observe on issues such as cheese factories and environmental projects that might go ahead.  One of the things he said that is of particular concern to the EU is an increasingly aggressive stance being taken against environmental campaigners in Ireland.  I quote:</p> <blockquote> 	There is evidence not only of increased use of (strategic lawsuit against public participation) SLAPP suits, but also negative reporting in mainstream media, and even from politicians &ndash; like threatening to cut off funding to certain NGOs... or negative reporting (of such).  </blockquote> <p>Just in today's session, we have had discussions around whether it is solvent and the financial strength, or otherwise, of parent organisations.  There has been a characterisation of the strengthening of the legislation or the wording in SLAs, as arising from something that has happened within An Taisce, which is absolutely not the case.  </p><p>Here we are today, watching this being played out.  We have not identified any wrongdoing in terms of public funds and An Taisce.  What we are doing today is undermining that organisation and fomenting suspicion around the operation of a body for wholly political reasons.</p></speech>

I welcome the information.  I do not know of any member of the committee that did not welcome it.  It is appropriate that any organisation receiving State funding be open to scrutiny.</p></speech>

Some of the programmes An Taisce runs are excellent.  That is a bigger political issue on all sides of the debate.  I am not going to allow to be opened up here a debate between people who believe the earth is still flat and people on the other side.  I am not going to go into that or allow it.  The point, however, is that legitimate questions be asked.  Every committee member, including me, has welcomed the very comprehensive responses that have come back.  Simply asking a question about funding is not casting any aspersions.  Deputy Carthy actually prefaced his remarks by saying he was not casting any aspersions in respect of the misappropriation or alleged misappropriation of funds.  That is the-----</p></speech>

Therefore, I am wondering what exactly is going on.</p></speech>

There is a very strong debate between both sides.  We do have to reduce our carbon emissions but that is a bigger issue and it is not for this chamber.  There is a fair amount of political consensus in this country on it.  It is a matter of how we do it.  Most sensible people agree that we have to move on with it.  There is no disagreement on that, but that is for another day.</p></speech>

I feel I have to put that on the record.  Clean Coasts Ballynamona is in my constituency.  I raised many a green flag myself when I was a Minister of State.  The Chairman will know from the tone of the language of my questioning that it was not with a view to seeking to undermine any organisation.  I stated very clearly on the record the great work that An Taisce does in respect of the delivery of the programme but since I am not a financial or forensic accountant, I have to rely on the guidance we receive from the secretariat and the correspondence we receive from the Departments.  We are fully entitled, as I understand it, to ask a question of any organisation.  I am merely posing the questions and am entitled to do that.</p></speech>

I take grave exception to that.  It is wrong that it should be inferred from my questioning; it is unfair.

We have a very fragmented body of information.  It is not coming from one Department but from many.  It is legitimate in relation to State agencies.  It is worthwhile putting the jigsaw together to determine the funding profile; it is absolutely of value.  I do not believe there is any motive behind an overview, nor do I believe there is anything jumping out that I would be concerned about.  If there is, it will be reflected in our work programme.  If not, I expect we will not be spending time on it.</p> <p>  I certainly do not want to include Deputy Sherlock in saying there will be people looking at this as undermining an organisation.  It may not be occurring within this committee but there is no doubt that it is a feature.  Calling for a shutting down of debate is part of the discussion in relation to things that people do not want to hear.  That is just a fact of life.</p></speech>

I would like to think that if there are items of clarification that might be of use to us in ensuring public money is spent to deliver value for money and for its stated purpose, we would ask the relevant question regardless of the issue or organisation before us.  I am an agriculture spokesperson.  I do not get involved, and have not passed public comment on, legal cases, even where there were Ministers on both sides, with one criticising and another supporting the legal action.  I do not pass judgment one way or another; I never have done.  As agriculture spokesperson, I deal with farm organisations whose objectives and mission statements I support but I would never consider those bodies to be above questioning by me on any matter requiring clarification.</p> <p>  Part of the problem we have had in this State for too long is that when politicians support the objectives of an organisation, they move to the point where they believe the organisation is beyond question.  That is a dangerous and unfortunate position.  I hope this committee is above that.  I do not believe that, in my time as a committee member, the questions asked and inquiries made were for anything other than to pursue the stated aims of the committee.  In most instances, I have been pleasantly surprised by the fact that Government representatives on this committee have been willing to support reports, questions and lines of inquiry that are very critical of Government Departments.  That is the way we should pursue our business here.  We should deal with every organisation in a courteous manner and ask questions when necessary.  We should accept the assurances that are given, but I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that, when talking about public money, we have a right to know whether an organisation is drawing down substantial amounts such that members of the committee can be absolutely satisfied regarding it and say with hand on heart that we have done our job without fear or favour.  That is how I approach all these issues.  I will continue to do so.</p></speech>

Our dealing with that does not mean we are trying to undermine any organisation.</p></speech>

It was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>last week that some information is contained in those minutes about the projected date of completion.  That would be important information for us to have.  As the newspaper has it I do not see why we would not have it.</p></speech>

If we could just ask for those.  I also wish to highlight an issue about which I have written to the committee.  It will not be dealt with until next week but there is a particular timeline attached to it.  It is about Benefacts, a not-for-profit organisation that was set up and provides a very useful, open and easy to use database.  The database gathers information on grants and such things.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is looking to cease that and the Charities Regulator will replace it, but what will be available is not as open or as flexible.  In advance of the discussion on this, I ask that the clerk write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and find out whether there is something we cannot see to explain their making this decision.  It is time sensitive.</p></speech>

Next week, on 10 February we will examine the expenditure on the national broadband plan with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Please note, as previously agreed we will engage with NBI, and this is the part members need to watch, from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and with the Department from 1.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.  Correspondence will be circulated as normal but will be held over to the following week, 17 February.</p> <p>  We then have a series of housing related meetings scheduled, starting with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 17 February, the Residential Tenancies Board on 24 February and Home Building Finance Ireland on 3 March.  I will ask the clerk - I raised this at last week's meeting - domestic refuge provision is an issue that cuts across several Departments.  There are nine counties, including County Laois and County Offaly, that do not have a domestic refuge.  I will use that opportunity.  It is an important issue.  We all know why it is important that at least we give advance notice and that we get an opportunity to deal with it, with the agreement of the committee.</p></speech>

We will come back to that.  Next week we have that, 10 February.  The timeline is 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and the afternoon session with the Department.  The agenda for the engagement with the Department is the 2020 appropriation accounts and from the Comptroller and Auditor General is the 2020 report on the Accounts of Public Services, Chapter 3 on the central Government funding for local authorities and Chapter 8 on the oversight of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  The Department has also been advised that the committee may wish to discuss the cost rental expenditure, expenditure on women's refuges and EU findings on the Derrybrien windfarm.  Briefings will be requested on these areas.</p> <p>  In regard to the engagement with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and Home Building Finance Ireland please let the clerk know if there are any particular areas of concern or interest to be brought up in regard to their financial statements.  This will allow a briefing to be requested in advance of the meeting and allow the witnesses to prepare for the engagement in those areas on the day.  Availability has been confirmed for all these engagements.  Is it agreed to proceed as outlined?  Agreed.  Thank you.

No doubt everyone on the committee recognised that mental health services in this State are wholly inadequate.  We have seen in the media coverage of the report on south Kerry CAMHS that 227 children were exposed to risk of significant harm and that 46 children suffered significant harm.</p><p>We have seen coverage in the media of the report on CAMHS in south Kerry and the 227 children who were exposed to risk of significant harm and the 46 children who suffered significant harm.  I expect there will be an inquiry into what occurred there.  </p><p> The committee could play a role concerning our mental health services more broadly.  We could invite representatives from the HSE to appear before us to address specific issues in the mental health services.  We could seek to get detailed notes on those aspects beforehand, as well as having the relevant senior officials here, to allow us to engage on this subject.</p><p> I recall that it was only in December that we heard that &euro;1.8 million of mental health funding was diverted to purchase electric vehicles for the HSE.  If the committee agrees, I think we should make this issue a priority and ask HSE officials to appear before the committee at the earliest opportunity to address it.  It is up to the committee, but perhaps we could set aside one of our meetings on a Thursday afternoon in the next few weeks for that purpose, if that might be possible.</p></speech>

With the agreement of committee members, we will ask that representatives be invited from the HSE and, presumably, from the Department for a session to discuss our mental health services.  We will have to try to work out the schedule, because there can be problems with what we have planned when it turns out that people cannot attend.  Perhaps a slot like that could be filled with the session Deputy Munster proposed.  Her request is that we should bring in witnesses to discuss this issue soon.  Is it agreed that we will invite representatives from the HSE to discuss the mental health services?  Agreed.  Equally, we should try to do this in a timely manner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.  </p></speech>

There are nine CHO areas.  This should not end up being a discussion on the clinical end of things, although that facet obviously comes into it.  We could look at the HSE nationally, but what goes on is a postcode lottery.  We are continuously being told the problem is not a shortage of funds.  Yet we still see, for example, &euro;10 million being diverted from the mental health services into other services.  We must try to get an understanding of how the finances are distributed in this context, if it is done objectively and how the process has worked to date.  We must make up our own minds about the money spent, if it has been spent efficiently and if we delivering in respect of what is being spent in this area.</p></speech>

We must ensure this proposed slot is used well and that we know precisely the areas we want to cover in it.  Of the overall health budget, &euro;1.1 billion is for mental health services.  Will this proposed session be specifically related to CAMHS or will it seek to cover mental health in general?  How broadly do we wish to address this issue?  It is a short timeline for a broad subject.  Equally, a significant amount of public spending is allocated to this area.  A sum of &euro;1 billion is not small, so how can we act in a precise way that will allow us to get into the meat of this topic?</p></speech>

Part of the problem here was evident when we met representatives of the HSE for two or three sessions last year to deal with the health services in their entirety.  Therefore, there is no way any one area would get the level of scrutiny it probably deserves.  In talking about bringing in witnesses to talk about the mental health services, Deputies Catherine Murphy and McAuliffe have rightly pointed out that even within that category we could probably use all our meetings for the rest of the year to scrutinise a specific topic.  The first thing we must do is to expedite this endeavour as quickly as possible, because there has been serious public interest in this topic.</p> <p>  This week alone, I have heard four senior Government representatives say in the D&aacute;il that money is not an issue in this regard.  Clearly, then, we must find out what is happening with all this money that is apparently being allocated to our mental services if we as public representatives are dealing with people every day of the week who are telling us they cannot access them.  I suggest that we invite the senior management of the HSE, including the CEO, to appear before the committee as soon as possible, as proposed by Deputy Munster.  We can clarify in our private sessions what aspects we will be dealing with.  I do not envisage this being a once-off meeting.  We will probably need to follow it up with more sessions.</p></speech>

As others said, we are continuously told that money is no object, and yet it is not transferring down into the delivery of services.  Regarding the massive budget we are told is there, we must find out, not only from the perspective of service provision but also that of the public purse, where the money is going and why it is not delivering services on the ground.  The crisis in mental health is increasing weekly.  It is imperative to have representatives from the HSE appear before the committee.  As Deputy Carthy suggested, we could have a private meeting ourselves to set out what exactly we need to know.  The general topics, however, would include the budget, a breakdown of it and information on the delivery of services, including details of service provision in each CHO area.  We will need all that type of information.  It will be a minefield, but despite the amount of money we are told is being thrown at the mental health services, not one person could honestly put up his or her hand and say that he or she can see the results on the ground.</p></speech>

In accordance with international best practice, that should be increasing to 11% or 12%.  I just note that.

That is the best thing to do, and may be helpful.  Several difficulties arise when trying to schedule meetings.  As we have seen over the last year and a half, we can have difficulty scheduling meetings with representatives from organisations because of availability, diary conflicts or the time needed to prepare.  It is difficult to arrange the schedule as we would wish it to be.  The secretariat works diligently in this regard.  It is not something done just once a month.  The secretariat works not only weekly but daily, indeed, to engage and to try to keep things moving along.  They do that six, seven and eight weeks in advance.  It will be noted that it was difficult to schedule meetings at different times during the pandemic because we were not even sure if we would be able to have meetings.  Arrangements cannot be made fortnightly or every three weeks, because if representatives from one organisation do drop out, then it will not be possible to fill that slot at short notice.  It is necessary to give people a month's notice to allow them to prepare.  I ask the committee members to bear that point in mind.  Moving one meeting will have unintended consequences for people in other areas.  I ask the members to be mindful of that aspect as well.</p> <p>  To outline the schedule, we have matters nailed down until 3 March.  Commitments have been sought and given, and the preparation work has been done.  To allow the secretariat to make the necessary arrangements and to avoid any potential scheduling difficulties, I will set out the work programme up to 5 May, as outlined in the work programme document circulated for today's meeting.</p><p>From 10 March, we will move into a series of justice-related meetings.  We are scheduled to engage with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, on that date.  Last week, we agreed to engage with the Policing Authority the same morning.</p><p> The following week, beginning 14 March, is a non-sitting week.  On 24 March, it is proposed to schedule an engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and on 31 March, with the Department of Justice.  If, for example, we schedule the meeting on mental health issues for 10 March, it will mean changing that arrangement again.  I hope I am reflecting accurately that it is the committee's wish to get those issues relating to justice and the Garda, that is, with GSOC, the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, within the same block.  We agreed last week that we will try to do it over two weeks.  If we move the meeting of 10 March, it will mean kicking the can down the road on meeting those three bodies again.  I do not know whether the committee wishes to do that, but I am just pointing out that it could create a difficulty.</p><p> I am also mindful of the point raised by Deputy McAuliffe, namely, that it may be better to try to cover this mental health piece in a series of meetings.  There may have to be two or three related hearings on mental health-related issues.  I ask members to bear that in mind, although I am open to suggestions about how we deal with it.  As it stands, we will start those justice-related meetings on 10 March.  L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile P&aacute;draig is 17 March and the next public meeting after that will be held on 24 March, when we will deal with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That will then conclude that set of meetings.  I appreciate the urgency of this and I agree with Deputy Munster on the area of mental health services.  We have had representatives of the HSE before us a number of times and, unfortunately, we have not had an opportunity to deal with mental health services.  The issue requires and deserves a proper examination.  We need to be careful that we do not knock everything else off the schedule.</p></speech>

That would not negate following through on what Deputy McAuliffe mentioned, namely, holding more in-depth meetings as a later stage?</p></speech>

To get a proper hearing, we will have to have the witnesses before us in the morning also.  If it is an important issue for us - I think that is accepted - we do not want it to be pushed onto the tail end of the day.  That would not do it justice, for want of a better term.  I suggest we try to slot in the meeting for 10 March and push everything else back by one week, if that is agreeable.</p></speech>

Is it too logistically cumbersome to deal with two different issues on the same day?</p></speech>

It is not open to the clerk to the committee to contribute right now but dealing with two issues in one day would create difficulties and I am conscious of that.  We need to be realistic about what we can cover.  The preparation for a meeting in any given week is considerable, as members will know from the work they put into meetings along with their personal assistants, the secretariat, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and everyone else involved.  It is not as simple as just scheduling a meeting and the meeting happens.  Weeks of work go into the build-up.</p> <p>  We need to move on.  The option is there and I propose we return to it when we can allow the secretariat to comment.  We will try to deal with it that way.  For now, the schedule up to 3 March has been nailed down and there is a provisional schedule beyond that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022020300002#JJ00900"><p>I would suggest that is not a bad option but I want to allow the secretariat to comment and I cannot do that in public session.  Provisionally, there is a suggestion we go with that.  It is widely recognised that what the Deputy has proposed is worthy and needs to be dealt with as an urgent issue.  I ask her to bear with us until we deal with the rest of the meetings.  I think she will be happy with what we decide.  We will come to a conclusion that will meet the needs of the committee, which is the important thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.662" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022020300002#JJ01000"><p>I appreciate there is a difficulty in that we are in public session and we cannot engage with the officials in that format, but I am not clear as to what the agreement is.  It is such a serious issue that we could even examine community mental health as a stand-alone issue, dealing with the various organisations where there are service level agreements with the HSE as well as dealing with CAMHS.  It is too broad an area to cover in one meeting.  Is the suggestion that we would have the meetings on 10 and 24 March?  There was a separate proposal that we would discuss in private session which areas we will cover.  I am worried about agreeing to a time for a meeting whose scope we have not yet outlined and for which we have not decided who will appear before us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-03a.663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022020300002#JJ01100"><p>I ask members to be helpful on this.  I will return to it soon, given it will not take very long if we allow it to happen.  There was a suggestion that we would have two meetings but that would add a further complication.  I ask members to bear with me while we nail this down conclusively.  I qualify this by saying that, if we decide to take 10 March as the meeting on mental health and if we accept the Deputy's suggestion to hold a further meeting on 24 March, that will push other issues a week or two down the road.</p> <p>  I reiterate what has been agreed.  Last week, we agreed we would schedule a meeting with the University of Limerick, UL, and include in our invitation a request that the chancellor, Mary Harney, would attend, given the nature of her position and the duration of her tenure, along with the president, who is the accountable person.  That is on 7 April.  UL's financial statements for the year 2019-20 should be available to us at that point.</p> <p>  In accordance with our work programme, we would then engage with the Department of Finance on 14 April and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after the Easter break, on 5 March.  I ask members to agree to that on the basis that we will sort out later what we will do about the meeting on mental health, that is, whether we should introduce it for the meeting of 10 March or whether we should schedule a double meeting for 10 and 24 March.  I am not asking members to agree on the exact dates but rather I propose we take them in that order, subject to sorting out of the business of the mental health issues.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I propose we go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 10 February, when we will engage with National Broadband Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of expenditure on the national broadband plan.</p></speech>
