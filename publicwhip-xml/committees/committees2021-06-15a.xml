    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#A00200"><p>I thank members and witnesses for participating in today's committee meeting in line with the exceptional circumstances we have to deal with during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I remind the committee that, apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the precincts of the Leinster House complex only.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton and Senators Gavan and Ahearn.</p> <p>  Today we will give consideration to the general scheme of the companies (small company administrative rescue process) Bill 2021.  Recently, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Robert Troy, wrote to the Business Committee seeking an exemption from the normal pre-legislative scrutiny requirements in light of the urgency of getting this Bill enacted.  This is the third time the Department has requested an exemption from normal pre-legislative scrutiny requirements from us, and these are not requests to which I agree or ask the committee to agree lightly.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is an essential part of our role as legislators.  Since the beginning of the year our committee has been very busy and has agreed to pre-legislative scrutiny on the corporate enforcement authority Bill and the sale of tickets Bill, since enacted, and we are to complete pre-legislative scrutiny of the competition Bill.</p> <p>  The general scheme we will be discussing today provides for a rescue mechanism for small and microbusinesses facing financial and trading difficulties exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the aim of preventing the closure of otherwise viable companies and providing them with the necessary breathing room to continue in operation and trade their way out of present difficulties.  The Minister of State's request to the Business Committee for a waiver of pre-legislative consideration has been passed on to this committee for our observations.  Following today's meeting we are required to communicate these decisions to the Business Committee for it to decide on the application for a waiver.  As the committee will know, we had been scheduled to commence today's meeting at 9.30 a.m. with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy.  Subsequently, however, the Minister of State was unable to attend.  A letter to this effect has been circulated to members explaining his reasons.  In his place, we are delighted to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy English, who indicated that he would be available from 9.45 a.m., hence the later start time for today's meeting.  I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State to brief the committee on the general scheme and on the case for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses, as I said, will give their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> The opening statement of the Minister of State, Deputy English, has been circulated to members, as has a letter to the Business Committee from the Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chair for the introduction and for facilitating the time change to allow me to participate in the place of the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.  I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the forthcoming Bill to amend the Companies Act 2014 and to provide for a small company administrative rescue process.  I am joined online by two officials from my Department, Ms Fiona O&rsquo;Dea and Ms Tara Keane.  They are happy to take any questions if I am unable to answer them.  After today's discussion, we will be happy to engage with the committee over the coming weeks.  We hope to finalise work on the Bill and bring it to Cabinet on 22 June or the following week.  We will then bring the legislation through the Houses and discuss it with the select committee.</p><p>The companies (small company administrative rescue process and miscellaneous provisions) Bill is included as a legislative priority on the Government&rsquo;s legislation programme for the summer session.  It delivers on a programme for Government commitment to review the Companies Act to simplify and improve examinership laws in response to the Covid-19 crisis and follows on foot of proposals by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in response to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s request that it examine the issue of corporate rescue specifically for small companies and advise as to how such a process might be put in place.  I know this is an issue the committee has discussed several times and members have sought to find a simplified and less costly process to address the matter.  </p><p>On 8 July 2020, the T&aacute;naiste requested that the CLRG examine the issue of rescue for the sector.  Membership of the CLRG, which is a statutory body, is wide and representative of a broad range of stakeholder experts, making it uniquely well-positioned to advise on company law.  It has served us well in this space before.  The CLRG submitted its report in October 2020 and recommended a rescue process for small companies, which would be stand-alone and separate from the examinership process, but which would mirror key elements of the examinership legislation.  Since receipt of that report, the Department has worked closely with the Office of the Attorney General in developing the CLRG&rsquo;s advice from both an operational and policy perspective.  Throughout this process, we have also had strong engagement with the Revenue Commissioners, the Departments of Social Protection and Justice and other relevant stakeholders.  In addition, my Department launched a public consultation earlier this year to inform development of the general scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, notified this committee of the consultation and invited it to make submissions.  An overview of all submissions made, the responses to them and the reasoning underpinning those responses is available in a report on the Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>In overall terms, the Department has engaged in a process which has been transparent and accessible and has involved substantial submissions from representative bodies for employers and employees across all sectors and industry professionals in the field of company law and insolvency.  As a consequence, I am pleased to note that the general scheme of the Bill has met with a generally positive response from industry and professionals in the field.  I ask the joint committee, in considering our request for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, to bear in mind the role of the CLRG in developing the Bill and the level of engagement with stakeholders in the public consultation.</p><p>As members will know, the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for a small company administrative rescue process, one that can assist viable<i></i>small and micro-size companies to remain in business, as the economy recovers and supports are phased out, and to try to protect as many jobs as possible.  </p><p>We know from years of experience that examinership works.  It saves both companies and employment.  It is internationally recognised and is a successful tool for restructuring, in its own right.  However, examinership is overseen by the court from beginning to end.  For this reason, it can be an expensive undertaking and, thus, potentially out of reach for the average small company, whether that be a local restaurant, hairdresser or other similar businesses.  The small company administrative rescue process is designed to reduce those costs insofar as possible and provide access to an affordable and much-needed avenue of rescue and recovery for small companies in difficulty.  It has limited court involvement where creditors are engaged in the process and positively disposed to a rescue plan.  However, the option for court involvement remains, if there is no agreement by the creditors.  This is an important part of the process.  </p><p>The Bill replicates key provisions of the examinership model in an administrative context.  While it provides for certain novel concepts, it does so by building on a tried and tested framework, with the benefit of years of experience and jurisprudence.  The proposals are founded on an existing bedrock of well-understood and well-respected law and they deliver an accessible, fair and balanced process for the broad range of stakeholders impacted by corporate rescue. </p><p>The introduction of this legislation, or any new legislation, is not without risk.  For this reason, officials in my Department have engaged extensively with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure the process is constitutionally robust and meets the required standards of procedural fairness.  Therefore, the process incorporates robust safeguards, including court oversight, where appropriate.  It strikes a fair balance between the needs of the company and its creditors.</p><p>The main provisions of the Bill can be broadly summarised as follows.  The Bill is designed to help small and micro companies, as defined by the Companies Act 2014, which constitute approximately 98% of companies in Ireland.  The rescue process is commenced by resolution of directors, rather than by application to the court.  It is concluded within a shorter period than examinership.  It is overseen and implemented by a qualified insolvency practitioner, to whom we refer in the context of the Bill as &ldquo;process advisor&rdquo;.  The rescue plan can be passed by a majority of creditors.  The Bill provides for the format of cross-class cram-down of debts, designed to reduce costs.  The process does not require an application to court in circumstances where no creditor objects to the plan.  Where creditors do object to the rescue plan, the courts will then have a role in adjudicating the matter, as is currently the case in examinership.  The Bill also incorporates safeguards against, and penalties for, irresponsible or dishonest director behaviour. </p><p>On foot of recommendations made by the CLRG in its first phase of work in the area of employees' rights as creditors during a liquidation and taking into consideration the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&rsquo;s, ICTU, minority report to the CLRG report, the Bill also enables the Companies Act 2014 to provide for a number of actions that can be addressed in the short term to improve the quality and circulation of information to employees as creditors.  In that regard, I am also happy to engage with the committee on the overall plan of action that we discussed previously, as it is not fully dealt with in this legislation.  I will also be happy to engage with the committee on its report on this area.</p><p>These amendments feature in the plan of action the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I published last week.  It contains a range of commitments, including amendments to employment law and company law, to enhance protections and ensure transparency for employees in insolvencies. </p><p>As we emerge from a sustained period of lockdown, and as Government supports for businesses are gradually phased out, this is a Bill of the utmost importance and urgency.  We are all aware of the enormous pressure business owners currently face in terms of not only their immediate liquidity, but also the sustainability of their businesses into the future.  This is particularly true of small and micro companies, which employ almost 800,000 workers.  Some 78% of small and micro companies operate in sectors that have been particularly challenged by the pandemic, such as retail, hospitality and the service industry.  The contributions these companies make to our economy cannot be understated.  They will be key to our country&rsquo;s economic recovery, which we want to be jobs led.  It is for this reason that the Government is so committed to providing a genuine, alternative rescue framework for these companies.</p><p>This Bill is an integral part of Government&rsquo;s response to the economic impact of the pandemic.  It provides for a rescue framework for small and micro companies, many of which have been significantly challenged by Covid-19.  Our response to the crisis has proven successful in mitigating the immediate impact of the pandemic on these companies, so far.  However, as the economy reopens, we must have an appropriate regulatory response, not simply planned but actually in place and available to small businesses.  It should support fundamentally viable companies to continue to trade and get themselves back on their feet, and to preserve employment.  It is our responsibility to ensure that this essential rescue process is implemented in time to make a difference to these companies.  To that end, I ask the joint committee to approve a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, so that we may achieve enactment of this important legislation before the summer recess. </p><p>As I said, my officials and I are happy to answer members' questions and provide greater detail on the provisions of the Bill.  We are also available after the meeting to go through any finer points if members want or need more time on this.  We would like to have the support of the committee on the journey of this necessary legislation.  As I said, we hope to bring it through Cabinet next week or the week after in order that we can begin the formal process in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I invite members who wish to speak to raise a hand using the raise hand function on Teams.  It is important, when they finish their contribution, that they cancel the raised hand.  The first speaker will be Deputy Louise O&rsquo;Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#B00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending and facilitating this discussion.  I was not expecting him this morning so while he is here, I remind him that we are still waiting on the heads of the Bill for the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  If he could get that to us as soon as possible, it would be much appreciated.  I do not like to be in the position of waiving pre-legislative scrutiny as we all get a lot from it.</p><p>However, I do understand and accept the urgency in this situation.  I welcome the Bill.  I am not the only person in that position.  At some point we have all referenced the need for examinership "lite", or some version of that, so this is good.  However, I do have a couple of questions if that is okay.  I may take the opportunity to follow up if that is in order as well.</p><p> Regarding speeding up the process, what is the estimated time saving involved?  How much quicker is it anticipated that it will be in comparison to the current process?  This leads to another question and if it is all right, I will take the two of them together.  It is about the cost of it.  Does the Minister of State have an estimated cost of the process at this point in the proceedings?</p><p> Head 52 relates to the costs and remuneration of process advisers.  It indicates that they will use the resources of the company, but they might not exist.  We are talking about small businesses, so we are not talking about places that would be massively overstaffed with administration and backroom staff.  In the event that it is not there or that it is not forthcoming for whatever reason, could that lead to a situation whereby costs will escalate in a way that would not be desirable?  Perhaps the Minister of State will respond to those questions first.  I have a couple of other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#C00200"><p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her support in principle for the legislation.  I totally accept the concerns about not having pre-legislative scrutiny.  I accept that is a process she would not like to see continue.  I know we will avoid it as much as we possibly can.</p> <p>  Regarding the other legislation, I hope to have something for the Deputy in the coming week or two.  As per my commitment, as soon as I have it, I will share it with everybody, and we will tease it out.  I know there has been some engagement with our officials on that piece as well and it can continue because we want to have everybody on board with it is as much as we possibly can.</p> <p>  The rough timeline we expect is that once a process adviser is appointed, he or she has up to 49 days to produce a rescue plan.  That is the target.  In terms of how long the process will take thereafter, it depends on the rescue plan and what is put in place in that regard.  My understanding is that there is no official end time on the process, but the aim is to save companies that are viable and can be protected and to put in place a plan, by agreement, within 49 days.</p> <p>  It is hard to clarify the exact costs that will be involved.  At the moment we think the costs of examinership are an issue and a barrier to the process.  They are in the region of &euro;80,000 to &euro;120,000 for the normal examinership process.  What we expect for this process is somewhere between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000.  Naturally, if there is full agreement and everyone is on board, there is a quick resolution and a plan is put in place quickly, it could be a lot less.  That is roughly what we expect if creditors are in agreement and there is no need to involve the courts in the process.  That is based on experience and getting feedback, but I cannot give any guarantees on that.  What we hope to do is to put in place a cheaper model if everybody plays his or her part to reduce the costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#C00300"><p>That would involve both the co-operation and the staff being available at that point.  Clearly, it will cost more then if they are not available.  I am trying to get an understanding of what is involved.  I expect that the figure of &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 would involve the staff being available and additional staff not having to be hired?  I suppose the hope is that is what would happen.</p> <p>  I did not see it, but if it is there the Minister of State can point it out to me.  Is there any legal mechanism to make sure that wages or moneys owed to the workers &ndash; it is not just about the business owners; it must also be about the people working there &ndash; are protected as part of the rescue process?  I apologise if it is there and I missed it, but perhaps the Minister of State could point it out to me.  That would be fantastic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.13" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>Deputy Damien EnglishThere are two pieces in that regard.  As Deputy O'Reilly is aware, statutory entitlements are protected in any of these processes if they are not paid out by the company.  That is clear in law.  I accept there is an ongoing debate about strengthening that provision and we are happy to continue the discussion in that regard.

Employees are among the creditors who must agree to the rescue plan.  They are very much involved in this process, which they should be in all cases, because they are a major creditor as well.  Unless I have missed it &ndash; my officials might want to clarify this &ndash; there is no enhancement of the statutory rights of employees yet.  We are engaged in a conversation on that process.  Part of the plan of action is to strengthen the information around employees as creditors and that was part of the process of engagement with the committee and the discussion on the Duffy Cahill report and other reforms as well.  The entitlements have not changed in this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#C00500"><p>I might come in to respond to Deputy O'Reilly&rsquo;s question.  The ongoing expenses of employees will continue to be paid, as they are critical to the continuation of the business and the normal suite of employment protections will apply.  Employees will continue to receive their wages and other statutory entitlements for the duration of the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#C00600"><p>I thank Ms Keane very much for the clarification.  I also thank the Minister of State.  I would like to see something a bit stronger in the Bill in terms of the protections for workers because I sometimes think the focus can go off the people who will be impacted.  It is not just the people who own and run the business.  We will have an opportunity to discuss that further.</p> <p>  Will there be a register of process advisers so that people can find them quickly?  There is a concern that vital time could be lost while one is looking for those supports.  A centralised register guarantees minimum qualification and while the qualifications are essential, more importantly, that people looking to access the service would have a one-stop shop where they would be able to access a register and easily find a person to help them through the process.  Has the Minister of State given consideration to compiling a register like that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.16" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>Deputy Damien EnglishI know that one must be qualified as a liquidator in order to become a process adviser.  I will bring Ms Keane in to respond to the question of a register.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#C00800"><p>No, we had not given consideration to a register, the reason being that in order to be a process adviser, one must be qualified under section 633 of the Companies Act to be a liquidator.  That sets out the various people who can act in that capacity.  It would be the typical insolvency practitioners who run examinerships and liquidations, and solicitors.  We did not feel there was necessarily a need for a central register, given that it was already established practitioners that companies are used to dealing with in the course of their business.</p></speech>

What is the difference in how proposals are accepted under this process and the normal process?  Will this perhaps lead to a deluge of objections or does she reckon it will go smoothly enough?</p> <p>  Under the same head, in subsection (7) there is an indication that the State will not object to any plans where a majority vote in favour.  Obviously, if the majority back a proposal the State will back off, but that might still lead to some people being disenfranchised.</p></speech>

That is just an unfortunate reality.  We must provide people with an opportunity to object in order for the process to be compatible with the Constitution.  We cannot mandate a write-down of property rights.  However, what does happen here is that one only needs one class of impaired creditor to approve the rescue plan, so that means if over 50% in one class approve it then this can be imposed on the other classes.  There will then be a cooling off period within which the objections can come in.  The extent to which people approve the plan is really dependent on the quality of the process adviser's report and how much he or she has convinced them that this is the best way to go.  What process advisers have to do is to prove to creditors that they will be better off in this scenario than they would be if the company were wound up and that they will receive more money this way than that.</p></speech>

People have to believe the rescue plan can rescue the company and give it the best chance of getting its debts paid and saving the jobs as well.  The Deputy asked about the protection of employees and that is the key here.  The real aim is to keep the company viable and operating, and that generally works as well.</p> <p>  It is fair to say Revenue has taken a very responsible approach to the examinership process in general and, in 90% of cases, it does agree with the plans and it does buy in.  However, it has to protect the State as well.  If there are any issues for Revenue, it is generally based on historical evidence in regard to the company's performance or track record.</p></speech>

I have one more question which relates to head 48, the provision with respect to leases.  Most of the businesses I have spoken to in the last 18 months will say that what is driving them into debt is a lack of forbearance by commercial landlords, and &ldquo;forbearance&rdquo; is a word I hope we will consign to the dustbin of history post-Covid because, generally, it will be shown that the people talking about forbearance cannot demonstrate when that forbearance is shown.  I know there are constitutional issues that the Minister of State has referenced in regard to property rights, and they are difficult to circumvent.  There are situations where the debts are effectively strangling a company that might otherwise have a very sound business model and be a very sound business but, due to the commercial rents and the lack of forbearance on the part of commercial landlords, they are being driven into debt and driven towards this process.  Has any consideration been given to how that might be supported within the legislation?</p></speech>

Ms Keane might want to come in on the specifics because there is an ongoing requirement in regard to the rent thereafter as well.</p></speech>

What happens is that, subject to court approval, they can formally accept or reject certain uncompleted contracts to which the company is party.  Any party which suffers a loss as a result of that is awarded compensation, and this ranks as an unsecured debt as part of the rescue plan.  Where this comes in with regard to leases is that, in examinership, the repudiation clauses are frequently used to renegotiate rents and other onerous contracts.  It is actually very unusual for it to end up in court because it provides the stick with which one can encourage those negotiations and mutual reorganisation of the contract.  I should also state that this is a particular provision we are looking at quite closely with the Attorney General to refine it and streamline it further.</p></speech>

As we are all aware, for anyone involved in business or enterprise, the facts are that during the examinership process, the majority of costs are usually of a legal nature.  That this legislation is removing the requirement to go to court will certainly help businesses and will reduce costs significantly.</p> <p>  Where a creditor triggers an objection, there is a requirement to have the scheme confirmed by court.  Will the Minister of State advise whether he is concerned about disingenuous or frivolous objections, where creditors might use the threat of such objections to attempt to secure enhanced payment for themselves over other creditors?  Is this a concern?  Was consideration given to imposing penalties for such objections, such as the creditor having to pay any legal costs and so on?  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

In regard to the second question, while I was engaged in the preparation of this Bill, I will let Ms Keane comment on whether it was considered, although I am sure it was.  The benefit here is to try to encourage everybody to get involved in this process to save the company and protect its ongoing debts in general, so there is a chance of paying them.  We hope a majority would buy into this process, as opposed to objecting to it or going into the courts process.  I understand the point the Senator is making, that is, that one individual, large creditor could have an impact on the overall process.  If it is returned to the courts for an opinion, the reasons for that objection would naturally be first judged by the courts and they are the best place to do that.  Our Constitution contains protection of property rights so, at all times, there has to be access to the courts, if needs be.  Naturally, the aim here is that we can avoid that but there has to be full support in general.  Ms Keane might want to come in on whether it had been considered previously.</p></speech>

We thought it was an unfair balance because when we are talking about creditors, we are often talking about other small companies and perhaps unsophisticated creditors who would not be used to a court process.  We felt that to impose a significant penalty on them for raising what could be a valid objection just did not fit in with the overall procedural fairness and robustness of the process, and that it would be disproportionate for them to bear the burden of cost.  Also, in examinership, it is for the company and the examiner to prove to the court that the rescue plan is fair, that it is not unfairly prejudicial to any creditor and that the same burden of proof should apply in the SCARP, the small company administrative rescue process.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome this and believe it is timely and much-needed.  I have no doubt there are many companies which are carrying burdens and that need restructuring but, underlying that, they are viable companies.</p> <p>  It goes back to the cost of access.  The reason we have only about one fifth of the access to examinership that there is in the UK is the very high cost in Ireland associated with going to court.  I know the role of the court has been reduced but, on the choice of a requirement for qualification as a liquidator, I would be interested to know why that was required and whether it creates a very high entry barrier for small companies looking to use this procedure.</p> <p>  We get the impression that liquidators are a small group of people and they can almost name their price and, as I understand it, their bill is the first that has to be paid from any resolution.  On that element, I would be interested to know why there cannot be a little bit more relaxation in regard to the type of person.  Undoubtedly, they need to be capable of assessing and ensuring that no creditor is unfairly prejudiced, and all the rest of it.</p> <p>  Second, I want to understand the threshold for moving ahead with the proposal.  Is it that it includes over half of the creditors by value?  I know that, obviously, one has to have the power, and I think the term used is to "cram down", although in a fair way, but we cannot let one hold up the overall.  How is the threshold decided as to when there are enough creditors on board for the process to proceed, albeit that an objection can still be raised?</p><p>The speed issue, which Deputy O'Reilly raised, will continue to be a concern.  If this runs on for a long time, it will be more difficult and onerous.  Will the Minister of State indicate where he thinks the quicker process has been achieved?</p><p> Many companies, having come through this process, will be short of capital.  There is a risk that viable businesses will become zombie companies in that they cannot get access to new capital.  One of the problems with examinership has traditionally been the lack of finance providers willing to take on companies that have been established as financially viable following restructuring.  How does the Government intend to approach that?  Certain categories of investor get support from the Exchequer in one form or another.  For companies coming through this process, will there be a need to establish access to capital?  Some of the vehicles the Government has put in place may be suited, but in some cases there may be a need for new equity.  Will that be part of this process?  Could the process involve a requirement to have new equity come in and to identify its sources?  I am trying to better understand how one would get a company that is temporarily struggling to return to a viable growth path.</p></speech>

To respond in reverse order, the main aim of these structured resettlements is to assist companies with a sound business model and a viable future, as the Deputy identified.  It is generally their legacy debts that are the difficulty.  The process of putting the rescue plan in place should deal with ongoing financial costs and highlight where they are part of the plan or access to finance is key to making the plan.  Often, companies in this position have a bright future from a trading point of view if they have time to deal with legacy debts.  That was the planning process which the Deputy will be familiar with.  What we could do----</p></speech>

We would be willing to review the credit guarantee and proposals brought through the system with the approval of the House of the Oireachtas.  They are working extremely well and de-risk financial providers of those loans, be they credit unions, mainstream banks or others.  They are encouraged to back sustainable businesses because the State and the EU take on some of the risk.</p> <p>  The credit guarantees in place for this and next year, which we have extended, should be sufficient but we can track that and monitor any judgments.  The Credit Review Office will deal with refusals of credit.  We can track that as well.  They are measures in place now that were not in place after the last financial crisis and which would have been of great benefit back then.  Structures are in place but we will have an ongoing review of that and track that.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to equity as opposed to borrowing finance.  The SME task force highlighted this as an issue we need to look at to encourage equity stakes in SME communities and microbusinesses.  The budget will look at that but there are no proposed changes linked to this legislation.  The point is well made and I will track that.</p> <p>  In this case, the threshold for proceeding with a proposal is a majority of creditors by value.  That is different to an examinership, which is a majority by value and number.  That should result in greater acceptance of the plans. </p> <p>  On the necessity to qualify as a liquidator, it is important that the person who will become process adviser has the qualifications to do the job.  The Deputy made the point that it should not be cost prohibitive.  A number of people are qualified to do it and it is linked in the legislation.  Ms Keane may wish to speak on the specific qualifications but my understanding is that the bar is not especially high but not everybody concentrates on this business.  Once this process is in place, we may see a number of companies use it that have not been able to use examinership processes in the past.  More people might make themselves available as process advisers.</p> <p>  The question the Deputy will probably ask next is what are the likely numbers.  We do not know.  The Deputy and many others have made the case strongly that this legislation needs to be put in place and we share that view.  We have no idea what the numbers will be like because Government supports, with the backing of the full Houses of the Oireachtas, have kept those businesses alive to this stage.  Only in the recovery stage will we find out what businesses are in a position to continue.  Hopefully the majority will, but we have to recognise that some companies will need to avail of a scheme like this.  Even at that, this process will not save all companies.  Does Ms Keane wish to respond on the issue of qualifications?</p></speech>

One has to be qualified as a liquidator, which means it is open to members of an accountancy body, qualified solicitors, members of one of the other professional bodies regulated by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IASSA, suitably qualified people from other member states and people with significant experience of insolvency proceedings under a grandfathering provision.  There is a good pool of people from which to choose.  However, I take the Deputy's point that there will be a cost involved.  We felt it was important for the overall robustness of the process that a specialist person be in place to advise the company.  Notwithstanding that this applies to micro and small companies, they may have tricky affairs which need to be considered.  It speaks to the overall robustness and protection of creditors if we ensure someone suitably qualified does that, particularly in circumstances where we have removed court supervision.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the point about overall time saving.  Currently, examinerships can run for up to 150 days, on the basis of temporary amendments being made under the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act.  However, they typically last 100 days.  This process is expected to conclude in 70 days, which is subject to getting a rescue plan by day 49 and having a  21-day cooling-off period.  There will be circumstances in which it can be done more quickly and there is flexibility in the Bill to allow this to happen.</p></speech>

It makes logical sense.  Part of the directors and creditors agreeing a plan will be around costs and viability.  If the costs are excessive, it will not be possible to use this system and save the company, so it is in everyone's interest that the costs are manageable.  The Deputy is right that it can be expensive, which we want to avoid.  We will track and monitor that.</p> <p>  We have engagement from all stakeholders on this and we can continue that to see how to use the process to its best ability, once we get it through the Houses with Members' support in the weeks and months ahead.</p></speech>

I think everybody agrees this is very important legislation.  We need to get it over the line as quickly as possible.  Will the Minister of State highlight where Revenue debt and, in particular, leases will be considered in terms of prioritising outstanding debt in this process?  We will have companies that have already warehoused Revenue debt.  In this proposed process, how will this be dealt with?  Is Revenue a preferential creditor which would see no write-down while the burden would be placed on private companies?</p><p>Maybe the burden will have to be placed on private companies.  Could the Minister of State give us an idea about that?  The same applies to leases.  What is the Minister of State's attitude to leases?  Where there is an onerous lease, we are asking the business to get involved in an examinership process, yet the landlord might be saying he cannot take any hit on the lease.  There may also be upward-only rent clauses on foot of which payments must be made.</p></speech>

There are two issues.  Leasing, I believe, is dealt with under head 48 in relation to contracts.  There is a process to have a conversation with the landlord.  There are two issues.  Separate from this legislation, we have had an ongoing conversation with the business community on potential legacy debts from rent and arrears.  Since the start of the pandemic, the Government, through the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and many others have requested that all landlords and others involved in leasing, be they institutional landlords or private landlords, engage with their tenants to try to find a way through this.  We have put in place a voluntary code of conduct to try to enable this process.  It has been of assistance in many cases.  My Department is doing work on this in conjunction with the Department of Finance to determine whether we need to assist more.  An arbitration model that has worked well in other countries is being suggested by some but, in the majority of leasing contracts here, an arbitration process is already identified.  Therefore, we are not convinced about what the State could add to the process.</p> <p>  Under the process in the proposed legislation, there is an opportunity for the process adviser to work with all creditors, engage and put in place a rescue plan, which would involve dealing with rents, leases and ongoing costs.  There is an opportunity to repudiate contracts and to try to deal with this issue.  What the Deputy is talking about is a rescue plan in this regard.  As he knows, various supports have been provided by the State on behalf of the taxpayer to the businesses in question.  We did not stipulate which costs or bills businesses would pay.  That is a decision every business has to make for itself.  In most cases of which we are aware, people have sat down with all their providers of services, including in respect of properties, and worked out a payment plan.  That is what we would encourage in this regard.  Those conversations have gone on.  Admittedly, there are still some cases that are not dealt with.  Naturally, we do not want legacy debts to drag a business down.  We will continue to engage and work on this. </p> <p>  The supports announced under the economic recovery plan will assist businesses with their ongoing costs, certainly their wage costs.  The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is continuing.  The new business resumption support scheme, BRSS, payment, to be introduced in September, will assist companies that have still not reached a turnover allowing them to pay their bills.  The small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, is in operation and there are various other arrangements.  I accept they are not all sufficient to replace lost turnover and profits but they are certainly of assistance in paying some of the bills.</p> <p>  With regard to Revenue, warehousing was mentioned specifically.  As the Deputy knows, the option to warehouse debts in this regard was extended beyond August of this year until the end of this year.  For all of 2022, there will be no interest charged on the warehouse debt but the charge will kick in thereafter, in 2023.  Therefore, one has a full 12 months, after which Revenue will engage on plans for repayment over a suitable period.  Revenue has been asked to engage in a pro-business manner.  It is engaging in this way and has responded quite well over the past year.</p> <p>  With regard to this legislation, both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are excludable in respect of the start of this process.  In most cases, the Revenue Commissioners have engaged in the examinership process and have been supportive of plans but in some cases, based on historical dealings with a company or some of its directors, they may opt not to do so to protect the State.  That is their job.  In general, however, the Revenue Commissioners have been quite supportive of the process.  Our indications are that they and the Department of Social Protection will continue to be supportive under the legislation under discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#F00300"><p>The Revenue Commissioners, by default, are included in the rescue plan but they have the option to remove themselves based on confined statutory grounds.  These all relate to issues where tax returns are outstanding or where the company has a poor history of compliance.  The reason we have included this is that when an examiner is appointed, the court will invite the Revenue Commissioners to make a submission on the tax history of the company and confirm the outstanding debts to the State.  That does not happen here; they do not have that opportunity so we have included the measure as a safeguard to protect moneys owed to the Irish people.  We have drawn the section from the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which also provides for the Revenue Commissioners to be excludable.  The difference, however, is that we have said they can have the option to exclude themselves only on statutory grounds, as opposed to having a carte blanche to exclude themselves.  The Revenue Commissioners have indicated to us that, on the personal insolvency side, in circumstances where they are in a position to quantify the debt, they have opted in to over 90% of cases and they have no reason they would not engage in the same manner under this process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#F00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State and Ms Keane.  Deputy Bruton raised the issue of approved liquidators.  The Minister of State has highlighted the position on solicitors and accountancy firms.  What is the position on a small business?  We are going to see people entering this process over &euro;10,000.  For a large business, this would not be an issue but it is the type of debt that would bring down a micro-company.  If businesses are to be referred to large-scale practitioners, the debts that will accrue by the end of the process will probably be in the order of a few thousand euro.  Could any arrangement be arrived at under the legislation whereby, with the agreement of the creditors, a de facto accountant could be appointed to engage in the process?  This to improve the scheme to try to reduce the cost to micro-businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061500002#F00500"><p>There is not such an arrangement under the legislation but it is important to point out that there is nothing excluding micro-companies from entering voluntary agreements with their creditors outside the legislation and reaching mutually agreed positions on write-downs or renegotiated contracts.  I accept that the cost of appointing a liquidator may be prohibitive to some companies but it is important to point out also that, at the early stage, before the company decides to appoint someone, the person engaged to give the professional advice is obliged to give the client information on fees and the ongoing costs of the process.  It is then up to the directors of the company to determine whether they wish to make a formal appointment.  They have the option to shop around.  Since solicitors are qualified, it means one's local solicitor is also qualified.  It could be somebody who has already given professional advice to the company in another capacity.  Therefore, I do not necessarily envisage companies being boxed into using some of the larger firms &mdash; in Dublin, perhaps &mdash; that are used to running the large-scale examinerships.</p></speech>

The Minister of State said the decision is made based on the quantum of money.  If 51% of the money is to support examinership, that decides the position on the remaining creditors.  Has the Minister of State given any cognisance to where a large company that can afford to take the hit might take the debt write-down on the basis of wanting the scheme to go one way, which might impact very negatively on the other creditors?</p></speech>

I was just sitting here thinking about them and the circumstances that would arise if they were to say they need a certain number of staff.  They come from a firm.  I am aware that they could be from a local solicitor's office or small firm but, equally, they could be from a firm with a considerable team of background staff.  I am sure they will all be lovely people but is there anything to prevent them from saying they need two accountants, that they happen to have two such accountants in their firm and that the company with which they are dealing does not have qualified accountants?  All of that is going to add to the cost.  I am conscious of what Deputy Shanahan was saying in that we are talking about small companies.  I understand completely the purpose of the measure but we need to guard against the possibility that the process advisers might insist on bringing in staff, which would add to a bill.</p><p>In a large examinership, this is not so onerous but when we are talking about amounts of &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000 for additional requirements for staff for potentially up to 49 days, that would be burdensome.  If I missed it, I will put my hand up but is there anything to prevent this from happening?  I do not know if this might be by way of a code of practice.  I stress that I do not know these process advisers.  I am sure they are all lovely, fine upstanding people but we could have a situation whereby someone will insist that he or she needs a team of accountants and has them back in his or her own company because at the end of the day, the process advisers work for their company.  If it is not there, consideration should be given to ensuring that this cannot happen unnecessarily.  I understand it is tricky because we must balance that with the fact that the process advisers probably will need some additional help.  However, if they are looking at the person who does a bit of part-time book keeping for the company and saying this person is not good enough and he or she needs a qualified accountant or two or five qualified accountants, we could end up with extra costs when this is trying to avoid that.  The Minister of State's thoughts on that would be very welcome.  </p></speech>

The process adviser has an obligation to inform the company of the likely costs of his or her appointment and the ongoing costs throughout the process.  That gives the company the information at the start to make an informed decision as to whether this is suitable for it.</p> <p>  In addition, in circumstances where the court has to approve the process adviser's costs, it will have regard to the additional expenses of the process adviser and the extent to which he or she makes use of the facilities available to him or her via the company and his or her own facilities and whether this incurred an additional cost throughout the process.  In conversations with the insolvency practitioners on the Company Law Review Group, the majority of them indicated that in most cases for small and micro companies, anyone who is qualified to act as a liquidator will generally be well equipped to deal with the accounts of these companies.  </p></speech>

With the greatest will in the world, extra costs could end up being stacked on.  I understand an indication will be given but if one has ever had building work done, one always gets an indication but in the final shake up, it is not always exactly what they say.  I want to avoid that if possible.</p></speech>

After the legislation, there may be other things we can do as well.  I understand the Deputy's concern but I would also say to a lot of companies that it is important to have full professional advice when they are trying to produce a business rescue plan.  Very often, some companies could benefit from that at an earlier stage, which is why we grant aid through the LEOs to encourage that.  It is beneficial but the Deputy is right.  It cannot be abused and there cannot be unnecessary costs.  The Deputy wants to avoid an unnecessary burden caused by bringing in too many professional people at too high a cost.  That is certainly something we can look at.  I am not convinced it can all be dealt with in legislation but it is certainly something we can look at it.  We will take a look at it with the team.</p></speech>

That concludes our briefing session on the matter today.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for attending and helping us with the briefing.

There will also be an opportunity to debate this informally in the Houses.  In respect of the ongoing conversation around the Duffy Cahill report and the other recommendations and conversations, we have completed our work and produced the plan of action in this space.  It is going through Cabinet this week so I can engage with the committee as I committed to do in January.  I am not sure where the committee's ongoing discussions are with regard to this topic but I am happy to engage with it on our proposals and any suggestions the committee may have.  We did engage briefly with our stakeholders, who we brought together prior to Christmas.  There seemed to be general acceptance that we are moving in the right direction.  Of course, we always want to add to that and there is some ongoing work from the Company Law Review Group but we will certainly move with any changes we can at this stage and, hopefully, by agreement with the committee.  This is something we can always work on in the future so I am happy to engage with the committee.  We will link in for a date to arrange that.</p></speech>

The committee needs to make a decision as to whether we will go into private session or continue in public session to decide whether we will waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  Can those who think we should go into private session raise their thumbs?  I think it is two and two.  We will stay in public session.  We can do this quickly anyway.</p> <p>  Having heard the evidence from the Minister of State, the committee is now required to adopt its observations for the business committee on whether the normal requirement to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill can be waived.  I invite members to make any comments they may wish to make.  </p></speech>

While we have been very good in facilitating the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny, I do not want it to unrecorded that this is not best practice and is not ideal.  It cannot become a habit.  I understand entirely the unprecedented nature of the times through which we are living and the need to expedite legislation.  I do not in any propose to delay this legislation but I do not want it to go unremarked either that the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny is not good practice.  It is not something I support as a general rule.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is an essential part of the democratic process.  In waiving it, I am conscious that we are facilitating necessary legislation but we must also be cognisant that pre-legislative scrutiny is necessary.  We need to be cognisant of the frequency with which this is happening and the danger that it might become a habit because none of us want it to become one.  Notwithstanding my misgivings, I am happy to waive pre-legislative scrutiny in this instance because I understand that we are all at one on the need for this specific legislation.  However, everything can be an emergency if it is left until the last minute and I am anxious that we do not drift into the space where the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny becomes the norm.  Everything becomes an emergency if one leaves it long enough.</p></speech>

We all understand the need for pre-legislative scrutiny but in this instance, it is an emergency regardless of whether it has been deliberately slowed down and I do not think it has.  It is a difficult subject to get over the line anyway but we must do so.  There are so many businesses that need to look at restructuring.  This is an avenue for them to consider and we need to support it as much as we can.</p></speech>

We do not want to waive pre-legislative scrutiny but we understand the circumstances surrounding this Bill and how important it is that this legislation goes through the Houses.  As we are in the middle of a pandemic and many companies are waiting for this Bill to be enacted, I support the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  The committee agrees with me as nobody else has objected so we can agree that we have agreed that.

They are all from the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at DCU.  The witnesses are attending to brief the committee on school bullying and its impact on mental health.  Before I begin, I thank the centre for its invaluable assistance to the committee.  Our seminal meeting with the centre on 5 November had a profound impact, as evidenced by the extensive media coverage seen in recent months.  Our examination followed on from that meeting.  I am speaking on behalf of the committee when I say that it has proved a worthwhile and important piece of work.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Professor O'Higgins Norman to make an opening statement, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has a six-minute slot to ask questions and the witness will respond within those six minutes.  If there is time left over, I will allow members to contribute again.  As Professor O'Higgins Norman is probably aware, the committee will publish his opening statement on our website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect of they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses have already been advised of this issue and they may believe it appropriate to take legal advice on same.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I call Professor O'Higgins Norman to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We are happy to be able to help the committee in its work on school bullying and mental health.  DCU's anti-bullying centre is located in the DCU Institute of Education and staff at the centre have been doing research and education on bullying for 25 years.  In addition to our research activity, the centre delivers a number of educational resources, including the FUSE programme, which is a nationwide anti-bullying and online safety programme for primary and post-primary schools.</p> <p>  As outlined in our various submissions, previous research has consistently shown that being involved in bullying as a target, bully or bystander at school can be associated with a number of mental health problems, including psychosomatic complaints, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation.  Issues of identity seem to remain at the heart of bullying behaviour.  One report from UNESCO involving 144 countries found that physical appearance was the top reason for being bullied.  Closer to home and in terms of identity, a recent study at our centre found that teachers of religious education had specific concerns about students who were practising Catholics being targeted for bullying more than those who did not practise a religion.</p> <p>  It is well established in research that negative childhood experiences have a negative effect on the development of a child, particularly when the bullying is related to identity.  Our research shows that school principals understand and recognise this.  The next step then should not be to go over old ground any longer, but to think critically about how we can prevent bullying.  Our research shows that this is the piece that principals are less sure about.</p> <p>  There have been some significant developments at policy level in terms of school bullying, most significant of which was the introduction of the Action Plan on Bullying and the related procedures for primary and post-primary schools as well as Circular 0045/2013, all of which comprised a landmark in educational policy relating to bullying prevention and intervention in schools.  We suggest that the Action Plan on Bullying be audited to ensure that it continues to be informed by up-to-date research and evidence, is connected to subsequent policies on child protection, well-being and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and is benchmarked against the recommendations that were recently published by UNESCO's scientific committee on tackling bullying and cyberbullying in schools.  Such a brief audit of the action plan and procedures to ensure that they comply with UNESCO's recommendations will not be overly burdensome, nor will it allow us to be distracted from the continuing task of implementing the action plan and procedures in schools today.  Separately, there is a need to provide further support to assist schools in implementing the requirements of the action plan and procedures while also ensuring that, possibly through the Department's inspectorate, schools continue to prioritise bullying prevention and intervention as part of a whole-of-education approach.</p> <p>  Regarding bullying policy, we warn against the dangers of conceptual pluralism where issues like bullying prevention and intervention are conflated with concepts such as well-being and positive school culture, as this may result in a dilution of the focus and efforts required to tackle bullying and cyberbullying fully among children and adolescents in our schools.</p><p>Parents and schools are rightly concerned about issues related to cyberbullying and online safety.  Moderation of cyberbullying content and behaviours on social media and online gaming platforms is improving and increasingly relies on proactive artificial intelligence, AI, with the aim of identifying bullying before it is reported by a user.  Published information on bullying content that is detected proactively would be more meaningful if we had more information, such as the overall incidence of bullying involving minors on a given platform and what supports were provided.  To that end, it will be increasingly important to ensure interdepartmental collaboration between the Departments responsible for the action plan and procedures, the online safety and media regulation Bill, as well as the implementation of Coco&rsquo;s law.  Furthermore, in addition to their role in preventing bullying behaviour within schools, school staff need to understand they also have a role under the action plan and procedures regarding bullying that occurs outside of school, including online.  Consequently, mechanisms to support closer collaboration between communities, school communities, social media-gaming platforms and statutory agencies will be required.  This has already started informally, for example, between Dublin City University, Facebook and the Department of Education regarding the roll-out of our FUSE anti-bullying and online safety programme.  The results of our current fieldwork suggest this could also include greater collaboration directly between schools and online platforms in reporting abusive content. <br/><br/>Over the past three years, we have translated our research on school bullying and cyberbullying into a programme of resources for schools.  This programme, called FUSE, was made possible with financial support from Facebook, Rethink Ireland and the Department of Education.  At the heart of the FUSE programme is the aim of building capacity in schools to tackle bullying and online safety and to empower children and adolescents to understand their own behaviour, be able to recognise bullying and online safety risks and to be confident in how to report and seek support when they need it.  So far, more than 12,000 students have been registered on the programme across 127 schools in every county.  Evaluations show the majority of those who complete the programme have increased their self-efficacy in noticing, responding and reporting bullying and online safety issues. <br/><br/><b></b>On the question of what to do next, based on national and international research, we recommend there be an audit of the action plan on bullying and the procedures to ensure they continue to be informed by the latest research and comply with UNESCO&rsquo;s whole-education approach.  We need further fieldwork to understand why some schools are encountering challenges in implementing the existing action plan and procedures.  We need to increase transparency from schools, social media, gaming and other online platforms on how they are handling reports of bullying and cyberbullying.  We need greater awareness raising of the vulnerability of students based on identity.  We need greater involvement from the Department of Education&rsquo;s inspectorate in supporting schools to implement, review and take action on bullying prevention and intervention programmes.  Schools need to have appropriate access to counselling for those negatively affected by bullying.  We also believe schools need to be required to provide specific hours each year to implement an approved programme of resources such as the FUSE programme to teach about bullying prevention within a whole-education approach and alongside social personal and health education, SPHE, relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and well-being frameworks.</p></speech>

We need to get it right with respect to schools, communities and beyond.  He addressed the specific difficulties with social media, the cyberworld and gaming platforms.  Who should be involved in recording the metrics?  I imagine it would be the companies but what exactly are we talking about?</p> <p>  Does Professor O&rsquo;Higgins Norman consider there is a need for a digital safety commissioner or similar who would have some element of oversight?  These tech companies have the facility, as Professor O'Higgins Norman referenced, of using AI from the perspective of having a general ability to notice this type of behaviour.  He also spoke about the need for greater collaboration with schools, which we would need to facilitate.  How would that relationship work?  What would be the structure and enforcement powers, for want of a better term?  How would we see the outworkings of that?  If Professor O'Higgins Norman could answer those questions, I may ask a follow-up question.</p></speech>

We typically talked about whole-school approaches to tackling bullying and cyberbullying.  However, now we are looking at a different type of world, a much more joined-up world, both online and offline.  The idea that a school would be left to deal with an issue like bullying or cyberbullying on its own would not work.  We suggest there is a role for the school, as part of the wider education system and societal system, to be connected in some way with the online safety commissioner or directly with social media companies or gaming companies, which might have a facility to report negative and abusive content that is not picked up by AI.  For example, one suggestion we make is that there be a trusted person in each school to whom children or parents could report if they are concerned about something going on in the school that has made its way online, and there would be a speedy communication line directly to someone who could do something about it, whether that be in the social media company, the gaming platform or at a regulatory level with respect to the online safety commissioner.  There needs to be a formal structure in place for that.</p> <p>  We know AI is working to a certain extent when it is used by social media and gaming platforms but we do not have a full picture of how well it is working.  Many of the metrics are collected internally by the private companies and access to those is quite limited from a research point of view.  We are flagging that the more information we have, the more we will be able to decide in wider society how effective these AI methods are.</p></speech>

We need to make sure those metrics are provided, be it to a digital safety commissioner or whomever it may be, and ensure that officeholder has sufficient resources to deal with that issue.  We also need a best practice communication line, particularly, as Professor O'Higgins Norman said, if there is a trusted person in a school to whom such communication could be made.  People understand that.  While we may get the best case scenario of dealing with gaming companies and so on, legislation may be required to ensure they comply with certain rules to ensure we have a decent level of interaction.  I assume Professor O'Higgins Norman is calling for us to put a structure in place to ensure we get the metrics and have best case communication protocols.</p></speech>

Beyond that, in the context of some of the studies DCU has done, a number of commentators have stated that when bullying is identity-based it has a greater impact.  What is Professor O'Higgins Norman's view on the facility within schools to deal with the outworkings of some bad cases where someone has been greatly impacted?  We have heard recently there is insufficient provision of counselling or therapeutic counselling at primary and secondary level.  What is Professor O'Higgins Norman's view on what is needed in that area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James O'Higgins Norman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#B00800"><p>There is a spectrum of experiences in relation to bullying, whether it is identity-based or not.  There will be people at one end of the spectrum who may experience being targeted and they will have sufficient support around them and it will be dealt with sufficiently to minimise the impact on them or the people who witness it, or even the people who carry out the bullying behaviour.</p><p> At the other end of the spectrum, we have people who will be severely traumatised by bullying experiences whether, as I said earlier, they are targets, bystanders or engaging in bullying behaviour.  They will need a more specialised level of therapeutic intervention.  Something that has come up in our research is that access to this type of therapeutic intervention is not always immediately available or clearly immediately available to schools.  Something on this would be very helpful to provide the service for those who need it.  Not everybody who experiences bullying would need this type of care but for those who do need it, it should be easily accessible and readily available.</p></speech>

It also involves a whole-of-school approach.  How has Professor O'Higgins Norman found this?  I imagine the best programmes are those in which children and parents are involved and that teachers buy into in a big way.  I would like to hear about the research Professor O'Higgins Norman has carried out in this field.</p></speech>

Intervention comes when it is already too late and the bullying has taken place.  This is where we need other supports.  If we can do as much as possible to prevent bullying, and link it into the whole education and society approach, then we can remove the need for a lot of intervention.  Our FUSE anti-bullying and online safety programme, which we deliver from the centre, is based on our research.  We are gathering data all the time when we are rolling it out.  It is designed to fuse together, which is where the name comes from, the agency of the children themselves, the concerns of the parents and the professionalism of the teachers.  When all three are brought together something can happen in bullying prevention.  I will refer to my colleague, Mr. Darran Heaney, who is the project manager and who might say more about the programme.</p></speech>

When all of these facets work together, namely, the parents, the school community and the teachers, there is a much greater impact, as opposed to a stand-alone resource operating in a school over a specific period of time.  The FUSE programme is evidence based.  It is linked to the nine components of the whole education approach.  FUSE shows up in each of these nine components, whether looking at student agency, education of the teachers, policy and policy development.  We are in the second year of it and it has been really well received by schools.  This year,127 schools have participated and even while they had struggles with Covid they still delivered and it was still engaged with.  As it is the end of the academic year, we are processing the data and feedback is very positive on it.</p></speech>

It is fantastic to have the UNESCO chair on anti-bullying.  Dr. Mazzone has presented to the committee previously and I have spoken to Mr. Heaney on the roll-out of the FUSE programme.  I thank the witnesses for their work and their presentations as we begin our research into bullying.  We have dealt with many groups.  I thank the witnesses for the two detailed submissions they have made and I have a number of questions.  The witnesses have recommended an audit on the action plan on bullying.  Principals now have a mandate to go forward and allocate staff.  The witnesses have pointed out that only 51% of schools have appointed a specific member of staff to investigate and tackle bullying in schools.  Less than half of schools, 45%, have researched and identified a specific anti-bullying programme to use in the school.  What would this audit look like?</p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody on the statistics.  She mentioned a sample of 900 schools.  What is the breakdown between primary and post-primary schools in the responses received and the statistics given?  My next question is for Mr. Heaney as the operations manager.  What is the role of the school board and parents' associations in what he has seen to date?  My next question is on the roll-out.  According to 2019 statistics, we have 3,242 primary schools and 723 post-primary schools.  They cover more than 1 million students at primary and post-primary level.  How will we roll this out quickly?  I understand the witnesses have done great work but it is only with 127 schools.  It is still wonderful but how do we reach all of these students with the FUSE programme?</p></speech>

The audit we are speaking about is on the action plan itself at a national level.  Its procedures were published in 2013 and they have not been updated since then.  With regard to the research that informed them, we remember that at the time there was very deep consultation with all of the stakeholders.  It took a lot of work to come up with the action plan and its procedures.  Some people have asked for a new action plan or new procedures.  Before we go down this road we believe it would be better to audit the national action plan to see how it measures up against more recent research and the latest in terms of international practice on whole education approaches, such as what was published by UNESCO last year.  It would be a task for the Department to lead the audit, with support from ourselves and others, and see how it measures up today, the guts of ten years after it was first published.</p></speech>

From the sample that has been taken, schools have not been able to implement this and it has been in place since 2013.  When Professor O'Higgins Norman says "audit", does he mean updating the strategy or is it an audit whereby we go out to the schools to evaluate whether they have put these measures in place and, if not, why not.</p></speech>

The audit is with regard to the document itself as a guiding document for how schools would tackle bullying and cyberbullying.  As I also said, we recommend further fieldwork with principals to try to understand why schools would find it difficult to implement the action plan and procedures.  There is a need for field work with schools as well as auditing the overall national document.</p></speech>

I will pose my final question to him also because perhaps it is most relevant and perhaps he has some ideas on it.  How do we roll this out to more schools?  Does Professor O'Higgins Norman have a response to this?  Although 127 schools per year is excellent it will never meet the 4,500 primary and post-primary schools we have.  How will this be done?</p></speech>

The resources we have had to roll out the programme in its present form over the past two or three years have been considerable but we will need more resources to be able to do it across all schools.  We can be smart about how we do this.  We can arrange local committees.  We can arrange it on a county-by-county basis with local co-ordinators.  The thing to remember is what we are trying to do is bring about a change in the culture of schools and a change in how we understand bullying behaviour.  It will take time and it will not be immediate.  We need to plan for this and resource it appropriately.</p></speech>

DCU has the expert skillset but surely there is a need to roll it out so we have groups set up in regional areas to drive connecting with these schools.  I do not see how it is feasible at the numbers that have been mentioned if we want to achieve this within the next three to four years.</p></speech>

Each educational authority has an action plan and a coordinator for implementing the national legislation and the action plan on bullying within a group of schools.  Across the whole of Norway there are these regional committees which are coordinated centrally but have a local coordinator as well.  If the policy is to be developed in a way that is sustainable within schools then it cannot be top-down from a centralised place and it must be resourced accordingly.</p> <p>  If it is okay I would like to kick that question over to my colleague, Dr. Alan Gorman, who can talk a bit more about how such a policy might be rolled out.</p></speech>

On the involvement of the principals' and parents' associations, there is a commitment at the very start when schools register for the programme that they will deliver it, set up a committee and follow through with the resources and delivery.  We also provide information for the principals to share with their boards of management about the school's participation in the programme.  To clarify the numbers there, 30 of those schools were primary and we are in our first year of piloting the resources with primary.  We wanted, therefore, to take a phased approach to double-check the resources were appropriate and that they worked and that how we were tackling it was appropriate.  On the other schools which were post-primary, I reiterate what Professor O'Higgins Norman has just said on the regions.  That is the way to broaden our reach across the whole country, including getting schools to work in clusters.  The whole aim of the programme is to connect schools, parents and teachers but also to empower the schools to be able to meet what is set out in the policy, national action plan and procedures.  It is therefore about providing them with support, resources and a toolkit to try to do that.  Covid has been particularly good in the sense that we now have a lot of online options for training which has given us a broader reach across the country, which has been very helpful.</p></speech>

It is not just about one specific programme but about looking at the range of supports we currently have in Ireland.  An example would be building up leadership capacity, particularly for early-career principals, looking at the supports currently available to them through the Centre for School Leadership, through advisory bodies such as the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, and the inspectorate as well.  It is also about linking in with other key policy developments to supports schools, for example the Inclusive Education Framework developed by the National Council for Special Education.  It is a very important policy document to support schools in that way.  It is important that we are building up capacity within schools.  It is top-down but as Professor O'Higgins Norman said it is bottom-up as well so schools have the agency to identify areas they need to work on and address those areas in relation to what they need in order to address bullying as well.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for presenting to us today and for taking time out from their busy schedules to discuss this really important issue.  I will not repeat what other members have said.  I will keep it really short.  I was really struck by what Professor O'Higgins Norman said about image and how research has shown a lot of children get bullied because of image.  Is that because of the colour of a child's skin, for example?  A lot of time people would look and say a child is a member of the Traveller community or that he or she is poor because he or she does not have the top-class runners other children in the class have.  Thus I am wondering about the whole area of image and what was spoken about there.</p> <p>  Has there been any research around bullying done on the grounds of a child's ethnicity, culture or race?  It is a similar question.  I refer to research on cultural or racial discrimination with the purpose of identifying whether or not this type of bullying has different effects and impacts than personal bullying.  While it is not nice to speak about, unfortunately this bullying can be carried out by teachers.  It is absolutely necessary we develop studies on bullying.  Will the witnesses speak to the committee about the research to date on racial bullying?  It is not about blaming teachers, or anything of the sort, but unfortunately bullying can come from the adults in the room as well as the children there.</p> <p>  Again, I would be interested in hearing more around what was said about image.  Is it the child with the cheap runners on his or her feet?  Is it the trans child with short hair?  That question can be for any of the witnesses.  I thank them all so much for presenting to us today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#D00900"><p>Sure.  Maybe the professor asked me to speak because I am one of the principal investigators on a project we ran recently.  It has just completed at the anti-bullying centre.  We looked at the experience of bullying among the Roma community in Ireland.  There are many other examples where identity or culture might influence a child's likelihood of being a victim of bullying.  The research we conducted, and our findings from that research, actually show it is not that straightforward.  There are a lot of different things we need to consider, especially if we think about ethnic minority groups like the Roma or members of the Traveller community in Ireland.  Classroom composition is important.  How many other members of the Traveller community are in a child's class might also affect whether or not he or she is a victim.  Social networks, having good leadership in the school and all those things influence it so we cannot really say that if a child is a member of one community he or she is more likely to be bullied.  It is not so straightforward.  What we can tell, and what the research is very clear on, is respect for diversity decreases bullying.  If there is a school culture that is positive and that promotes, acknowledges and encourages diversity and difference then there will be less bullying.  That is probably a better way to look at it than to think about who is highest risk and who is going to be a victim.  It is more like asking how we can prevent everyone from being a victim of bullying.</p> <p>  Somebody else may want to jump in on the other questions.</p></speech>

I wanted to say something about her comment that sometimes teachers are involved in the phenomenon of discrimination.  I have published research in recent years on bullying towards native and immigrant children and the reasons for bullying of native and immigrant children.  We found that, according to the children's thinking, bullying towards migrant children is very much related to contextual factors, to stereotypes and prejudices that come from family, school, teachers and media.  There is a process of learning prejudices and stereotypes concerning migrants which strongly affect bullying towards migrants.  Interestingly, some of the children who were interviewed, who were first- and second-generation immigrant students, reported they experienced forms of discrimination from teachers as well and that sometimes teachers tended to underestimate their family background, and associated their national background with poverty and low skills and low school achievement.  These findings suggest a whole educational approach very much needs to be adopted.</p><p>It is very much needed to tackle the phenomenon, by adopting whole-education approach, in the sense we need to educate children, teachers and the whole school system to diversity.  I hope this answers the question.</p></speech>

I would extend it to children with additional special needs in the classroom or children with disabilities who are in mainstream school.  Was there any research done around young people with additional special needs?</p></speech>

Research has been done.  As Dr. Foody said, it is quite complicated in that being a member of an ethnic minority or having a special educational need does not mean you are more likely to be bullied, but the context around you can influence that.  The more we can create schools which appreciate everyone is different and diversity is part of life and reflect that in our policies, curricula and syllabus, the better.  It is important kids see themselves in textbooks, images and stories around the school.  All of that makes a difference in terms of how included people feel.  It is important we push that agenda.  I will refer to my colleague, Dr. Keating.</p></speech>

That is key.  Professor O'Higgins Norman highlighted the prevention mechanisms the school has in place.  One key way to do that is through education and adopting a whole school community approach in which parents are involved in promoting respect and celebrating diversity.  You have the home and school links, which are very important.</p></speech>

As they will be aware, we have had quite extensive contributions from witnesses in previous weeks as well.  I am interested to know if the witnesses have listened to those contributions and if they feel there are additional things we should be especially aware of coming out of today, which need to be a focus within a report and for us to get down to the granular detail of it.</p> <p>  Following on from Senator Flynn, with whom I sit on the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community committee and of which she is the Chair, what is interesting is we on that committee have done some training, facilitated by the Chair, on our own biases.  I wonder if teachers across the board are doing that.  In any workplace, that needs to be a feature, but here we are concerned with the education system.  Much of what happens in schools is either a reflection of what is going on in the wider society or that the school system is not set up in a way which reflects the wider society.  If biases exist in the adult world, they are likely to be replicated in the child's world.  If they are not and if there is more happening in the schools, it is likely the school is not set up in a way which reflects adult society.  Neither of those things is the correct approach.</p> <p>  With regard to respect for diversity and promoting diversity, that was a really interesting piece of research Dr. Foody had undertaken.  What would that look like?  I note the comments on practising Catholics in the witnesses' opening statement, which has not come up previously.  What could be changed to make all of our schools more accommodating of those from different religious backgrounds?</p> <p>  It is concerning overall that schools are struggling to implement a plan.  I want to put that on the record.  It is concerning for us all.  It is not just about identifying what more we can do and what changes in policy need to happen around bullying.  However, the fundamental question is why are we failing in the education system even to put into place a plan which is there.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#E00800"><p>With regard to the Senator's first question, within recent years and the reconceptualisation of initial teacher education in Ireland, in particular, there is a much stronger focus on the process of reflection and inquiry.  Within that, higher education institutions are looking at engaging student teachers, in particular, in that area of challenging their hegemonic assumptions or beliefs and looking at the pedagogy of discomfort and having those uncomfortable questions around that.  It proves to be a very interesting experience with student teachers.</p> <p>  Interestingly, that has been called for, especially for principals or teachers moving into the role of principalships within schools, in terms of the notion of leadership and leading an inclusive school.  Their understanding of inclusion and what an inclusive school is, is important, as is looking at those hegemonic assumptions or beliefs which the Senator has discussed.</p> <p>  It comes back to the point I raised previously in terms of the role.  It is very important those agencies, such as the centre for school leadership and the professional development service for teachers, PDST, support early-career principals and continue to engage in that kind of critical dialogue mentioned.  It should remain a policy priority at initial teacher education, ITE, and induction levels and within continuing professional development, CPD.  There is promise with Cos&aacute;n, the Teaching Council's policy on professional development, which is still in a consultative process but there is promise there.  That should be included within that as well.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of us not to mention the specific reference made to practising Catholics and what can be done, not just for that area but around identity.  We have not examined that previously on this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James O'Higgins Norman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#E01100"><p>I apologise.  I meant to answer that question already.  It links with what has been said by my colleague, Dr. Gorman, about schools having hegemonic cultures, in terms of a set of assumptions about everybody and the way people will live their lives.  We are in a particular place in our society in which we have become more pluralist.  Things have changed and it is no surprise people who practise religion, and maybe practise the Catholic religion, are increasingly in the minority, especially young children and teenagers in schools.</p> <p>  One of the studies we has done recently has shown a concern among religion teachers about what they are observing among students who are practising Catholics and are being targeted for that, more than a concern about kids who are not practising a religion.  That is coming through now and sits well with international research on that, in that when a particular world view or religion has had a dominant position in society and that changes, it often results in those who adhere to that being targeted and being seen as old-fashioned or out of the mainstream culture.  With bullying, when people are seen to be different, they often stand out and are more likely to be targeted when it comes to bullying.</p><p> In terms of addressing that, we need to promote in our schools an idea of the understanding of difference, that difference is the norm, no two people are the same.  All our teacher training, continuing professional development, and curricula across the whole school programme must be linked to the understanding of a human being, where we understand that difference is a good thing and that we appreciate that.  That calls for the need to look at what we teach, the way we teach and who is teaching in our schools, and the assumptions that underline all of that.  Dr. Keating might like to come in on that.</p></speech>

The project was quite successful in schools across Europe.  The reason behind this success was that it was embedded in already existing school curriculum and policy.  It addressed workload issues and curriculum overload as well.  When one goes down the route of promoting respect and celebrating diversity, it is important that it is done in the school culture and fitted into and embedded within the existing school curriculum, so that teachers will have more confidence when delivering sensitive topics.  What was key to that project was giving both teachers and parents the skill sets to have these conversations with their children and to teach these topics in the classroom context.  Many teachers found that, prior to this, they shied away from teaching sensitive topics.  Giving them the skills to teach and address these issues in the classroom is very important.  That was achieved through the Gender Equality Matters project.</p></speech>

I will start by asking Dr. Foody a question.  I am conscious that everything we do must be guided by research and I was interested in and pleased to hear about the research Dr. Foody has conducted.  Can she outline for the committee what she believes are the trigger points or catalysts that, at present, give rise to a child in school becoming a bully?  Is it the pressures he or she is under at home?  Is it based on differences?  What is her assessment of this?  I know it is a broad question but I would appreciate an attempted answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#F00500"><p>If we knew the answer to that, we would have it all solved.  There is much research on why people bully or why people are victims.  The reasons are quite varied and there is no straight answer.  Dr. Mazzone would know more about traditional bullying literature and how people become a victim or are victimised in different settings.  I will let her answer.  In terms of research from Ireland, it depends on what one is talking about.  It depends on whether children have family supports, whether they are already vulnerable or being supported.  Is it that bullying happens once and that is it, or is it something that happens for a long time?  Perhaps Dr. Mazzone would like to give her input.  In answer to the question, I do not know.</p></speech>

He asked about bullying perpetration in relation to diversity, if I understood correctly.  I am not sure.  What is the Deputy asking about?</p></speech>

I assume diversity can be a catalyst for bullying.  Kids sometimes see differences and may feel threatened by that.  What are the other factors in Dr. Mazzone's assessment that give rise to bullying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Angela Mazzone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#F00900"><p>One of the main issues I investigated in my PhD was morality.  In particular, my PhD was focused on moral disengagement which is the tendency to justify immoral behaviours.  Children who bully their peers show high levels of moral disengagement.  The tendency to justify immoral conduct is socialised within the peer groups.  We know from the research that in classrooms where there is a high tendency to collectively morally disengage, children bully their peers more - in other words, children tend to justify bullying.  They think it is something that is admissible and tolerated.  They also tend to put the blame on the target for having provoked the bullying.  Morality is one of the components that is associated with bullying perpetration.  There are also some variables related to family functioning.  In dysfunctional families, for instance, in families with low levels of cohesion and communication, children are more likely to bully their peers.  This is also based on some of my research findings.  I suggest we need to focus on both individual and contextual factors to understand the causes of bullying perpetration.</p></speech>

I wish to ask Professor O'Higgins Norman and Dr. Gorman about the culture of schools.  We repeatedly hear from guests who come before the committee about the importance of schools having a strong culture that does not tolerate bullying and that promotes good treatment of students by all persons in the school.  What can this committee do to assist schools to mould and develop that type of culture?  How can that culture be developed in schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#F01100"><p>Over recent years, there has been a significant policy drive in schools.  Schools and principals, in particular, are dealing with competing policy agendas in their role.  It is important that schools are afforded the time to engage with meaningful professional development.  I emphasise that there should be school-based professional development available in order to build a positive school culture.  This would look at elements of the school that are working and areas that might need to be addressed.</p> <p>  I refer to the point made about school leaders.  Schools should be equipped with understanding what inclusion is and it should not be just a one-off workshop.  They should be equipped with the knowledge of how to lead an inclusive school.  We must also look at the work done on policy over recent years, coming back to the point I raised.  There are many policies that speak to one and other, if one were to sit down and look at them.  In looking at our schools, take, for example, the inspectorate's framework for school self-evaluation.  That promotes a positive school culture, as does the inclusive education framework, by way of another example.  Principals need to be encouraged to look at those policies and support them.  Most importantly, they should be provided with the time to engage in professional collaboration, which is meaningful school-based professional development, in order to build a positive school culture that promotes inclusion as well.</p></speech>

Does she have any view as to whether or not the proliferation of pornography on the internet has had an impact on the attitude that boys have towards women and girls, and whether that has, in any way, contributed to what one may perceive as an increase in gender-based bullying?</p></speech>

I was going to say that we have not conducted our own research on that topic.  However, in gaming, for example, where young people are online playing games, it is not so much even the content of the games but rather some of the behaviour of the people who play games and the way in which they relate to women and talk about females within gaming.  The research has shown that that and the perception of misogyny and sexism that comes across on gaming platforms can be quite negative.  One statistic I found was that if you speak with a female voice when playing an online game, you are three times more likely to receive negative comments and harassment.  That is very much linked to how females are perceived in that space, so there is more work to be done there.</p></speech>

As we are so far into the topic of bullying, we can really begin to delve into specific items and tease things apart.  I do not intend to go over much of the ground that has been covered already.  I had a look at the UNESCO report, Behind the Numbers: Ending School Violence and Bullying, and I want to talk a little about some of the trends it points out.  It suggests that bullying as a behaviour, in general, is decreasing.  I am interested in asking about that in the context of the quality of our longitudinal data.  School bullying has been a touchstone issue for a decade at least, but our information, if we try to step further back in time than that, is probably of lesser quality.  I want to give the witnesses an opportunity to comment on that.</p> <p>  As for the prevalence of different types of bullying, it appears, at least from the UNESCO report, that instances of physical bullying are decreasing.  The report mentions that the number has decreased in almost half of countries and territories.  Could the witnesses comment on the Irish-specific context of this?  It is a recurring theme through this unit of work that a lot of bullying has moved online, has become cyberbullying and now has become image-based bullying because of the pressures of Instagram, etc.</p> <p>  I am very interested in Professor O'Higgins Norman's last comment.  Anecdotally, it seems misogyny has now gone to the online space.  It is hidden under the rock of the online space.  I would like some insight from the experts here on those trends we find within bullying.  Are we looking at something that is psychologically based, delivered over the medium of online behaviours?  Are we seeing a move away from the more commonplace, old-style understanding of school bullying?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#G00900"><p>I will try to answer all the questions.  Yes, internationally, the literature shows that we have seen a small reduction in what we might call traditional or offline bullying.  That is probably as a result of the increased awareness that young people as well as adults have of what bullying is, what constitutes bullying and the harms of bullying.  That is definitely in contrast, like the Deputy said, to the literature or research that was conducted earlier, in the past 20 years or so, when we did not even know what bullying was or what we were talking about.  Now it is clear that everyone recognises that there are very severe, long-term negative effects of bullying.  That is one of the reasons.  There are also increased amounts of money and time put into anti-bullying programmes, which are working in some cases.</p> <p>  Apart from that, it is important to say that, according to at least the Irish data and a lot of the international data, traditional and offline bullying is still more prevalent than online bullying, so the former is still there and has not gone away.  We just have to look at human nature, and even adults and workplaces, to know that it probably will not go away, but we are looking for it to be at least reduced further with the work we do.</p> <p>  On the cyberbullying side of things, Dr. Mazzone might want to comment on some of her work.  Cyberbullying, as I said, is not as prevalent as traditional bullying but its impact can be more severe in some cases.  One incident of cyberbullying might be enough for somebody to feel so isolated and alone that his or her mental health comes under severe pressure, whereas offline bullying might continue for a little more time before that person would need to seek help.  The face of cyberbullying is changing because we have so many different apps, devices, methods and means, including photos and videos, to cyberbully or to harm somebody, so that is an ever-evolving space.  Again, however, in general it is considered less prevalent than offline bullying.  Even on that point, though, it is really important we do not focus too much on these distinctions because young people are usually victims in both spaces or bullying in both spaces and are often in both spaces at the same time.  They might be online and offline talking to their friends at the exact same time, so even trying to distinguish between how prevalent bullying is in one area or one space as opposed to another is kind of futile.  We have these prevalence rates in order that we can look at the impact of our interventions, but it is really important we just think about victimisation, whatever its shape, and the impact of it, whether it happens online, offline or both.  We are just concerned with young people's experiences.</p> <p>  I do not know whether anyone else wants to speak about prevalence or anything else.  Have I answered Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's questions?</p></speech>

Of course that is an encouraging result but, at the same time, we need to keep in mind that the older children become, the more they use subtle forms of bullying, that is, relational forms of bullying such as rumours and gossip.  In addition, there is qualitative research showing that children tend to trivialise bullying.  Oftentimes they do not react when bullying happens because they are used to a certain type of language, which is offensive and harmful to some targeted children.  My point is that bullying can take subtle forms.  Of course it is a good and an encouraging result that instances of physical forms of bullying are tending to decrease thanks to the whole education approach but, at the same time, we need to address and raise awareness of subtle forms of bullying.</p></speech>

Seeing as the witnesses' presentation was one of the few presentations we have had that has had that international context because of the involvement with UNESCO, I want to ask a question that reflects that international context as to where Ireland sits in terms of the prevalence of bullying, the prevalence of different forms of bullying and our success or lack of it in tackling bullying.  The obvious add-on question is this: wherever we sit, is there some place we should look to that is doing a really good job of tackling bullying?</p></speech>

According to the findings of international reports, Ireland has rates of bullying comparable with those of western countries like Italy or, I think, Sweden and Norway, so the situation in Ireland is not too bad.  I think there are more recent findings, however.  I cannot remember the name of a report published recently.</p><p>Professor O'Higgins Norman might help me with the name.</p></speech>

The findings of this international report in respect of Ireland show that bullying actually increased in 2018, the period to which the data refers.  Of course, the methods of assessment matter.  Depending on the methods that we use to assess bullying, we can find variations.  I am sorry I do not remember the exact rate of bullying perpetration and victimisation reported in this report, but I am happy to share the findings with the committee afterwards.</p></speech>

It is great to have them with us.  I thank them for their insights and for sharing their expertise.  There are many questions I could ask, but it would not be fair to expect that there would be research available that would answer everyone.  Following on from what Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh asked about where Ireland stands relative to other countries, a question Dr. Mazzone answered pretty comprehensively, what do we know, if anything, about the shape of our school system?  Much is made, for example, about school patronage and the fact that the majority of school patronage is in Catholic hands, as it were, even though society has changed and there is a need for more diversity in the future.  I think everybody agrees about that, but some sought to put in issue the question of whether faith-based patronage is a part of the problem in the context of bullying.  I hope the Christian tradition in particular would be a culture that would seek to counter bullying.  I have asked about that in the past.  Last week, Professor Hymel referred in passing to the decline of faith as perhaps a contributor to the problem of moral disengagement, which is a phrase used by either Dr. Mazzone or Dr. Keating.  What do we know about school form or ethos?  Is there any information as to how that helps or hinders the fight against bullying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James O'Higgins Norman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#H00700"><p>I suppose the operative ethos of a school is an important part of how people experience school.  There has not been a huge amount of recent research on that topic.  There was a glut of it about 15 years ago and everybody was very concerned about it, including me, but there has not been a lot on that in recent years.  I will go back to what we were talking about earlier about the school sitting within the whole of society and the whole education approach, where we look at the school as being influenced by society and sometimes not quite catching up with where society is or not reflecting the beliefs of parents or <i>vice versa</i>.  School culture definitely has a role to play in bullying.  Dr. Mazzone and Dr. Gorman will now chip in and say something about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.147" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#H00800"><p>I thank Senator Mullen for his question.  What we hope to explore in the centre, in particular in the next 12 months, is the opportunity to engage with schools.  Professor O'Higgins Norman mentioned the need to engage in deep, qualitative research with principals in schools.  In the research, we want to draw on a range of schools and school contexts to include denominational schools, multi-denominational schools and Gaelscoileanna and explore the perspectives and the challenges principals are meeting individually in terms of leading the schools.  We hope we will gain more insights into that in the research in the next 12 months in particular.  It is a very interesting question.</p></speech>

Many people would have been unaware that there seems to be evidence in that regard.  Practising Catholics are mentioned specifically.  I am not surprised by that because I heard anecdotal reports about children who dared to go against the cultural grain in school on big sociopolitical issues feeling the heat from their classmates, often, ironically, in faith-based schools.  It seems that minorities are always in the line of fire for bullying.  Today's minority is not the same as yesterday's and, as a result, there is a constant need to upgrade our thinking.  Do the witnesses have any views on whether a hegemonic media culture that could be seen as hostile to religion could be part of the problem in creating a context where bullying now occurs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James O'Higgins Norman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#H01000"><p>Exactly as Senator Mullen has already said very well, the predominant peer culture among children and adolescents in schools is influenced by their families and parents, wider media and so on.  In our current context, those who are going against the grain are standing out and they will then be more likely to be targets for bullying whether that is for religious or other reasons.  Fifteen or 20 years ago we were talking about homophobic bullying and how it was a focus of bullying in schools and a great concern for everyone and now today here we are talking about the possibility that children who practise a religion might be the ones who are targeted for bullying.  As Senator Mullen said, the situation changes and moves.  There is something fundamental underneath all of that which we must address in terms of the implementation of an inclusion and diversity policy and curricula that promote inclusion, whether it is somebody who is practising a religion or somebody who is not or whatever other diversity issue might be involved.</p></speech>

Is there an argument that there should be a greater focus on the fundamental problem of bullying, which is the abuse of a power relationship?  Is it possible that the label of bullying is not as important as the underlying negative attitude that causes the person to bully?</p></speech>

If there are people in the school system who do not feel cared for or represented, which, in a sense, makes them feel not cared for, then there is an issue for us to address.  Sometimes we need to name a specific identity or type of bullying in order to make sure those people feel included and cared for.  The overall point is that if we can have more kindness in schools and we can have that modelled by teachers, parents and the wider community, then bullying would decrease and we would not need to be so concerned about specific identities.  However, those identities have a whole political agenda behind them in society.  There is a concern that we will get lost in all of that, but at the heart of it is the need to have more care and more kindness in schools.  If we have that, then the individual identity should not be as much of an issue as the overall experience of being included and feeling cared for.</p></speech>

Love your neighbour as yourself does not seem like such a bad starting point.</p> <p>  If I have time, I wish to ask about cyberbullying.  There had been a lot of talk about helping children to be resilient in terms of understanding what is happening to them when they are experiencing bulling.  I am also concerned, however, about whether we are doing enough to encourage people to push back against bullying, obviously not in a violent way, but to develop a strength to help children to be agents in combating the negative treatment they experience.  Is there room for doing more in that regard?</p><p>Given the significant challenges and opportunities posed by the much greater availability of technology in people&rsquo;s lives, is there something to be said for trying to offer education and support to parents before their children ever go to school, to encourage them to have the strengths to make decisions about children not having technology of certain kinds too soon in their lives, for example, or not having access to technology in their bedrooms too late at night?  Are we sometimes a little disinclined to exhort good behaviours over bad behaviours when it comes to the kind of things that might be contributory causes to children's vulnerability?</p></speech>

The Senator mentioned children using their cell phones in their bedrooms at night.  What we know from research is that parental mediation strategies, which are the strategies that parents use to deal with children's usage of technology, should be consistent in the sense that parents should give clear and precise rules and should follow up on those rules.  When parents&rsquo; strategies are consistent, children are less likely to be involved in risky behaviours and in cyberbullying.  There is probably no magic recipe for parents but it is more about using consistent strategies and being coherent.</p> <p>  Perhaps someone else would like to address the other question.</p></speech>

The literature is quite divided.  One of the things we know from the most recent literature is that we have to be very careful when we ask children to be responsible for stopping the bullying themselves.  We do not want them to feel that they have an extra pressure, in that they are already victims and, now, it is also on them to stop the bullying.  That is a big ask for young kids.  There is also this idea that, &ldquo;Oh, they are resilient&rdquo;.  There are certainly things we can do to develop resilience but not every child would be resilient in the same scenario or in the same way, so we also have to be careful about how we use that term.</p> <p>  If we want to get them to a place where they can deal with bullying, we need to talk about telling and reporting, and about ways they can identify when it is happening, being a good bystander and all of these other things that will also influence bullying rates and attitudes for other children as well.  It is things we can do with all the kids, not just victims, and that we work on things like empathy, being good bystanders and making sure they have the capacity to report and tell when it is happening to them.</p> <p>  On the other point about parents, in addition to what Dr. Mazzone said, namely, that we do the same thing, we also need to be a good role models as parents.  We need to ask our children to be empathetic online and offline and make sure they are responsible digital citizens.  Therefore, whatever way, shape or form that takes, we are recognising that if we see something online that we do not like, we feel a sense of responsibility for dealing with that as well.  That could be one way that parents could mediate or try to influence cyberbullying, by talking to their kids about it and taking responsible actions, even if they are not the victim or the bully.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

That includes having activities with children and young people where they can explore walking in the shoes of a bystander and what they could do, walking in the shoes of a bully and what they could do, and walking in the shoes of the victim and what they could do.  Drawing on Olweus&rsquo;s research on the bullying circle, it includes being aware that standing up to bullying does not ever mean putting yourself in danger, and it can be telling someone and knowing those potentially five trusted adults who they could tell, who can intervene and help with what they are witnessing, such as a teacher, a principal or a parent.</p></speech>

They do wonderful work and it is appreciated and valued.  My apologies, I had to come off the call for a short period to go to another meeting, but I feel I have a very good sense of this and I have, of course, read the submissions.</p> <p>  I have a few general questions, and a lot of that is based on some of the findings we have heard and received from other witnesses in regard to this very important issue.  I will go into them quickly and put them all together, and the witnesses can then respond.</p> <p>  We have heard that the 2003 anti-bullying policy needs to be completely updated.  An interesting comment was made at last week's meeting that we need to change the language around that, and instead of saying "anti-bullying", we need to couch it in very positive and proactive terms.  I thought that was a very good point and I would be interested to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views.</p> <p>  It would seem that a problem with that policy is that it is more or less saying to schools they need to have a policy but is not very clear what those policies should be.  I had not realised until this meeting that only 51% of schools had actually complied.  I am quite surprised to hear that.</p> <p>  There were differing views as to whether there should be a database in regard to school bullying incidents and the type of incidents, and whether tracking these incidents and how they are dealt with should be done on a national basis.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views.</p> <p>  With regard to the question of a roadmap, it has been very clear from the witnesses we have heard that we need to have a very clear roadmap.  There seem to be a lot of very good tools that are being used in different schools but it is a case of never the twain shall meet.  Many very good practices are being carried out and, for example, the ETB schools have a very specific policy.  A number of schools are also doing restorative practice.  I have spoken to a few principals about that and it certainly seems to be excellent in terms of dealing with the perpetrators, as well as the victims, and, of course, the bystanders.</p> <p>  I want to mention three other areas.  In the context of appointing an online safety commissioner, Senator Mullen spoke about cyberbullying.  There is certainly a belief that an online safety commissioner would play a very important role in that area.</p> <p>  Particularly since Covid, there has been a bigger conversation about education, what the importance of education is and a possible steer away from having just academic learning towards having a well-rounded, holistic young person at the end of that, who is enabled to have a broader lifestyle and broader life skills.  It even goes back to what Professor O'Higgins Norman was saying about being kind, just taking that moment to think about being kind and showing respect.</p><p> Finally, what is the role of the parent in collaboration with the school in dealing with bullying activity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James O'Higgins Norman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#K00200"><p>I will address some of those points and some of my colleagues might like to pitch in.  On anti-bullying language, there is much disagreement internationally in this field.  By calling it "anti-bullying", it is making a clear statement against bullying, which drives the work in that direction, but that is defining it negatively.  There is much debate on that and there are good points on both sides.  The bottom line is about trying to create an atmosphere and a reality where people do not experience bullying in schools or online.</p> <p>  The figure of 51% of schools relates to those that have implemented a local programme to tackle bullying.  All the schools in our research have policies in place, that is, they have all taken their lead from the national action plan on bullying and implemented a local policy.  The next step was to implement an anti-bullying programme in their schools and only about one half of schools had reported they were able to do that.  I personally believe there should be a database on which we track the level of bullying in the country, which goes back to a question one of the other members raised earlier.  Having good-quality data allows us to make informed decisions about the initiatives we use and how effective they are, so I very much support beginning to do that and building those data.</p> <p>  On the roadmap, the international research suggests there is not a one-size-fits-all programme or approach to tackling bullying.  Schools need to be able to draw down on resources of use to them, depending on what they are dealing with locally.  A programme such as the FUSE programme we offer, for example, provides schools with a programme of resources and an approach, and they are then able to adapt that and use it locally.  The effectiveness of saying to every school that it must do a particular programme at such a time in such a way is not always proven.  The one-size-fits-all approach is something I am cautious about.</p> <p>  The online safety commissioner is really important, although the role still needs to be worked out.  It is my understanding it will not be possible to make individual complaints or reports through the commissioner&rsquo;s office, which will be disappointing for people looking for somewhere to go when they feel there is nowhere else for them to go and they have tried everything else in regard to reporting the problem or seeking help with online safety issues.</p> <p>  As for a well-rounded education, Dr. Keating will talk about how the overall curriculums, including the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum and so on, sit alongside the anti-bullying work we do.  The role of the parent is the key, going back to Senator Mullen's point.  We need to help parents such that they will feel strong and confident and have a purpose to the way in which they educate their children about bullying, both offline and online, and be able to do that in a consistent and confident way.</p> <p>  I might hand over to Dr. Foody to comment further.</p></speech>

There were more than 900 respondents, so while it was not every principal, it was a good sample.  As Professor O'Higgins Norman said, that figure of 51% we talked about meant that 51% had not appointed a specific member of staff to deal with bullying cases in their school, but there were many very positive findings from the study.  Almost every school, or 99% of them, has a policy and all the principals recognised the impact of bullying on school attendance, academic achievement and mental health.  We are cautious in regard to being negative about the work that needs to be done on the procedures because principals are used to them and there is much good stuff in there.</p> <p>  The main finding from the work was that principals had not identified a specific anti-bullying programme.  That study and other Irish studies, including one by Corcoran and McGuckin in 2014, have found that what principals in Ireland wanted above all was support in resourcing and finding materials related to bullying and to be told by the Department what intervention they should run and what steps they should take.  They are seeking more support.  They are doing everything in their power in terms of their policies.  Our results show that perhaps assigning a specific member of staff might help.</p> <p>  On the point about tracking, that is a good idea and it is one place principals could start if they were given support with somehow being able to assess the level of bullying in their own school confidentially in order that they would not be afraid those data would be available or would influence their attendance rates, for example.  They should also be given support in specific areas, if they need it, for it to be reduced, and that is something the FUSE programme could fit into.</p> <p>  A number of member raised this research.  To clarify, it related to 900 principals from primary and post-primary - mainly the former - and covered both  DEIS and non-DEIS schools.  There was no difference in their responses depending on school type.  In general, the responses were the same, irrespective of level or school type.</p></speech>

The Senator asked about parents and how they can contribute.  There should be a consultation with parents on policy and how it is being developed, rather than it being something they might download from the website when there is an issue, in order that they will feel they are being brought along in the process.</p> <p>  On interventions, it is important for schools to evaluate their incidence of bullying and respond to that with the most appropriate intervention that will tackle the specific needs in their school.  I have found from my engagement with schools that that is often where they struggle, unsure of the best intervention to use.  It is important to acknowledge that many schools are doing really well.  A forum or other way for them to share with other schools what they are doing well, in order that they can learn in a community-practised type of approach, would be very useful as well.</p></speech>

The danger is that if one person takes sole responsibility, it may leave only that person wearing that hat.  What we should be looking for is a more distributed leadership, and that has been very much endorsed in policy in recent years, particularly in the area of educational leadership.</p></speech>

Children&rsquo;s use of technology has become much more prevalent and there are many different social media platforms.  I have heard frightening stories of children in fourth and fifth class using Snapchat, Facebook and many other platforms.  One question I have asked every guest before the committee in recent weeks relates to how to educate parents and get into their minds.  A steady stream at all the meetings suggests that often the parents who need to be got to are the ones who will not listen, attend meetings, inform themselves, communicate with the school or get involved in it.</p><p>The million dollar question is how to get those parents involved.  How should we communicate with them?  How can we get a commitment from them?  How can we inform them of the dangers of social media?  Dr. Foody spoke about parents' sense of responsibility.  Everyone who brings a child into the world has a responsibility to do their best for that child.  Many parents are not doing their best for their children while allowing them on some of the terrible social media platforms that are meant for adults.  Children as young as nine, ten, 11 and 12 are using them.  They are not just using them after school, but sometimes up to 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  Parents are allowing their children on these dangerous social media platforms until that hour of the morning unsupervised.  They do not know whom they are communicating with.</p><p> If the witnesses had responsibility in the Department of Education tomorrow, what additional supports would they give to primary and post-primary schools to assist the principals and teachers to support the pupils through the bullying and other difficulties they experience?</p></speech>

If I were to wave my magic wand, I would give every primary and secondary school in Ireland an audit tool to assess the effectiveness of their policy every year.  This would comply with the existing oversight management which is outlined in the Department of Education procedures for schools.  It would highlight to schools what they are doing well.  We do not want to come across as telling schools precisely what they should be doing.  Schools need to understand what great work they are already doing and how to build on that work.  They should assess their policy annually and include every staff member, the caretaker, the school secretary and anyone who may potentially witness bullying behaviours in the school.  They need to be aware and have a voice so they know what to do.  If those data were centralised, it could feed into annual reports highlighting areas where schools are struggling and areas in which schools are succeeding.  That can assist in putting supports in place the following year.</p></speech>

They might tend to underestimate the phenomenon and believe it is not their children's problem.  A first step we could take to engage with these parents would be to raise awareness of the danger of cyberbullying and the importance of setting clear rules on the use of technology.</p></speech>

How could an online safety commissioner be empowered to tackle cyberbullying?  Are social media companies doing enough to tackle bullying on their platforms?  This has been the subject of major debate at the committee in recent weeks.  I believe the policies of social media companies are not strong enough.  I believe the Government is not doing enough to tackle these social media companies and should be doing more.  I have heard some absolute horror stories, some of which have resulted in suicide by youngsters, some of them in their teens because of ongoing online bullying.  Somebody needs to take this by the scruff of the neck.  I hope that the proposed online safety commissioner will be given the power to do that.</p> <p>  Investment by social media companies here in Ireland contributes a considerable amount.  However, we should not be afraid to take them on, given that they are causing such harm.  Social media can be very positive, but there is also much negativity about it.  I feel sorry for some kids growing up.  When I was going to school, both primary and secondary, bullying happened within the school.  Now it goes far beyond that and comes right into the home and into a child's bedroom.  It is a dangerous tool if it is not used correctly.</p> <p>  I would be interested in hearing Professor O'Higgins Norman's views on the online safety commissioner.  What sorts of powers should the commissioner have in various areas particularly in tackling cyberbullying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.172" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor James O'Higgins Norman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021061500002#L00600"><p>Social media refers to many organisations and companies.  Some of them are extremely small and are providing apps that kids can download very quickly to their phones without their parents realising the full implications of them.  It also refers to enormous corporations, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and so on.  In recent years I have seen greater engagement by some of those and not so much by others in trying to deal with online safety.  Any of the companies we have worked with are very anxious to try to address these problems.  They often look to us for solutions, help and advice.<br/><br/>I think things are getting better.  Everyone agrees that more needs to be done.  We also need to recognise that the behaviour that makes its way onto these platforms is human behaviour that exists without the platforms.  I am not so sure we can say the platforms cause it.  For example, some of the research that looks at gaming shows that there is very little in online games that causes or produces negative behaviour, but the way people behave in those games, the way they speak to one another and the way they relate to one another can be really horrible at times.  This comes back to being a human behaviour that needs to be addressed.  Whether it is expressed on social media or elsewhere, it is a problem.<br/><br/>The online safety commissioner's role must be to make it as easy as possible for people to have some place to go if they have a problem.  As I said earlier, at the moment there is considerable development in artificial intelligence, AI, to address some of these issues.  However, AI can only do so much.  Education and regulation are the way forward.  People need to feel they have some kind of recourse to the online safety commissioner when everything else fails.  Before that, we need to have education and have people using these facilities in a different way from how they have been using them.  <br/><br/><b></b>The Chairman also asked what we would do if we had a magic wand.  Regarding resources for schools, as someone said earlier, time is getting squeezed out of our schools.  Every day there is increasingly less time to think and to do things that are really meaningful because teachers, parents and everyone in the school are under so much pressure.  If we had a way to give schools a bit of time, maybe cover for substitutes to allow teachers to take up continuing professional development and making time available in that way, it would be really important.  There is also a role for the school inspectorate in the whole-school evaluation and looking at how schools are handling bullying and cyberbullying issues within schools, particularly educating teachers about the fullness of their role.</p></speech>

What are the witnesses' views on the importance of physical exercise for mental health and various reasons?  The curriculum is so packed.  We cannot extend the school week but should we extend the school day?  I am not sure whose area of responsibility this might be.  Is there too much in the curriculum?</p></speech>

It is also really important to look at the broader picture and the holistic development of the child.  The physical element is just one component.  My area is social, personal and health education, SPHE, and I think there should be more time on it in initial teacher education and the school curriculum.  At primary level it is only 30 minutes per week.  That is where the life skills take place, the decision making, feelings and emotions and how to manage and regulate them and how pupils learn to cope with scenarios they may face.  It also includes media education.  It is very challenging for teachers to deliver meaningful lessons in a 30 minute slot.  There can be a tendency, as research has shown, that where classes run over time in other subject areas, SPHE is often the subject that gets missed out on.  The review of primary and post-primary has included significant redevelopments in valuing SPHE.  This is clear in this year's revised version of the well-being programme for junior cycle and the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, draft primary school framework in 2020.  There is now a focus on well-being as a subject area.  From junior infants to third class, the well-being umbrellas includes SPHE and PE.  Both go hand in hand to promote the well-being of the child.</p></speech>

While that is important there is a danger that there can be a preoccupation with measurable outcomes such as standardised testing.  The consequence can be a narrow focus on the curriculum and then looking at practices such as ability grouping and streaming.  That can have an impact on children and on their learning in the school environment too.  We should be mindful of the holistic development and the holistic curriculum into the future and that we do not focus on narrow attainment levels in future curriculum development or redesign.</p></speech>

They are all pervasive and therefore so is cyberbullying.  There is no escaping it or down time from it.  It can be difficult to monitor what your kids do on social media, particularly as they get older, and there will always be a difficulty there.</p> <p>  Returning to the metrics and incidents being recorded and a school making its best case scenario intervention, in some cases this will involve families that have added vulnerabilities and difficulties.  When we talk about acting holistically, we probably have to think beyond bullying.  We fail miserably to carry out these early interventions that would be a hell of a lot cheaper and easier and could give supports to families or, in really bad situations, go nuclear quicker by removing children more quickly from bad situations.  We pay for that in the sense of bullying but also people entering into mental health service or the justice system.  It is really terrible and has an impact and a huge cost.  I am interested in the wider question of how this fits in.  We talk about a community answer which will have to include the schools but it probably has to be more holistic than dealing with bullying in a silo.  </p></speech>

UNESCO's whole education approach locates the school within the wider societal issues.  We must always be cognisant that every child comes from a family and a community where there may be additional vulnerabilities and they will compound the problem.  If someone is coming from that kind of background, and most kids at some stage in their life have some kind of issue in their background they need to deal with, that will be linked to bullying.  We need to have what UNESCO calls the "whole education approach" which has different characteristics and includes things such as policy, political leadership, curriculum development, therapeutic services, and the role of the social media companies.  All those have a place in the whole education approach to try to lift up the child and the family that are experiencing the vulnerability and the related bullying.</p></speech>

Friendships are really important for buffering against the negative impacts of bullying.  A similar example could also be given in respect of people interested in playing chess.

Our main business this afternoon is meeting with representatives of Yazda UK and Ireland to discuss the plight of the Yazidi community in Iraq.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Natia Navrouzov, head of the legal documentation project related to the latest UN Investigation, and Ms Nasreen, who is a survivor of ISIS captivity.  Both are joining us remotely from Kurdistan.  Mr. Ahmed Khudida Burjus, head of Yazda UK and Ireland, joins us from London.  We are joined too by Mr. John Gallagher, also of Yazda UK and Ireland.  The witnesses are all very welcome this afternoon to our meeting in Dublin.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will first hear from Mr. Khudida, followed by Ms Navrouzov and then from Ms Nasreen.  We will then revert to members of the committee to discuss and engage in a question-and-answer session with our witnesses and guests.  As we are quite time limited due to Covid restrictions, I ask that our witnesses be conscious of time constraints when initially addressing the committee in order that we will be in a position to expend the bulk of our time by way of engagement.  Following the opening statements there will be a discussion followed by questions and answers with members of the committee.  Again, I ask members to be concise in their questions to allow our guests the opportunity to answer questions and all members the opportunity to ask questions.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  Of course, it is imperative that they immediately comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, I remind them that there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings that witnesses physically present in the parliamentary precincts currently enjoy.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their own domestic law in the jurisdiction from which they speak and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex or from the conference centre, where the D&aacute;il and Seanad are meeting today in plenary session.  For anybody watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everybody bear with us in the event of a technical issue arising.  I thank the technical team, who have been working since this morning to ensure that our witnesses and guests are present and audible.</p> <p>  With that, I am very pleased to call on Mr. Khudida, followed by Ms Navrouzov and Ms Nasreen, to address our committee.  They are welcome.  Mr. Khudida has the floor.</p></speech>

I also thank the members of the committee for the previous discussion of Yazidi issues at its previous meeting.  I thank as well the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, for his positive words about the Yazidi situation at the previous meeting.</p> <p>  The members of the committee will be aware the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, ISIS, committed genocide and other heinous human rights violations against religious and ethnic minority groups in Iraq and Syria.  The Yazidis were specifically targeted for their identity.  This systematic persecution led to the mass killing of an estimated 5,000 Yazidis, the abduction of approximately another 7,000 Yazidis, mostly women and children, the forced conversion of countless Yazidis, the systematic destruction of Yazidi religious and cultural sites, homes and farms and the forced displacement of an estimated 450,000 people in Iraq alone.</p> <p>  Since then, little progress has been made regarding the plight of the Yazidis.  Around 2,800 Yazidis, mainly women and children, are still missing.  Half of the community is still in internally displaced people, IDP, camps facing a miserable situation.  In recent days, we saw a very large fire in the Sharya refugee camp which destroyed 400 tents and left more than 1,000 Yazidis homeless.  Those who have returned to their home areas have very limited access to the most basic services.  Many areas are still extensively mined and have not been rebuilt.  Most importantly, there is an absence of justice, accountability and reparations after almost seven years of ongoing genocide.  In addition, there is instability in Yazidi areas due to political insecurity and geopolitical conflict between national and regional players.</p> <p>  To discuss these issues, we have two speakers from Yazda.  The first speaker is Ms Nasreen, a member of the Yazidi Survivor Network, YSN, and a Yazidi human rights activist.  The second speaker will be Ms Natia Navrouzov, who is one of the leaders of Yazda and the head of our documentation and legal team, as well as being our legal advocacy director.  Yazda is a global Yazidi organisation which tries to bring justice, healing and rejuvenation to vulnerable ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq and Syria who have suffered or been affected by the genocidal campaign of ISIS in 2014.  Yazda works on three main missions: humanitarian, justice and advocacy missions.  As part of our humanitarian mission for the past six years, we have been providing services and supports to survivors of the ISIS genocide, people in IDPs and refugees.  This has included, but has not been limited to, mental health, psychosocial support, case management, education, medical, healthcare, livelihood and legal supports.  Our justice mission aims to bring justice to survivors through the documentation of ISIS crimes and filing cases against those accused of persecution.  Our advocacy mission seeks recognition of the ISIS genocide and to empower survivors, like Ms Nasreen, to speak out about their experiences and anguish.  I hand over now to Ms Nasreen.</p></speech>

I apologise, my English is not very good.  I hope the committee can understand me.  I thank the committee members very much for inviting me to participate in this meeting.  I am a Yazidi human rights activist and a member of the Yazidi Survivor Network.  Perhaps not all the members of the committee may be aware of the Yazidis, so I will begin by defining us as a religious and ethnic minority who live in many parts of the world, but mainly in northern Iraq and specifically in Sinjar.  They have been subjected to many genocides, the most recent of which occurred on 3 August 2014 in Sinjar and was perpetrated by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, also known as ISIS.  As a result of this genocide, thousands of Yazidi men were killed, thousands of women were enslaved, with many subsequently traded by their captors multiple times, children were trained as soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Yazidis were displaced.</p> <p>  I am one of those Yazidi women who has subjected to sexual violence in the form of rape, slavery and physical and psychological torture.  In addition, we have lost our beloved family members.  More than 5,000 of our fathers, husbands and brothers were shot and buried in mass graves.  It has been seven years since the genocide, but about 3,000 Yazidis are still missing, including 14 members of my family, whom I miss very much.  There is not enough time to talk about this genocide in detail.  I will focus on the Yazidi survivors who have been subjected to one of the most awful crimes in this century.  They are also facing many difficulties now following their liberation from ISIL captivity.  They have lost everything and they are trying to restore their lives from nothing.  Most of them live in tents in IDP camps.  Despite all these difficulties, these survivors are very brave and are advocating for their own rights and those of others.  They also work very hard in helping the authorities to bring justice for everyone.  We are fighting to prevent future genocides from happening to us and everywhere else in the world.</p> <p>  The Yazidi Survivors Network is an example of brave survivors who work on advocating for the rights of Yazidi survivors and the survivors of many other cases.  However, to carry out this advocacy work effectively, we require capacity building training courses in different fields.</p><p>We were deprived of the opportunity to continue our education because of being in captivity.  We need more education to be taken seriously and to be part of the decision-making process, especially on topics that are directly about us.</p><p> The main issue we now face in developing the Yazidi Survivors Network is funding.  I would like to take this opportunity to ask the committee to support the network members in any possible way so that we can support other survivors and our community in general as much as we can.  I thank the committee very much for listening.  I am sorry my English is not good.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for the honour of addressing the committee today.  I wish I could be there in person.  I will keep my remarks short so there is room for questions and a discussion with members.</p> <p>  I want to start by giving a little more background about the Yazidi Survivors Network, as mentioned by Ms Nasreen  This network brings together 15 Yazidi survivors in advocating for their rights.  The starting point of the network was a draft Bill on reparation for Yazidi female survivors presented by the Iraqi President to the Parliament in March 2019.  Although the name of the Bill was the Yazidi female survivors law, not a single survivor was involved in the drafting process.  Even though the Bill was for them and was meant to address the harm they had suffered and are still suffering, none of them was consulted.  The draft law was a good step in the right direction but it needs improvement.</p> <p>  To tackle these challenges, Yazda UK and Ireland brought together a group of survivors and provided them with capacity building on transitional justice, mainly on the topic of reparation.  We explained to the survivors the obligations of the state in terms of reparation and, more importantly, their rights as victims.  A core group of this network started to advocate for the improvement of the Bill and the Iraqi Parliament took some of its suggestions into consideration.  The law was passed in March this year and by-laws are being drafted to ensure its implementation.  The next step is to ensure survivors are also involved in the implementation phase, especially through a monitoring mechanism, which will need to be established.</p> <p>  After their experience with the Yazidi female survivors law, the survivors realised how strong their voices can be, as individuals but also as a group.  The wish to establish a formal network came from them.  Having strong voices of survivors is essential in a country where the process is often top-down.  However, to ensure these strong voices remain and become louder, we must continue to develop the network.  To pursue this important work, the survivors in the network are asking for simple things, some of which Ms Nasreen mentioned.  They are asking for further capacity building, with English classes, Arabic classes, IT classes, public speaking and advocacy lessons.  As Ms Nasreen mentioned, most of them are not able to go back to school because of the year's gap they had and because of being in ISIL captivity.  They are asking for an office space where they can meet to discuss important topics related to their community and develop advocacy strategies together.  They need funding for transportation costs, to be able to go from their camps to the office, and for mobile telephone chargers to enable them to speak to each other through WhatsApp groups and for general Internet use.</p> <p>  We have calculated that to fund such a campaign for the network for a year, approximately &euro;370,000 will be necessary.  It is a significant amount of money but the impact this network could have would be much greater.  Yazda UK and Ireland would welcome the opportunity of a subsequent discussion with the Minister and his officials to explore the possibility of obtaining this funding.  Just as the Irish National Teachers Organisation is helping to fund primary education for our community, we hope Ireland will be able to help fund survivor empowerment and capacity building.</p> <p>  I want to give another example showing why it is important to encourage and support strong victims' voices in Iraq.  At the end of April this year, the government of the Kurdistan region of Iraq presented a new draft Bill to its Parliament.  This draft law is about establishing a special tribunal in Kurdistan to prosecute ISIL suspects for international crimes.  Currently, there is no legal framework in Iraq to prosecute ISIL members for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Only trials under antiterrorism laws are taking place.  This draft law is a very good step in the right direction.  Such a tribunal is needed to enable justice for survivors.  Again, however, there is the same risk that the survivors are not being consulted, even though such a tribunal is meant to bring justice to them.  Therefore, the survivors will need to proactively seek to be involved in the decision-making process.  We can enable this by empowering them.  Yazda UK and Ireland is advocating for consultation with survivors and civil society to take place in regard to the draft law.</p> <p>  We have already had initial discussions with the Yazidi Survivors Network on this Bill and one of the main comments from survivors was that the tribunal needs to have strong international involvement because of the local mistrust towards Iraqi institutions.  To avoid history repeating itself and this tribunal facing the same challenges as the Iraqi High Tribunal, which prosecuted Saddam Hussein and his party, the international community, including Ireland, needs to be part of the process from the start, which is now.  For example, Ireland can lead European Union countries in the discussion on the tribunal to ensure the voices of survivors are heard and that the tribunal has a strong foundation and legitimacy.  I am happy to answer any questions related to the draft law during our discussion.</p> <p>  I would like to finish by saying that the fight against ISIL is not over.  It needs to continue in courtrooms and we need to arm survivors to face their perpetrators.  Survivors like Ms Nasreen have already taken a major step by sharing their story.  Yazda UK and Ireland alone has collected more than 2,000 statements of survivors.  We need now to take a step towards them and show them we care by empowering them and enabling accountability.  The UN Security Council did this in 2017 by creating UNITAD and the international community needs to do so again by supporting the creation of a tribunal in which all the evidence gathered can be used.</p> <p>  ISIL is not only an Iraqi or Syrian issue but a global one.  Initiatives such as the one in the Kurdistan region of Iraq need global support and survivors like Ms Nasreen need to see that international crimes receive an international response.  I know that at the previous meeting of this committee, the issues affecting Yazidis were raised in members' discussion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was presenting before the committee.  I very much welcome the points raised by a number of members on behalf of our community and their understanding of the challenges facing minority and ethnic groups in many parts of the world today.  I also put on record my appreciation for the positive responses from the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I hope our delegation can provide further information and detail to assist the committee in any further deliberations.  I thank members very much for their attention.</p></speech>

I will now take questions from members, starting with Deputy Brady.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021061500002#D00100"><p>I welcome our guests to the committee, in respect of what I imagine is a harrowing and traumatic experience for all of them.  I was particularly struck by the testimony of Ms Hassan.  It was truly brave and remarkable of her to make that statement given the lived experiences she has had to endure.  Like her, so many other Yazidi people have suffered at the hands of the barbaric terrorist organisation ISIS.  I commend the witnesses on their bravery in speaking out to try to get justice for their people.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  For a number of years, I have been following what was happening to the Yazidis at the hands of ISIS and, similarly, the people in Syria, Northern Iraq and Kurdistan.  It is appalling.  Similarly, the slowness of the international community to step in and try to provide assistance to the people when they were being slaughtered by ISIS was appalling.  What happened has left an awful lot of trauma legacy issues.  Suicide is prevalent given the extent of the trauma, the displacement of the Yazidi people and the uncertainty as to where loved ones are.  It was striking to hear from Ms Hassan there are still 3,000 people missing, including 40 members of her family.  That must serve as a message to the international community to step up to the mark and provide assistance to reunite families and find loved ones that are missing and to provide the tangible assistance laid out by the witnesses in their statements.</p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions.  For me, what happened to the Yazidis was genocide, pure and simple.  It is important that when a genocide takes place the international community calls it out for what it is in order that we can learn from it and hold people to account.  I will touch on the need for a tribunal later.  On the specific issue of genocide, am I correct that the UK Government is the only government that has declared what happened a genocide and how helpful would it be for the international community to state it as it is? </p> <p>  As a member of this committee I had the opportunity to put questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, when he was before us a couple of weeks ago.  I am struck that Ireland is one of a few countries that has not contributed to alleviating the difficulties and plight of the Yazidi people.  As I am aware that Concern is active on the ground in parts of Iraq and that there are particularly sensitive security issues around that, I will not prise the witnesses for information on that.  In terms of assistance from the Irish Government, what more can be given?  I note the witnesses have a specific request for &euro;368,000 to assist the excellent work they are doing.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support that.  It is the minimum the Irish Government should do.  I am sure the committee will come back to this issue in terms of some of the specific requests from the witnesses, on which, I hope, all committee members will be able to agree.</p> <p>  Other than financial aid, what more can Ireland do?  Ireland has a seat on the UN Security Council and is a member state of the EU.  There is a specific request that Ireland would lend its voice in regard to the tribunal.  It is critically important that survivors are listened to.  What message would the witnesses send to the Irish Government in terms of the tangible assistance needed to ensure Yazidi voices are heard within the tribunal?  Given our own conflict and attempts at conflict resolution and the peace process within Ireland, what role could Ireland play in terms of trying to negotiate a settlement?  I am aware of some of the issues in regard to Kurdistan and in terms of the international support for a tribunal.  Kurdistan still has the death penalty, as does Iraq.  That might be a problem.  The witnesses might address that issue.  If that is a problem in terms of the international community getting involved, given Ireland's involvement in the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, what role could it play in terms of trying to get agreement and having the death penalty set aside to ensure accountability can be heeded.?</p> <p>  I have a couple of other questions.  Sinjar is still in ruins and the Yazidi people are dispersed across many different countries.  In terms of the rebuilding of Sinjar, for example, what commitments have been given by the international community and what work is happening on the ground to help people to rebuild their communities, livelihoods and lives in general?  In terms of recommendations, the committee should consider putting forward a recommendation on the funding to Department and the Minister in regard.  On the tribunal, Ireland needs to use its voice to ensure the voices of survivors and victims are central in that process and it is essential there is recognition that a brutal genocide against the Yazidi people was perpetrated.  I again commend the witnesses and thank them for being here, in particular Ms Hassan, whose statement was truly powerful and touching.  </p></speech>

My first question relates to the international process needed for the courts.  I ask the witnesses to highlight precedents where such a process has happened previously.  I refer, for example, to Rwanda where the international community and the UN Security Council has done something similar.  I would also like to know about the impediments to the international process in terms of the courts.  Would the absence of legislation in Iraq to deal with an international court hold up such a process and, if so, what can we do to encourage the Iraqi Government to pass the legislation that will be needed to collaborate on such a process?</p> <p>  My next question in relation to the international court pertains to Ireland and its position within the EU and on the UN Security Council.</p><p>What would the witnesses strongly encourage our State to do to assist in this plight?</p><p> Will the witnesses tell us about the education work that they take on and the support they have been receiving from the INTO in that regard, and what we can do to help support that essential work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.204" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021061500002#E00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  Ms Hassan's English is more than suitable for conveying the horror that she and the Yazidi people have experienced.  She should feel incredibly proud of the statement she made and the dignity she showed when making it.</p> <p>  I do not want to go over areas that have already been covered, but I will add something further on the question of the court system.  It is vital that survivors have their day in a court of law and see the perpetrators of the crimes against them stand before that court.  For that to happen, though, survivors need scaffolding.  They need multiple layers of support around them.  They need to be physically capable of standing in a courtroom.  They also need to be psychologically prepared to be there and to rebuild afterwards.  That is not an easy task.</p> <p>  The female survivors law is really disappointing.  It is beyond disappointing to hear that women were not included in its drafting.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Sadly, we know from experience that sexual violence is used as a weapon in conflicts.  How likely are women to engage in the process and utilise this law if the proposed amendments are not taken into consideration and included in the final legislation?  One of the key issues for survivors is that they do not feel like they have got justice if they are not involved.  They do not feel like they have been represented if their voices are not heard.  If their voices and lived experiences are not included, it can sometimes create a barrier to utilising laws.  How do the witnesses see that playing out?  How can it be ensured that those who most need this law benefit from it?</p> <p>  Education was mentioned.  It is right to say that education is key.  It is the cornerstone that will change the lives of people who have experienced conflict, as it allows them to develop into fuller people.  Will the witnesses give us more detail in that regard, please?</p> <p>  Mention was made of the Kurdistani draft legislation.  Due to the nature of ISIS, we know that many people will have fled.  How many countries are likely to need to pass similar legislation?  If multiple countries must pass multiple laws, what impact will it have on the timeline for delivering an end result for the Yazidi people?</p> <p>  My final point is on the project's funding.  The project is a wonderful idea and could make a major difference to people's lives.  Will the witnesses give us more detail about it?  Will they tell us more about the potential service users, its location, its potential structure and the governance that will be put in place?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies for their questions, which were relevant.  I tried to write down as many as I could, so if I forget any, they might let me know.</p> <p>  I will focus on accountability and the tribunal.  Turning to Deputy Brady's comments, Ireland could provide support through diplomatic channels, particularly given that Ireland now sits on the UN Security Council.  It would be great to remind the Security Council that, while establishing the Investigative Team to Promote Accountability for Crimes Committed by Da'esh/ISIL, UNITAD, was a good step, it was not enough.  What is the point in having an investigative team gathering evidence that cannot be used in Iraq?  It comes down to spending billions of dollars without serving justice to survivors at the end of the day.</p> <p>  I am unsure as to how aware the EU is of the draft law.  It was presented at the end of April and matters are moving forward quickly.  The Kurdish Parliament is conducting various consultations, but consultations with survivors are not scheduled yet.  Ireland and the wider EU could push for these consultations with survivors, but also for consultations with the international community, including Ireland.  ISIL is a global issue and needs to be addressed globally.  From my experience as a lawyer, Ireland has great judges.  They could sit on the tribunal or advise it.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of a legal framework, the Iraqi judiciary does not have the expertise to prosecute international crimes.  As such, capacity building is needed.  Funding for the tribunal is also much needed.</p> <p>  A good point was made about the death penalty.  It will be a sticking point because, with a death penalty, there will probably be no international support.  We saw the same with the Iraqi High Tribunal, for which there was a great deal of goodwill.  There was the will to prosecute international crimes, but because of the death penalty, the lack of transparency, the lack of involvement by survivors and the hearings not always being fair, the international community did not support the institution.  We need to ensure that the same does not recur if a tribunal is established.</p> <p>  Deputy Gannon asked about the example of Rwanda and what had happened previously.  There are different ways to have an accountability mechanism.  It could be the same one as was used in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia, for which there was agreement between the UN Security Council and those countries through resolutions to establish a court.  That is still an option in this case if Ireland and other countries negotiate it with Iraq at a diplomatic level.  UNITAD is an example of Iraq's will in this regard, but Iraq might be too scared to deal with the issue alone.  As such, the support of the international community is much needed.</p> <p>  Another solution could be the International Criminal Court, ICC.  Unfortunately, Iraq is not part of the Rome Statute, but it could agree to be.  That would enable such trials in the ICC.  This is something else that Ireland could look into with Iraq.</p> <p>  Another option is a hybrid tribunal, that is, a mixed national and international process.  This is actually what is being suggested now.  There would be some international involvement under the draft law, in that some of the judges could be from the international community.  Unfortunately, the number is not specified.  If there was a majority of Iraqi judges and a minority of international ones, it could reduce the decision-making power of the international judges.</p> <p>  Regarding the Yazidi survivors Bill, it was sad to see that the survivors themselves were not involved in the process.</p><p>We really advocated for that.  At the end of the day, some of our recommendations were taken into consideration.  Currently, in the by-law drafting process, Yazda along with 31 other NGOs have formed a coalition that is working on reparation, which has provided a set of recommendations to the Council of Ministers in Baghdad.  We are currently working on the by-laws.</p><p> Our main point was to have a survivor-centred approach and put the survivor in the centre of everything we are doing.  We start by doing outreach.  Many survivors in Iraq do not know even know this law was passed.  It was discussed two years ago and it was passed in March this year.  Outreach is, therefore, needed.  It is important to ensure that survivors understand the process and know where to go to submit their paperwork.  These are very practical things whereby if no-one really deals with them then this will not enable the survivors to be part of this reparation programme.</p><p> Another question was regarding the Sadiki initiative and how many other countries would need to pass such laws.  I am not sure.  I know that in Europe, some trials against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, members for crimes against Yazidis are taking place.  There is no need as European countries already have the legal framework.</p><p> Other countries might need that but I am not able to tell the committee how many.  Since most of the victims are in Iraq and most of the crimes happen in Iraq and Syria, it is very important to ensure there is a legal framework in this country.  Otherwise, trials can be scattered like what is happening now.  Only a handful of trials are being conducted, for instance, in Germany.  If, however, there is no legal framework in the country where victims are or where the crimes took place, there will not be much justice served for the survivors.</p><p> There should also be accountability.  Iraq needs to deal with the issue in terms of broader transitional justice to enable trust-building again between the society and the country.  As I said, at the end of the day, survivors, unfortunately, do not trust the institutions anymore because they are saying the institutions did not protect us.  Having a court would, therefore, send a positive message to the community.</p><p> One final point from my notes was about the funding we are requesting for the Yazidi Survivors Network.  This funding would enable us to continue to empower the survivors.  Currently, we have a group of 15 survivors who are willing to get further capacity-building on public speaking, IT, Arabic, and English so that they are able to carry the messages they want to carry in Iraq but also globally.</p><p> As I said, unfortunately, we are not able to be there physically with the committee.  One of the things survivors want to do is travel and explain what has happened to them.  Some survivors have done that and Ms Nasreen is a great example of that.  There are, however, so many other survivors who are willing to do so and there are so many things that need to be done.  We need hundreds of survivors to be able to speak up.</p><p> In terms of localisation, these activities will be mainly based in Duhok, Kurdistan, where we would want an office where we would be able to build out these capacity-building sessions where survivors could meet.  This was one of the issues.  They are currently scattered in different camps.  They are not even able to meet physically to discuss what is important to their community and what they need to advocate for.  Sometimes, they are not even able to communicate virtually because they do not have the money to buy the communication methods.  As I said, the cost would be &euro;370,000.  It is a lot of money but it would also have a great impact on these survivors.  Members will see the results quite quickly and for many years.  I thank the committee.  I hope I covered the questions that were for me.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the manner in which she dealt with some of the questions.  I am not sure if we have any further engagements from members.  As Chairman, however, I acknowledge what Deputies Brady, Clarke and Gannon said as to how we might assist.  I propose that immediately following this meeting, we write to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to ask that a sum in the amount of &euro;368,000 be made available from the Department.</p> <p>  I note that among the documentation furnished to this committee was a detailed proposal for practical support, which has been broken down under a number of headings.  I believe that is quite transparent and will be helpful for us.  I ask, particularly following the contributions of members earlier, that we pass a resolution now seeking such assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs and engage further on the matter with the Minister at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>  I see that Senator Craughwell is offering.  I believe it is important that we follow up this meeting with concrete practical steps, one of which would be an exhortation to the Department from the committee that such funding be made available.  We can also engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, as well as the Minister, as to the channel through which these funds would be made available and targeted.  I call Senator Craughwell.</p></speech>

I do not have any questions.  The witnesses have been fairly questioned up until now.  I want to add my voice to those of support.  The Chairman has laid out what he sees as the way forward.  I totally agree with and support him on that, as I support Deputy Brady and all others who have spoken.  It takes courage to speak out.  Anything we can do to help the victims to speak out, we need to do.  I thank the witnesses very much for appearing before the committee and sharing their experiences.</p></speech>

Before I ask our witnesses to leave us with some closing messages, I ask members to immediately agree proposals Nos. 1 and 2 supporting the provision of resources for the recently established Yazidi Survivors Network, having regard to our consideration of the specific budget and costs included in our appendix.</p> <p>  I ask that we agree that now and agree a further request to the Department of Foreign Affairs, at EU and international level, to enable delivery of the types of initiatives that have been mentioned, such as the proposal to establish a tribunal on Isis in the Kurdistan Region.  I ask members to agree these proposals now.  I will then ask our witnesses for closing comments.  Is Deputy Brady agreed on that?</p></speech>

Could our witnesses when summing up touch on the issue of genocide, on which I asked a specific question?  I have read through some of the notes and I stand corrected.  I believe France has also recognised that genocide has happened.  In their concluding statements, the witness might address how important it would be for parliaments and countries to adopt that position.</p></speech>

I believe the Deputy asked a specific question so and I will quickly answer.  In terms of genocide recognition, parliaments or governments in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Armenia, Portugal and the European Parliament have recognised the genocide.  We hope, therefore, that Ireland will follow these countries and recognise and acknowledge not only the genocide but also Isis crimes against all communities, especially the minority communities in Iraq and Syria.</p><p>This would be a moral support for all victims and all communities there.  It would also help as an important step towards justice.  We hope the committee will include this on its agenda.</p><p> There were a couple of questions about education, what we are doing now and what the needs are on the ground.  Basically, even before the ISIS attacks, Sinjar had been neglected and persecuted systematically by the current Government and, before that, by the Government of Saddam.  For example, I graduated from Sinjar.  We have almost 5 million people there, including in the surrounding area.  There is no university there.  We have an institute.  We have what we call villages.  In the village I lived in, there were approximately 30,000 people and we had only three or four schools..  This is for all the people in all the region.  What was there ISIS has destroyed and we have been left with a broken education system.   It was already broken before ISIS. This is why the needs are very great in terms of education.</p><p> I will give a few examples.  In an assessment over six months in Sinjar, we found that almost 30,000 students in primary, middle and secondary schools had only 120 formal teachers and 400 volunteer teachers.  For instance, a school of 600 students has only a few teachers.  There has been general spending from the international side and it has supported the provision of 35 teachers in high schools between 2018 and this January.  There have also been other initiatives from other organisations.  These are all temporary solutions, however, and only help for a short time. We need funding to rebuild schools.  We need to hire more teachers.  We also need school supplies.  We receive very small but generous support from Irish teachers' organisations, which support informal educational programmes to help children to learn English and other activities after school.</p><p> There was a question about other countries.  I would like to acknowledge some of the work that has been done by international organisations and countries, including the US, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries.  For example, the US has been heavily involved in providing mental health support and psychological support case management.  The Netherlands has also helped over the past two years in providing these types of supports.  There have been 700 beneficiaries, mainly survivors.  The UK has helped with demining the area.  I cannot mention all of the activities supported by all of the countries.  We thank all of them and we hope Ireland will also come forward and get involved in some activities.  What has been done is appreciated but it is really not enough.  It is very little compared to the needs of people.  As I have said, all sectors are destroyed and we need to rebuild.</p></speech>

It is so impressive how much power they still carry in them and how much willpower they have to change things.  I am doing a lot of work on these issue but I do not enjoy anything more than working directly with the survivors.  I hope to see the committee members very soon and I thank them very much for their kindness and support.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome them to the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have to read a note about privilege.  The evidence of witnesses physically present from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings that a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chairman and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person's or entity's good name.</p> <p>  I invite the Reverend Karen to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

First, my work as a minister centres on peace and reconciliation.  I have the privilege of working with people from all backgrounds on this island, across the UK and further afield.  Second, I believe it is critical that conversations regarding the future of Ireland extend beyond the political arena.</p> <p>  During our previous discussion, I argued for a citizens' assembly, as I am passionate that our conversations are not solely politically-led, but also extend to being people-led.  When one gets to the core of what matters most to people, it is not their political stance.  It is the bread and butter issues that affect all of us, concerning education, housing, healthcare, the economy and so forth.  Therefore, I am sure the Chairman and members can understand my disappointment at some comments made to my colleague, Mr. Niall Murphy, at the previous committee meeting.  One member, in an attempt to link us to a political party, publicly stated: "If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck".  I understand political opposition, but I kindly ask that this is not projected onto those of us who are not political.</p> <p>  The work of peace and reconciliation calls us to have the courage to extend beyond our own boundaries and to step into all places and spaces.  I was born into a unionist family.  My family, friends and colleagues are unionists.  I am currently involved in various projects, which include the Catholic and Protestant divide, gender equality, racism, LGBT+ rights and inter-faith work.  I write a column for Belfast Media Group.  I am a champion of progressive faith and public theology simply because I believe in equality, inclusion and creating a fair society for all.  I have had the privilege of serving as chaplain to two Lord Mayors of Belfast.  It was an honour to champion our city.  My reason for sharing this is that peace and reconciliation are best exampled when people from very different backgrounds not only work together, but form friendships.  I assure the committee that my work is not politically motivated or linked to any political party.  This is important to me.</p> <p>  Previously, I shared my vision of creating a nation of neighbours based on the ancient question: who is my neighbour?  This question is foundational to my work, as I believe it has the potential to help provide a unifying framework to build a nation of neighbours.  Thanks to the Anabaptist Mennonite Trust I have been accepted to begin a PhD this coming autumn on this very theme from a faith and theological perspective.  This is important to me because I am your neighbour and you are mine.  It does not matter what background we are from &ndash; we must always find ways to work and partner together, creating a better place to live.  Even though it was disappointing to hear those comments, I was overwhelmed by the response and support for myself and the work of Ireland&rsquo;s Future.  We are not part of any political party.  Those of us who are entrusted with a place of leadership have the responsibility to move away from name calling, labelling and any type of pigeon-holing.  Let us learn to lead well and by example.  Let us together, regardless of our background, put our shoulders to the wheel of peace and reconciliation and concentrate on the main thing, which is creating a better home and future for all of us.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I extend the hand of friendship and welcome to the Chairman and all the members.  I ask them to come to Belfast and spend time with us, to hear our stories and about the work in which we are involved.</p></speech>

On the last point, the committee would be very happy to visit Belfast.  In fact, the clerk to the committee has been asked to make those arrangements at the appropriate and suitable time.  As Chairman, I will be happy to go as soon as possible, as would all the members.</p> <p>  I wish to make two points.  At the meeting Reverend Karen referred to, I made it clear that I refuted the allegations that were made.  They were made by a Member of the Oireachtas, but he is not a member of this committee.  I assume he was not familiar with the process we use here.  I categorically assure you, Reverend Karen, that I absolutely accept that your work is not politically motivated or related to any political party.</p></speech>

However, when one is with Ireland's Future it is a different operation and different process, as you rightly point out.  Coming from a unionist background, we are delighted to have Reverend Karen at our meetings.  In fact, one of our biggest difficulties has been trying to get people from a unionist background to appear before the committee so we can appreciate and fully understand what their issues are, how we must deal with them, how we must recognise their right to have those views and how to live in an Ireland that allows them to hold those views respectfully and respects them as well.</p> <p>  We will takes questions now.  Ms &Oacute;rfhlaith Begley and Mr. Paul Maskey are the first Sinn F&eacute;in speakers.  There are 15 minutes for questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Oacute;rfhlaith Begley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021061500002#B01300"><p>I welcome the members of Ireland's Future to the meeting.  I am delighted that Mr. Murphy has been joined by two formidable females.  That was a great introduction from Reverend Karen to the committee.  Before asking my questions, I commend Ireland's Future on the work it has been doing.  I believe there was a vacuum in that regard and it has created a platform on which to engage and have a respectful discussion on the potential for future constitutional change.  All who are involved in Ireland's Future are to be commended.  I welcome the opportunity to engage with those who are before the committee today, as on the previous occasion.  Hopefully, we can have a discussion which remains respectful of our guests and is informative for us as members of the committee and as representatives.</p> <p>  On the previous occasion, Mr. Murphy referred to the fact that the constitutional conversation is louder now than ever before.  He specifically referred to Brexit and how it has accelerated the conversation by placing the focus on the need to prepare for a potential referendum.  In terms of that preparation and taking into consideration what I have just heard from Reverend Karen, I would like to hear from her about her perspective on the current level of discussion that there is within the Protestant unionist loyalist, PUL, community or those who identify as British regarding future constitutional change.  Within that, what specific issues or concerns does she think there are within the community or among those individuals who, perhaps, identify as unionist in respect of their cultural identity if there was to be reunification?</p><p>What protections or guarantees can be put in place to reassure members of that community, and individuals who identify as British, that their rights and cultural identity will be upheld?  I thank the witnesses for their previous presentations and the presentation given this morning.</p></speech>

It is very important to set that context and that everyone respects each other no matter who they are or where they are from.  I really appreciate Reverend Karen's opening remarks.  She is someone I know very well.  She works closely in west Belfast with many marginalised people and is showing and leading the way.  I have no doubt the fact that Reverend Karen has become a member of Ireland's Future is obviously a very big step for her to take given her background and where she comes from, but also in the context of the current work she does on a daily basis, so well done to her.  It is a brave decision and a brave step so fair play to the Reverend Karen for that.</p> <p>  It is also great to see Ms Harmon and Mr. Murphy here.  My question to the group is about the coalition of change on the island, which Reverend Karen shows is there.  Throughout the length and breadth of the island more and more people are having this conversation about unity and making sure we are prepared for it.  None of us wants to make the same mistakes made with Brexit, for example, with regard to the proposed Oireachtas joint committee and looking ahead at how we prepare, work and propose initiatives.  What is Ireland's Future's view of what that joint committee would look like?  What form will it take and what should it plan to do in the future, taking this conversation forward? </p></speech>

I will answer the first question because it was directed at me.  Ms Begley is absolutely correct.  There is no doubt, right across the spectrum of our communities, that Brexit has catapulted us to this place.  Things are changing and shifting and people are beginning to ask whether there is something better.  That is a great and very healthy question to ask.  Much of the focus in this conversation is on how we get unionists to engage and bring them into the conversation.  It is the wrong question to ask.  I am being honest in stating that the unionist community will see this through the lens of certain political parties, whether we like that or not.  This is why I am very passionate that we begin to put a light on being people led and not just politically led.  That is not in any way to denigrate anyone because I am thankful for all the work members of the committee do.  I could not do their job.  On the question of unionists being at the table, I would not expect them to come and join my conversation about a future shared island Ireland because they are adamant.  It is important to them to be part of the UK.</p> <p>  The reason I raise is the conversation needs to focus, and the spotlight needs to be on, building the case.  The invitation is for the unionist community to build its case for being part of the UK.  I will be honest that I am up for that.  I am from a unionist background.  I go into my meetings and have great, healthy banter with people like, "Well, here's Karen who would love to see a united Ireland and there's us who want to be part of the union".  It is good, healthy banter and the root of it is, "Okay, you convince me and I'll convince you."  If there is going to be a conversation at a table, then our precious unionist community must begin to build a case to be part of the UK, which it is doing.</p> <p>  I commend some of the groups that have been set up.  We do not need to threaten violence or threaten our peace process.  Healthy debate is being conducted by people like We Make NI, United UK, a new group called Union NI, or groups like Her Loyal Voice and Let's Talk Loyalism, which are groups doing what we are doing but on the other end of the spectrum.  That is not a negative because the central question is not, "Do you want a united Ireland?".  Of course, unionists will say, "No".  The central question is how to begin to think higher than where we are, lift our eyes beyond where we are, begin to build the case for being part of the UK and look at what we are doing to begin to build the vision of us being together on this island.  It is not a negative to think about unionists.  The reality is their voices are just as important as any of ours.</p> <p>  I am interested in those people in the middle ground, who are the unheard, unseen, silent majority.  I am interested in our youth, teens and students.  There are voices that want to be persuaded and that is what I see.  The majority of people in Northern Ireland want a better future.  We just need these conversations to be structured so we can begin to plan for that.  If we learn from Brexit, when people head for the polls on a big question of what they want they should be well informed.  I welcome and encourage the committee to consider inviting and hearing from some of these groups, such as Union NI, We Make NI and United UK, not to convince them of a united Ireland, but to hear their vision.  That is what being a neighbour is about because at the end of the day people will decide.</p></speech>

I ask the Reverend Karen to give the clerk to the committee contact details of the groups we might usefully invite and who would like to come to give their perspective solely, which is what we want to hear.  There are still five minutes remaining in this slot.  Does anyone else from Sinn F&eacute;in want to come in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021061500002#C00500"><p>I will address Mr. Maskey's question.  I compliment Reverend Karen on what she said.  It was an exceptional introductory address and wholly summarises the philosophy of Ireland's Future.  We are so delighted and proud that the Reverend Karen is now an ambassador for our message.  It was a real privilege to be on this call to listen and hear what she had to say because it really sums up exactly how we want to conduct this conversation.  There is a huge responsibility upon all of us, on politicians and anybody who is engaged in this discourse in civic space, to be as open, reflective and respectful as possible.  That is precisely how we want to manage our affairs.</p> <p>  On Mr. Maskey's inquiry on what an Oireachtas joint committee might look like, we respectfully consider that should be complementary to our citizen-led approach in which we are just a participant.  We are not defining the conversation and do not seek to.  All we want is to provide a platform and contribute to public discourse.</p><p>We want that to be done in a spirit of mutual experience, reflective of everybody.  I consider it as a bowl of stew in which everybody is a different ingredient.  Everybody brings to the conversation that which they have experienced, personally and as a community, and does so with respect and confidence.  If there were to be an Oireachtas joint committee in that sprit, the ambition might be for us to get to the position to which Scotland got in 2013.  Our overriding overture is that there must be detail, evidence-led and empirically robust positions that everybody and read, comprehend, understand and contribute to.  As I mentioned in my remarks two weeks ago, the Scottish Government was in a position to publish a 670-page analysis outlining its vision of how Scotland would transition to independence in the event of a positive referendum.  Of course, that did not happen.  There is no preconceived outcome to all of this but our position is that detailed preparation should be undertaken to inform the conversation.  That is where I think an Oireachtas joint committee can outline, drive, procure evidence, monitor, engage and review how a transition in respect of constitutional change might occur.  That might also be complemented by the appointment of a Minister of State with dedicated and specific responsibility to develop strategies to advance constitutional change while co-ordinating with all of the Government's other all-Ireland policies.</p><p> The work that has been commenced by the shared island unit was rightly brought to my attention and that of the committee two weeks ago.  I compliment that positive step.  The finance which has been regenerated and made more specific has infused more energy into what are wholly and fundamentally positive engagements.  Reconnecting the synapses of our island is crucial to everybody's best endeavours in this regard.  Our respectful analysis is that more needs to be done.  As I said, there is a responsibility on all of us to conduct our affairs as transparently and openly as possible.  The best mechanism for that is, of course, through the convention of a committee such as the one we are attending today.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the Taoiseach has stated categorically that it is additional, new and ring-fenced funding, as opposed to money that would have come anyway.  It is new and additional funding.</p></speech>

I am delighted because I missed the committee's engagement with them a couple of weeks ago.  I welcome Ms Harmon and Reverend Karen.  I asked Mr. Murphy a question a couple of weeks ago so if it is okay, I will focus on asking questions to Reverend Karen and Ms Harmon.  I would love it if both of them could answer my question.  Reverend Karen mentioned the need to provide a unifying framework to build a nation of neighbours, which I think is powerful and vital to the creation of meaningful dialogue and the cultivation of positive attitudes towards political opposition.  I know Reverend Karen is a champion of peace and reconciliation.  Her words today were powerful.  My question relates in particular to young people.  We all know that young people have not experienced the trauma of the conflict.  My question as to how we bring in young people is also directed at Ms Harmon.  How do we bring young people into the conversation on their vision of what a new Ireland would look like?  It is really important to bring young people into the conversation.  I ask that question to Reverend Karen in the first instance.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Harmon about a citizens' assembly.  I know she did phenomenal work on the campaigns to repeal the eighth amendment and the campaign on the marriage referendum.  She was involved in and championed those campaigns.  She did phenomenal work.  My question to her relates to young people and a citizens' assembly.  How do we engage young people?  I am really asking the same question of both our guests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Reverend Karen Sethuraman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021061500002#D00400"><p>I thank the Senator for her welcome and for a great question.  It is a timely question because, as I have shared, in terms of my role in Ireland's Future, I really want to go after what I call the kitchen table conversations.  Those conversations are happening around the kitchen table and in businesses.  Someone contacted me and told me about a project that was happening, led by a CEO named Jacinta Linden.  I had never met her before.  She is a hero of community and is the CEO of Bolster Community.  She received PEACE IV funding to work with young people.  It was to run a programme called Youth Up Front for Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.  A campaign called Beyond Tolerance involved 120 young people, aged 12 to 15.  I really want the committee members to hear this because they are going to hear their voices this morning.  I hope we will all pay attention to them.  Their idea was to overcome adversity, to build inclusive and cohesive communities and to begin to build leadership skills in the young people.</p> <p>  I approached Ms Linden, told her I was part of the Ireland's Future team and asked her to facilitate three questions from me for the young people.  As I mentioned earlier, the starting point with conversation is not to ask people if they want a united Ireland.  That is not the place to start, certainly with young people.  I pitched three questions to the 13- to 15-year-olds.  I explained that this is our home and our home belongs to all of us.  I asked how do we make our home a better place to live.  I also asked the young people what are their dreams for our future together.  My third question, which is for the committee members, asked the young people if they had one message they wanted our Governments to hear, what would it be?  I do not have time to read all the responses but I want to read some of them so the committee can hear how important it is that we have these inputs on the table in this conversation.</p> <p>  In response to the question as to how we make our home a better place to live, &Eacute;abha, aged 14, said that we need to start by making friends with each other.  She said that we are all just human beings.  Grace, aged 15, said that she never really gets the chance to meet young people from different religions and have more opportunities to mix and build understanding.  James, aged 15, asked why there cannot be more tolerance.  He said that surely there is room for all of us, regardless of who we follow.  The following one tugged at my heart.  Caoimhe, aged 15, said she wants to grow up without ever having to face the sectarianism and danger that her parents faced when they were her age.  Those young people's voices matter and we have a duty to pave a way for those young guys.</p><p> The second question was what are the young people's dreams for their future together.  &Eacute;abha, aged 14, dreams that everyone will be treated equally, regardless of race, religion or sexuality.  Dan, aged 14, got straight to the question, even though it was not asked.  He said that he thinks a united Ireland would be a good future but that he does not want the journey to be too bumpy.  Sin&eacute;ad, aged 14, mentioned integrated education and a lack of conflict.  James, aged 15, said that he wants to be a leader who will consider the hopes of others.  Tom, aged 14, said that the tensions and fears between all religions and races will end.  Not one of these kids gave an answer about flags; they want peace, a future and to share this home together.</p><p> I want members to hear the answer to the next question.  The children were asked what message they would like their Government to hear.  Jessica, aged 15, said that she wants to give everyone an equal chance.  Sophie asked the Government to be more accepting, to try to engage with everyone and to consider all options before making impactful decisions.  Christina, aged 14, asked the Government to get rid of sectarianism and discrimination.  James, aged 15, said that we need kindness in our Government, that we have so much to live for and asked the Government to give us hope for a better future.  I love the answer of Jana, aged 14.  She asked the Government to listen to children because they want a future in Northern Ireland.  She also said that young people need more opportunities to get together and understand better.</p><p> That is a little snippet of from 120 young people from all backgrounds taking part in a PEACE IV programme.  We have a duty to honour their young voices.  They are not just our future but our today.  They are the voices that matter as we shape our future in terms of the role of Ireland's Future and of other organisations that take part in conversations.</p></speech>

That is fantastic.  I want to ask Ms Harmon about young people and about the Citizens' Assembly.  That are Ms Harmon's thought about the Citizens' Assembly?  She has so much experience in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Harmon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021061500002#E00300"><p>I apologise that I was precluded from joining the committee two weeks ago due to technical issues.  I am speaking in a personal capacity as a member of Ireland's Future, which I joined a number of months ago.  I am part of the events' team, I am excited to be on board and I am excited about this dialogue that is already happening.  It is important that we facilitate these conversations in a proper manner and that we are part of them.</p> <p>  I work for the Irish Council for International Students and I used to work the National Women's Council of Ireland in Dublin as well.  As part of that work, I was the head of voter mobilisation for Together for Yes.  Previously, back in 2015 I was the president of the Union of Students in Ireland, which is an all-island organisation that represents students North and South.  It also has a trilateral agreement with the student union in Britain and in the North so that provides a lot of learnings.  I would have been involved in making submissions to the Constitutional Convention between 2012 and 2014 in the lead-up to marriage equality and the Citizens' Assembly, particularly the one on the eighth amendment to the Constitution.</p> <p>  I am from a Gaeltacht in Cork and I have been in Dublin for a number of years.  The reason I joined Ireland's Future is that there is a need to have a non-political entity driving this.  We saw in recent referendums the importance of having these conversations led by citizens.  That is not to say that politicians should shy away from those conversations.  They should be involved in them but they should be citizen-led initiatives that are inclusive of all aspects of society and they should not be tied to one political party or another.  It is important for us to bear that in mind.</p> <p>  I will get to the questions that were asked.  On young people, I echo what Reverend Sutherman has outlined and it is fascinating to hear the views those young people have expressed.  It is great that the shared island unit is engaging with young people as well and that those conversations are happening.  When it comes to young people and from my previous experience with the Union of Students in Ireland, one of the reasons the marriage equality referendum in particular was so successful is that we saw mass voter registration drives of young people.  Young people were part of the conversation and they were not just a sideshow but they were at the table, which is important for this issue.  When we are talking about a shared island and having these dialogues, we should not just be going off in silos and just having specific youth consultations.  Those are important and we need to consult with all the representative youth groups and ensure that young people from all creeds and backgrounds with different languages, including the Traveller community, the Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, LGBTQ, community and the migrant community are represented.  Also, when we are having conversations, young people need to be included with older people and be at the table when there are panels and debates happening.  It should not just be a sideshow with young people.  They need to feel that they have ownership of this issue and that they are just as valued as any other age group in society.  That is important.</p> <p>  I know the Citizens' Assembly was discussed at the last meeting as well.  First, having it citizens-led is important if it is to be a citizens' assembly but politicians and political parties should not just take a back seat either.  Political parties need to step up and be responsible for the issue but it is important that it is citizens-led.  One of the things that worked well with the Citizens' Assembly which started in 2016 was that it was not polarised and that there was a random selection for it.  That is not to say that any future citizens' assembly should purely be a random selection of citizens.  This would be a completely new entity because it will have to include the North and the South and citizens in the North will be vital in their self-determination around this issue.</p> <p>  It is valuable to include citizens who might not necessarily have been involved with the issue before and who might not have their opinions made up yet.  That is all part of the process.  People are on a journey to figure out where they stand on the issue and to figure out what issues are important to them in terms of a shared island, education, health, a post-Brexit economy and issues of rights.  We need people at the centre, therefore.  We need to have an opportunity for groups to feed in from all perspectives with their issues.  These include issues of unity, issues from youth groups and issues from all relevant sectors.  People must be able to make submissions and request to address the assembly if that is what it will be called.  There will be recommendations out of it that can then be taken into consideration by Governments.</p> <p>  Planning is really important because the public across the island are ahead of politics.  These conversations are already happening in schools, around kitchen tables and in workplaces.  I have personally seen such an increase in people talking about this issue, not just in the media or in places like this but in everyday life.  We need to be ahead of the curve, start planning and start looking at what models will work best.  That is not to say this is something that should be rushed but it is something that needs to be planned and to have forward-thinking.  It should never be something that is rushed but it needs to be started now because these conversations are already happening.</p></speech>

I apologise that I missed some of the meeting earlier because I had difficulty getting connected.  In one of his responses, Mr. Murphy made a point on detailed preparation for what I, along with others, want to see in the future, which is constitutional change on our island.  Like many others, I aspire to a united Ireland to be achieved through the mechanisms laid out in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is extremely important that detailed preparation is made in every respect.</p><p>Something I have repeated <i>ad nauseam </i>at this committee is the need to utilise and maximise the potential of the existing agreements and political architecture in place already with the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  All of these are important pieces of the political architecture on this island, predominantly the Good Friday Agreement.  I have always believed it is most disappointing that all of its aspects have not been implemented.  We know how important the commitments made in the New Decade, New Approach agreement are and we sincerely hope they will be honoured without delay for the benefit of all of the people of the island.</p><p>At our previous meeting at which Reverend Karen was present, Mr. Lunn left us to go to the announcement of the results of the inquest into the Ballymurphy massacre when I was making my contribution.  I mentioned the issue of the civic forum in Northern Ireland and I suggested that perhaps Reverend Karen would discuss it with Mr. Lunn as a member of the legislative assembly.  From memory, in the multiparty talks, the Women's Coalition was a powerful advocate for a civic forum.  Subsequently, as a result of signing the Good Friday Agreement, the Civic Forum was established in 2000.  Unfortunately, it has not met since 2002.  Its purpose was to have a means of consulting civic society to ensure better understanding of social, economic and cultural issues.  We all know that such assemblies or fora are prevalent throughout the world and are associated with various parliaments and parliamentary systems.  I have always believed there has been a huge lacuna without the Civic Forum to involve and engage civic society.</p><p>The contributions we have heard from Ms Harmon, Reverend Karen and Mr. Murphy have focussed very much on involving civic society.  They speak about a citizens' assembly.  We have provision for a civic advisory panel that, unfortunately, has not been put in place or used at present.  I am not saying it would solve the problems of our country but were the politicians to put that structure in place to ensure the different voices all the witnesses have spoken about today could be listened to, it would be an important message to give out to civic society in Northern Ireland about the mechanism provided for in the Good Friday Agreement and Stormont House Agreement.</p><p>If I got the message coming from the young people Reverend Karen quoted, it was about the need to listen and consult.  The witnesses are advocating very strongly on the potential for an all-Ireland citizens' assembly.  Will they comment on the deficiency we have at present in not having the Civic Forum?  It could contribute something to the general debate, not just on constitutional issues but economic, social and cultural issues also.</p></speech>

I have a question out of pure curiosity for Reverend Karen on her road to Damascus and becoming a member of this group.  I am very curious about it.  Can she say she is a unionist any more?  She has come to the right side of the road and has now become a nationalist.  I would love to know from her point of view how has she reconciled this in herself, coming from a unionist background and wanting union with the UK and now wanting a union of Ireland.</p> <p>  I have another question for Ms Harmon and Mr. Murphy.  Reverend Karen spoke about what the children had said about integrated education and about listening to children.  I look at the education system in the North and how segregated it is.  From the point of view of the witnesses, what can Northern politicians and Southern politicians do to advance an integrated education system in the North?  To me, this is a huge barrier to peace if we are to move forward to a united Ireland, which is my ambition for this island.  We have a lot of work to do in the North and its education system and for our young people to make sure either side does not have two heads.  We are all just trying to get on, which is exactly what those children said in Reverend Karen's presentation.</p></speech>

Following on from some of the comments I made on the previous occasion about the Good Friday Agreement, where we are on this island, the pathway that lies ahead for us and how we create that pathway, there is a lot of responsibility and onus on us all.  In reference to this, the battle over many decades was with the British establishment and British Government.  Since the Good Friday Agreement, that pathway has changed.  We have our own destiny and how we create that destiny is what this is all about.</p> <p>  One of the questions I asked on the previous occasion, and I pose it again in the context of what Reverend Karen said this morning, was how do we break down these barriers.  What can Ireland's Future do as an organisation?  It has done a lot of good work.  What can it now do to bring the unionist communities, parties and tradition, and the Protestant people in Northern Ireland with it?  Much of the work it has done heretofore has been very heavily on the nationalist voice.  There is a pathway for a group such as Ireland's Future to do massive work on bringing in these unionist speakers and voices and letting them have their say.  We need these voices at the table.</p><p>We are crying out for them and we crying out for them on this committee.  The pathway ahead must be one that we all share.  I will be interested to hear the witnesses' thoughts in that regard.  </p></speech>

I am going to answer the question from Senator McGreehan.  The Senator and I need to get a cup of coffee.  It is a long road to Damascus.  I grew up in east Belfast, with Union Jacks on the lampposts.  Going to the bonfires for 12 July every year was an outing.  I grew up in that community, where we had street parties as kids, championed the English football team, partook in all the things the unionist community does and I loved every bit of it.  I do not know if there was a big road to Damascus moment.  I probably started to see outside of my own narrative because of my pastoral experience.  I started to work and get involved in peace and reconciliation work and through that I realised that there was another story apart from the one I grew up in.  I realised that there were other people who were hurt and busted and who did not agree with the same outlook.  I was probably sheltered from that view as a young person who grew up in the Troubles.  If I am being honest, though, I am not sure that I really understood what they were fighting over.  I just knew, and remember being told, to just not go to this community, that I should stay in this community and all of those things.  However, that is a whole other conversation.</p> <p>  To be quite frank with Senator McGreehan, I fell in love with people.  I lifted my eyes up a little higher to think about whether there might be something more.  I ended up becoming a mum myself and that wrecked me even more because - and we still laugh at this as a family - when I was driving my kids, who were 16 and 18 years old, one day they asked me whether they were Catholic or Protestant.  I thought it was wonderful to have moved so much forwards that my kids did not know that.  I am not really into labels, but I would probably label myself as a "neither" in that regard and someone open to being convinced and persuaded either way.  However, when I got out of the little bubble in which I grew up and went down to Donegal, I fell in love with the beaches and the people there.  When I went to Dublin, I wanted the diversity of that city for Belfast.  When I went down to Cork, I also fell in love.  Something in me realised that I may have grown up and identified as British, but I am Irish and I am proud of that.</p> <p>  There is something about working, looking back and thinking that here we are one hundred years after partition.  However, is it not the work of peace and reconciliation to seek to bring together what has been divided?  That is probably where my answer focuses.  The root of my changed perspective is that I fell in love with people.  My kids have also changed me.  I am not sure how we identify.  I have people in my family, and I am talking about people in my close-knit family, who are unionists and that is the bottom line.  I have a daughter who is Irish and she wants to live in Dublin.  I have another daughter who probably identifies with the Alliance Party.  Therefore, we are just this great mixed bunch and I think that is an example of many people here in Northern Ireland.  There is something about hearing other people&rsquo;s stories.  I want to make this clear.  I commend the Government, in respect of wanting to build bridges with neighbours, on acknowledging the passing of Prince Philip.  Simple things like flying the flag at half-mast reach out to our unionist neighbours.</p> <p>  Turning to the question from Senator Blaney, we can often break ourselves wondering how we can get unionists to the table.  We must shine the light on a different question, which is not whether people want a united Ireland.  That question may very well come in a border poll at some stage.  However, the question now is let us consider that we may be bigger than the UK, and that the other option on the table is that we may be part of an all-Ireland entity.  That is the invitation to unionists.  Unionists cannot be asked to be part of something they do not want.  However, it is possible to ask them to build the case regarding why they are better off in the UK and what that means to them as a people.  When it then comes to the time for a border poll, unlike Brexit, people will be going to that poll having been informed.  Politicians will share their visions and raise the flag for what they believe is best, and that includes unionists, nationalists, the Alliance Party and all sorts of parties.  The people will then decide.</p> <p>  A better question, however, which is the question we pitched to those children, is what do they dream of as being our future.  What does such a future look like?  Cases can then begin to be built for the UK and for a new island.  It is also important to say that we would not expect those who are champions of the UK to be part of the Scottish conversation on independence.  We would not expect representatives of the Scottish National Party, SNP, to be at conversations concerning championing the UK.   We would expect a case to be built for such arguments, and that is all that this is.  I see myself as extending the vision beyond Northern Ireland being part of the UK.  I refer to the possibility that what may be best for us is to join up with the South.  I am up for that.</p> <p>  I love everything about the whole island, including the freedom to be able to have those 12 July celebrations and go to bonfires.  It would be great if Ireland embraced all of that as an island and recognised 12 July as an all-island celebration and as a holiday.  I think there are ways in which we can work together but the starting place is how we can make our home better.  I hope I have answered the question from Senator McGreehan but let us grab a coffee and I will share more about the road to Damascus.</p></speech>

I will pick up on a point Deputy Brendan Smith made about the Civic Forum.  This is an aspect that I have raised, and I note people like Emma DeSouza fly the flag for the Civic Forum.  To me, it is just a gaping hole in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  That agreement belongs to everybody and mechanisms were put in place to ensure that politics left nobody behind.  Unfortunately, however, we have seen how politics has left people behind, particularly in the loyalist communities.  Therefore, I am very much on the same page as Deputy Brendan Smith in respect of ensuring that the Civic Forum is progressed.</p> <p>  I refer not only to the Civic Forum, but also to the North-South consultative forum.  There have been moves regarding the forums in the New Decade, New Approach document but there is no better time than right now to set up those forums.  I refer to looking at the economic opportunities that are there for the taking by the North in respect of having access to the British internal market and the European market.  The North-South consultative forum would be a very valuable place for businesses to engage regarding the all-island economy and for the Northern businesses as well.  We are absolutely on the same page in that regard.</p> <p>  I look forward to meeting again over the summer in more face-to-face forums when opportunities arise as Covid-19 lifts and we are all able to get out and about more as we, collectively, are part of this bigger conversation about the future.  I reiterate that I am in favour of a citizen's assembly but the issue for me in this regard is timing and getting that right.</p><p> The witnesses' organisation is set up to advocate, promote and hold important discussions about Ireland's future, including the possibility and viability of new constitutional arrangements on the island of Ireland.  The organisation has people within it who have different views about timing and urgency.  I presume that they accept that.  It is a good thing.</p><p> Regarding the shared island unit, much of the Government's emphasis is on multilateral action and seeking consensus rather than pursuing unilateral action.  Do the witnesses see the benefits of the shared island unit as a good approach to getting more people involved in this conversation in a positive way?  While we believe that a citizens' assembly is the way to bring about constitutional change, it is important to get the timing right.</p></speech>

I was struck by the Deputy's description of the political architecture of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is right to say that this is an important feature of the Good Friday Agreement that has not been given expression, and we are all the lesser for it.  In short, we are in favour of the inception of a tangible and meaningful civic forum, but it should be as well as rather than instead of the citizens' assembly, which we have advocated for.  They would address two discrete and different sets of relationship, but they could complement each another.<br/><br/>Regarding the political architecture, a quote came to mind about international law, namely, <i>pacta sunt servanda</i>, or agreements must be kept.  That is a fundamental principle in international diplomatic relations and law.  It is a regrettable fact that several aspects of political agreements over the years have been left unexecuted, as it were, for example, an Acht na Gaeilge.  We are 500 days on from New Decade, New Approach, 15 years on from the St. Andrews Agreement and 23 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, all of which made explicit and express affirmations in respect of Irish language legislation.  In terms of citizenship and the architecture of the state, it has been argued in court twice that the Good Friday Agreement is not binding on the courts or the British Government.  We have also seen that expression used in judicial review proceedings taken by a parent who had chosen an Irish route of education for his or her child and applied to Col&aacute;iste Feirste.  The Northern Ireland Department of Education attempted to persuade the court that the Good Friday Agreement was advisory rather than binding.  Obviously, and rightly, the court dismissed that argument.  We have had agreements on how to resolve the legacy of our past, for example, the Stormont House Agreement, but we still do not have an historical inquiries unit, HIU.  The matter was addressed more generally in the UK Supreme Court yesterday.  Perhaps most egregiously, we have had a Secretary of State express his intention to break international law in terms of Brexit, which is an issue that continues to vex the G7.  The political architecture is important, but it is also important to consider it in a wider context, the overriding fundamental principle being that agreements are all well and good, but they are no good if they are not abided by.<br/><br/>Deputy Brendan Smith was right to bring to our attention the utility and good auspices of a civic forum, and I would welcome the inception of such a forum, but it should be as well as rather than instead of our call, which is to promote an all-island dialogue on the exclusive issue of the potential constitutional change on our island.</p></speech>

What we have seen with the Erasmus+ programme post Brexit has been interesting.  The funding committed to in order to continue it was positive.  The education system in the South is evolving, as it is in the North, for example, the issue of patronage in the South.  A much wider discussion on what education might look like probably needs to happen, but it could be held as part of a citizens' assembly-type forum in consultation with the students themselves and their parents.</p> <p>  Regarding Senator Currie's comments, the shared island unit is a great initiative and the Government's commitment to funding it is important.  The Senator also spoke about timing.  We are all in agreement that timing is key.  As we outlined, though, many of these conversations are already happening and public opinion has been shifting.  As the Senator knows, it will take a great deal of time to get the structure of a citizens' assembly right, for example, who will be the chairperson and how to include all citizens and voices.  There is nothing to stop us starting the preparations for the assembly now.  With previous assemblies, issues have not necessarily been acted on straight away.  If there was a recommendation from this citizens' assembly for a border poll, it might not occur immediately.  It would be up to politicians to decide what would happen with a recommendation.</p></speech>

Throughout the document, it is stated that, if unionists do not come to the table, we should proceed.  What are Ms Harmon's thoughts on how we can try as best as possible to make them part of the conversation?  There is an emphasis in the document on politicians being part of this.</p><p>How would Ms Harmon see that being managed?</p></speech>

Some of my colleagues may wish to come in on this.  In terms of managing it, however, first and foremost, we need to make sure that whatever process we are setting up is as inclusive as possible in respect of all communities and that the invitation is sent out on any dialogue we have.  Ireland's Future is deeply conscious that the schedule of events we are planning is as inclusive of all voices as possible and brings everybody to the table.  Everyone's voice is as important as the next as part of this discussion.</p> <p>  As we said, it is about a shared future and a shared Ireland.  There is no right or wrong answer when we are having these discussions on how we do that and construct an assembly.  It will be important to ensure those mechanisms are in place for submissions and presentations to occur as part of that process.  As we discussed earlier, there is also scope to ensure that different groups are represented as part of this committee and that different entities are invited to make presentations on their views on the issue and how it should progress.</p></speech>

What was being attempted and what happened at the previous meeting was unbecoming of Oireachtas members.</p> <p>  Now, to get on to the serious business of this committee and put questions to people who are in the business of building relationships in the North of Ireland about the work they are doing.  I thank Reverend Karen for her thoughtful and excellent contributions thus far and at previous meetings of this committee.  I believe it is important, particularly for people in the South - in the Twenty-six Counties - to understand that when we talk about unionism, it is a broad church in the North.  It is not all DUP voters.  And also, many people who vote DUP do so because they want to remain within the United Kingdom.  They do not necessarily agree with that party and all its different points of view, however.  It is very complicated and multifaceted.  Perhaps Reverend Karen could talk more about the engagements Ireland's Future is having with the unionist and loyalist community in the North and also about the multiple layers.  She described the layers and colours in her own family.  I believe that is a healthy thing in a healthy democratic society.  I hope to see more of that in the new Ireland I intend to be a part of.</p> <p>  If we could deal with that issue, it would really cover it.  Again, I want to put on record how angry I was when I read the comments of what happened at the previous meeting, and how pleased I am to hear that the Cathaoirleach made it clear that this person does not in any way reflect the views of the cross-party Good Friday Agreement party in the Oireachtas.  I congratulate all three witnesses, who are respected people in their own right, on the excellent work they are doing.</p></speech>

She accepts the acknowledgment that she is not nor has that organisation been involved in any political activity as such.  I want to make that exceptionally clear.  If the Deputy was here earlier, he would have heard that.  I say that by way of being factual.  Is there another Sinn F&eacute;in speaker before we get replies from our witnesses?</p></speech>

I was listening in a busy party room.  They will just have to hear it now.</p><p>As I am conscious that I made a few points at the previous meeting, I will not eat into the time too much.  Like other colleagues, I want to take the opportunity to welcome our guests back and to thank them for what has been a much more thoughtful and respectful engagement and dialogue.</p><p> I watched Michael Portillo's documentary last night.  I do not know if anyone else saw it but it was a documentary on partition and the centenary of same.  It concluded with Gerry Adams making the point to Michael Portillo, a former Tory Secretary of State, that the key way to build peace is through dialogue.  That is the key ingredient and the core component.  That is why the work of this committee and of Ireland's Future are so important and why the broad range of engagements, conversations and dialogues it is having are so important.</p><p> I made a point at the last committee meeting and I would be keen to get the visitors' views on it.  I stated that in many ways, large parts of society were ahead of us in terms of the clear call for Government to respond to the need to prepare for constitutional change.  Some colleagues took issue with that point and that is fair enough; they are entitled to do so.  I will ask this question of our guests, because we ultimately ask it of all our guests at the committees; if they had one request of the committee in terms of what it can do and should be doing on this issue of promoting dialogue and a citizens' assembly going forward, what would that be?  We have had citizens' assemblies before on issues that would have appeared to be contentious, intractable and fundamental and nobody said we could not have a citizens' assembly because an issue was too sensitive.  Maybe that was said at the beginning but it ultimately came to the point where society led matters to a position where that reality could no longer be denied.  I would love to get the views of the witnesses on that and to hear what they think we can do going forward from these worthwhile and useful engagements.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on what Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said about what our request might be and to pick up a theme that Reverend Karen addressed in her opening statement.</p> <p>  I also did not get the opportunity to respond to Senator Blaney when he asked what more we can do.  There is more that we can do, we will endeavour to do that and we will keep doing our best.  All anyone in life can do is one's best.  I would ask the committee to do its best.  This is not wholly and exclusively the purview of Ireland's Future.  We are a responsible contributing voice to the conversation but in terms of building bridges and relationships with our neighbours, friends, work colleagues in the North, there is a responsibility on everybody on this island and on the elected representatives on this committee to listen and to invite them in.</p> <p>  Reverend Karen made some suggestions, such as Union NI and Stronger Together Northern Ireland.  The committee should bring them in and listen to them but more importantly, members should tell them that they want them to be a part of our island, that they are valued citizens and that they are an entity which can make everybody's opportunities on this island better.  That is not an overture that is often heard.  There should be no frostiness but a clear, concise and direct message that we want them and that we want this island to be better together.  My ears are open to anybody who wants to make an argument to the contrary but that is not a message which often resonates in the ears of our unionist friends in the North from the South; that the South wants them.  That is one respectful suggestion I have and I will have over to Reverend Karen to conclude our contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Reverend Karen Sethuraman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021061500002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee regarding our guise as Sinn F&eacute;in and for their welcome and I again thank the Chairman for handling the situation with grace.  We wholly accept that, in terms of comments that were made.</p> <p>  I know that someone mentioned that people are moving away from the DUP.  I do not want to get into politics in that sense but I mentioned earlier that in my heart, I regard myself as being in the middle ground and that I would classify myself as a "neither".  A lot of people are moving away from the two-community distinction because we are more than two communities.  We need to lead outside of that box.</p> <p>  I am interested in the unheard, the silent majority, the "neithers", those in the middle ground and the ones who want to bring change and who dare to dream of something different.  A lot of us have shifted into that place.  I said the last time that it is a bit sad that the media only portray certain voices.  That is why opportunities such as this are key and critical.  One gets to hear other people and one gets to hear the voices of children that I shared earlier.  Those are the sorts of voices around which we need to build the vision of a better future together.  That is important.  If we focus on the minority, then the alternative is that we remain where we are.  I do not want to remain where we are; I want to move forward and I long to bring people with us.  As Mr. Murphy has said, we will engage with everybody and anybody.  I will seek and endeavour to continue to hold those kitchen-table conversations and at every opportunity feed back to the committee, like I did for those 100 young people from all backgrounds, in order that we can hear that there are other voices that deserve to be heard.</p> <p>  This is our home and that is our starting place.  I have said this many times.  The starting place is not to set out what we would like it to be and that we would like to include people in that.  The starting place is that this is already our home.  Nobody is an addition and we are more than two communities.  We owe it to those children and the generations that come behind us to pass something better on.  One of those young kids said that she did not want to grow up in what her parents had to go through.  She is the voice of the majority and of everybody who is present here.  Therefore, I plead that the committee does not focus in on what we must have but that members understand that there is a majority of people who are open to this and that these conversations are already taking place.</p> <p>  That takes me to my request, which Mr. Murphy addressed, and that is that we get to the next step.  Conversations have been happening for quite some time and the next step is the support of the committee to set up the citizens' assembly that provides structure for these conversations.  Let us remember that there are other organisations such as the SDLP's new Ireland commission, the shared island unit or Think32, which has been holding podcasts with our unionist friends.  There are other people besides us and we are all doing this together.  I do not join things but I signed up to this because I believe in passing on a better future and a home for all of us.  Opportunities like this are brilliant, therefore.  Having the place to be able to hear the groups we mentioned that are championing the UK, to hear their voices and to hear their vision for being part of a United Kingdom is important.  Our role as Ireland's Future is to continually reach out the hand of friendship.  We would want to reassure everyone that this is what we are doing.  We are working in the background and meetings have been organised throughout the year, beginning in the autumn, in places across this island.  I would encourage people to come along, pull up a chair and listen.</p><p>We are better when we work towards holding on to everything we have for a peaceful and better future.</p></speech>

I will move amendment No. 141 and discuss that as it is purely a technical amendment.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 139 and 140, as tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould and as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has explained, seek to include a reference to "public".  I genuinely do not believe this is required and I do not intend to accept these amendments.</p> <p>  Section 48 deals with the establishment and operation of the register of relevant public land.  That is there already.  The Deputy is just seeking to rename that to a public register of relevant public land.  I do not consider the amendment to be required, although I remain to be convinced.  I am happy if Deputy &Oacute; Broin wishes to come back for some particular reason.  It is not the title of the register that will determine that it will be a publicly available register but rather the provisions that are already in section 48(5), which provides that, "The Register shall be published and made available for inspection by the Agency on its website."</p><p>It will be a public register and that is important.  The LDA has already commenced work on the register, as we all know.  A prototype is available on its website but more work is required.  The development of the register is a priority and it has to be, as I have said to the LDA.  It is important that there is full public oversight.  I assure all Deputies, particularly the Deputies who tabled this amendment, that a register will be publicly available for use by all and at all times.  I completely agree that the register is a vital tool for the LDA and the Government to identify all relevant public lands; that is, lands owned by relevant public bodies in areas with populations greater than 10,000, as we understand.  I think we are all clear on that.  The register will detail land such owned by the Office of Public Works, OPW, Departments, local authorities and all other State bodies, including commercial State bodies.</p><p> The register will be used to identify public lands.  If they are not sold, they will have an affordability requirement attached to them under the legislation, which is really important too.  This will ensure that regardless of whether the land is being developed by the LDA or another developer, there will be a requirement to provide 50% affordable housing, at least in certain areas.  We will deal with other changes to that next week.  I intend to increase that further - above 50% - in other areas.  The register will be used by the LDA to report to the Government on the use of public land.  We really need that.  We need to ensure there is full visibility and full oversight.  In order to ensure the register is as complete as possible, public bodies will be required to co-operate with the LDA, and the LDA will be able to request information from such bodies in terms of all relevant public lands they have.  Unless Deputy &Oacute; Broin believes we have missed something, I am happy to listen.  It is important that we focus on what the register does as opposed to what it is named, and I think we have been incredibly clear on that in section 48.</p><p> Amendment No. 141 is purely a technical amendment and corrects an editing error in section 48(3) by replacing the word "on" with "in".  The phrase "entered on the Register" has been changed to "entered in the Register".  This amendment does not in any way change the intent of the provision and simply corrects a drafting error.</p></speech>

My amendment removes the reference to &quot;a member of a relevant public body;&quot; from section 49(1) as it has been brought to my attention that the inclusion of this provision would include board members of State bodies or the elected members of local authorities like councillors.  It was genuinely not the intention of this legislation to provide for this.  I am happy to amend that today to provide that it is only the staff of the relevant public bodies who will be obliged to co-operate and assist the LDA, and rightly so.  Members of the relevant public bodies - I am thinking of councillors here - will have no direct role.  In particular, it had not been intended that local authority members would have been included in this provision given their separate constitutional and non-executive role as members of local authorities.</p></speech>

I am glad he has clarified that this part of the Bill was not aimed at the elected members of local authorities.  I am concerned that the Minister's amendment will not achieve that explicitly.  While it takes out the reference to "a member of a relevant public body", section 49(1) is then left ambiguous in terms of whether it applies to members as well as staff of "a relevant public body".</p> <p>  While the Minister's amendment is well intended, it does not make it explicitly clear that elected members of local authorities are not covered and that section 49 does not relate to them.  Therefore, the legislation will be left ambiguous.  My amendment and the amendment tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould are better because they specify that elected members of local authorities will not be directed to co-operate.  That is important because one cannot have a situation where elected members of local authorities are under a legal obligation to co-operate with the LDA.  Of course co-operation is a good thing but members of local authorities must not be legally obliged to do so because there are times when they may, within their rights, decide on a different course of action, and the correct one, from the one being proposed by the LDA.  Members of local authorities must explicitly be exempt from this rather than what is in the Minister's amendment, which leaves it unspecified.  I agree with the points made by the Minister but I am not sure his amendment will explicitly exclude elected local authority members or councillors from this provision.  I am concerned that it will, at best, create ambiguity.</p></speech>

This is also an amendment that has been tabled by the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG.  Other than the amendment that the Minister has just tabled, which correctly dealt with that issue, we have not agreed any of the other AILG amendments to date.  One has been referred back and it is important for us to emphasis that this organisation represents the vast majority of our elected councillors from all political parties and none.  When it is asking the committee to consider amendments to legislation that affects their area of responsibility, we should take those amendments seriously.</p><p>This is a straightforward amendment.  It is trying to reassert the primacy of the city and county development plans, the local area plans and other statutory plans and byelaws because they are fundamental to good place making and plan making, which have a democratic legitimacy because they are approved by elected members after lengthy statutory processes.  On that basis, I was more than happy to submit and move this amendment by AILG.</p><p>Does the Chairman want the Minister to respond to each of the amendments in this group in turn or will I rattle through the other amendments?</p></speech>

Amendment No. 151 is about asserting the primacy of statutory plans, policies or byelaws made by local authorities in relation to the location on which land is situated, including but not limited to the county or city development and local area plan.  It is a further strengthening of the previous amendment in that regard.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 152 is about the housing needs assessment being prepared by the relevant local authority and that having a key role in determining and shaping the use of land by the Land Development Agency.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 153 and 154 relate to section 50, which mentions laying a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  I always think it is better to have a tight timeframe and therefore I would much prefer 30 days.  I would like that to not just be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas but to also be presented to the relevant Oireachtas committee, which in this instance would be our committee.</p></speech>

I know there are a number of members who would have been councillors with me who went through the last county development plan and a lot of time, effort, energy and commitment goes into those county development and local area plans.  They should be respected because people look to us as elected representatives to represent their views and to do what we feel is best for their area.  There is a real sense of people being let down by the Land Development Agency, strategic housing developments, SHDs, or that type of legislation that usurps the control and power of local councillors and local authorities.  This is an important amendment.</p></speech>

These amendments are technical in nature and provide for the inclusion of a subsidiary designated activity company, DAC, in an number of places in section 50.  We had a series of these earlier in the Bill and this followed feedback I received from both Government and Opposition Members on Second Stage.  The section deals with reports to the Government relating to certain lands and provides that the LDA must report on relevant public land and land owned by the agency.  It was always the intention of this legislation when it was being drafted that the reference to the LDA would also refer to subsidiary DACs but to avoid any doubt at all and taking on board the input and feedback from members, I am moving these amendments to clarify that the LDA must also report on any land owned by a subsidiary DAC.  These amendments are being inserted to provide that particular clarity.</p> <p>  I want to make a couple of point on amendments Nos. 145 and 151 on development plans.  I take the point that is being raised.  The LDA will seek planning permission for its proposed developments via the appropriate procedures under planning and development Acts in a similar way to any other planning applicant.  In making decisions on proposed LDA developments, the planning authority or the board is required to determine that these planning applications are in accordance with the provisions of relevant development plans, local area plans, or strategic development zones, SDZs, that are in force.  I know there have been some issues around SHD, which expires this year as members will know.</p> <p>  A number of LDA developments have been through the planning system to date.  As members may know, Shanganagh Castle in Dublin and St. Kevin's Hospital site in Cork had to take into account the provisions of the county development plans.  All planning authorities provide access to pre-application consultations under this.  Having said that, I understand the point that is being made that it might not be any harm if we were a bit more prescriptive in fully stating that it is subject to the development plans themselves and to other plans.  If Deputies are agreeable, I will endeavour to come back on this on Report Stage.  I want to check those two amendments out in particular.  I will do that and I will come back to Deputies.</p> <p>  I take the point that Deputy Paul Donnelly is making and I have been a councillor myself as well.  Councillors are important.  They have a reserved function to vote on and put together their own county development and local area plans.  That is something I have always been a firm supporter of.  If there is something we can insert to make it abundantly clear that this is the case, I am happy to look at it.  I want to check that there are no unintended consequences.  I do not believe there will be any but if it is acceptable I will take those two amendments away and come back on them specifically on Report Stage.  The Deputy will reserve the right to reintroduce them if he is not happy with what we are coming back with.</p> <p>  Is amendment No. 152 in this grouping as well?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061500002#C01800"><p>I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 152, 153 or 154.  I know what Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gould are referring to in the housing needs demands assessment, HNDA, but the wording there might even be problematic because it might be too prescriptive.  We are doing that.  I would be afraid that if we put that specific wording in, like we have the HNDA rolled out to all our local authorities, that phrase is not consistent with the phrase in amendment No. 152 and could well cause us a problem.  I know what the Deputies are trying to achieve and I do not have an issue with that but it might cause difficulties.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 153 and 154 would just put further requirements on the LDA that are above and beyond what any other agency does.  We discussed at length at a previous hearing how the LDA will be fully answerable to the committee.  It will also have Comptroller and Auditor General oversight and it will have to report to whoever the Minister is at that given time.  This would be providing another layer of reports that have to be laid as well as seeking to put additional provisions in place.</p><p>I am satisfied the provisions in the section are robust enough when it comes to laying any report before the Oireachtas or the Government.  The Oireachtas committee can use the report and call witnesses in that regard, if it so wishes.  The report, prepared by the LDA under this section, is to enable the Government to decide on the use of public lands.  It is what the section relates to.  It is not appropriate that the agency would prepare this report for the Houses of the Oireachtas as it would not have any decision-making powers for the use of relevant public lands and, if required, the disposal of such lands through it.</p><p> It is fully appropriate for a report to be furnished to the Government so it can make the appropriate decisions.  It would be laid before the Oireachtas once the report has been submitted to the Government.  Any decisions that arise from this on the use of public lands must be made by the Government following the report and they will also be laid before the Oireachtas.</p><p> I have dealt with amendment No. 152 so I believe that covers all the amendments in the group.</p></speech>

We will support them.</p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 145, 151 and 152, he seems willing to consider these in the context of a possible Report Stage amendment so I am happy to withdraw them at this stage.  I reserve the right to reintroduce them.</p> <p>  I accept the Minister's point about the wording, "housing needs assessment", and this has been overtaken by the housing need and demand assessment.  Will he consider the inclusion of that as well if he is tabling a Report Stage amendment on this?  It will be such a key tool for determining the local authorities' housing plans.  For the first time we will have an empirical evidence base indicating not only how many homes we need within a local authority over five years but we could have the information down to local electoral area and or in even finer detail.  We will know how many of them should be one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom of four-bedroom properties.  It would be wholly inappropriate if the LDA in its plans to develop public land was not obliged to take into account that evidence base in the same way we expect local authorities, etc., to do so.  Will the Minister give us a quick update on whether the LDA toolkit for local authorities will be ready by the end of the year?  There has been some good progress on that.  I am happy to withdraw those three amendments and reserve the right to reintroduce them.</p> <p>  That leaves the final two amendments in the group.  The functions that the LDA will be given are a little different from other State agencies and more similar to the National Asset Management Agency.  This agency will have control, albeit subject to Government approval, to very large tracts of public land.  Having an additional layer of scrutiny with a report to be sent to the Oireachtas committee would be sensible.  We often complain that simply laying something before the Houses of the Oireachtas or putting it on a website does not bring it to the attention of a busy committee.  Therefore, I will press that amendment.</p> <p>  Likewise, having a timeframe for laying the report is important.  The Government must make its decisions but we would like it to do so in a timely fashion.  I will also press that amendment.</p></speech>

It would certainly not be the norm and I would expect that valuations would be done through the Valuation Office.  In the rare event there was, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, an issue with staffing and something was needed urgently, it is to give the option so we would not have to come back to amend an Act for a very simple process such as this.  As I have said, I would see that in most, if not all, cases the Valuation Office would be used.</p></speech>

Sections 66 and 67 provide that, where the LDA is acquiring land via compulsory purchase order, it can take possession of the land in advance of an acquisition order and would pay compensation to the landowner for the advance possession.  This provision, as drafted, is to provide that the LDA can take possession of a site it is acquiring under Part 7 in advance of the land being vested in it.  Any land that is acquired under Part 7 is being acquired as it was offered to the LDA by the relevant public body or on foot of a Government direction.  The question of compensation does not apply as it is relevant public land and is not being acquired by way of compulsory purchase order.  It is on this basis that I move the amendment today, to provide that the LDA may take early possession of a site it is acquiring under Part 7 but will not have to pay compensation.  There are practical reasons the LDA would seek to get early possession of such sites, particularly where it would need to undertake ground surveys or detailed planning.  These amendments are technical in nature.</p></speech>

I have two small questions for clarification.  Is this for development land or smaller strips of land to access development land in the first instance?

Does this mean there could be occasions where land is being transferred from one State agency to the LDA in which no cost is incurred and, effectively, the land is being transferred for free?  Is this what the Minister is speaking about?  My previous question was on whether we are speaking about large development sites or small ransom strip access pieces of land.</p></speech>

It is where the LDA acquires land under Part 7 in advance of the land being vested in it.  It is in these instances where we would not necessarily envisage compensation at that stage.  We discussed the discounted value in detail earlier.  It is in these instances, whereby it makes sense for the LDA to have possession of the land at an early stage before any payment, for instance, for ground surveys, T tests, P tests or whatever the case may be.  This would not relate just to ransom strips.  I see this as relating to regular sites.  I hope this answers the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 187 is also one of the AILG's amendments.  It is a very specific provision whereby if the LDA intends to sell land that has originally been acquired from a local authority, it should be offered for purchase back to the local authority either at the prevailing market price paid to the local authority at the original acquisition or the original acquisition price, whichever is lower.</p> <p>  While one would not expect this to be a standard practice, it is a very important safeguard, in particular when the LDA is up and running and given that we do not know the future composition of Government.  There might be a different Government with a different policy complexion.  Therefore, we need to ensure that whenever decisions are being made to potentially sell on valuable local authority land or land that was originally local authority land to the private sector, there are checks and balances.  I will support Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's amendment and will also move amendment No. 187.</p></speech>

There is a view that local authorities are delaying the delivery of social and affordable housing.  Prior to the publication of the Affordable Housing Bill and this Bill, it could have been argued that it was not possible for local authorities to build the kind of public housing on public lands which I believe these Bills will now allow local authorities to do.  Therefore, the full toolbox for councillors is now present in terms of having mixed income and tenure and well planned communities.</p> <p>  The decision to remove the power of disposal from local authority members will not be required.  It is often the intransigence of officials to bring forward proposals that is the real delay.  We have talked about amendments to this Bill in terms of targets for local authorities.  In my amendment I am trying to find a way for councillors to express their desire to develop plans, and in that case it would not be possible for the LDA to take that land without their approval. </p> <p>  The power of disposal is often a leveraging and negotiation power which local authorities use to get good planning decisions or compromises in a development.  I have said that where section 118 of the 2000 Act is enforced, in other words, where a local area plan has been put in place by local authority the lands subject to that section could not be disposed of without disposal by councillors.  I am open to another mechanism that the Minister may have to do that, but even in places that have a higher population than small town centres we need to protect the right of councillors in their desire to develop land without that being taken from them without their approval.</p></speech>

There is a balancing act between ensuring that the LDA achieves its objective of delivering housing on appropriate State-owned land while also ensuring that publicly elected councillors retain their section 183 authority to determine what should happen on State owned land.</p> <p>  Our counsellors and the leadership teams of councils are best placed to determine the needs of their local communities and what a site in their area should be used for.  The housing demands needs assessment will give councillors the data they need to be able to make informed decisions on what their local community needs from a housing perspective.  Their views on the best use of council-owned sites still need to be taken into account. </p> <p>  A population clause in the Bill could, for example, mean that in a town with a population of under 30,000 people councillors would determine what happens on council-owned sites and the LDA would have the final authority on sites if councillors cannot agree a use for them in more populous areas.  That would be a good solution because the demand for housing is likely to be greatest in more highly populated areas.  This would represent a compromise and would achieve the objective of delivering homes on appropriate State-owned lands while responding to the concerns of councillors highlighted to us through representative organisations like LAMA and the AILG.  Like Deputy McAuliffe, I am open to another solution if the Minister has one.</p><p>It is important that we balance the needs of the LDA with the democratic rights of councillors.</p></speech>

On a general point, it is important to remember that the vast majority of both social and affordable homes will continue to be delivered by local authorities.  That is why we are tooling them up to do that.  That is why we gave them the largest housing budget in the history of the State.  We will continue to drive that on by giving them additional resources, which I announced last week, around the project management area, quantity surveying experience and beefing up their housing delivery teams.  The LDA will deliver in excess of that.  It will supplement, not supplant.  We must be clear on that and reinforce it.</p> <p>  There is no question that a big bad commercial entity is going to come in and gobble up council land that has been identified for housing.  That is not the case at all.  If anything, the Government is trying to get councils to deliver that more quickly.  I brought in the single-stage approval process to be able to push that on.  We are looking to amend that further to get councils back doing what they were good at.  They have started to do that, even leaving Covid aside, by building their own developments.  They will deliver direct-build affordable housing as well.  Members have seen many of the sites I visited with Government colleagues recently.  That is the context of this debate.</p> <p>  We are looking here at the instances in which it would be appropriate for the LDA to develop that land.  We have seen in Shanganagh Castle, for argument's sake, that is can be done in partnership with the local authority.  That will happen with the LDA on some of the larger sites when cost rental and other housing is being delivered.  I have seen that happen.  I wanted to make those general points first before dealing with the amendments because they are relevant to what the LDA is about.  Some previous amendments at this committee were proposed because people did not want the LDA to be involved in residential development at all, which is baffling.  If we have State-owned land that is non-local authority land, which is the bulk of what the LDA is going to work with, this Government and I want to see those lands put to productive use to deliver affordable housing, social housing and cost-rental housing for people at scale.  We must do this.  We all know of sites throughout the country, for example in our regional cities, that have been sat on by State bodies and have not been used.  In some instances, council sites that have been identified for housing have been run into the ground for 20 years because of indeterminate arguments, going back and forth.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis, which means we must deliver more homes.  We must do things differently to make sure we get that supply up.</p> <p>  In relation to the specific amendments before the committee, Deputy Duncan Smith is not here to move amendment No. 185.</p> <p>  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 186 and 187 because they seek to provide in section 55 that the LDA would require the consent of the Oireachtas to dispose of land rather than by ministerial consent, as is currently drafted.  It is not appropriate that the Oireachtas would replace the obligations of Ministers in this provision.  I do not think any future Minister would agree with this.  We can imagine the potential additional delays in getting homes developed.  We have seen that at local authority level.  The last thing I want is to see that happening with a new agency.  The Minister with responsibility for housing and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be the shareholders of the LDA.  There is no provision for any other shareholder.  It is wholly appropriate that the Ministers, as shareholders and as Ministers of the Government, rather than the Oireachtas, would have to consent to the disposal of land by a commercial State body.  The ministerial consent requirements are consistent with the existing procedures under Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circulars for the disposal of State assists.  They are consistent with all other State agencies, as well as the ministerial consent which is required under the State Property Act.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 187 seeks to introduce a further amendment to section 55.  It proposes that land which was previously acquired from a local authority and is being disposed of by the LDA "shall be offered for purchase to the local authority at the prevailing market price or the price paid to the local authority at original acquisition, whichever is the lower".  I cannot accept this amendment because it does not serve any purpose, in that a local authority would offer land for sale to the LDA after it had already decided to dispose of the land.  The LDA will only acquire such land where it considers the land is suitable for development under the legislation.  I do not envisage a scenario where a local authority would want to have first refusal to purchase back land it had decided to dispose of.  If one were to think about it this way, we have ensured through this Bill that other State agencies will have to offer land to the LDA first.  That is the position in relation to disposal of lands.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 188 and 189, as tabled by Deputies McAuliffe and Higgins, seek to amend section 56, which relates to arrangements regarding the disposal of land by a local authority to the LDA, to provide that it will only apply to land zoned for housing.  Amendment No. 189 looks at larger urban areas.  I am giving these amendments close consideration.  At this stage, I am not in a position to accept them but I am looking at whether section 183 of the 2001 Act may only apply if it is land that is not designated or zoned for housing.  It would apply in that instance.  I see this as an extremely rare scenario.  Land zoned for housing that has not been used by a local authority - we do not envisage that being the case &ndash; would not be subject to section 183.  I will work through some of these suggestions, taking account of the feedback received from Opposition and Government Deputies, and indeed our colleagues in local government, to see whether we can fine-tune this some more.</p> <p>  There is a very good reason for this.  Members of the Oireachtas, in opposition or in government, cannot continue to countenance the adding of further delay upon delay on specific sites that are there.  We must do things differently to deliver at least 33,000 homes a year, both public and private, which is what the ESRI based its research that I commissioned on.  That is what we must achieve, but we are way off that figure.  That is why we need the LDA to develop and manage State-owned land that is not being used productively.  I reiterate that the local authorities will still be the main deliverer and provider of social and affordable housing, so much so that I gave approval last week for local authorities to acquire more lands.  I changed the way the recoupment of costs for land purchased by local authorities is done.  I held four housing summits last week with all chief executive officers across the country.  I advised them and issued a letter in that regard.  They are aware that when local authorities are short on land banks, which many of them are, and after the next few years they will be short because of what they are doing, they are to get back out and acquire land.  We need that.  I asking them to acquire land in order that they can build public homes on public land and build affordable homes on affordable land.  If we say to local authorities that we want them to buy more land, and the Government gives them the funds to do that and asks them to do it, as sure as hell they are not going to be taking it away on the other side.  We want the LDA to develop and provide homes on land that has not been used productively.  I wanted to give this context because it is important.  There are aspects of this that I am looking at and will come back to on Report Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061500002#H00600"><p>I wish to reply to the Minister in regard to amendment No. 187.  The fundamental disagreement here is that I do not believe one or two Ministers should have the authority to decide whether considerable tracts of public land should be sold, including to private actors.</p><p>One of the great values of the section 183 process in local authorities, to which I will come in a moment, is that there is a level of democratic accountability and scrutiny of both the substance of the decision and the decision itself.  Land being transferred from a local authority to the LDA, which the LDA could then decide to sell on all or a portion of to a private interest with the approval of one or two Ministers by way of a phone call or email, is not an appropriate way to deal with what is possibly one of our most valuable public assets.  I will, therefore, be pressing the amendment.</p><p> I will speak briefly to amendments Nos. 188 and 189, in the context of having tabled a formal opposition to section 56.  That formal opposition to section 56 has been requested by the Association of Irish Local Government.  In some senses this is one of the most negative elements of this legislation, even if one were in favour of a single centralised State agency to displace councils and develop housing, which is what I believe this will become.  The Minister claims otherwise but we take a different view on where this will go and that is fair enough.  Section 183 has two functions and it is important that the public and other interested parties listening in understand them.</p><p> First, there is a transparency function.  When a local authority is considering transferring any piece of land for residential or commercial development, from a small ransom strip to a large piece of land, the director of development has to publish a report stipulating the purpose of the transfer of the land and the financial return to the local authority.  If that financial return is lower than the market value, the manager must outline the reasons for that.  There are many cases where that might be done because it would improve economic opportunity, create jobs or provide a community dividend, etc.  That public, transparent process is the first function of section 183, which would be lost if section 56 of this Bill goes through.</p><p> The second aspect of section 183 is that the full body of elected members then has to vote on that process.  Therefore, what section 56 of this legislation proposes to do is remove all the transparency and accountability and all the mechanisms by which local authorities outline what to do with what is essentially public land, which belongs to the taxpayers and the wider community.  It would deny elected members a vote.  I do not accept the contention that that is being doing to speed anything up.  Let us look at some of the lands in question.  Shanganagh Castle, for example, was sold by the Department of Justice to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council almost 20 years ago.  The delay in that project was not because the councillors were in any way divided over the development of that land, as Deputy Boyd Barrett will tell us.  He knows better than the rest of us because it is his constituency.  Councillors had been screaming at the Departments responsible for the environment and housing for years to fund the site.  They put what they wanted to see into the local area plan by unanimous vote, which is remarkable but positive.  The Minister's predecessor, Eoghan Murphy, refused to fund it.  The delay of 20 years in Shanganagh is due to central government not providing the funds.</p><p> St. Teresa's Gardens is the same.  Dublin city councillors are agreed on what they want on that site and there is no difficulty in getting councillors to support it.  The difficulty is that, before elected members have even been asked if they want to transfer it to the LDA, it is already up on the LDA's website.  The great tragedy of that is that it will split the cost-rental housing from the social housing.  Dublin City Council will buy back the rented social housing if this project goes to the LDA but the LDA will retain the cost-rental housing.  Then, in 30 or 40 years when the principal loans raised to build those apartments are paid down, it will be the LDA that benefits from the revenue surplus, not Dublin City Council, to which it would be hugely beneficial for recycling back into the maintenance of already underfunded stock.  And so on and so on.  It is never, in my experience, councillors who delay the development of sites.  It is central government not providing the funding.</p><p> The Minister is on record saying he wants to reassert the role of local authorities in the delivery of social and affordable homes.  That is great rhetoric but how he puts his money where his mouth is by giving local authorities the money to deliver that.  Oscar Traynor Road is a perfect example.  By a large majority, councillors have said they want 40% social, 40% affordable cost-rental and 20% affordable sale, not unlike D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did.  Yet, all they are getting from Department officials, according to a report that went to Dublin city councillors, are delays and hurdles.  Let me be very clear: I fully accept their intentions but I do not understand why Deputies McAuliffe and Higgins would seek to amend this section.  It should be scrapped.  It has no place in this Bill.  It undermines local authorities' transparency and accountability and we will be pressing our opposition to this section. </p></speech>

I am also concerned about section 56, which I am formally opposing as well.  There is a significant gap between what the Minister is saying and what the legislation allows for and there is a significant gap between what he is saying and what is actually happening in practice.  The legislation allows for public land and local authority land to be acquired by the Land Development Agency.  Then, if the Land Development Agency does not use that land it can sell it on to a developer or an investment fund purely with ministerial consent.  These sorts of schemes are already happening.  In that situation, there will potentially be private delivery of homes on what was public land and then the council or the State will step back in to take up a long-term lease, which would mean paying an exorbitant cost for 20 years to 25 years.  It is win-win for the investment fund or developer that ends up getting the public land and it comes at a huge cost to the public, the State and local authorities.  That is what is happening now and that is what the Bill allows for.  If our amendments are not accepted and this section is not deleted, that is exactly what is going to happen.  It does not matter what the Minister says about the LDA supplementing, not supplanting, local authorities because the Bill allows the LDA to supplant what local authorities are doing.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that the biggest obstacle to local authorities building social homes is the Department and the Government not providing funding and approval for schemes.  The recent report from the ESRI was damning in that regard.  It stated that the excuses being made about funding not being available are just not true.  It looked at the most conservative financing model it could come up with in terms of what could be drawn down and borrowed at historically low interest rates and, on that basis, it projected that we could easily double the amount of capital spending on social homes to deliver twice the amount of housing.  It was scathing of the current expenditure on private sector subsidies to deliver social housing.  I urge the Minister to read that report in full, if he has not done so.  If he has done so, I urge him to implement it in full and scrap the provisions in the Bill that would allow public land to be sold on to private developers and investment funds.  That is what it allows.  If the Minister is genuinely against that happening, he should amend the Bill to stop it.  It is as simple as that.  Why have these provisions in the Bill if not to keep the door open for that to happen?  That is the critical thing.  With more than 8,000 people living in emergency accommodation and more than 120,000 households on housing waiting lists or in insecure HAP tenancies, we simply cannot afford to continue with this lack of delivery of social and affordable homes.  One sure way of delaying the delivery of the houses we need is to sell off public land to private developers or investment funds that can then sit on it until prices increase or engage in a slow delivery that suits the full market prices they are trying to achieve.  I am now more concerned than ever about this section. </p></speech>

It is the dirty little secret behind the Land Development Agency.  The agency should be about gathering up land that is being sat on by private developers and speculators, or land being held by Departments or State agencies other than local authorities, and ensuring that land is developed for public and genuinely affordable housing.  Instead, we have an agency that is creating the opportunity to sell off public land to investment funds, speculators and private developers.  These are the very people who are responsible for the current housing and homelessness crisis.  There is simply no justification whatsoever for disposing of public land or involving private finance, speculators, developers or investment funds with the public land bank.  In fact, they threaten to undermine any attempt to deliver the public and affordable housing that some of us in opposition have been pointing out for a decade is needed to address this crisis.  This is NAMA part 2, to put it simply.  We warned about NAMA originally.  NAMA should have been used to deliver public and affordable housing but instead it was used to flog off land-----</p></speech>

It is exactly the same policy and will have exactly the same disastrous consequences at a time when we should be moving in precisely the opposite direction.</p> <p>  Shanganagh Castle is proof positive of that.  If the Government had simply provided the local authority, which had signalled its desire to build public housing on that land, with the funds to do so we would have public and affordable housing on the Shanganagh Castle site now.  The funding was not forthcoming because the Government always had a plan, of which the LDA is the culmination, to open up that public land bank, that particular site that was publicly-owned, to private finance and private developers.  The consequence of that is we do not know whether the affordable housing will be affordable.  There has also been a chronic delay in actually delivering anything and a sod being turned on that site.  Why is that?  It is because the Government has involved private financiers in the equation and they must make a profit.  The Government has been trying to square the circle of how to deliver affordable housing on public land and make a profit for private financiers and, of course, it is a very difficult circle to square.  The Government would not have to square it were it not trying to dispose of the land and involve those private, for-profit interests.</p></speech>

I am just concluding on the point that this is the critical section that gives away what is wrong with this Bill.  There is simply no justification from the point of view of finance, as has been confirmed to us by the ESRI, and there is no justification on the basis of efficient delivery of public and affordable housing because doing it in this precise way has led to chronic delays on sites where we could have easily delivered public and affordable housing by now.  The Bill will not do what Deputy Higgins is saying, it will do the opposite and it will mean the affordable housing may well be completely unaffordable.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to specifically clarify it in his reply because the Deputy made a statement of what he believed to be in the Bill and then a conclusion.  His belief is that when land is transferred to a private owner that it will then be sold for open-market sale or for speculation and so on.  It is very clear in this Bill that regardless of who owns the land there is an obligation to build affordable housing on it.  Thus if anything, it is the exact opposite of what Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan have said.  I ask the Minister to clarify, because it is important for the record of the committee, that the purpose of the Bill is to assign the obligation to have affordability on it, rather than allowing a mechanism to make it unaffordable.  It is not a correct for Deputy Cian O'Callaghan to conclude that the Bill will allow land to be sold and then for it to be on the open market to be developed and speculated on.  He is leaving out the most important obligation in the Bill, namely, the permanent obligation, regardless of who owns the land, that only affordable housing may be built on it.  It is really important.  I do not think the Deputy made the point disingenuously, but it is an important thing to clarify that the obligation is permanently assigned to the land regardless of ownership.</p></speech>

I want to mention two things.  We are talking here, and the Minster has talked as well, about local authorities developing lands.  We have a site in Mulhuddart in Dublin 15 called Churchfields which has been delayed for a good number of years on the basis that there is no funding coming from central government and there is no affordable housing.  That was delayed for year after year.  We were crying out for housing to be developed on that land and there is space for more than 1,000 units.</p> <p>  Also, I ask the Minister if on the one hand the Bill is allowing land to be transferred to the LDA while at the same time asking the councils to buy more land?  Surely that is completely and utterly contradictory.</p></speech>

I invite the Minister to respond to the number of points made by Deputies, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021061500002#K02100"><p>A number of points have been made.  We had a clear example there of some of the best in sound bite politics and misrepresentations of the real situation.  That is just a fact.  Throwing out phrases like "dirty little secret" and that type of stuff is not correct, at the end of the day.  I reiterate that where local authorities have decided to dispose of land, they, like other bodies, including commercial bodies, must give first refusal to the LDA before selling to the market.  It is only in these circumstances that section 183 of the Local Government Act would not apply as it is moving land from one public body to another.  Deputy McAuliffe's point is absolute.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan may want to clarify what he said but the reality of it is we have already seen, very recently, schemes that have been funded by my Department, through the serviced sites fund, voted down by the Deputy's party, the Social Democrats, and voted by down by Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Paul Donnelly's party.  That is the proof of the pudding.  That is 1,200 homes gone.  Of those, 238 were to be social, 238 affordable and 150 cost-rental.  They are all gone.</p><p>People will have to make up their minds as to whether they really want unproductively used State-owned lands to remain in that condition with State bodies sitting on them.  I do not want that, and neither does the Government.  The Bill will ensure that it does not happen.  Saying that this measure would be a mechanism to sell off public land to investment funds, developers, speculators and so on - I am quoting - is a sound bite that might play well with some elements of the media and keep people disaffected, but we are concerned with delivering solutions.  Parties are opposing these mechanisms.  They actually opposed the LDA building any homes at all.  Deputies &Oacute; Broin and O'Callaghan went even further and opposed the LDA even planning to build for houses by saying they did not want the master plan.  Let us get real.</p><p> I will consider Report Stage amendments to see whether there can be further changes in this regard, but I firmly believe that we must get on with building affordable and social homes on State-owned lands.  I will table amendments to increase the affordable ratio on those lands further.  I put it to the Deputies who argue against it to set out what they will do.  Will they vote against homes for working people being built on State-owned lands as their parties have done in respect of council-owned lands?</p><p> We all want the State to use its land appropriately and to deliver social and affordable housing.  Some Deputies are not crazy about affordable housing and do not believe in real homeownership, but this Government does.  We want to give people a chance to own their own homes at an affordable rate and we have voted accordingly for it.  That is why definitions of "affordability" are contained in the Affordable Housing Bill, which is a Bill I hope the Members opposite will support.</p><p> I will conclude on my next point because I know time is short, but some serious charges have been made about what the LDA will do.  Deputies &Oacute; Broin, O'Callaghan and Boyd Barrett, people for whom I have personal regard, know better than that.  They do not believe what they are saying, nor should they because they are misrepresenting the facts.  I will not accept their amendments.</p><p> I thank my Government colleagues in respect of amendments Nos. 188 and 189.  I will revert to aspects of the matters raised on Report Stage.</p></speech>

My point is that who delivers homes matters.  If public land is sold to a private developer or investment fund - I did not use the word "speculator"; the Minister used it, although he is right that land could also be sold to speculators - and a certain percentage is to be affordable or social, we know from what is happening now that the affordable housing will be at a higher price, in particular because the private sector has to borrow at a higher cost.  That is a fact.  I looked at one planning application recently where the financing costs were 14% of the total.  That would not be the case with public delivery.  Since the cost is higher, the affordable purchase price - or the rent if the property is cost rental - will be more expensive.  As such, it matters who delivers these affordable homes.  It also matters in the case of social housing.  If public lands owned by a local authority are acquired by the LDA and sold on to a private developer, the local authority or the State could end up leasing the social homes built on them back at an expensive rate.  The local authority building housing directly would be a much better use of resources, as the ESRI pointed out.</p> <p>  Regarding the proposal for 1,200 homes that was voted through in respect of lands in Donabate, I do not agree with the majority of those homes being sold at full market price when they are on public lands.  It is a scandal.  What the-----</p></speech>

We are engaging with stakeholders who made written submissions on the general scheme.  This is the second instalment of our engagement on this matter.  We had a previous engagement about four weeks ago with a number of other witnesses.  I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for chairing that session in my absence.  She is our in-house expert on the topics involved and I thank her for stepping into the breach.  She is also the Vice Chairman of the committee and has a particular expertise and interest in the matter.</p> <p>  Today's witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee from outside the Leinster House precincts.  As per the current fashion, we are holding remote sessions and that is working well on a practical level but there are some limitations.  I welcome the witnesses to the meeting.  We are joined by Mr. Liam Herrick of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. ICCL.  Mr. Herrick is welcome.  His organisation is becoming familiar to the committee and I thank him for his continued input.  We are also joined by Ms Gemma McLoughlin-Burke, also from the ICCL.  I thank Ms McLoughlin-Burke for attending.  She is a procedural rights fellow at the ICCL.  We are also joined by Mr. Kevin Condon, a principal officer from the civil legislation unit in the Department of Justice.  The Department's representatives regularly attend and participate in our meetings.  I thank all involved for being here.</p> <p>  I invite witnesses and members to make sure they unmute their devices when they are addressing the committee so that we can capture the sound.  I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices while not contributing to avoid picking up background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the raise hand function when they wish to contribute.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I advise them of the following regarding parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p>For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present in the committee room would, and I ask them to be mindful of that.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  For members who are participating remotely, I offer the usual advice about keeping their devices on mute until they speak.  They might have their cameras switched on unless they need to turn them off and be mindful that we are in public session.  There is the procedural privilege requirement that because of the constitutional requirement as interpreted by the Houses of the Oireachtas that members must be physically present within the confines of the place, namely, Leinster House, a member cannot participate from outside Leinster House in this session or, indeed, any similar sessions.</p><p> Finally, I remind members that the clock is as always against us.  We have two hours for the session.  That is a decent period but if we run up against the clock, we have a strict cut-off point because of Covid limitations.  I ask members and witnesses to adhere to the subject matter because I will not be able to let the meeting stray too far off the agenda.</p><p> The format of the meeting is that each witness and or organisation will be invited to make an opening statement of approximately five minutes.  Once the opening statements have been delivered, I will call on members of the committee to put their questions or comments to the witnesses and the meeting.  Depending on the time, there may be an opportunity for a second such round.  Effectively, we will have opening statements from the witnesses, we will have questions and comments from members, and we might do one or two rounds depending on time.  As I said, the duration of the meeting is limited.</p><p> I will move on to the witnesses.  I will begin with Mr. Herrick, who has been with us before and who is very welcome back.  I am delighted to have him with us again.  Mr. Herrick has five minutes in which to make his opening comments.</p></speech>

I thank the committee members for inviting us to be with the committee today.  As the Chairman has already indicated, I am joined by my colleague, Ms McLoughlin-Burke, who is procedural rights fellow with the ICCL.</p> <p>  As members of the committee will know, the ICCL is an independent human rights organisation which has played an active role in public discourse on matters of law, policy and human rights since its foundation in 1976.  In particular, our perspective is to ensure that Irish law and practice is compliant and meets the standards of the constitutional rights and the rights set out in international human rights law.  Our founders include the late Kader Asmal, professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, the late Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, a member of the Supreme Court, and Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the administration of justice has been a particular priority issue of the ICCL in its work.  In 2007, we published a report, Justice Matters, which was a comprehensive analysis of the issues of independence and accountability with regard to the Irish judicial system and we have made a number of submissions on the question of judicial reform over recent decades.</p> <p>  The judicial appointments process in Ireland has been a point of contention and controversy in recent years and the ICCL believes that a deficit in formality and transparency in the system has impacted on public confidence in the Judiciary.  In that context, we strongly welcome the proposals in the proposed Bill to introduce clear and transparent criteria by which appointments would be made, and we share the Government's stated objective of promoting diversity and ensuring that the Judiciary is one which is truly representative of the people of Ireland.  Although the ICCL recognises that the proposed Bill marks a significant improvement on the preceding appointment process, we are concerned that some of the provisions fall short of international best practice.  In preparing our submission on the proposed Bill, we relied on and referred to international standards derived from a number of treaties, including international human rights treaties, the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p> <p>  Sorry, I believe there might be somebody speaking.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Herrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairman.  We have also relied on the UN basic principles on the independence of the Judiciary, the Council of Europe recommendations on the independence and efficiency and the role of judges, the European Charter on the statute for judges and the International Principles on the Independence and Accountability of Judges, Lawyers and Prosecutors.  There is a wide range of international standards from which to draw and which can inform the legislation.</p> <p>  On the question of independence and who should constitute the appointing or nominating body, the current proposals recommend that the Chief Justice, two members of the Judicial Council and the president of the court in which the vacancy arises will form part of the commission.  In line with international best practice, the ICCL recommends that the three suggested judicial members of the Commission should be elected by their peers in order to ensure the strongest possible transparency and independence.</p> <p>  The Judiciary must be representative of the society over which it adjudicates.  All appointments should take into account the fundamental importance of ensuring diversity and appropriate representation in the Judiciary.  This should be reflected in the criteria for appointment to all judicial posts.  Broadly speaking, we welcome the approach that is taken in the proposed Bill in this regard.  We recognise, however, that as the Judiciary is drawn from the senior members of both legal professions, it will not be possible to address the objective of achieving diversity without looking at the question of diversity among the senior reaches of the Bar and the solicitors' profession.</p> <p>  The process must be transparent.  The introduction of clear objective criteria based on merit is welcome.  However, the number of recommendations by the commission to the Government should be reduced, in our view, to three for one nomination and five and eight, accordingly.  We believe that we should minimise the discretion of Government in the process to the greatest extent possible to achieve the strongest level of public confidence.  We also believe that there is no justification for a separate process for the appointment of senior officers of the court - the Chief Justice and the presidents of the superior courts.  A separate system for such senior appointments which is more heavily politically dominated, and has a role, for example, for the Attorney General as a voting member, risks undermining the benefit of the general appointment process.</p> <p>  In order for the appointment process to maintain public confidence, there must also be some level of accountability.  Where there are welcome provisions here about a report back to the Oireachtas subsequent to appointments, we believe that where the Government decides to deviate from what is recommended by the Judicial Appointments Commission it should have to give reasons.  We are clearly recommending that the recommendations of the commission should include a ranking of candidates as well as a smaller number which will greatly enhance independence.  It should be noted by the committee that the proposed approach would, in fact, retain a discretion for Government to circumvent the Judicial Appointments Commission completely.  Bearing that in mind, it is very important that we strength the process of the commission.</p> <p>  The ICCL sees the proposed Bill as a radical and hugely welcome opportunity to improve the judicial appointment system process in Ireland.  If approached correctly, these changes can have the potential to enhance public confidence in both the Judiciary and the rule of law.  We make eight recommendations in our detailed submission which we believe can further enhance the approach being taken and we look forward to engaging with the committee and any questions the members might have on our submission.</p></speech>

The judicial appointments commission Bill is currently at an advanced stage of drafting.  The Government approved and published the general scheme of the Bill in December.  It was forwarded to a number of key stakeholders at that time, including the Judiciary and the legal professions, and a number of submissions were received.  I might focus on a number of principles that underpin the provisions in the general scheme.</p> <p>  There was broad acceptance of the need to update the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board arrangements, which were put in place via legislation introduced more than 25 years ago to deal with first-time appointment of judges.  There was also a recognition that the involvement of lay persons in the process should be increased, expanding the experience and knowledge brought to the process of selection.</p><p> There was a need to expand the remit of the advisory body to include promotions, or elevations, of serving judges, which now is addressed under an informal process for the appointment of serving judges.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has no role in this.  In the programme for Government brought forward last year, it was determined that the process of appointing judges for the future should remain under the leadership and guidance of the Chief Justice, and a substantial judicial input in the process is advisable.  To support the new arrangements, the Government agreed that a small dedicated resource be established through an office under the supervision of the commission.  An important further principle, to which the previous speaker referred, was that merit will become the defining criterion for the selection of judges.  This should be expressed in statute, with regard to other key objectives, which the general scheme sets out.  It was also understood that the commission should be enabled to develop statements of judicial skills and attributes, as well as selection procedures, having regard to particular criteria.  This structured approach would allow the commission to further develop the requirements for judicial recommendation and selection.  A further point was that the constitutional position relating to the Government's function of appointing judges be maintained.</p><p> Regarding consultations, a public consultation process was conducted in 2014 focusing on questions relating to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process, independence of the Judiciary and related matters.  The outcome of those consultations is still informing the fabric of the scheme and the earlier forerunner Bill.</p><p> The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which was established on foot of the Court and Court Officers Act 1995, was a landmark development at the time, introducing a new, independent element to the judicial appointments process.  Article 35.1 of the Constitution provides that judges are appointed by the President.  Under Article 13.9, such power is exercisable and performable only on the advice of the Government.</p><p> As members will be aware, a key element underpinning the 2017 Bill, which remains in the general scheme, is the composition of the commission.  A significant change in this scheme compared with the previous Bill is that the Chief Justice will be the chairperson of the new commission and that there will be an equal number of laypersons and judges.  The Attorney General will also be a member.  The board has been chaired since its inception by the Chief Justice of the day and this ensures that the selection process is rigorous and meets the need for a strong, independent Judiciary.  I am sure we will go on to look more closely at the composition of the commission and members may have questions about that.  The lay contribution of the board is an important consideration.  The scheme makes reference to a number of areas of experience and knowledge that it is anticipated lay members appointed to the commission will have.</p><p> A key aspect of this Bill is that all judicial positions are covered.  The Bill replicates the 2017 Bill approach whereby all persons who wish to be considered for appointment to judicial office, including serving judges, will be required to apply to the commission.  At this time, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board deals only with first-time judicial appointments.  For the elevation of serving judges from one court to another, there is no system at all in statute other than the constitutional process.  It would appear that it is no longer sustainable that there is no statutory process in place to address some of the most important appointments to any office in the State.  There is general acceptance that these arrangements should be updated in the manner envisaged in the planned Bill, in the interests of good governance, transparency and accountability.</p></speech>

My first question is for the ICCL but Mr. Condon should feel free to answer if he wishes.  It strikes me that one of the deficits in the arrangements we have had for the past 25 years, since the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was created, is that it appears to act as a sort of Garda vetting mechanism rather than an actual selection vehicle.  People have to go through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and get out the far side to be available for selection but it does not appear to have a role in prioritising, weighting or ranking candidates.  Am I right in saying that?  Within the confines of the constitutional framework, is that something that can be addressed outside of a referendum or would we need to go one step further and change the Constitution?</p></speech>

The Bill should be trying to achieve a shift from a system of vetting, in which candidates are simply excluded if they are unsuitable, to one in which candidates are actively selected and recommended.  I believe that is the intention of the Department in bringing forward this proposal.  Our preference is that the recommendation of the commission include a ranking of candidates in order of preference.  We note that some of the other experts who have been before the committee have also suggested an obligation to actively engage with candidates, including through interviews and so on.  That is an interesting recommendation but we are broadly coming from the same perspective.  We should be moving towards a more active selection and recommendation process.  That is a clear recommendation from our point of view.</p></speech>

We note that in the proposed approach, the Government would retain absolute discretion to appoint judges who are not recommended by this process at all.  In that context, very wide discretion is being retained.  We can only assume that is for constitutional reasons.  It should be possible, however, to establish conventions and norms whereby the vast majority of appointments, if not all, are done through the process.  If that is the case, it should be a rigorous system of selection purely based on merit.  That is our understanding of the approach being taken.  In our view, there is clearly no constitutional difficulty with the proposed scheme because the Government is retaining absolute discretion to appoint judges as it sees fit.</p></speech>

The later heads of the Bill provide for that, for example, by bringing forward quite detailed statements of skills and attributes that potential judges would be required to have, as well as more rigorous selection procedures.  It would be fair to say that that kind of robust approach is not fully reflected in the process that is in place now.  We have no advice that any constitutional change would be required to allow this more rigorous approach to be brought forward in the proposed Bill.</p></speech>

The constitutional arrangement underpinning this, whereby the Government makes the appointment by advising the President to do so, will not be affected by the proposed Bill.

I have two questions that relate to his submission.  I will then move on to other members.  Mr. Condon stated there was, "a recognition that the involvement of laypersons in the process should be increased".  He later said, "There will be an equal number of laypersons and judges".  I presume that means an equal number of laypersons and legal people.  Why is that?  It is an area of quite specialist expertise.  Why would we want to have 50:50 involvement between non-expert and expert, if I can put it that way, in this process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.545" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Condon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#D00200"><p>If one goes back to 1995, it was felt that the process needed to be opened up to people who brought a perspective from business and commerce.  The 1995 Act sets out reasonably minimal criteria for that.  Nevertheless, however, it brought the involvement of three laypeople into what was a board of ten people at the time.  That board, of course, changed to 11 people when the Court of Appeal was established in 2014.</p> <p>  The Chairman will be aware, of course, that there was some question of having a lay majority within the 2017 Bill.  The provisions of the Bill set out a wide range of criteria that Government believes laypeople can bring to the process, whether it is experience of the courts, arbitration and mediation or administration and business.  I believe a wide range of perspectives are required to be captured on a board.  To be clear, the board has nine members.  It is actually an equality of laypersons and judges because there will be four judges and the Attorney General.  There will not, therefore, be a majority of laypersons but an equal number of laypersons and judges.</p> <p>  It is fairly consistent, for want of a better way of putting it, with nearby jurisdictions, which have strong and positive lay involvement.  They certainly tend to have more lay involvement than we have currently under the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board system.</p></speech>

Mr. Condon mentioned the 2017 Bill, on which there was much engagement over the course of the previous D&aacute;il.  Obviously, we are a new committee and a new D&aacute;il.  It is, therefore, a new Bill and we will move forward on that basis.  What were the lessons learned?  What has Mr. Condon carried forward from that?  Has anything been positive?  What is different in this Bill to the previous one?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.547" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Condon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#D00400"><p>At a quick look, in some ways, the scheme is quite similar to the 2017 Bill but there are significant differences.  Members might recall when that Bill was last in the Seanad in December 2019, 59 amendments had to be tabled to get the document right because there were quite a number of inconsistencies in it and so forth.</p> <p>  Clearly, the biggest difference at this point between the Bill that was drawn from this scheme and the old Bill is the composition of the commission and the change to the Chief Justice's chair.  It does not have a lay majority, which was proposed the last time around.  It introduces the Judicial Council as a source of nominees into the Judicial Appointments Commission.  That change alone to the Chief Justice chairing means there are a network of consequential amendments in the Bill, which would probably be a bit too detailed to go into.  They are there, however.  A lot of change is required.</p> <p>  On top of that, we have been looking at a number of other issues.  I believe I am free to say that since the scheme was passed, like any drafting process, a number of things were required to be fleshed out.  Members will probably see some new technical amendments, for example, relating to data processing, and one or two things we were just not seeing in the scheme or that were not in the 2017 Bill.  I believe that when the Bill is published, it will probably look substantially different to the 2017 Bill.</p></speech>

I will move on to the next speaker.  Deputy Martin Kenny had his hand up first.  Senator Ward will be up after Deputy Kenny; he may wish to focus on that.  Deputy Kenny has the floor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.549" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#D00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  I first want to question the role of the Attorney General in all this.  We are mainly trying to get to a situation whereby the Government of the day will, at least, have less influence in setting forward which people would potentially be selected to go on to the Judiciary.  However, the Attorney General would very much be the Government of the day's person on the board.  That, to me, reflects a problem.  If we think about it, that means the Attorney General will be there from the very beginning of the process right through to being at the Cabinet meeting at the very end of the process.  How appropriate is that in the context of trying to bring forward something that is supposed to change the old bad habits of the past?  That is one issue we need to try to deal with.  I would like to hear the views of both contributors on that issue, particularly the specific role of the Attorney General in all this.</p> <p>  Those who are selected by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board at present are very much taken from a wide base of people, which is quite appropriate.  I refer to the procedures it uses to select people to be considered as members of the Judiciary.  I am not sure if we need to have a more succinct and direct set of procedures in place to ensure that is done in a fair and transparent way.  That is really what the public is seeking.</p> <p>  With regard to promotions whereby people will be moving from lower courts to higher courts, etc., how can that measure of merit be put in place?  Again, people would like to understand that is transparent and clear.  I am not sure that is the case in the piece of legislation coming forward.  I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

With regard to the Attorney General, in a sense, the appropriateness is measured against what has been in place since 1995.  The Attorney General has been a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board since 1995.  To some extent, the commission is certainly a development of the board.  In that context, the Attorney General has been retained.  He has been retained on the commission with no vote, however.  The only members on the commission who will be making a definitive call on a person going forward for selection, if it comes to a vote, of course, will be the lay members and judicial members.</p> <p>  With regard to more formalised procedures, a very important part of the scheme requires the commission to bring forward an entirely new set of selection procedures and statement of skills via the procedures committee and publish them, and to consult with whoever it needs, particularly presidents of the courts, to see what the appropriate requirements will be.</p> <p>  One important detail on the Deputy's final point about promotions is that those procedures would allow distinctions or differentiations to be made between different types of procedures that might apply for different types of courts or different classes of business before different courts.  Interview procedures, for example, will be developed and set out in these statements.  Certainly, therefore, a much stronger set of procedures will be known to everybody and published.</p></speech>

That will, therefore, be part of the process.  It will be a requirement and a condition of a person's selection that he or she actually gives an undertaking to take training if requested to do so.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a couple of issues, specifically with regard to what Mr. Herrick said about minimising Government discretion.</p><p>This is not a surprise.  The ICCL has been consistent on that line.  Does Mr. Herrick accept that there is a democratic requirement for an element of Government discretion?  Would he acknowledge that is an important part of the judicial appointments process?  Remarks have been made about bad habits of the past and things like that.  There is substantial evidence to support the notion that we have an excellent Judiciary that is functional, that abides by the rules of law and that delivers fairness, on the whole.  I am not saying that every judge is wonderful.  As a practitioner, I can say they are not.  Overall, however, we have a corpus of judges who are good, reliable and fair.</p><p> Mr. Herrick spoke about giving reasons for deviation from the recommendations of the commission.  In general, I think there is an absolute basis for that but, in practice, there is a real difficulty.  Ranking candidates is all very well but asking the Government to publicly explain why it has chosen one candidate over another will create substantial problems from the point of view, in particular, of the unsuccessful candidate because it results in an official declaration of what the Government sees as the inadequacy of a candidate which could be damaging to that person professionally.  In the whole process of the appointment of judges, the confidentiality of applicants is paramount because many practitioners who are qualified and who would make excellent judges would never apply if they thought applications, particularly unsuccessful applications, were going to be made public because it would massively damage them within their profession and in the context of their ability to continue in their profession.</p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny referred to promotion from lower to higher courts and Mr. Condon has spoken about merit as a criterion.  All of that makes sense but I wonder is that not a tremendously subjective criterion?  There are many fine legal practitioners, solicitors and barristers who turn out not to be very good judges.  While an element of knowledge and experience in the litigation process is extremely important, I wonder can any of our guests tell us what constitutes the definitive criteria for what makes a good judge?  That is a difficult thing on which to settle.  In the past, there has always been a practice not to promote judges from the District Court to the Circuit Court or from the Circuit Court to the High Court because there was a danger that it would incentivise a particular judge to behave in a certain way.  If a judge is focused on promotion rather than doing the right thing or rendering the right decision, it potentially compromises that individual in his or her ability to do the job as opposed to climbing the ladder.  I wonder if our guests have anything to say about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.559" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Herrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#E00200"><p>On the first question asked by the Senator, it is clear that the proposed approach retains an absolute discretion for the Government to make appointments to the bench without any reference to the Judicial Appointments Commission nominations.  It is for the committee and the Oireachtas, ultimately, to decide whether that is constitutionally mandated or not.  There is nothing in our submission that is in any way critical of the quality of the existing Judiciary; far from it.  It is absolutely the case that we have had the benefit in our constitutional history of a strong, independent Judiciary that has acted and exercised its functions with great honour.  That does not mean we should be complacent, however.  We need to be mindful of taking this opportunity to have the most robust and strongest process possible to anticipate all the potential changes that might happen in the future.  In that regard, I think there is nothing inconsistent in saying we have a strong, independent Judiciary now but we can have stronger processes in the future.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny raised the role of the Attorney General in his contribution and that touches on this matter.  There are clear concerns about the Attorney General having any role in the process.  To a large extent, the approach that is proposed by the Government addresses many of those concerns in the general appointment process by the Attorney General having a non-voting role.  However, we are presented with a significant difficulty when we have a separate senior appointment process for the Chief Justice and the presidents of the superior courts.  In those cases, the Attorney General not only retains a role but has a significant voting role as one of three.  That is probably the greatest weakness in the proposed Bill as it is currently presented.</p> <p>  With regard to reasons for deviation, Senator Ward made good points about the requirement for confidentiality.  It would be interesting to explore whether it is possible to balance what we are trying to achieve in terms of accountability with the confidentiality of applicants.  There are two different ways in which the Government may deviate from what is recommended by the commission.  One is to deviate from it in terms of the ranking of candidates which we propose.  A second method of deviation is to circumvent the proposed list entirely.  It is essential that there is some requirement on the Government to explain itself when it takes the latter course and possibly to work out whether it can achieve the ranking of candidates while balancing principles of confidentiality for unsuccessful candidates.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about judicial training and the specific skills that are required of judges.  We must look at the Judicial Council Act and the proposed judicial appointments commission Bill in tandem.  The requirements in place under the Judicial Council Act in terms of ongoing training of the Judiciary will be a great resource to strengthen our Judiciary and allowing it to keep up with contemporary developments.  I do not think that objective will be achieved through the Judicial Appointment Commission Bill alone, it must be considered in tandem with the Judicial Council Act.  We are supportive of what is in the Judicial Council Act.</p></speech>

Much of what I was going to say has already been covered.  I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny that if the independence of the commission is so important for the Government, I find it hard to see how that sits with the inclusion of the Attorney General, who is a member of the Cabinet and has been appointed by the Government of the day, in the decision-making process.</p> <p>  Mr. Herrick stated in his report that the knowledge requirements are inadequate.  I am glad to hear Senator Ward has experienced great judges over the years but, while most of the judges with whom I have dealt over the years were well trained, a few have been inappropriate or inadequately trained.  Should a practitioner have spent a year or two in criminal law before he or she starts to run trials?  Should a practitioner have similar experience in family law before he or she starts to hear family law cases?  I accept the point about ongoing training but just because someone has been a qualified solicitor or barrister for ten years does not necessarily mean that he or she has any idea what is going on in, for example, the criminal courts.  Does Mr. Herrick have any views on what specific training should be required?  One would not go into the commercial court without a knowledge of commercial law.  I heard what Mr. Condon said about a background in business and commerce but we should be exploring the possibility of appointing someone with a background in consumer protection, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the equality commission, or a former prison governor who would have a great understanding of the people who are regularly attending before, for example, the District Court and the Circuit Court.</p></speech>

Do we know where the noise is coming from?  Can Ms McLoughlin-Burke mute her device?  I thank her for that.  The interference was coming from her end.  It seems to have stopped now.  She might be able to figure out what is going on while her device is muted and rejoin the meeting if she is able to sort it out.  I will pass back to Mr. Condon.</p></speech>

They are simply a reflection of the fact the procedures we have are somewhat outdated and need to be brought up to today&rsquo;s standard and best practice, as other contributors have said.  That would be a clear motivation behind the reforms.</p></speech>

In the ICCL's submission, to which Deputy Daly alluded, there are some interesting statistics which show that the Circuit Court and the District Court are the workhorses of the system, with the vast majority of cases going through them.  If I understood the submission correctly, it states that the rules stipulated training and familiarity with procedures for judges of the superior courts.  That recommendation or requirement was not there for, dare I say it, the lower courts.  Perhaps it should be, given the volume of cases coming through.</p></speech>

Whereas the intention is that it is to recognise some specific attributes that might apply for superior courts, the risk is it might convey the sense there is a lower level of qualification and expertise required for the District and Circuit Courts.  There is an argument to be made that procedural expertise and experience may be at least as important in the District and Circuit Courts in light of the large volume of work with which they deal and the pivotal role they play in the overall process.  That is one of the recommendations we are bringing forward for consideration.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Herrick for that response.</p> <p>  I will move on to the next speaker.  Apologies to Ms McLoughlin-Burke.  Her microphone is playing havoc.  This happens to all of us when we are on these sessions.  It is a case of the perils of the demo.  These things happen.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to bring Ms Mcloughlin-Burke in because she is inaudible.  She might stay with us and if in the meantime she manages to figure out what is going on, she can let me know and I will bring her in later on.  Our next speaker is Senator McDowell.</p></speech>

I have one specific question to put to Mr. Condon regarding the scheme of the proposed Bill, which has been worrying me since the last occasions we discussed the general scheme.  It concerns head 9, which deals with the composition of the commission and which effectively states that there will be nine members of the commission. Subhead (1)(b) of head 9 contains the phrase "a Court President being one of the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit court or the President of the District Court, to be determined in accordance with subhead (2)".  Subhead (2) states "The member referred to in subhead (1)(b) shall, for the purpose of the determination of a recommendation by the Commission in respect of a judicial vacancy or vacancies in a court, [be] the President of that Court."  What we have there is a rotating membership to be shared among the presidents of courts.  One problem with this is that the commission has business other than simply considering candidates.  It has to make annual reports, lay down procedures, set out criteria of this various kinds and adopt statements and the like.  I have a major problem with saying that, for instance, the position will be occupied on a kind of rotating basis depending on the recommendatory business that is going on when there is other day-to-day business which has to be carried out by the commission, such as preparing reports for Government or Oireachtas committees, handling its relationship with the chief executive and making decisions on finance, recruitment, etc..  It is not clear how that particular head works if, for example, we cannot say at any one point that Mr. Justice Michael McDowell either is or is not a member of the commission for the purposes of all those ancillary matters.  That is a point I wanted to draw to Mr. Condon's attention.  More work needs to be done to remedy the position in this regard.  I ask Mr. Condon to come back to me on that point.</p> <p>  I echo what Senator Ward said.  When in government, one of the aspects of appointing members of the Judiciary is that it is not always based simply on the individual merits of an individual.  For example, one might decide that the Supreme Court needs to be made more liberal or more conservative, more pro-European or less pro-European, more pro-personal injuries awards being high or pro-personal injuries awards being low or whatever.  In the context of issues on that nature, a diversity of approach and philosophy is something which a properly appointing Government may consider to be a hugely important issue.  If there are three or four people in a row who all have the same view and the Government is of the view that the court is beginning to go in a particular direction and it is not happy with that, it is its democratic function to correct the position by making its own decisions.  We have a simplistic view of merit that one person is better than another on the basis of merit, but we also must have not simply the crude rationale of, say, having people who are representative of the community demographically or whatever else.  In addition, the Government has a very clear duty to ensure that the Supreme Court has a philosophical balance to it which the Government would want to ensure is maintained.</p> <p>  Mr. Condon and Mr. Herrick might grapple with another point I wish to raise.  The Attorney General is a constitutional officer.  He or she is the adviser to the Government on all matters of law.</p><p>It is quite possible for an Attorney General to look at the slate of candidates putting themselves forward for selection and come to the view that a judge-dominated commission is knocking on the head some kinds of people that maybe should have a look in.  One of the problems with the 2017 legislation was there was a bit of intellectual confusion as to whether the Government should know who was applying for jobs.  There was a huge problem with this issue.  The then Minister, Deputy Flanagan, did his best to rescue, from the extremes of Shane Ross's approach to the matter, some degree of common sense that the Government should know, by one means or another, what kind of people are being rejected.  If liberals are being rejected by the Judiciary on a consistent basis, somebody should be in a position to tell the Government that it seems to be replicating itself and that "judgeitis" has descended on the process.  Somebody should be in a position to report to the Government what kind of people are failing to get onto the shortlist.</p><p> The Attorney General has an important role of being the canary in the coalmine and being in a position to tell the Government, for example, that there are five really good solicitors or barristers who are constantly being turned down or that others are being preferred, and that he or she is worried about it.  The only way the Cabinet will be made aware of this is if the Attorney General has some sight of what is happening at the commission.  There is some merit to the Attorney General having this role and I throw that out there for consideration.</p><p> There is another point that arose in the context of the 2017 legislation.  Very frequently, when it is decided to appoint the President of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court or something of that nature, there are consequential knock-on vacancies in the Court of Appeal and the High Court.  One of the problems pointed out to the Minister at the time, Deputy Flanagan, was that there was a very clunky process whereby where a vacancy arises in this way, the entire process has to be started again to go hunting for somebody to fill that vacancy.  What happened when I was around was that three such appointments were made on the same day in a promotional appointment chain.  This is no longer possible because we have to start again and go back to each layer of the cake and conduct interviews for vacancies that arise.  There has to be some flexibility when a vacancy is created.  I really believe there should be a standing invitation to judges to state whether they want to be, for example, on the Court of Appeal.  Those that want to be should be considered as candidates semi-permanently and, likewise, other solicitors and barristers.</p><p> I am unhappy with the idea that the legal profession, which often sees an awful lot more of their colleagues than judges do and see how they really think and hear what they really say over cups of coffee, or over a drink for that matter, and how their brains actually function, very frequently are in a very good position to advise whatever commission we have that Joe or Josephine Bloggs is a bit ropey.  It is a mistake, therefore, to knock out some input from the people who see these colleagues on a daily basis.  The people who have been receiving rude letters from their solicitor or barrister colleagues for 20 years can say that a person is a bit of a header.  A judge might not realise this but it is a very valuable input.  Having served on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, I know that the input from members of the Law Society and the Bar Council was sometimes very important in sounding a warning bell about somebody who looked brilliant on paper to the effect that there was a problem and that the individual in question was not as good as he or she sounded or looked.  There are discretionary issues such as this.</p><p> I throw these ideas out for consideration.  I am particularly worried about head 9.  I cannot understand how the council can have only nine members and that four of them will be rotating all the time.  If the council is supposed to have a continuous corporate existence and is to make decisions about annual reports, hiring extra staff, accepting the recommendations of the chief executive and all the rest of it, who will be a member on a day-to-day basis of the commission?</p></speech>

The Senator will note from our submission that we do not recommend the Attorney General be excluded from participation in the commission.  We do think the provision that he or she be a non-voting member addresses some of the concerns.  There is a separate question, of course, about the potential appointment of an Attorney General as a member of the Judiciary and whether there should be an exclusion, which is a separate question.</p> <p>  The Senator set out very clearly a political and philosophical perspective on the potential role of the Government in the process.  He spoke about the concepts of correcting what might be the philosophical or ideological balance on the court.  I understand this point of view but we could easily counter it.  They are subjective concepts that can also be interpreted as an excess of political input in the process.  Overall, we clearly recommend a curtailment of discretion but a retention of some discretion.  With regard to how this balance is achieved, broadly speaking the approach taken strikes the balance quite well, when it is combined with accountability on the part of the Government once it has made decisions and has responsibility for the commission and how it exercises its functions.</p> <p>  The Senator made the point that it is essential the Government has sight of all persons who apply.  We understand the proposed scheme retains the provision that the Government will have sight of all applicants, which would be an important safeguard against what the Senator has suggested, that the commission tends to go in a particular direction.</p> <p>  On the question of whether the Government might have to start again, a chain is a very important practical concern.  Our understanding, and Mr. Condon might correct me on this, is that the scheme allows for the Government to anticipate a vacancy arising so it can act before the vacancy manifests, which I imagine would happen, for example, when a judge is going to reach retirement age or where the term of office of a senior officeholder expires.</p><p>The scenario outlined by the Senator might not be quite as grim as he depicted.  It might be possible for the Government to act in advance and put the appointment chains in motion before the vacancy would arise.</p><p> The point about the legal profession is well made.  It might be possible to address that in how the criteria for lay members might be set by the Public Appointments Service, for example, and whether there would be requirements for legal professional expertise within those criteria.  We note the comments made by the Bar Council and the Law Society in that regard but, overall, we think the balance is quite well struck as it is.</p><p> When we speak of diversity it relates to the profound problem of a lack of representativeness in the legal professions.  This was manifested as recently as yesterday with appointments to the inner Bar, for example, where, in the solicitors' profession, five women were appointed as opposed to nine men, and, on the Bar side, it was five women as opposed to 20 men.  There are problems with diversity even when it comes to the question of gender, not to mention, as matters stand, other questions of diversity.  It is appropriate that this proposed Bill would be used to try to address the issue, but it will not be possible to do so without also looking deeper into the processes and structures within the professions.</p></speech>

On his final point, gender imbalance on the courts has been substantially remedied by political intervention since 2011.  That is notwithstanding what he said about the professions - a point well made, particularly when we look at the proportion of women becoming senior counsels every year.  However, there was political intervention to rebalance that in the courts.  The big concern with a judicially dominated structure, such as the one we are talking about, is the threat of judicial self-selection.  At our previous meeting, we talked about the great Australian judge, Michael Kirby, who was the first openly gay judge and who said he would never have been selected by his peers at that time.  That was such an important statement and intervention.</p> <p>  I have six questions.  I am happy to break them up and come back in, whatever is best.  The first and most important, particularly for the committee and the record, is the question of independence and best practice.  Mr. Herrick, in his submission, states that Ireland is adopting something that is less than best practice.  The inference is that it is compromising judicial independence in some way.  Can Mr. Herrick talk me through what the logic of that is before I ask my question?</p></speech>

Mr. Herrick states at the beginning of his full submission: "At present, the judicial appointments system in Ireland does not align with best practice as outlined by international instruments on the independence of the judiciary."  That is a big statement from the ICCL, which, as Mr. Herrick and I have discussed several times, I regard as an important institution for this State.  That is a really crucial statement made by him and his organisation about the functionality of the courts and how people view that functionality.  Can Mr. Herrick talk me through that before I ask my question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.589" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Herrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#H00500"><p>As I said the outset, in preparing the submission we made to the committee in March, we looked to a number of international standards.  These were specifically: UN basic principles on the independence of the Judiciary; the Council of Europe recommendation on the independence, efficiency and the role of judges, the European Charter on the statute for judges; and the principles on the independence and accountability of judges set out by the International Commission of Jurists, a well-regarded international non-governmental organisation.  We drew from those, so when we talk about best practice we are talking about existing standards.  To give examples, the UN basic principles refer to standards applying to the promotion and careers of judges, as well as their appointments being better dealt with by a selection body, at least half the membership of which should comprise members of the judiciary.  There is also reference in some of the standards to a preference for the judicial members of such a body to be elected by their peers.  That is where we are drawing it from.  As the Deputy knows, any recommendations we bring before the committee on any matter will be grounded on, and derived from, international standards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#H00600"><p>Okay.  I want to go back to Mr. Herrick on some of that.  Those UN principles date from 1985 and 1999, but what Mr. Herrick does not include is a much more significant document, which is the Mount Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence.  All the leading political scientists and legal theorists came together to draw up those standards, which specifically acknowledge the role of governments in circumstances where there are judicial selection boards.  I can send that to Mr. Herrick.  It is so important.  For example, the standards state: "The recent trend of establishing judicial selection boards or commissions ... should be viewed favourably [of course we have that], provided that a proper balance is maintained in the composition of such boards [by] branches of [the] government".</p> <p>  The UN standards, and all the others to which Mr. Herrick referred, particularly those of the Council of Europe, which deals with so many European career judge systems, are entirely different from, and not comparable with, the common law model.  The frame of reference is very different, especially when one looks at the judicial selection systems in Latin America and Russia, all of which are covered by UN standards.  These are very different democracies that have very different standards, completely different career models for judges and a very different role for politics.  In many cases, they are absent a constitutional democracy.  They must be set carefully against a real comparative analysis, which, of course, relates to advanced common law democracies and constitutional democracies.  How are we doing in that regard?</p></speech>

I understand that the body in question is without any legal status.  We take as our first standard international bodies of which Ireland is a member, such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union.  The Deputy will be aware that, obviously, United Nations standards will apply to both civil and common law jurisdictions.  The Council of Europe standards also apply to common law and civil law systems.  We are very happy to rely on those as the primary source of standards.  Of course, we need to learn from best practice as well.</p></speech>

How does Mr. Herrick see Ireland's judicial independence when set against other common law countries?  Does he think there are other analyses and tests of judicial independence?

My questions are as follows, if that is helpful.  Leaving the issue of standards aside, there is a question of independence regarding how interviews and promotions are conducted.  There is a question about the balance of the independence of the legal profession as well.  For example, and this is something that can be worked out in the eventual Bill, who is it thought should be interviewing prospective judges?  Will it be sitting judges of the courts in which they practice?  Who will it be and how would one go through a process in order to maintain, as my colleague Senator Ward noted, the independence of judges, against a selection process where there may very well be personality clashes and in the context of which a whole range of other things may arise?  How do we protect the independence of both the legal profession and judicial members in those circumstances?</p> <p>  The ranking situation is quite interesting because two totally different types of candidate can come through, with different practice backgrounds and very different skills.  If it was a question of ranking me against the Chair, for example, it is obvious that we are completely different people and are not necessarily comparable.  How does Mr. Herrick conceive of ranking people with very different skill sets and experiences?  Senator McDowell alluded to trying to achieve an overall balance on the court.  I will leave it at that because I do not want to take up too much time.  I will come back in if there is more time.</p></speech>

She asked two questions so she can certainly ask some more.  Perhaps we will take those first.  The questions were primarily directed to Mr. Herrick but Mr. Condon may have something to say as well.</p></speech>

As we previously stated on more than one occasion, the ICCL is very clear that we have immense regard for the quality of the judges who sit on our courts now and for those who have sat on them over the years.  We do not think there is any incompatibility between believing that we get good results, by and large, from the current system but also wanting to improve and strengthen the system for the future.</p><p> On the specific question about how the judicial membership might be composed and how the questions and so on would be conducted, Senator McDowell has already asked questions about how the body corporate would be constituted.  I understand from Mr. Condon that it will be addressed in the Bill.  Our suggestion is that all the judicial members nominated by the Judicial Council and those acting on behalf of the appropriate court would be elected by all members of the Judiciary.  The thinking behind that is it would strengthen the authority and legitimacy of the idea of these people acting on behalf of all judges.  It would also avoid a potential danger - not one that we believe is manifest - of having a clique of the senior members of the Judiciary that would dominate the judicial input and that would not represent the Judiciary as a whole.  That is our suggestion on that point.</p><p> On the question of ranking, we are talking about a selection process.  No matter how it is constructed, it will involve choices and preferences.  There are two elements to what we suggest.  The first is ranking, which strengthens independence, and the other is reducing the number of names that goes to the Government.  The two should be seen as going hand in hand.  Both would make a contribution towards strengthening, and of course either could be done separately from the other.  Both would have the effect of strengthening the independence of the process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.601" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#J00400"><p>Yes.  My point is that there may be three or five candidates and they can be completely different and possess different skill sets.  A court needs lots of different types of things at any given time and there are gaps in experience at different times.  If these are being ranked and putting an onus on the Government to be accountable publicly in some way, and we get to how that discretion can be used, it really tightens the flexibility in appointing people.  For example, we might need a criminal practitioner but have corporate practitioners in first and second place.  A third candidate might have to be appointed for completely obvious reasons but how would that work?  As Senator Ward asked, what would be the standing of that judge?</p></speech>

We do not believe that the approach proposed in the general scheme precludes the possibility of procedures being set by the procedures committee.  The criteria to be established under the proposed Bill would allow the commission to take into account some of those overall considerations.  For example, we are mandating that it would take into account considerations of diversity, which, of course, cannot be considered just in terms of isolation of individual appointments and must be done in the round.  Similarly, we would have thought it possible under the current proposals for the commission to also take into account wider questions of balance as well.</p> <p>  It is probably difficult to make an overall assessment of the proposed approach until we see what procedures are ultimately agreed by the procedures committee.  That is our understanding but I defer to Mr. Condon, who clearly has a deeper insight into the thinking behind the proposed approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Condon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#J00600"><p>There are a number of points on the table but I will pick two or three of them.  Mr. Herrick has mentioned the international conventions, which are very important.  As far possible, we have attempted to have regard to international conventions and best practice.  The two that loom the largest are the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, recommendations and the European Commission's view of our legislation.  It is important to say this scheme and the new Bill probably move much closer to what GRECO and the European Commission would like to see in one very important area, which is the composition of the commission itself.  That is important.</p> <p>  Mr. Herrick made a point about the election of judges.  I am not 100% sure about how that would be developed except that some of the nuts and bolts of the provisions are not absolutely finalised.  Looking at two Judicial Council nominees, there is a process within the council on how those members would be put forward.  That may involve some element of what Mr. Herrick is referring to.</p> <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked who will conduct interviews.  These are significant questions in how the eventual Bill will pan out.  There is provision for criteria and statements of qualification and procedures.  Some of the elements that those statements and approaches must have regard to include independence of the Judiciary.  There are some benchmarks around the concept of judicial independence where regard would be had when those statements on procedures and skills are produced.  I guess it will be members of the judicial commission who will conduct those interviews.  It seems a logical conclusion from the provisions as they have been developed to date.  We may have to wait to see what the commission produces.  It is required that after 12 months it should produce detailed documentation as to how the procedures are to be managed.</p></speech>

There was a point about common law jurisdictions and advanced common law jurisdictions and these may not equate directly to other memberships of the various bodies.  It was an interesting observation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#J00800"><p>I have just one further question.  I can give a practical example of the interview point.  There may be a very conservative Judiciary and a particularly difficult President of the High Court, for example.  Mr. Herrick may have been briefing counsel to try to advance civil liberties and the elements are constantly bashing up against each other.  The best senior counsels may be trying to advance civil liberties but there might be a clash between a person and the President of the High Court, who may then interview that person for a position on the High Court.  We must design systems for the worst in people and not the best.  We must try to protect the system against a nefarious influence, such as in that hypothetical example.</p><p>There was a point made on the retention of discretion.  The Government has absolute discretion from a constitutional point of view, and that is a necessary position for the read across under Article 13.9 of the Constitution about advising the President generally.  The practice with the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has meant that there is absolute constitutional discretion but there is also the concept of political discretion.  As Mr. Herrick mentioned, this is the established convention, as it were.  The established convention is that the Government always - or with only one exception - has appointed judges from the list of recommended candidates from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  That exception was Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, who became Chief Justice.  Where it was not done, it had to be published in <i>Iris Oifgi&uacute;il</i>.  He is the only exception I am aware of.  There is a political convention as well as one relating to the overall constitutional point.</p><p>What is the discretion within that, given that this is already the case and the Government has never deviated from it?  If the point is that the Government is retaining sufficient discretion, how is that moving at all?  Does the witness accept that this has been the essential political convention for the complete period of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.606" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Herrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021061500002#J00900"><p>With the first point the Deputy speaks about guarding against the worst possible scenario in a judicial-dominated system.  One might equally point to the worst possible scenario in a politically dominated system, where an excellent lawyer who has been particularly critical of the State or represented persons that a particular Government might have a particular distaste for.  That is at least, I suggest, as great a danger as the scenario the Deputy outlined.</p><p>Currently, we have a system that is largely lacking in transparency and we are talking about replacing it with a model which will have checks and balances because there will be multiple actors and constituencies represented on the primary decision-making body.  There will be accountability, in the model we propose at least, whereby there will be reasons given.</p><p> On the second question, to say that recent Governments have abided by a convention may very well be true but that convention has been a system whereby the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board gives to Government a very long list of potential names for each particular post.  That still affords the Government very broad discretion.  The Government has abided by the convention but the convention has very broad discretion built into it.  This leaves open the risk of either political appointments or the perception of political appointments.  The latter will be restricted, curtailed and, we believe, improved by what is proposed in the general scheme and on the basis of the additional recommendations which we make.</p></speech>

It is clearly a matter of Cabinet privilege and confidentiality as to what recommendations it goes with or does not go with.  I have listened carefully to Ministers in recent years and all of them have indicated that the convention is that the short list, the long list or whatever is attended to when the appointment is made.  I am certainly aware of that.  I think it is a good point.</p></speech>

The <i>status quo</i>is that judicial promotions, namely, promotions from among the ranks of sitting judges, do not go through that process.  The Government has been making most of the senior judicial appointments outside of any conventional process of any type.</p></speech>

I have been criticising the judicial appointments selection process for nearly 20 years and have argued for a range of different reforms, but I have never criticised the independence of the Judiciary.  I have argued that a judge-led system has been incapable of formalising the process in the way in respect of which I have argued regarding accountability, transparency and professionalism.  We are on the same page in the context of many aspects of this but I had to push Mr. Herrick on the independence point because it is very important in light of the ICCL's standing and the standing of this committee.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for that point, which was well made.</p> <p>  We will have a second round of questions if, that is, members have any other questions.  We have already had a good and comprehensive engagement.  There are 25 minutes remaining.  We will have to wrap up then but we may not require that time.  I will begin the second round of the questions.  There will be some latitude because we have covered many points.  We will not stray too far from the agenda but we can touch on wider topics.  My question is for both witnesses.  I am interested in hearing their responses.</p> <p>  The general scheme relates to judicial appointments and how people get  on the Bench.  We have had some discussion on how people will move from a lower Bench to a higher Bench, as it were.  Aside from the appointment process, I do not think judicial regulation, conduct, management or sanction, if appropriate, come within the scope of the proposed Bill, but I am not sure whether that exists, what format it takes or what process is in place.  There are two scenarios where that can unfold.  One is what has been  documented considerably certainly last year but also occasionally in the past where there has been what was considered to be judicial conduct off the Bench which was considered at times to be not appropriate or the subject of public comment, which certainly did not help anyone's cause.  There has been significant comment on that.  I hesitate to use the term "judicial misconduct" but there can be scenarios of problematic conduct by individuals on the Bench.  I do not mean decisions being made which a Government, a politician or even the public may agree or disagree with.  I mean standards of behaviour which, in other contexts, might be seen as workplace bullying.  It is very much the exception rather than the rule because the vast majority of academics, all the reports and even practitioners would say that they all perform impeccably.  Such issues can arise, however.  There are behaviours off the Bench which can be problematic but there are also such behaviours on the Bench.  I do not mean in terms of which side a particular judge comes down on but more how they execute that function.  It may be the case in any role when one is elevated at a certain point and is not answerable to anyone that bad habits or certain modes of behaviour can creep in which go unchecked for long periods and, in an even worse scenario, be exacerbated.  I am not sure whether there is anything in place to temper that.  I do not know, for example, whether there is a complaints process or any mode of regulation or mitigation.  If not, should there be and what might that look like?  Mr. Herrick might respond first and then Mr. Condon.</p></speech>

The council is in the very early stages of establishing its procedures.  The ICCL is engaged with National University of Ireland Galway and the University of Limerick on some initial research and working hopefully with the Judicial Council regarding the development of its procedures.  We are greatly supportive of the approach set out in the Judicial Council Act and of having the Judicial Council taking on this function, which will greatly improve things in the context of the matters to which the Chairman referred.</p></speech>

What does Mr. Condon say to that?  Does he consider that regulation is in place or needs to be in place and what mitigation exists in respect of behaviour, both on and off the Bench, that may not be acceptable?</p></speech>

Since the introduction of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017, the Judicial Council has been established.  I cannot brief today on the activities of the Judicial Council.  In terms of the general scheme, the important context is, clearly, that there are basic eligibility requirements around probity and so on which would be sought by the commission.  In drafting the Bill itself, we are looking at there being a link between the commission and the council.  In other words, how will the commission whether there is an issue?  It can go and ask the council.  We are considering one or two measures like that which would help in this regard.</p></speech>

Over the course of the afternoon we have had a very strong engagement.  I thank the witnesses.  Ms McLoughlin-Burke did not have an opportunity to contribute but I am sure she has contributed in a significant way.  I know she contributed to the submission because I read it and it has her name all over it.  Her inputs are clear.  Technology lets us down at the best of times.  I thank Mr. Herrick for his contribution.  I also thank Mr. Condon&rsquo;s for his contribution on behalf of the Department.  They were very valuable contributions.  I thank my colleagues on the committee, as always, for what has been a significant and robust engagement.  We are all the better for it.  That concludes our engagement with the witnesses on this topic.  I propose that we publish all the opening statements on the committee&rsquo;s website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses again.  I also thank our staff and secretariat for their preparation work and the efficient running of the meeting.</p> <p>  Is there any other business?  There is a brief opportunity to raise other business.  There does not appear to be any other business.  That concludes our engagement.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to our witnesses from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children and Ms Nuala Ward, director of investigations.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank Dr. Muldoon for his report, No End in Site: An investigation into the living conditions of children on a local authority halting site, which was published in May 2021.  The report is hard to read, especially when one hears the testimony of the children about their living conditions.  </p> <p>  The committee is concerned that if Traveller community accommodation is not addressed satisfactorily then Traveller health, education and employment will also suffer.  The committee has received letters from primary school principals about the difficulties faced by Traveller children that has been made worse by Covid-19.</p> <p>  We can see from the report that poor accommodation is having a detrimental effect on Traveller education.  If Traveller community children today do not get a chance of an education, then another generation will suffer the same fate as many of their parents.  The committee is very interested in the ombudsman's report, his recommendations and his plans to look for six-month and 12-month updates from local authorities, which is particularly important.  The committee is looking at the role of local authorities in the provision of housing, particularly halting sites for Travellers.  The report, in terms of the halting sites, will be of great help to the committee.</p> <p>  I suggest that Dr. Muldoon makes an opening statement that lasts between five and ten minutes.  Then each member will have the opportunity to ask questions and they will have about five minutes for questions and answers.  However, members may come in a second and third time, as appropriate.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. Niall Muldoon, Ombudsman for Children, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.633" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021061500002#A00600"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear and discuss my report, No End in Site.</p> <p>  As members of the committee are aware, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body, which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.  As the OCO has two core statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age, and to examine and investigate complaints made by, or on behalf of, children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals that have, or may have had, an adverse effect on a child.</p> <p>  The report was initiated because a Traveller visibility group and the local Traveller women&rsquo;s network came together and contacted the office in 2018 about conditions at a local authority-run halting site where 66 children and their families were living.  Eleven families then came forward and made complaints about the following: a persistent problem with a high rate of childhood illness caused by living conditions; a lack of safe play areas for children; the fact that housing applications were not being progressed; rodent infestation; inadequate sanitation; extreme overcrowding; safety concerns about access to a site; illegal dumping nearby; inconsistent and inadequate waste disposal; and inadequate heating systems and unsafe electrical works. </p> <p>  The OCO met families and visited the site on three occasions.  In total, approximately 140 people were using toilets and washing facilities that had been designed for 40 people, which the residents say has led to stress, tension and, at times, conflict.</p><p>During our investigation, the HSE director of public health nursing told us that the children living on this halting site suffer from skin conditions and respiratory problems at a much higher rate than the local or general population.  The chief fire officer told us that there are frequent call-outs to the site.  We met with 17 children who told us that they feel different to their peers due to the standard of conditions on the site.  One 12-year-old girl said, &quot;walking up to school you see all the rats ... they would be running up and down the walls of the trailer&rdquo;.  A 14-year-old girl said, &ldquo;people ask why I&rsquo;m dirty, but I&rsquo;d be ashamed to say.  I don&rsquo;t want to say it was from walking out of the site&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The conditions we found on the halting site in question were deplorable.  To think that children in Ireland in 2021 are living like this is utterly shocking.  Under no circumstances can this be accepted or allowed to continue.  Our investigation acknowledged the hard work done by the local authority and the difficult circumstances in which its staff sometimes found themselves.  Ultimately, however, we found that the local authority failed to consider the best interests of children, did not maintain the site and housing applications were not processed or were incomplete.  This meant that some families may have missed out on homes and may have remained on the list longer than they needed to.<br/><br/>The local authority also did not account for the disadvantage experienced by Travellers.  We made a series of recommendations and we called for these to be overseen from the top, by the CEO, to ensure that the changes happened.  Our recommendations seek to improve conditions for children living on the site in the short term, and to bring about long-lasting systemic change in how Travellers are treated by the local authority.  This was a long and difficult investigation for the families involved, the Traveller advocacy groups and the local authority in question.  The paralysis in the system cannot continue.  I very much welcome the commitments made by the local authority to implement these recommendations and, in particular, the expressed commitment by the CEO to ensure that the necessary actions occur.  I will be seeking regular updates from the local authority on the progress it has made in implementing our recommendations and how the lives of children have improved.<br/><br/>On 27 May, an editorial piece in <i>The Irish Times</i>stated that this report &quot;shines a light on a grave problem that too many arms of the State wish to ignore&quot;.  That is the big issue for our office now.  It is not the follow up of this report, but the fact that so many other sites have come to light and that nearly every local authority could be held to account in the same manner as the one in this case.  In light of that, we have taken a number of steps, including writing to An Taoiseach and all leaders of political parties, because we believe the time has come to, once and for all, eradicate the racism and discrimination in our local authority planning system that allows children to grow up in standards that were abolished for the rest of the Irish population more than 50 years ago.<br/><br/>On 26 May of this year, the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il:</p><blockquote>	My understanding ... is there have been lots of different initiatives and plans produced over time but they have not brought a resolution.  The consequence of that failure to get a resolution to a lot of the issues is children living in absolutely unacceptable conditions in terms of health, hygiene, quality of life and so forth.  It is absolutely unacceptable and the local authority will have to move decisively now in response to the ombudsman&rsquo;s report. </blockquote><p>I have called on each political leader to instruct their representatives on local authorities throughout the country to vote for progress on Traveller accommodation.  No excuses should be accepted for blocking progress in the provision of Traveller accommodation or for failing to fully utilise the ring-fenced funds.  I have also asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to be much more proactive in the monitoring of spending in this area.  It is the only budget that is routinely not spent and the Minister must see to it that such underspends are not allowed to happen and if they do, there must be a serious oversight and audit of the workings of that local authority.<br/><br/>I urge all members here on this committee to back that call so that this group of citizens and rights holders can begin to benefit from proper, safe and secure housing for the first time in many generations or perhaps for the first time ever.  We are also planning to hold a seminar in July and invite all the relevant staff in local authorities.  We believe that there is a window of opportunity to change the narrative in this area away from one of blame and accusation, and redirect it to properly focusing on the accommodation services we are providing to the children of our nation.  I thank the committee again for its invitation and for members' time.  My colleague, Ms Ward, and I are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I have studied this report very carefully and, even though I have been around a long time in politics - 35 years in total - I am very shocked by it.  I spent 22 years as a county councillor before I became a Seanad&oacute;ir.  I had a reasonable amount of involvement with the Travelling community in Kerry, and especially in my home town, with 99% of it being extremely positive.  Clearly, there are serious issues highlighted by Dr. Muldoon in this report that we, as a committee, will address seriously and bring forward.  I will not hog the meeting, but I will make a few points and I have one or two questions.  Unfortunately, this meeting clashes with the children's committee meeting, which relates to the burials, a very sensitive and important matter, and I will have to leave early to attend that.  That meeting starts at 1 p.m. in private session.</p> <p>  What is shocking is the health situation of the whole community in that halting site and, in particular, the health of the children.  I need not go over all the details - they are horrific.  I will target one health issues that is probably the most overlooked, which is the psychological health of those children and the sense of shame they have when they go to school.  When they go out into the wider community, they have a sense of shame about the way they are dressed and their lack of sanitation, because they do not have an opportunity to wash and so on.  I was a teacher, as was my wife, in a special school for the Travelling community for many years.  We would be familiar with that issue but not to the extent that it is highlighted in the report.  I can see that this is clearly something which must be addressed.</p> <p>  Another issue is the that of the tragedies which, naturally, come to mind when one reads this report.  I refer to sites where there have been serious fire incidences and terrible tragedies.  All the ingredients seem to be here, and it was just by the luck of God that no catastrophe occurred at this site in the context of the electrics.  The list of issues includes things like no working smoke detectors, badly fitted stoves, the electrical system being overloaded, etc.  It is a complete fire hazard.  They are the two issue I would focus on - the psychological health of children in particular and the fire hazard.</p> <p>  On a more critical note, Dr. Muldoon pointed out that this halting site was originally established to house 12 bays.  Before long, it seems there were multiples of that number at the site.  He does not go into detail as to how that situation arose.  I presume it happened incrementally.  Was it not being monitored by the council?  Were the residents, in any way, culpable of inviting or accepting, perhaps, relatives and friends on to the site?  We need to look at that a bit more because it is a critical point - that site was never intended for that number of people.  I know the circumstances that pertained to people who came in and probably felt aggrieved by the housing allocation system and the housing priorities of that council, and so on.  However, this must be highlighted.  Perhaps the council are to blame, or other agencies, for how it developed.  I want to know over what length of time this developed.</p> <p>  I refer to the points noted by Dr. Muldoon that council staff and outside contractors were reluctant to go onto the site, that they were, perhaps, even in fear and that garda&iacute; had to be used as moderators or mediators once or twice.  That was regrettable but I am sure there were two sides to the story.</p><p>Why was that situation allowed to develop?  I presume these people were coming in to do good work, to fix the electrics and do the plumbing.  Why should there have been resistance to them on-site?  Is there something we are not getting there?</p><p> I agree with Dr. Muldoon that it is a disgrace that certain local authorities will not even use the ring-fenced budget they get for Traveller accommodation.  Under no other heading or programme would a county council be returning money, and they would be screaming for more on every single issue.  As a committee, we discussed this in private today.  We are awaiting reports from all of the various local authorities to justify their position on that, and we will be working on it ourselves.  I engaged with the chief executive officer of Kerry County Council, Moira Morrell, and her senior housing staff in preparation for this meeting, and they presented me with a very comprehensive report, which I will not go into now but which I will be happy to lay before the Chairman and the committee.  Not to be parochial, Kerry seems to be doing more than its share, or at least an equal share, and I am proud to be able to say that.</p><p> I know Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward investigated this one issue in great detail, and well done to them both.  Do they think this is typical?  Is this standard procedure?  Can we imply and take forward from this report that this type of thing is going on all over the country, in the cities of Dublin, Galway and Cork, and in our rural towns and communities as well?  Perhaps there is a much bigger scandal to be gone into.  Again, I welcome both witnesses and I congratulate them.  I regret that I have to go to an equally important meeting but I will carefully study their responses.</p></speech>

I want to comment on a couple of points.  He has hit the nail on the head in that this concerns the psychological health of the children as much as the physical health.  I note from the last open meeting we had that a witness, Bridget Kelly from the National Traveller Women's Forum, said that infant Traveller children are 3.5 times more likely to die in the first year.  When we see conditions like this, we can see why.  We have been told that respiratory conditions are an issue right from the start so, again, they are being set up for long-term health issues.</p> <p>  When we talk about the psychological side, as a nation that is one of the top nations in Europe financially and is trying to be one of the leaders of the world in many ways, we try to teach our children to be confident, to be strong, to stand up for things and to learn about life in a safe and stepwise manner.  However, all that these children are hearing all of the time is negative, abuse, racism and put-downs.  Again, the accommodation where they start is important.  Maslow's hierarchy of needs refers to the need for shelter and for a first safe, secure place.  If people do not have that, they do not feel safe, they do not feel secure, they do not feel that is where they can retreat and be comfortable, safe and warm.  Everything else falls apart from there, and it becomes much more difficult to thrive and survive in the way that we want our children to do.  I agree that that really is a starting point.  If we can get safe, strong, affordable accommodation for this population, as is their right, then we would change enormously their projection into the future and, as was said, the impact on education and employment.</p> <p>  The fire risk is clear.  Unfortunately, in my first year as Ombudsman for Children, I attended one of the wakes for the children in Carrickmines.  It was horrific.  To think that could still possibly happen anywhere in the country, after all the work that has been put into it, is scary.  Hopefully, it will never happen again, but we seem to be creating conditions that could allow that to happen.</p> <p>  Is this typical?  One of the things we can do in our office is to carry out systemic investigations, for example, if one case leads to something that might change systems.  In this situation, we felt it was better to do a strong job on an individual authority and take the lessons from there.  The committee will have seen already the feedback to this report, and it probably struck us even more than we expected.  There are probably examples in every local authority area and there are various different elements.  Whether it is the overcrowding, the hygiene or the poor administration of housing applications, it is probably happening all over the country.  As to whether it is typical, it is certainly not an outlier, I would say, from what I can understand and the feedback I have got from different organisations.  That said, this is why we want to use this investigation as an opportunity to change, and as a starting point for local authorities.  We worked very hard with that local authority to say that we are not trying to hammer it but that we are trying to find a way to make things different and to change things.  That is why we will stay engaged over the next six to 12 months, and longer if necessary.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Ms Ward to talk about how the population increased from ten bays to 40, and also about the outside staff as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.640" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nuala Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021061500002#C00400"><p>This site opened up in 1989 and there was no formal means of allocating the bays to anybody.  It is very important to put the historical context on this.  Over time, families grew and nieces and nephews, children, sons and daughters moved into the site, like any other village or townland in Ireland.  What we were really concerned about is that, because the chronic overcrowding had been going on for so long, we would have expected a robust method of allocating social housing or other sites to people who live there as a very straightforward means of addressing overcrowding, but that is not what we found.  That was a very serious concern to us.  As the committee knows, overcrowding is a key contributor to all the other issues that Dr. Muldoon has identified in regard to the health and well-being of children.</p> <p>  With regard to the contractors, this is a critical point.  Information was given to us that, for example, there was one electrical contractor who was unable to gain access to the site.  When we looked deeply at that, looked at the minutes and cross-examined everything, we realised it was just one individual on the site who was causing the difficulties.  All the other people on the site were extremely upset that they suffered the consequences because of this one individual.  They were querying why garda&iacute; were not called and why something was not done in regard to that one individual&rsquo;s behaviour that impacted on everyone else.  When committee members read through the fine detail of the report, they will see that.</p> <p>  That is why Dr. Muldoon mentioned the paralysis.  We cannot just walk away from such deplorable conditions and not try to resolve them in some other way.  I hope that answers the two questions.</p></speech>

I have one further question for Ms Ward.  When additional mobile units started to encroach on that site, should the council have been proactive in either removing them or making it impossible for others to come in?  Perhaps that is a crude way of dealing with it.</p></speech>

The key piece is the Traveller accommodation plan.</p><p>That is how you should identify accommodation needs and make plans to meet the needs, and that should have been in place and closely monitored to prevent this happening.  As can be seen from our report, that did not happen.  The legislative basis for the Traveller accommodation plan was to address the discrimination that Travellers experience in relation to meeting accommodation needs in Ireland.  The failure to meet the basic minimum legislation requirements in this regard is a key contributor for why this overcrowding was left year on, year on, and its impact on children.</p></speech>

I sat on a local authority in Galway for a very short period.  One of the most shocking things to me was the treatment of Traveller communities by local authorities.  Some of the things in this report do not come as a surprise to most people who have been active in their communities or have been councillors.  It is one of the greatest shames in some ways.  Galway City Council routinely returns funding year after year.  The local Traveller consultative committee did not sit for a number of years either.  Even if Traveller accommodation plans are put in place, to what extent are they really consultative if one fails to bring everybody together?  At private meetings we have discussed the various things that might be part of Traveller culture, such as horses.  If we are really looking at accommodating the Traveller community we must also look at accommodating the lifestyles of Travellers.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is not only about provision of housing, as the witnesses rightly point out is the bedrock of Maslow's hierarchy of needs but it is also about the provision of adequate housing.  I would argue that means it has to be a home and that it has to be something that reflects the culture of that particular section of society.  In all those things local authorities across the country are failing.  Hearing the words of children is what really brings it home to adults.  There is no excuse for not going into a site and addressing issues on the basis of one or two adults who are difficult because children have rights in our Constitution quite apart from adults.  One can be quite sure that they were not the ones creating the difficulty for the Garda or the local authority to come in and sort out the problems.  On the one hand, I do not want to be too hard on local authorities but I do think it is important.  As a public representative, we have a huge challenge that unelected people are making decisions a lot of the time.  We have one of the weakest local governments in Europe and that also has to be addressed.  There are problems around councillors voting against accommodation and an awful lot of political parties are involved in doing that before anyone puts up their hand and says it is the Government, it is not.  Everyone has to take responsibility for that, particularly the largest parties who wield a lot of power in those local authorities.  I do not want to be overly political in that sense but everyone needs to step up.</p> <p>  First, is enough done to change the behaviour of the local authorities or is it valuable to do this kind of reporting on other sites across the country?  I know of places in Galway, for instance, where there are rats.  It is not the fault of the local population.  They have been crying out for housing.  </p> <p>  Second, do the witnesses believe that prioritisation of vulnerable children is happening when social housing is being allocated?  Third, transitory sites do not seem to be happening around the country.  The sites that are supposedly there for transient families moving from place to place become permanent sites without all the facilities there for the children to get to school and so on.  There is an opportunity now.  There are a couple of Ministers who deal with this area.  There is the children's Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and also the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, who is in the Department of Social Protection.  They have been stepping up to the plate but this is a failure over decades and it continues to be a failure because of the operations of local authorities.  </p> <p>   Ms Ward explained well how somewhere that has ten bays moves to 40 bays.  We cannot go shutting things down.  Where do the families move on to?  There must be somewhere for families to move on.  One cannot simply come in with the strong arm of the law and leave children with nothing if there is no provision of social housing.</p></speech>

A key thing for me is this opportunity to change things from now on.  That is why we wrote to the political leaders.  The Senator is right that the local councillors are the ones who have to start stepping up but they have to be whipped, if one likes, as they would in the D&aacute;il.  There has to be a statement from the top that says that they need to vote in favour of Traveller accommodation for the next five years or whatever it might be until we get this problem sorted.  We need to start stepping up and doing our duty which is legislated for - it is a statutory obligation in many cases.  The Traveller review from 2019 suggests a pause on the section 8 element of the Act, and that maybe something we do for five years, but the key is start pushing from the top so there is no room for manoeuvre at local councillor level and they have to follow the rules which allow for Traveller accommodation.  It will not solve everything completely but it will made a huge inroad to what is a relatively small number of people on the social housing list waiting to be moved on.</p> <p>  Like so many things, if one unblocks one element one starts to free up all the other areas.  The transitory sites are only being filled up because there are not enough proper sites and there are not enough opportunities for social housing.  As Ms Ward touched on, what I found shocking was the administration of social housing.  We had 11 families, that is all.  It took two and a half years to get the files together around social housing for those 11 families.  The administration is very poor.  If they were sorted out, clean, clear, we know one family was there 13 years and had not been moved on to social housing.  These sorts of things would not happen in the general population.  We need to ensure the proper administration is in place so that when there is an opportunity to move on a family it is taken and used.  There are many lazy myths put out by local authorities and councillors that people have been offered X, Y and Z and are not taking it.  In reality, when we investigated the 11 families, some who had been there over 13 years waiting, only eight offers were made.  Two were taken up and the others were refused, appropriately, because they were in different areas or whatever.  Eight offers in 13 years is not exactly moving fast or providing a way to unblock the dam.  One can see how overcrowding would happen there.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Ms Ward to talk about the allocation to vulnerable children.</p></speech>

As members know, we are aware social housing, group homes and all other different types of accommodation are incredibly valuable resources in Ireland.  They must be administered fairly and transparently.  That is really important.</p> <p>  When one looks at the different policies local authorities have, there are medical priorities.  This area had a particular priority because of Travellers but, more importantly, it had a strong priority if there was severe overcrowding, which was causing a health and safety risk.  We also had a number of children who had learning difficulties and such on the site.  They ticked so many boxes in terms of priority and yet that was not reflected in the records we saw.  There was not a recognition of compliance with policy, transparency and accountability with regard to how their applications were being administered.</p> <p>  That was a really serious issue considering the risks to the health and safety of the children on this site.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.647" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021061500002#E00500"><p>I welcome Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward to the committee today.  The ombudsman's report is a milestone from the point of view of where we are at in terms of Traveller accommodation.  These reports have been coming out for years.  We have had health and safety reports on that site, going back to 2011, in which the environmental officer said it was not fit for human habitation.</p> <p>  We cannot let this moment go, from the point of view of where the OCO established the scenario in all its difficulties, from the local authority to councillors and to society in general.  Some ten years ago, in Cork County Council, the local authority brought a proposal to extend the bays there but the councillors did not support that.  In many ways, that came from pressure from the community not to expand the bay there.  The witnesses' information to the committee will be important in respect of how we proceed in terms of Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>  Should section 24 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, which prohibits nomadism, be repealed?  Is the ombudsman suggesting it should be repealed and if that is the case, how should it be done?  The provision of the network of transient halting sites in each local authority area is exempted under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Is that part of the witnesses' recommendation or are they focusing on this site and other sites?</p> <p>  The amendment to Part 8 in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 has to be amended to prevent political interference with Traveller-specific developments.  That is crucial.  I listened closely when Dr. Muldoon said he had called for the leaders to instruct or put a whip on their councillors to say they had to support Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>  I am also interested in the OCO's meeting with local authority staff, which is hoped to be a target for July.  That will be important in moving along.  I was on Dublin City Council from 2004 and without casting aspersions on any individual, it was difficult to get the Traveller accommodation unit there to do the work one wanted it to do.  We have a site in Dublin South Central's Labre Park.  Planning for the site started off approximately five years ago and barrier upon barrier has been erected continuously to prevent that site from being developed.  Cl&uacute;id had the authority to build on the site and put plans forward.</p> <p>  I welcome this report and it could be a game changer from the point of view of making a start, because one is talking about a site which only accommodated ten families and now has up to 40 families.  Where were those people supposed to go, if they were not getting accommodation anywhere else?  The only option they had was to stay on the site or live on the side of the road and then there would have been ructions about that as well, from the point of view of society.</p> <p>  The key thing is it came from the Ombudsman for Children, in terms of the conditions in which children were living on the site.  I hope we, as a committee, can represent Dr. Muldoon's report and try to develop that as a national strategy with regard to housing.</p> <p>  Would the ombudsman support the setting up of a national Traveller accommodation authority to implement the recommendations of the Traveller accommodation expert group?  It will be important the Traveller community is part of that authority, to proceed with sites all over the country.  We are only talking about a small part of the population.  Surely, if we can develop, through the local authorities, good, well-run and well-looked after bays, people would accept those as part of our communities.</p></speech>

When Deputy Joan Collins asked whether section 24 of the 2002 Act should be repealed, I cannot comment.  I am afraid I would not know enough about it.  I am aware of the Part 8 provision through the 2019 review.  I listen to the people and experts who know.  A review group was put in place by a group of experts.  It was accepted by the then Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English.  It involved the NGOs and advocacy groups and they support the concept of suspending the Part 8 provision.  I can see the benefit of that, for a period of time.</p> <p>  That concept of political influence is part of local authority, but we have seen the impact in terms of blocking up and stunting the growth of many generations of Travellers, not just over five or six years.  There are three generations living on the site we investigated.  Again, 11 families came to us and they all want to be moved into social housing.  If they were given the opportunity to move, one would change out one third of the total number of people nearly immediately.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity to be taken here.  I will not suggest exactly what could happen but there is an expert review report in place which is only two years old and has been supported by all the advocate groups and NGOs.  With regard to national Traveller accommodation authority, the Deputy called this a milestone report.  I would hope this is a milestone report but in order for it to be so, we probably need to give a year for the local authorities to start showing they might change or do things differently, the Government to back them, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to come in stronger and challenge anybody who underspends and the system to be done differently.</p> <p>  If that is not working after 12 months, perhaps there is an opportunity for a new authority to be considered, that is, an independent authority which creates a focus on the children of the Traveller communities.  If we get it right for the children, everything else will follow.  That is the mantra we go with all the time.</p> <p>  We have to look at Covid-19.  In the past 14 or 15 months, the Government has acted with great wisdom in many cases, in brushing aside much bureaucracy which was not needed.  Can we do that in this situation?  The last set of witnesses before the committee two weeks ago talked about 2,000 families living in severe, dangerous situations.  Perhaps we can find a route to solving their problems, over the next four to five years, through adjusting things such as suspending some parts of the Act, giving more power to the CEOs or whatever way it needs to be done.  I am not quite sure exactly how it will pan out.  However, if the political will is there to do that, as there has been through Covid-19, to move things forward and emphasise the importance of the individual and families, there is a great opportunity here.  I hope this will be a milestone for all local authorities.</p> <p>  I will let Ms Ward answer on the meeting of the local authorities and what we are hoping from that point of view.</p></speech>

Since we published the report, some local authorities have reached out to the office and asked if this could relate to them, what they could do differently and what our thoughts are on this.  It is really welcome that some of the local authorities have taken time to reflect.  It has been very powerful in fairness to the children who came forward.  The voices of the children seemed to have resonated with all the adults who have decision-making and policy-making powers.  We very much welcome that and we will reach out to them to see what more we can do.  </p><p> Hopefully the webinar will involve an open discussion.  We will share our findings and what those in the local authority told us.  As Dr. Muldoon mentioned, the CEO of this local authority has formally stated that he will take accountability for the implementation of the recommendations arising from our investigation and that is to be respected.  We very much hope that will be a leadership model that other CEOs throughout the country might consider because it is about the best interests of the children who are living in such deplorable conditions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.651" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1657" speakername="Eileen Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021061500002#F00200"><p>Today, physically and mentally I was not able to chair this meeting.  Reading the report when it first came out brought me right back to Carrickmines and brought me back to my childhood.  I am now a 31-year-old mother.  I can only speak of the experience of the halting site where I was born and reared.  That halting site opened in 1967.  At the moment, its redevelopment is not even being looked at.  I was part of a big project for the redevelopment of the site.  Many of the children spoke about playing in the mud.  I was that young child, not having a safe place to play.  It just goes from generation to generation.  Dr. Muldoon rightly said that it will be the first time in history that there will be appropriate and safe accommodation for Traveller children.</p> <p>  While the focus of this report is on one halting site, I would like to thank Anne Burke, Breda O'Donoghue and others in the Traveller Visibility Group Cork for their help and the work they have done with that particular halting site.  I also thank Ms Ward and Dr. Muldoon for all the hard work they put into this report.  </p> <p>  Reading it again was very tough but its contents were very true.  I hope that something will change as a result of this report.  Ten people from within our community lost their lives and the local authority was not held accountable, nor was the State.  We do not want that in future for our young children going to school.  I was that young child going to school in the freezing cold, not having heating in the house.  Many Travellers live in caravans and trailers.  That is people's choice of home and it is a home.  People are looking for facilities.  </p> <p>  Two weeks ago, I spoke about Labre Park halting site where there was an outbreak of hepatitis A.  Many children ended up in hospital over the Christmas period and throughout January.  There was a small outbreak of coronavirus on the site at the same time.  How can it be acceptable for children from the Traveller community to get hepatitis A in this day and age and nobody is held to account for that?</p> <p>  One side of it is accommodation and the other side is education.  Children are being failed and Travellers, who are adults now, have been failed by the system but there are no consequences for it.  Nobody is held to account.  Nobody is saying that these children's lives matter.  I have a little girl who is 20 months old.  She is now in safe appropriate accommodation.  I am trying my hardest as a mother with really bad anxiety to get her past the age of two.  Every mother in the Traveller community fears their kids being under the age of two because we know there is still a danger of not being able to survive until they are over the age of two.</p> <p>  I could speak all day about the inequality.  Even on a Christmas Day people living in trailers come looking for water.  None of this is acceptable.  I have lived through this.  Most importantly, young children today are still living through it, not getting the right access to education.  They have the shame of going into school while not having the appropriate uniform and being labelled for that even though it is not their fault or their parents' fault.  It is down to the accommodation they are living in and the area surrounding it.</p> <p>  If the witnesses were to name their top three recommendations, what would they be?  Who should be held accountable?  Would this happen if this were children in the general population?  This is why we have child protection.  I am also a youth worker.  This is why we focus on the rights of the child and child protection.  Who should be held responsible for these failures that Travellers have had to live through for decades upon decades?</p> <p>  I stay in Labre Park for three days a week when I am actually feeling good and when I come up.  When my nephews, nieces and other children on the site fall, they are automatically brought to Our Lady's Hospital.  Their parents are questioned by social workers.  The mothers and fathers are terrified that their kids will be taken from them due to injuries and infections that are down to the living conditions at the sites and not getting the proper supports they need from local authorities.  </p> <p>  If this were to happen in the general population, who would be held accountable?  What would Dr. Muldoon recommend to the committee as the way forward?  Does the Ombudsman for Children intend to do any more of these reports?  I would support that.  The Irish Traveller Movement and Pavee Point, the National Traveller Women's Forum and other local NGOs would support the Ombudsman for Children to carry out more of these reports.  I am hoping this one is serious enough that the Government will take some action.  Who would be held accountable if it happened to a child in the general population?  That is one question the committee needs answered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.652" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021061500002#F00300"><p>This question is very important for the Senator.  The experience and passion she has for it are very clear.  She knows better than I do.  I come to it as an outsider trying to learn.  She asked who is held accountable.  We have a statutory obligation to look at the public services provided to children.  Where they fail, we hold them accountable.  Who is accountable?  It is the body or individual that is statutorily obliged, in this case the local authority and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Those are the two that are accountable.  We send our reports to them.</p> <p>  We engaged with the local authority and we sent our reports to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and also the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  As the latter now has responsibility for diversity and integration, we feel there is also a role for him.  The Ministers are clearly accountable.  In addition, if the Senator asks who is the boss of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it is the Taoiseach and the Government.  That is where the accountability is and that is why I have been engaging with them as much as with the local authorities.</p> <p>  We feel that we get more done if we engage with organisations and try to find a way to make things work and change things from the inside, rather than to use a stick, so to speak.  That is why we have a follow-up.  We could have finished this two years ago but we would not have had the support of the local authority when we did.</p><p>We engaged with it and asked how we could get this right.  We got the local authority on board to support us and to accept the recommendations.  We have a follow-up at six months and 12 months.  If there is a failure or I am not satisfied after 12 months, I have the option under the legislation to write a special report to the Oireachtas and ask it to take over from there.  That has not had to happen yet and I hope it will not happen in this case, but it is an option that is always available to us.  That is where the accountability lies.</p><p> As regards the recommendations, they are like children - we cannot choose one over the other, as I am sure the Senator knows as a mother.  We only make recommendations that are crucial.  We make important recommendations and I would hate to think that if we identified the top three recommendations, the local authority would sit back and not bother with the rest of them.  There is a statutory obligation to provide housing, so we have asked the local authority to audit the files for the 11 families with which we were engaged and to ensure those families have not been in any way failed in terms of the way their applications were administered.  We have also asked the local authority to look at all the family applications relating to the site and to create a timeline plan for provision of accommodation up to 2024.</p><p> Those are the recommendations that stand out for me but I would not say one is more important than another because it is also important to have sewerage, water and a playground.  Children have a right to play and I keep reminding many public authorities that play is not an add-on luxury; it is where children escape, have fun and leave everything behind them.  It is also where they learn how to climb, jump, take turns and escape real life.  It is crucial that they have a play area.  A simple thing such as a footpath to the nearest housing estate to allow them to get to school safely and cleanly is also important.  That is why I would hate to choose one recommendation over another.  They are all crucial.</p><p> On the question regarding investigations, we hope there will not be any more investigations but our job is to accept any complaint that is submitted and to consider it individually.  In the context of engagement with the local authority, as Ms Ward addressed, what I would like to do and may do after the meeting is to invite the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to join us at that meeting.  That might make for a much more rounded meeting at which we can try to engage that so that everybody is talking together and there is no miscommunication.  That may be a way of preventing further investigations.  However, if people come to us, we will look at each case individually and see what happens.</p></speech>

What we did raise is that it is really important for local authorities to engage with the children so that they feel valued and heard.  We thought it was really important to empower these children and assure them that what they told us mattered, that they matter and that they can effect change as individuals.  That is a crucial lesson to give these children.</p> <p>  As the members can see, one of our recommendations is that we asked the local authority to reach out to local youth services and the local child and youth committee to bring that wrap-around community response to these children to improve their lives.  It is not just down to the local authority, it is for everyone within that community to try to improve the lives of these children.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that the future will look bright for Traveller children and we will not have to see other generations of children growing up in dire accommodation.  I, too, am of the mindset that every recommendation is important.  As I said, it is not about recreating the wheel.  Many of the answers are in the report of the special expert group that was set up in 2019 and reported in that year.  That is important.  I again thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward on behalf of the Traveller community.  I rarely speak on behalf of the 40,000 people in the Traveller community but in this case, I will do so and say "Thank you" for this report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.657" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1470" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021061500002#G00500"><p>I thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward for the report and the recommendations but the situation described in the report mirrors that on many sites in my area that have experienced very similar things.  There is St. Joseph's, which is a halting site that has been there for more than 20 years.  Half the site is in use but the other half is decommissioned.  The same is happening in St. Mary's.  We lost St. Mary's and St. Christopher's and they have not been replaced in terms of accommodation.  As regards St. Margaret's, I do not know how many people I met regarding plans to expand that site in Ballymun but it still has not happened.  That has been going on for well over five years.  That is how seriously accommodation is taken by the local authorities.  On the Ratoath Road, the Gavin family is living with no water.  There are 14 men, women and children with no water in a Covid situation.  In fairness, they are being supplied with water by Fingal County Council, the local authority.  However, it is just unacceptable.  They had water but it was disconnected and they have not been linked up subsequently.  It is an absolute scandal.  That is what I have experienced in my area.</p> <p>  What penalties have the local authorities suffered in consequence for this?  We certainly need an overview of all of it.  There should be a group to oversee it, such as a national Traveller group, which would include our guests and many others.  That needs to be put in place because if the problem is so widespread in my area, I hate to think what it is like in other areas.  The report is so damning that one could probably identify many places where there are similar problems.</p> <p>  Many Traveller children in Finglas and Ballymun are in DEIS schools.  Education and getting people up to a high standard are so important.  </p> <p>The number of people from the local Traveller community who are coming to me seeking housing is very worrying.  Many of them are now being forced into getting HAP or going into local authority housing.  We are talking about Travellers being nomads and having their own culture, yet this is happening on a big scale.  The community is breaking down in many ways.  We should not allow that to happen.  If people want to stay in their community, we have to try to keep them in that community.  In the context of the mental health of these children and other members of the Traveller community in general, it is very important that we keep them within their own communities and we provide accommodation.</p> <p>  I have seen so many reports through the years and dealt with so many different issues.  It is actions that are really needed.  We need to push local authorities and change the mindset of many in local authorities, as well as local people and politicians, who are blocking progress, which is unacceptable.  I do no know what the ombudsman can do in terms of pushing this issue.  How does one push it?  Does one have to get onto a committee, as suggested, to oversee this issue?  Do we have to start identifying problems place by place or county by county?  Do we look at each place and figure out the way in which local authorities are dealing with the Traveller community in general?  Is that the best way to do it?   These issues are so widespread that I think we have a big job ahead of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.658" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021061500002#G00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He has identified several areas where he believes the same issues are arising.  I cannot argue with that.  That is why we hope this will be a trigger event rather than a one-off report.  It should be the start of something.  It is not our role to follow through at the level proposed by the Deputy in terms of getting involved with the authorities or accommodation.</p><p>Our job is to present this report to the Oireachtas and to make sure that the political and governmental systems takes over.  That is why we are pushing this with the political leaders.  As mentioned by Deputy Ellis, action is needed to change the mindset of the local people and the politicians.  The best way to do that is to have success, that is, to successfully move Travellers into the right systems, the right housing and the right safe, secure accommodation for the Travellers, which integrates well with wherever they need to be and provides for that nomadic lifestyle the Deputy spoke about.  Whether the local authority with which we are engaged is to create a successful template that others can only or it is the first of many in a national initiative that is fine, but as previously stated by the former rapporteur for child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, in regard to Ireland, we have some of the best legislation, policies and procedures but we suffer from implementation disorder.  As I see it, the legislation is strong and clear but the politicians are ignoring it.  They are bypassing it.  They are using the one piece, the veto under section 8, that allows the planning to be blocked.  This is providing an opportunity for people to block progress.  We need to look at that.  The mindset will be changed if we can get a successful move in the right direction for a number of areas and start using them as examples.  That will really make a difference.  </p><p> The Deputy mentioned the DEIS schools.  A great many schools are working hard to provide opportunities for these children.  I have met many young Traveller children, in particular the girls, who are bright as buttons and as sharp as can be.  They told me of restricted timetables and teachers telling them that nothing much is expected of them because they will leave school when they are 12.  These children have ambitions that are not being fulfilled.  They want to be doctors, lawyers, nurses and so on.  The mindset of people around them stifles them as well.  If we can make progress on accommodation, all of the other areas will start to grow as well and all of the opportunities will begin to broaden out in front of those children.  We will be pushing hard for this particular investigation to be successful and for the recommendations to be fulfilled, which we hope Members of the Oireachtas can then use to drive forward overall change for the next five years.  </p></speech>

I join in the welcome to Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward.  I also welcome the report, No End in Site.  Our aim and aspiration is to have action now on this matter and for this parliamentary term to be remembered as the term in which the question of Traveller accommodation was properly taken on.</p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned that he will engage in follow-up meetings.  I understand his remarks on the importance of implementation.  I agree that the process should be consultative and that we should try to coax people towards achieving results using the carrot rather than the stick until such time as the stick is required.  Should the need for the stick arise - we pray that will not be the case - Dr. Muldoon will bring a report to the Oireachtas.  I should, perhaps, know the answer to the following question, but what is the limit of the statutory obligations or powers of the Ombudsman for Children?  If a report is presented to the Oireachtas, does this then become a discretionary matter for the Oireachtas?  Does the Oireachtas have anything more than a moral obligation to act on Dr. Muldoon's findings?  I ask Dr. Muldoon to outline the law around that as I am sure people watching online might also like to know that.  </p> <p>  The case has been well made by so many.  All children must have play areas.  This is fundamental to their development and growth.  They must have proper housing, healthy housing conditions and housing that is no different to that of anybody else.  These things should be a given in this century in light of the level of resources available.  It has to be our ambition and aim to achieve a set of actions that bring this about.  I wish Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward well in their coaxing process.  I would welcome a response on where they can go with the stick if the carrot fails.  Were the public to bring pressure on the various elected representatives that would have an implication too, but that is probably not likely in the short term and so we do need to deal with it this way.  </p> <p>  I welcome the report.  We need to ensure it is implemented.  If there is any way that we can fit into the process, including by way of direct engagement, we should do so.  </p></speech>

On the limit of our statutory obligations, we can make recommendations.  The essence of the role of an ombudsman around the world is to create moral suasion.  That is the essence of how we work.  The reason we do not go for binding recommendations is that as soon as we do that type of an investigation, people lawyer up and it becomes a different type of process and we do not get the change that we have seen.  As I said, we engaged for three years with this local authority.  The final year of the engagement was about progress being made internally without anybody having to know about it and conversations that led to these recommendations being accepted.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, the Ombudsman for Children was set up in 2002 and it commenced operations in 2004.  We have not yet had to do this but if we find ourselves in a situation where we need to do it, we will write to the Secretary General or the Minister of the Department - in this case the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage - advising it that we intend to bring a report to the Oireachtas.  That tends to focus the mind.  As far as I know, that has happened only once under my predecessor.  Departments then tend to follow through and help to create satisfaction on our part.  That would be my intention.  Ultimately, if we end up bringing a report to the Oireachtas there will be a moral, but not statutory, obligation on the Oireachtas to finish implementing the recommendations.  I would expect that if it gets to the stage where a Minister is being told by an ombudsman that the nation and the house of Government are not happy with the way in which recommendations are being followed through, that would be a strong argument for getting it done.  As I said, that is very much a final solution. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.662" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021061500002#H00400"><p>As there are no further contributions from members, I would like to make a brief contribution.  It is a privilege to have been asked by the Chairperson to chair this meeting in her stead.  It has been a very useful meeting.  The report, in its detail, is very stark and important.  Unfortunately, there are many cases of similar type throughout the country.  We do not need to do much study to know that.  Most of us know that already.  The testimony of members today points to this not being a one-off situation, unfortunately.</p> <p>  There is another matter of concern.  The report looks at the Traveller issue not only from the point of view of accommodation but in regard to children because children are the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  The report is a wake-up call for us too.  We know how much early childhood experiences influence people's later life experiences in terms of health, education opportunities and so on.  The report highlights, from the prism of a child, the impact of lack of action in this area.  I can assure Dr. Muldoon that the committee will look carefully at the recommendations in the context of its report, which has a wider remit across the Traveller experience in our society.</p><p> I have a question regarding Part 8.  I believe it presents a barrier and we should be honest enough to admit that societal attitudes create that barrier because where accommodation for Travellers is proposed, pressure is often brought to bear on politicians.  I have argued for a long time that that issue should be dealt with and have asked whether Part 8 should perhaps be suspended.  Two suggestions have been made, one of which relates to handing the responsibility to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the short term, whether five years or whatever, or permanently, as was done in other cases.  People would be allowed to make observations and the board would then make a decision in line with Government policy.  The other idea was to have a dedicated national accommodation authority, although one problem with that, and I would be interested in hearing our guests' views, is it could take some time before that could be set up.</p><p> I thought the clarification Dr. Muldoon gave was very useful.  He seems to be saying that, as is the case in all ombudsman Acts, the ultimate power he has is to report to the Oireachtas.  He is throwing the baton to us, to the Oireachtas as a whole and to this committee specifically, which has been charged by the Oireachtas to examine how Travellers should be treated as full and equal citizens in our community.  Dr. Muldoon might confirm that that is where responsibility ultimately goes, that the buck stops here in the Oireachtas and that we should call to account the Government and all its agencies to deal with this issue once and for all, and ensure that no more children will ever grow up in the conditions outlined in his report.</p></speech>

We did not set ourselves up as experts in Traveller accommodation and legislation.  We have learned about it through three years of investigation and through experts coming together to create that report in 2019.  One recommendation related to the suspension of Part 8.  While I can see difficulties with doing that, something radical has to happen.  We have to change the legislation in some way or other.  On the An Bord Plean&aacute;la suggestion, I could not comment on whether that is a better option.  From our point of view, it is about creating movement because the paralysis of the system is allowed through Part 8.</p> <p>  People are crowded.  If a site starts off with ten bays, it can end up with 20 caravans.  The key is to get people onto another site or into social housing.  If a plan is made to build social housing or to generate a new site and that is blocked, it may end up that the 20 caravans becomes 30, and there is a paralysis of the system.  Something needs to be shaken up and that means being radical and suspending or changing something.  I am not going to say clearly what the political route should be but there is an option in front of the Oireachtas with a really well thought-out report, and the decision has to be made quickly.  We need to start making it happen.</p> <p>  When I launched the report, I likened the issue to the tenements.  In Dublin, one can go on a tour of a tenement, which shows that living in those conditions in the early 1900s was almost better than some of the sites the committee has discussed.  We eradicated that from our general population 50 years ago and we would not allow it to happen now, yet every politician in the D&aacute;il is standing over that if they allow their local government politicians to continue to use Part 8 in that way and to allow the influence to come forward.  Those children deserve the right to live in a safe, secure and comfortable home in the way in which they want to live.  They have a right to play, health and education, and those rights need to start from proper accommodation.</p> <p>  As for whether I have passed the baton to the Oireachtas, I believe that is what should happen.  I hope all we need to do is talk to the committee, and members can make the difference in pushing forward with their colleagues and as a committee with its report.  I hate to think I would end up coming back with a special report, but if we did that, it would definitely be a matter of handing the matter back to the Oireachtas to take control and do something about it.</p> <p>  I hope it will not get to that stage.  I would love to think that in 12 months, we will have a report indicating I am satisfied with the progress made and we can see real differences for the children on that site.  I will keep my fingers crossed in that regard and we will work as hard as we can with the local authority to ensure that happens.  I hope the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Taoiseach will, as was indicated, put forward opportunities for those local authorities to make a difference.</p></speech>

He is seeking that throughout the system, we as the Oireachtas and the Government insist on action being taken to deal with this issue.</p> <p>  The discussion has been very beneficial and informative.  On behalf of the committee, I thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward for attending.  It is a pity the meeting had to be held virtually.  We too are time constrained and we cannot put this issue on the back burner while Covid is here.  Whether it is ours or another committee that will in future deal with the specific issue of ensuring that Traveller children have rights equal to every other child in society, across the entire spectrum of their lives, I hope that on the next occasion our guests are invited into the Oireachtas, it will be in person.  Good and all as virtual meetings are, nothing beats being here in person.</p> <p>  As no other members are indicating, that concludes our business today.</p></speech>

I welcome everyone to this meeting of the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  We have no correspondence to consider and no minutes for adoption.  The agenda for today's meeting is the trade and co-operation agreement between the EU and the UK, the Northern Ireland protocol, and the EU-UK relationship post Brexit.</p> <p>  I have to go through the usual privilege spiel for our witness, Commissioner McGuinness.  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence that they give to a committee.  This means that a witness has a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third party or entity.  Witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.</p><p>Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside of the proceedings held by the committee, of any matters arising from the proceedings.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House campus.  In this regard, I ask all members to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their initial contribution to the meeting.  If they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p><p> Our witness today is EU Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union, Ms Mairead McGuinness.  I understand that the Commissioner is going to make an opening statement so I will hand over to her.  I thank her for her time this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.672" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mairead McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021061500002#B00200"><p>I thank the Senators for the invitation to join them this morning because it is very timely.  Next week, on 23 June, we will mark the fifth anniversary of the UK referendum to leave the European Union and, while I do not intend to rehash that decision or the events of the last five years, it is true to say that getting Brexit done was and is much easier said than done.  It is also worth noting that the implications of Brexit for Ireland and Northern Ireland were known five years ago.  Indeed, Sir John Major and Mr. Tony Blair came together in Derry and pointed out the realities of Brexit and the implications for Ireland in view of the fact that the invisible Irish Border would become the frontier between the UK and the European Union.  In fact, Brexit reintroduced the word &quot;border&quot;, which had long been forgotten, and reintroduced the implications of the word for the island of Ireland.  It is sad to say that those concerns were dismissed out of hand by Leave campaigners and they did not make a ripple in the overall campaign and debate on Brexit.  However, five years later, and it is quite extraordinary to think that it is five years, these issues are still confronting us and some, I believe, are still in denial.<br/><br/>On 1 January this year, Brexit formally took place and we are now actively working to implement the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the withdrawal agreement.  My colleague, Vice-President of the EU Commission, <font color="#202124">Mr.</font>Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, is responsible for monitoring their implementation and co-chairs the joint committee and the partnership council with Lord Frost, his UK counterpart.  I strongly stress to the committee that we want a good relationship with the United Kingdom as a close neighbour and a partner.  We believe that relationship must be built on trust.  Without trust we are nowhere.  The Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, and the withdrawal agreement provide the framework for the EU's relationship with the United Kingdom and the TCA represents the best possible outcome, given the UK's choice of a hard Brexit.  We got as good a result as was possible within those limits - comprehensive access to the UK market with zero quotas and zero tariffs alongside a robust level playing field.  The TCA gives the tools we need to build a positive and stable relationship with the UK.  It also gives us the tools to monitor the UK's commitments and to guard against divergence.<br/><br/>Full implementation of the withdrawal agreement is also a prerequisite for a good relationship built on trust.  After four years of difficult negotiations, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed the protocol together.  It remains the best and only possible solution to ensure peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and to protect the Good Friday Agreement while protecting the integrity of the EU's Single Market.  The protocol reflects the political choices of the United Kingdom.  Indeed, the protocol was a UK choice.  Members will recall that in the beginning the UK negotiated the backstop under the then Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May.  Later, Mr. Boris Johnson pushed to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and he agreed the protocol with the European Union.  The EU agreed the protocol in good faith, expecting that an international agreement negotiated collectively with the United Kingdom and signed by the European Union and the United Kingdom would be fully implemented.<br/><br/>The UK's choice to leave the Single Market and the customs union has consequences.  It makes trade between the UK and the European Union more difficult, with more red tape and more paperwork.  The protocol addresses some of those consequences for Northern Ireland.  Of course, there are still challenges with the implementation of the protocol, particularly when it comes to the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and especially around plant and animal health measures or sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, measures, to use the jargon.  On our side, the European Union continues to engage with the United Kingdom through the joint committee, in good faith, to find pragmatic solutions within the framework of the protocol.  We want to help citizens and businesses in Northern Ireland to adapt and to limit the impact on daily life across the island of Ireland.<br/><br/>The Commission has already identified flexibilities and technical solutions, including on the very sensitive SPS measures, medicines, VAT and tariff rate quotas.  On medicines, I stress that the European Union is very sensitive to public health issues, particularly in a pandemic.  I assure the committee that the European Union wants to ensure absolute continuity of the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland.  We cannot do this on our own, however.  If we are to put forward practical, workable solutions, we need the United Kingdom to demonstrate that it is committed to full implementation of the protocol.  In a way, there must be joint endeavour between both sides.  Unfortunately, from our side, there are fundamental gaps in the UK's implementation of the agreement.  The European Union has the tools to deal with these challenges, such as the infringement procedure launched in March due to the UK breaching its obligations under the protocol.  If the UK were to take further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU would react firmly to ensure that the UK abides by its obligations under international law.  There comes a point in a relationship when if one is not being fairly treated or treated with respect, there is a need to respond.  I stress again, however, that we will continue engaging constructively with the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>The people on this island are aware that the impact of Brexit is already being felt and will continue to be felt for many years to come.  Both the European Union and the United Kingdom have a responsibility to engage in close dialogue to ensure the full and effective implementation of the TCA and the withdrawal agreement but, as my colleague, <font color="#202124">Mr.</font>Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, said recently, trust, which should be at the heart of every relationship, needs to be restored.  To have trust, we have to know that the UK will meet the commitments it made under the arrangements.<br/><br/>I am happy to listen to the comments of members of the committee, which is an important committee, and to share with them some of the issues that are still to be resolved.  I believe that with goodwill and a practical approach we can resolve those issues.</p></speech>

It was interesting to hear her refer to the backstop.  It seems like a lifetime ago that we were in that space.  It is almost five years since the referendum and we have come a long way, but there is still a long way to go.</p> <p>  I should have mentioned at the outset that I wish to congratulate Senator Dooley, who was confirmed at the weekend as interim co-president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, Party following the unfortunate recent death of the party's president, Mr. Hans van Baalen.  We send our condolences to his family and congratulate Senator Dooley on stepping up to that position.</p> <p>  To ensure every member gets a chance to contribute, I propose to give each member five minutes.  In that five minutes the member will ask his or her question or questions but must also allow time for the Commissioner to respond within the five minutes.  If there is time we will have a second round, but everybody will have an opportunity to contribute in the first round.</p> <p>  On that note, I will put a question to the Commissioner.  She said the EU would react firmly if the UK were to continue down its path, if I can paraphrase it, of taking decisions unilaterally.  We saw recent reports from the excellent RT&Eacute; journalist, Mr. Tony Connelly, in which he said that the EU will take a measured approach or response to any further unilateral moves by the UK to delay implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.  If the UK again extends the time or delays implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, what will that measured response or firm reaction from the EU look like?</p><p>What can Ireland expect?  We were quite concerned at reports in the past week that there may be potential, as a last resort, to impose checks on goods coming from the Republic of Ireland to mainland Europe should the UK fail to implement the Northern Ireland protocol fully.  I would welcome the Commissioner's comments and remarks on that.</p></speech>

As she said, five years later we are still having this conversation because, before the ballots were cast, there was not enough conversation about the practical implications of Brexit.  There certainly was not a focus on the real implications for Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  To deal with the Chair's second question on rumours and concerns about where checks might potentially take place, I was very happy to hear my colleague, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, deny that completely.  There is no interest at the Commission or in the European Union to make the problem an Irish problem because clearly this is a Brexit problem.  It is a decision of the United Kingdom, which it took, in my view, without due consideration of the wider implications.  Since the date of that referendum we have been trying to work towards agreements with the United Kingdom to minimise the disruption and damage.</p> <p>  In my view, Brexit is a fragmenting event and there is no upside to it.  I know the UK takes a different view but I certainly do not see any upside.  Even if we look at how we have to restructure to engage with the United Kingdom, there are a plethora of committees now, which are perhaps more bureaucratic than if the UK was a full member, but that is in the past.  I stress to the committee that there is no discussion in the college about the sensitive point raised by the Cathaoirleach that checks could take place elsewhere, the inference being that Ireland would be disadvantaged in terms of access to the Single Market.  I can understand why these discussions are taking place and why people fear this, but I stress very clearly that it is not on the agenda and there is again, and remains, huge sensitivity to the island of Ireland and Ireland as a full member of the European Union.</p> <p>  On the Chair's first point regarding a measured response, it is important to reflect on what happened and why we were forced to take legal action.  Imagine being in a room with somebody negotiating a deal, a conversation is had, the meeting ends and the second party goes outside to make a unilateral declaration that it will diverge from the agreement signed up to.  This party has not told you or even passed a note to say this might happen or given the courtesy of a heads-up.  That is very damaging because, when trying to work out problems, people have to be very honest with each other and deal with that in the room in a very honest way.</p> <p>  As to the measured response, the legal route is there.  There are other potential avenues that are contained in the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  It is not helpful for me to outline what might happen "if"'.  It is important for me to stress that we hope that will not happen.  We hope that whatever needs to be done to resolve the complexities around the settling in of the protocol in Northern Ireland will be negotiated around the table as equal partners, respecting each other's very different views but understanding that, when it comes to Northern Ireland, we have a shared responsibility.  Again, all the efforts made from the moment of that referendum in 2016 right through to now are mindful of the unique situation of Northern Ireland.  That was how Michel Barnier dealt with the TCA discussions and how my colleague, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, is dealing with the issue now.  He and I talk practically every day and exchange concerns, hopes and fears.  We will do that again this afternoon in college.</p></speech>

I will try to be succinct with a number of points.  Given we are seeing rising tensions in the North, we may yet see an election there and we are moving towards the marching season, does it make sense to look at a negotiated extension of the grace period?  Related to that, and the Commissioner's point about building trust is very valid, what long-term mechanisms should we put in place to ensure trust is built between the various parties?  The fear is that it will be sausages this month and chicken nuggets the next.  There will always be an issue that may be used for political reasons.</p> <p>  My second question is on an issue that has come up regularly before this committee - it relates to flour and we heard it yesterday on whiskey and dairy - which is flexibility around rules of origin.  Does the Commissioner have views on that issue?</p> <p>  As the Commissioner is aware, the UK and Australia are due to sign a trade deal today, which is the first of the non-rollover trade deals.  What impact will this have on Ireland, North and South, particularly on Irish agriculture?  Does she believe it says something about the kind of trade deals the UK wants to negotiate into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-15a.677" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mairead McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021061500002#C00400"><p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  We have not heard details about the Australia deal.  It is very much a broad announcement, which, if it has not been made already, will say that they are going to reach a trade agreement.  Of course, the UK is free to do that.  When it comes to the detail, farmers in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland are already very concerned, especially beef farmers, because if there is an increased quantity of beef coming from Australia, it will displace existing suppliers, including beef farmers on the island on Ireland.  That will impact price.  There are genuine concerns but let us wait until we see the detail of those trade agreements.  It does seem a long way to bring product, but that is a separate issue.</p> <p>  On the rules of origin, when I was still a member of the European Parliament and, indeed, in the past five years, I had much representation from the dairy sector, which I am familiar with, and the alcohol sector about this issue.  To be very clear, the rules of origin exist and are as they are.  Brexit is the problem.  Brexit has caused so much disruption, including to this all-island dairy market, which has developed over time because Northern Ireland does not have sufficient processing capacity.  My late father supplied milk that produced Bailey's, so I have a personal interest in this and a real concern about the disruption to supply chains.  This is an issue I know there is a lot representation on.  I still say the rules of origin are as they are and changing them is problematic.  What might be helpful is, if we can get over these difficulties around the broader implementation, in time we could look in a measured way at these issues.  I note that, yesterday, the head of the dairy sector in the North very much supported the protocol while also raising problems.  Frankly, we will continue to deal with problems arising from Brexit for decades because you cannot have been together for decades, as the UK and the European Union were, and unpick without problems.</p> <p>  We are all very sensitive to tensions in Northern Ireland.  I am originally from County Louth and live in Meath.  I have had the great pleasure of saying to my children that the past was not a good place but we have come a long way, through many efforts on every side in Northern Ireland and support from the US and the European Union.  We should very much be mindful of that, and we all are, while understanding that Brexit is the problem that has caused all of these tensions to arise again.  Perhaps, when the withdrawal agreement was signed, the UK Government did not take the opportunity of the time between that and Brexit happening to help market players adjust.  The Irish Government did.  Some of the messages for Irish supply chains were extremely difficult, but at least the message was given that they needed to adjust.  In the case of Northern Ireland, that did not happen and it needs to.  That is why we allowed for grace periods and, to the Senator's point, why, if grace periods are to be extended, the best and only way to do that is in discussion and with an agreed solution.  If something is done unilaterally, it just does not help us to move forward because it raises concerns that this may be the way the UK intends to continue.  That is why there is very much a worry at EU level that should that be the path the UK chooses, we have to examine how we deal with it, stressing again that we regard the UK and the European Union as needing to be as close as they were when they were together, even with some of the differences that emerged, because we have to deal with all sorts of issues, not just the ones we talk about today but big global issues.</p> <p>  I apologise if I did not answer one of the Senator's points.  I may have time later to refer back.</p></speech>

I am in the convention centre.  It is probably easier to get the technological side of things sorted in Brussels than it is in the convention centre, but sin sc&eacute;al eile.</p><p> I did hear the Commissioner reiterate a message of regret regarding Brexit and the fallout from it.  As someone who comes from and lives in the North, and has been elected to the Seanad, I am acutely aware of the negative fallout from Brexit, not least in the context of the North having voted against it.</p><p> We heard various sectors reaffirming clear support for the Northern protocol at a meeting of this committee as recently as yesterday.  The Commissioner touched on that matter.  It is important to remember and reiterate that the vast majority of people, organisations, business sectors and stakeholders in the North are supportive of the protocol and that is the pre-eminent position of a range of society.  It is, as I say, important to reiterate that point.</p><p> The issue of engagement has come to the fore recently from the sectors and key stakeholders.  Representatives of the dairy and whiskey sectors were before the committee yesterday.  They feel like they are banging their heads against a wall.  I wonder how damaging the loss of the EU office and the Commission presence in the North has been.  Is there anything we can look at, whether from the perspective of trade and co-operation or a citizens' rights perspective, in order to try to make up some of the lost ground?  We know there was political controversy, the British Government refused the EU's request for an office and all of that.  I do not think that should put an end to us trying to solidify, reaffirm, improve and tweak the level of engagement where it is needed.  I am concerned that sectors are starting to feel that they do not have the same level of weight and breakthrough to the Commission and the EU institutions.  I am also concerned that the clear majority view in support of the protocol is not getting the lift that it warrants.</p><p> Perhaps the Commissioner will take the opportunity to explain why the protocol is supported by so many people, the reason it is in place and the reason we need it to remain in place, going forward, if she has not already done so.  I apologise again for missing the start of the meeting.</p></speech>

There is no need to apologise.  I can assure him I have had my fair share of technical hitches so we are all in the same boat.  The Senator asked me to explain why the protocol is necessary.  I stressed in my opening remarks that, in a way, the issue of Northern Ireland was not given sufficient attention when the decision to call a referendum was taken or during the campaign.  I was still a member of the European Parliament at that time and my office was an open door in the context of representations from Northern Ireland because Northern Ireland had no voice.  There was a real sense at that time that Northern Ireland's position was not getting enough of a hearing.  I tried my very best to offer that.</p> <p>  At a wider level, we all know we need to engage more.  The European Parliament, for example, needs to engage with the Northern Ireland Assembly.  We need to have political conversations or chats to ease tensions.  That is hugely important.</p> <p>  The Senator said that stakeholders are supportive of the protocol.  It seemed to me that stakeholders who were supportive were a little concerned about expressing that publicly because of fear that it was not the story that was politically acceptable at a higher level in the United Kingdom.  The business community now sees the opportunities of being rightly a part of the UK, with free-market access, and with equally free access to the market of the European Union.  There are considerable opportunities in that regard and that is why we continue to say we need full implementation of the protocol to harness the potential opportunities that arise from this unique situation.  There have, equally, been challenges and that is why if there were a deeper level of engagement, we could sort out those challenges.  Let me be clear, if not blunt, when I say that when one signs something with a counter-party, one expects it to be implemented, not to be torn up.  We are not sure whether the UK is actually committed to implementing it in full and would need clarity from the UK side on that.  I read in opinion pieces, etc., that there is almost a suggestion the problem has been made by Europe because we forced the United Kingdom to sign the protocol.  In fact, we favoured the Theresa May option but the UK and Boris Johnson chose otherwise.</p></speech>

It is my great pleasure to congratulate the Commissioner and wish her well.  This is the first public occasion I have had to express that.  From my knowledge as one of her constituents, and as a colleague, I know she will bring huge energy and capacity to the role.  That is clear already.  I echo the Chair's congratulations to our colleague, Senator Dooley, on his European position.  It is always good if we are gaining influence in our respective parties on the Continent.</p><p>Brexit is, of course, inherently divisive.  It is divisive in Europe and, ironically and contrary to the intentions at the outset, it is divisive within the UK.  The big anxiety I see, as has been touched on, is about our need to ensure that Ireland does not become collateral damage in a dispute between the UK and the EU around the protocol.  Having said that, the protocol is crucial.  The Commissioner touched on this a moment ago, but the business sector and interest groups in Northern Ireland are beginning to drift away from the politicians in their positions on the protocol.  That was visible during our meeting with representatives of the dairy and whiskey industries yesterday.  They are not <i>ad idem </i>with political leadership in the North on their view of the protocol.  Will the Commissioner comment on how she sees the negotiations on the protocol?  We in Ireland have a vested interest in a good trading relationship with the UK.  That is clearly beyond measure and our interest is in a negotiated outcome rather than a conflict.  I am interested to hear what the Commissioner anticipates will happen in that regard.</p><p>The veterinary agreement is much talked about, as are the SPS arrangements.  How optimistic is the Commissioner in that regard?  Those are crucial for the livestock business and for trading east-west.  I am interested to hear the Commissioner's response.</p><p>I will return to the question about country of origin labelling that arose yesterday.  I do not have to tell the Commissioner because of the constituency she represented when she was a member of the European Parliament how crucial that issue is.  The food processing sector is a major one along the Border, in Meath, where the Commissioner lives, in Louth and in all of those places.  I will not go through the list of processing units but they are all over the place.  They are the only show in town, economically and socially, and are a means of keeping people in the community.  In some places, they are the only job available.  It would, therefore, be disappointing if we did not do something about the question of country of origin labelling in the context of exports.  I would be disappointed if that happened and I invite the Commissioner to come back on that matter.  I was a little disturbed to hear her say that might not be alterable and I hope it will be.</p><p>Those are my comments.  It is a great pleasure to talk to the Commissioner.  The country is in safe hands with her.</p></speech>

While I live in the constituency of Meath East, I am actually a constituent in Cavan-Monaghan so the Senator and I have a shared territory.</p> <p>  I will turn to the points the Senator has made.  Brexit is divisive and I have referred to its fragmenting effect.  When the EU comprised 28 members, none of these problems arose.  Five years later, we are seeing that Brexit was not easy at all.  It is still quite a political story in the United Kingdom.  From the EU side, we have, in a sense, moved on.  We are trying to say that we need to implement what has been agreed and let us get on with our business.  We have a public health crisis, issues that will arise from the recovery, unemployment and all sorts of things with which we need to deal collectively with the United Kingdom.  I agree that the divisiveness does not help but I want to absolutely stress that while there is some bewilderment, to put it mildly, about how the UK is approaching these discussions, we are continuing to talk.  It was interesting that Lord Frost made the point that there was no breakthrough in talks but there was no breakdown.  Perhaps that is progress, in a nutshell.</p> <p>  The protocol is crucial because I shudder to think what the implications would be if there were nothing place.  Perhaps some who are concerned about the protocol do not realise that they need to compare the protocol to the situation that would obtain if nothing was agreed.  I think they are comparing it with life before Brexit, which is utopian and unreal.</p><p>Perhaps even those in the North who voted for Brexit are now beginning to understand the implications of that vote.  We will continue to negotiate in good faith and we want an agreed solution.  The rules on animal and plant health origin are very important from an Irish point of view because we know what happens when diseases cross borders.  We do say to the UK, and we have said it repeatedly as have others, that we can solve a lot of these problems even with a temporary agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary, not a forced agreement but a temporary agreement.  I am being given the five minute science so I will come back on some of the comments on rules of origin, if I may, towards the end if the Cathaoirleach will give me some time.</p></speech>

This is the first opportunity I have to do so publicly.  I also congratulate my colleague, Senator Dooley, on his elevation.  From the east to the west of the country we are well served in Europe.</p> <p>  I will be very brief as a lot of the points have already been raised by my colleagues.  With regard to the protocol, I do have a degree of sympathy for the unionist community in that it has been very badly served by Boris Johnson and his Government.  They are treated differently to any other part of the UK as a result of the protocol and we need to be sensitive to this fact.  The Commissioner, coming from the neck of the wood she does, is well aware of this.  It is important that everyone in Europe is also aware of it.</p> <p>  Having said all of this, I can feel the Commissioner's pain, so to speak, on the huge frustration that must exist in the EU about its dealings with the UK Government.  It is absolutely baffling to listen to Boris Johnson speak about a protocol he signed off on and, as the Commissioner outlined in her opening contribution, the UK Parliament signed and sealed the protocol.  Now, it is as if he fell asleep during the entire process and is only waking up today to the ramifications of that agreement.  This is truly frustrating.</p> <p>  At the end of her contribution, the Commissioner hinted the EU may have to play tough at some point in this, in whatever shape or form this may take.  I am afraid we might become collateral damage in all of this, and I have no doubt the Commissioner is well aware of this.  Europe might get fed up hanging around dealing with the UK and put the foot down, and we might be the losers in this regard because, potentially, no country will be as affected by the negativity of Brexit as us.  Is this sentiment floating around in Brussels with the rest of the Commissioner's partners in discussions?  Is she hearing this?</p> <p>  Other colleagues have made points on country of origin.  It is important that every country shows flexibility on this issue, and this would extend to the EU.  Country of origin was mentioned yesterday several times by representatives from the National Dairy Council and people from the whiskey community.  It is something we need to be aware of and I would like to think Europe would show a degree of flexibility on this also.</p></speech>

We need to be straight about this.  There is frustration but equally there is pragmatism.  We have good agreements and we want to implement them.  We are trying to convince our UK colleagues that the best way to do this is at the table.  I believe we can come to this position.  We have had various waves where things get heated in the public space and we have to let them flow and then things settle back down again.  The Senator is right to acknowledge and have a degree of sympathy for the unionist community.  He summed up how perhaps they feel badly served.  It is also important to stress that members of the unionist community supported Brexit.  They did not support the Theresa May option.  They believed Boris Johnson would deliver for them an agreement that would meet their needs.  They find this is not now the case.  We have to understand their sensitivity, and I do.  I absolutely understand.  I hope they will understand that what we are trying to do is solve the problems we have and find really good solutions to some of these problems.</p> <p>  I ask that rather than inflame a problem we need to deflate it and sort it.  Perhaps there has been too much focusing on the difficult parts and ignoring the massive opportunities.  Again, I would say the UK Government when it signed the agreement left it on the shelf and did not really interpret it or communicate it and did not put in the preparations needed in Northern Ireland to avoid the very situation we are in today.  This goes back to the very famous line of getting Brexit done.  If we do things in haste we will have regret and this is what we are now seeing.  Certainly there is big regret throughout communities.  We regret in the European Union that what is happening is actually happening.  We do not need this.  We need to work together.</p></speech>

This is the first opportunity I have had and how delighted we are she has found the time to meet us this morning.  I wish Senator Dooley well on his recent appointment.  I would like to get the opinion of the Commissioner on an issue and I invite her to comment on it.  This is the much used phrase about the best of both worlds for Northern Ireland.  One aspect of this is Northern Ireland's relationship with the EU.  In her previous capacity as an MEP, the Commissioner's door was always open to Northern Ireland concerns.  The special select committee played that role in hearing these representations and passing them on, as do many other vehicles in the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  Northern Ireland does not rely on Whitehall to fight for it in respect of this one aspect of the best of both worlds.  In the longer term, when east-west relations do not specifically cover the constituency of concern, although we are doing very well at present utilising existing infrastructural consultative mechanisms, is there not a need for more open formalised long-term two-way access for Northern Ireland in this new territory for the EU as well as Northern Ireland?  What is the view of the Commissioner on this?  They are very welcome and they come down to Dublin all the time, but could there be a more direct line?  If not, the Oireachtas really has to look at this in a more than piecemeal way and have a formalised voice for them in the Oireachtas.  We have to work on this even if it requires constitutional reform.  I would like the views of the Commissioner on this.</p></speech>

I really appreciate them.  The Senator has raised a really important point on how we can engage formally and informally and have effective engagement because we do not have it at present and it is key.  Perhaps the report could deal with some of these issues.  When I was a Member of the European Parliament I dealt with national parliaments through the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and I was a big supporter of this engagement because sometimes Europe is regarded as remote.</p> <p>  The European Parliament and national parliaments need to find a way to engage with Northern Ireland stakeholders that perhaps is not happening at present.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has tried on a number of occasions to reach out with David Frost to stakeholders in Northern Ireland and talk through the problems and solutions.  This invitation was not taken up.  I wonder why this is the case because there is no doubt whatever our differences are, and the committee knows them, the best way to sort them is to talk about them and resolve them.</p> <p>  The Senator has hit on a bigger point, which is that in order to get over what has been a deeply fragmenting five years, when Northern Ireland's position is more unstable than it was because of the Brexit vote, which Northern Ireland did not support but being part of the United Kingdom has got to go with it, we need to find deeper ways and long-term engagement in order that we can solve problems before they get difficult.  On a personal level, I was struck, when I was Vice President in the Parliament and my door was open to Northern Ireland stakeholders, that they felt they had no voice at a really critical time.  The committee has a role to play.  I also urge my colleagues in the European Parliament to look at what role they can play and I am sure they will do so because we all know that in politics whatever our differences are the only way to solve them is to talk.</p><p>We need to find a way to calm the situation in Northern Ireland.  We are coming up to a sensitive time and, therefore, what we are saying to the UK is that we should sit down and resolve these problems and work together to reduce tensions, to explain why things are the way they are and to find practical ways around particular problems for sectors and reinforce the positives.  I do not know why that is not happening but I think it should.  I would support whatever the committee does in relation to deepening that engagement, whether it is formal, informal or issue specific.</p><p> Before Brexit happened, if one talked to the farming community, there was no border.  There is a dairy industry that is all-island and it worked really well.  Brexit disrupted that.  That is a tragedy for in the industry, for farmers and their families and workers.  Politically, we have to find solutions and ways of engaging.</p></speech>

The Commissioner might share her thoughts on a proposal that emanated yesterday or the day before from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, where he suggested that it might be possible to find a middle ground with some kind of independent monitoring.  What is the Commissioner's view on that or has the College of Commissioners had any thoughts there?</p> <p>  It is clear that the relationship between &Scaron;efovi and Lord Frost is, at best, strained.  Is there any role for Michel Barnier to resume some kind of an EU negotiating position?  There is a lot of concern that Lord Frost might trigger Article 16 on checks on the basis of societal difficulties.  While that at one time might have seemed somewhat remote, friends of mine in the North are telling me that they have never seen so many Union Jacks flying so early in the year and it clearly signals that there are societal difficulties there.  Has the Commissioner any thoughts or views on that?  I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

We respect that the UK has a different view and has now left the EU but for the sake of Northern Ireland, and at the time we are in and the tensions issues which the Senator alludes to, it would be a calming solution and perhaps would pour oil over troubled waters and get us over this particular difficulty to get to a better place because there are changes politically in Northern Ireland that we are all familiar with.</p> <p>  In relation to the strained relationship, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has long experience in diplomacy and if he feels strained, he is not looking it.  Frankly, he is trying to do his best to get agreement with the UK side.  I think he has a good relationship with Lord Frost.  Maybe the commentary afterwards does not say that but the fact that they can still sit down in a room and talk, in my view, is progress.  There would not be any sense in which there are any attitudes there.  We have a problem to solve and we will get on with it.</p> <p>  Michel Barnier was on television yesterday in France repeating exactly what the Commission is saying today.  On Michel Barnier's role, we all regard him hugely for what he did and he supports the Commission's view on what is happening now.</p> <p>  On Article 16 and the tensions, I am aware of them.  We all are sensitive to this issue.  We would hope that that would not happen and, indeed, there are ways where things have to be done to allow that to happen.  First, let us try talk and see can we resolve these things without going there.</p> <p>  I do not have the details of the proposal by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Effectively, what he is saying is that we have an SPS overarching framework that the UK was part of until 1 January.  Effectively, it is still complying but will diverge.  We are asking that in this very short period they do a temporary deal with us on this, give us that space for them to help their businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland, and take the tension out of these checks.  I would be a little concerned that all we are focusing on in the public discourse are the problems and they are, therefore, becoming bigger than reality.  They are feeding into a political narrative which is saying that it is nasty Europe that is doing this rather than nasty Brexit.  Once we have that understanding, I would repeat with the opportunity of this important committee, we are open to doing a temporary arrangement on SPS to facilitate reducing tensions and allowing business to move on.</p></speech>

They made it clear that the country-of-origin issue needs to be addressed and the implications are massive if you have 40% of Lakeland Dairies milk coming North.  We need to get a solution here.  This divergence in standards will be a big issue for us over the next few decades.  Where will that divergence of standards go?  How will the EU play a part in making sure that standards increase rather than decrease?</p> <p>  Last night, there was an interesting documentary on RT&Eacute; with Michael Portillo regarding the participation in 1921.  It is obvious it became about dialogue and about the ability to talk and engage.  What functions or groupings can be set up to involve more dialogue at political level so that we have the opportunity, maybe between the EU and the UK, and even this Parliament and the UK Parliament, and Northern Ireland and the Republic, to have more dialogue.  Where does that dialogue need to go?</p></speech>

It is a great opportunity for me to be able to share some thoughts with him this morning.</p> <p>  I will try and deal with the rule of origin in some depth because it was an issue across colleagues.  As the Senator will be aware, the rules of origin exist because it is a way of making sure that our trading partners understand that the products we are producing comply with specific rules.  On the dairy and whiskey sectors, I read the transcripts yesterday.  I have also met them previously and I understand the dilemma.  Let us park that to the wider issue of rules of origin.</p> <p>  If there were to be changes, we need to be mindful that that might have other consequences that might not suit us.  Clearly, we have a specific interest in this issue but I would say here, and to the point that Senator Joe O'Reilly raised with me where he was concerned at my remarks, that what I am trying to be is frank and clear that as of now we are not renegotiating the rules of origin but that does not mean that the Senator in his capacity should not keep raising these issues and explaining the sensitivities of them, and see can we find solutions.  What I would see as the priority at the moment is to focus on implementing the TCA and the withdrawal agreement, and then there will be these other issues that arise.  I know it is very sensitive.  The Senator named Lakeland Dairies.  I know this is a real issue because dairy cows and milk flow across that invisible border and Brexit has sundered that to some extent.  Brexit has caused the problems now for us to look at rules of origin.  What I am saying is, and I know Senator Joe O'Reilly was disappointed by my answer, sometimes it is better to be clear and truthful than to be fudging and say we can change these overnight.  It is more complex than that.  The committee has a capacity and a duty to make sure these issues are fully debated and understood.  They may be dealt with in time but the priority now is focusing on implementation.</p> <p>  In relation to dialogue, this is a huge point.  I did not get to see the programme last night but I will watch it.  Dialogue is about talking and listening.  In politics, we know that sometimes the listening bit is more important and the silences are better sometimes than the words.  The EU is based on dialogue.  A day has not gone by here or when I was in the parliament that there was not a disagreement about something but we did not walk away and slam the door.  We worked around words, there was give and take, and we sorted things out.</p><p>If anything, what Brexit shows me is the dangers posed by a fragmentation of the European Union.  I am talking about the one nation of Great Britain and Northern Ireland wanting to be great, sovereign, free and independent but almost suggesting that the formal and informal contacts that the EU has given us are not as good as being able to stand up on one's own two feet.  I take a very different view but that is maybe because I come from a smaller member state.  Whatever the difficulties that we have had over time with the European Union we have a voice and we can use it for good or ill.</p><p> The biggest regrets that I have with Brexit are as follows.  First, the last five years have turned us a little grey if I were to show my true colours.  Second, Brexit has pulled apart the capacity for informal and formal engagement with the United Kingdom but it has made us set up an enormous architecture of a partnership council that is comprised of over 16 specialist committees.  We have replaced one set of bureaucracy, which the UK would refer to, with a completely new set of bureaucracy but dialogue is important and so is listening.</p></speech>

I thank everybody who has borne with me in terms of the tight timekeeping but it was necessary to ensure that everybody had an opportunity to comment.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I wish to say that we have had a worthwhile discussion with the Commissioner.  This is our final public meeting before we start drafting a report next week with a view to publishing in July.  This has been a really important engagement with the Commissioner because she is at the fore of the Brexit issue and has been able to give us the most up-to-date information this morning, which we really appreciate and I know that her schedule is busy.</p> <p>  The Commissioner will have seen from the vast array of questions and issues that we, as a committee, have had to grapple with over the last six months that there are a lot of issues that have yet to be resolved.  She is right that we must focus on implementation and ensuring that people live up to, and abide by, what they signed up to.  Obviously a particular concern for us here is to consider the tensions within Northern Ireland and try our best to ease them and allow people to cool off.  From what we have heard at this committee, there is considerable support for the protocol from business, industry and many citizens in Northern Ireland.  I suggest that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland support the protocol and understand its importance.</p> <p>  As Senator Gallagher has said, it is important that we acknowledge that there is a significant community who have an issue with the protocol.  I am not sure that the veterinary agreement or tinkering around the edges and making adjustments to the protocol will ever satisfy certain groups in Northern Ireland.  I think that is something we will have to work on for the next number of years, particularly as we approach the vote.  Four years post implementation there is a vote on the protocol in Northern Ireland so we must be very mindful of that because the lines have been drawn.</p> <p>  The Commissioner can make some closing remarks and I thank her again.</p></speech>

It is important that I convey those specific issues to my colleagues here in the Commission and I will speak to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi this afternoon.  I am happy to engage again, if that is appropriate.</p> <p>  I want to refer to one of the questions that was raised about the UK's decision not to allow the Commission to continue to have an office in Belfast.  Clearly, it would be better if there were an office because if one is physically present one can engage and get a sense of what is happening.  We must deal with the reality that the United Kingdom has taken a particular decision and wants to act in a particular way but with that said we must find other ways.  So we have our London and Dublin offices.  We have a Seanad and a Parliament in Ireland that wants deep engagement and I think that the European Parliament should be part of your thoughts for the future.  I say that because, and I was reminded of it recently, John Hume did his best work in the European Parliament.  Northern Ireland was his absolute and full focus but he needed the space of the European Union to find a way to talk peace and build peace.  The sensitivities around that in the European Parliament run deep.  There are many colleagues still in Parliament who remember that time and we should use that to get the European Parliament to be a wider voice, through different structures, in order that people in Northern Ireland have a sense that they will be listened to.  We are not interfering.  We want to listen and we want to help.</p> <p>  It does none of us good to know the reality that there is now increased tensions.  Equally, there is now a political responsibility in Northern Ireland, the UK and the European Union to dampen tensions with practical solutions, which we have offered.  If there were fewer headlines and opinion pieces but more dialogue in the room then we would be in a better place.  I hope that we can get there and I believe that we will.</p></speech>

I agree with her suggestion and I am sure that the committee members also agree.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank the Commissioner for giving of her time and engaging with the committee.  Today is the last day that we will hear from witnesses in a public session.  The draft report will be forwarded to committee members very shortly and we will take the next couple of weeks to go through it, and finalise its contents.  We are looking at a planned date of publication in the first week of July.  I thank everyone.  As there is no further business to be considered the committee now stands adjourned.</p></speech>
