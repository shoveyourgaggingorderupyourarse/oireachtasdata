    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Dennehy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019120400002#C00300"><p>I am the industrial director for Danone Ireland.  Danone is the largest dairy group in the world, with more than 100,000 employees, 1,000 of whom are located in Ireland.  We have two large manufacturing plants in Ireland at which we produce infant formula.  Danone has a stated goal of "One planet.  One health", and it drives all of its employees towards that goal, which means decarbonising our plants.  We cannot do that without using biomethane and that is why I am here.  On behalf of RGFI, we thank the Chairman and the members for inviting us to address the committee.</p> <p>  RGFI is a not-for-profit forum representing those with an interest in an indigenous Irish biomethane industry, including farm organisations, community groups, Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, and end users for renewable gas.  We are asking the committee to consider renewable gas as part of the renewable energy mix.  RGFI fully supports the Government's long-term climate ambitions.  We believe that with smart, evidence-based policies, the transition can be positive for Ireland.  This requires significant private and public investment, however, and the deployment of appropriate new and innovative renewable technologies.</p> <p>  We acknowledge the commitment to reviewing the potential of anaerobic digestion to supply biomethane in the draft national climate action plan, NCAP.  We are concerned, however, at the figures used in the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, analysis in the plan.  We believe those figures are wrong and that is key to our presentation.  The MACC estimates biomethane at a cost of &euro;377 per tonne of CO2 abatement, whereas we estimate it, with proof, at some &euro;78 to &euro;150 per tonne of CO2 abatement and this is in line with other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  In October, RGFI submitted a business case for biomethane in Ireland to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  This KPMG report shows an overall positive 1.26 cost-benefit ratio through to 2050 for producing biomethane from agricultural organic matter.  Specifically, by replacing 12% of current natural gas consumption with biomethane, Ireland can save 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 per year, supporting our decarbonisation targets and creating more than 3,000 jobs for rural Ireland by 2030.</p><p>In the replacement of gas, biomethane is the lowest cost solution.  In order to realise this vision, we will need: Government policy and legislative support for biomethane, agricommunity-led anaerobic digester, AD, plants; a number of large food and commercial waste plants; and a capital investment of &euro;1.5 billion, supported by industry.  The proposed deployment and ramp up is in line with Northern Ireland, where 60 AD plants were built in the first five years of the industry being developed.<br/><br/>RGFI represents some of Ireland's largest energy users, including my company, Danone, Dairygold, Diageo, Pernod Rickard, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and Wyeth Nutritionals.  Biomethane is the only viable and available alternative solution for many of our businesses to decarbonise our processes without impacting on overall operations.  As users of natural gas, we can make an immediate switch to biomethane, which would deliver our environmental and climate benefit targets at lowest cost and with least disruption. <i></i>We are willing to play our part in this transition.  However, having the right policy conditions to support a scalable, renewable biomethane gas industry is essential if we are to remain competitive and in order to sustain economic growth.<br/><br/>Ireland has sufficient capacity to produce the required agricultural feedstocks without impacting on the livestock industry.  Scaleable AD will provide certainty of demand for many farmers, with capacity to produce more grass for both animal feed and the new AD market.  That will increase farm incomes significantly, bring about improvements in farm practices and further support the global reputation of Irish food exports.<br/><br/>As the Government finalises the national climate energy plan, we ask the committee to support a target of 12% for the replacement of current natural gas consumption with renewable biomethane; that biomethane would be included in the plan and in the Government's submission to the EU Commission, and funding support for the sector.  Failure to support an indigenous biomethane industry, at the appropriate scale, will lead to a missed opportunity for the decarbonisation of agriculture, as well as higher energy costs for industry, a weakening of national energy security, and reduced competitiveness for the processing and manufacturing sectors.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

For those who are not aware, the ISEA has been lobbying for support for solar energy since May 2013.  We are an all-island trade representative body with approximately 17 members in the solar space.  It has been a very exciting month.  We have seen a real sense of urgency that I have not seen in some time.  The publication of the climate action plan is to be very much welcomed.  The phasing out of peat stations is also to be welcomed.  The approval by the Government of the renewal energy support scheme, RESS, with a revised goal to deliver up to 70% renewables in our electricity mix by 2030 is really ambitious and extraordinarily challenging.  It will require a step change from both the public and private sectors in terms of how we approach renewables.</p> <p>  In terms of the quantum, we are proposing to deploy more than 12 GW of capacity between now and 2030.  The background is that we have only managed to deploy 3.8 GW in almost two decades, which indicates the extent of the challenge that we face in the renewables sector.  It is a matter of regret that we have not achieved our 2020 climate change targets.  That is very disappointing, particularly as the solar industry has had more than 0.5 GW of available fully-permitted projects ready to come online before 2020.  Moving forward, we have seen financing costs at a record low in terms of infrastructure, whether that is for wind, solar, biomass or others.  We are also seeing a massive cost reduction in those technologies, which are also historically low.  Despite our heretofore limited deployment of these technologies, our late mover advantage is that we have never been able to bring them online at a lower price than is the case today.</p> <p>  We have 1.3 GW of solar capacity fully permitted, with grid connections available, land and permits secured, with a further 1 GW due to receive offers for grid connection coming out of enduring connection policy, ECP-1.  The industry has been investing since 2016 to be ready for the RESS auctions.  While I very much welcome the Minister's announcement and the carving out of solar, it is only 10%, which represents a maximum of 300 MW in the first auction.  That is a little disappointing.  As an industry, we also welcome the community element.  It was originally proposed in the high-level design of RESS that community schemes would not come online until the second auction but the Department has stepped forward and brought that into the first auction.  We think that is a great thing to do, although it will be very challenging to get community schemes correct.  We have experience of that in other jurisdictions.  We also very much the proposal for a &euro;2 community contribution for every megawatt hour of generation.  In terms of community funding, we have seen challenges in other jurisdictions but there are now methodologies and technologies that can make this more efficient such as crowd-funding, where a &euro;10 investment has the same transaction cost as &euro;100,000.  The challenge is not slowing up the deployment of the renewables while the communities raise capital.  We ask the committee and the Government to consider whether the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, or another organ of the State could perhaps provide bridging finance to allow community finance to come on board.</p> <p>  Switching back to solar, the KPMG report specifically shows that we are an industry which could quite easily deploy 4 GW by 2030.  We believe we can do a great deal more than that, and in the process create 7,300 jobs, and a significant value in terms of gross value added to the economy in tax take in the order of about &euro;3 billion in that timeframe between now and 2030.</p> <p>  Despite the positive news we have had in the past month, some serious barriers remain in the context of the deployment of renewables and solar in Ireland.  What we would like to see is more frequent auctions rather than four auctions between now and 2027.  As well as being more frequent the auctions should also dovetail with when the grid is available to take those assets online.  We would also like to see some consideration being given to reduce the cost and the time to connect and operate on the Irish grid system.  I very much welcome the moves that ESB Networks has taken in terms of engaging with industry to look at those costs but, frankly, this is something we have been talking about for four years.  We have the highest grid connection costs in Europe.  That means it is a higher levelised cost of energy, LCOE, because at the end of the day it is the consumer that pays.</p> <p>  We would also like to see legislative change to allow private wire in Ireland, whereby a generator can connect directly to the consumer.  This is quite a frustration for us coming from other jurisdictions in Europe where we are able to supply real power behind the meter and to have private wire across third party lands.</p> <p>  In the lead-up to the auctions, we would like to see a standardisation of rates and development contribution, which are leading to massive uncertainties in the auction process.  We need a standardised local authority rate and a standardised development contribution.  We would also like to see a fair price in terms of feed-in tariff for rooftop solar.  Under our obligations in the renewable energy directive, I believe we are obliged to provide a fair price for the wholesale price of power for any power that a consumer does not use themselves.  That is really important because it will change the behaviour of the public in terms of the way people consume and sell electricity themselves.  What may help to start the rooftop deployment of solar in Ireland is this feed-in tariff along with, potentially, a reduced VAT rate for renewable energy assets on houses such as, for example, solar photovoltaic, PV.</p><p> There also needs to be legislative changes to limit the qualification for planning appeals.  The wind industry has suffered greatly in the context of extended appeals and the solar industry is suffering also.  It is very easy to make an appeal in Ireland, which drags out the deployment of renewables by more than a year.  The climate action plan suggests that we need to deploy 8.5 GW of wind between now and 2030.  This will be extremely challenging.  It will never happen and we will have no chance of achieving it if we do not reform the process of planning appeals.  The UK, our nearest neighbour, effectively has a planning exemption in respect of solar for rooftops of up to 2 MW.  We ask for planning exemption for 0.5 MW.  This would remove the barrier for those who want to install solar on business premises.</p><p> We have come along way in the past few months, but we need to overcome some real hurdles.  It will require a co-ordinated effort from the public sector and the private sector.  The private sector has been waiting for some time.  We are ready.  We now ask that the organs of the State to step up also.  We are beginning to see that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019120400002#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present.  Addressing climate change is the challenge of our time.  It is an existential challenge that will determine our way of life, our well-being and the future of the habitat we enjoy today.  Those who follow will judge us on how we act upon this, and rightly so.</p> <p>  I will focus on the transformational opportunity that offshore renewables, and particularly wind, present to us.  Ireland has a comparative advantage with some of the best wind regimes in the world.  With advances in technology in the past ten years, including floating offshore wind, Ireland is well placed for the production of renewable electricity at scale.</p> <p>  Our land to sea ratio is 10:1 so we have long been in marine renewable resources unlike some of our European partners who have no marine resources whatsoever.  The resource we have on our doorstep is inexhaustible.  The question is, how will we exploit this gift we have been endowed with.  The answer is that with vision and strategic intent Ireland can turn this comparative advantage into a competitive advantage and become a leader in addressing climate change.  Renewable technology advances have seen wind and solar generation becoming more competitive than nuclear and fossil fuel-based generation.</p> <p>  The new EU Commission has set an objective of Europe becoming the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050.  Much policy and support in that regard is expected in the proposed new green deal.  Electrification of heat and transport and the production of hydrogen and other gasses are set to see European demand for electricity production increase by more than double to 7,800 TWh by 2050.  Without fossil fuels, this would necessitate a massive ramping up of renewable generation and deployment.</p> <p>  Offshore wind is forecast to become the biggest source of generation in Europe by 2050, overtaking onshore wind and solar.  The reasoning behind the enhanced offshore wind drive includes higher wind speeds and load factors.  One can generate twice as much energy from a wind turbine in a marine environment than onshore.  There is community resistance to onshore, notwithstanding all of the efforts and endeavours that have been made for onshore wind.  Scale effects that can be achieved offshore is staggering.  There is also the possibility of deploying large offshore turbines leading directly to falling prices.</p> <p>  WindEurope undertook an indicative exercise, a report on which it published last week, that allocated the EU Commission&rsquo;s offshore target of 450 GW across those countries with offshore wind resources.  In this notional allocation, this country was given 22 GW with the following observations: Ireland needs to increase its leasing and consenting rate; it needs to work on its connectivity and supply chain; and it needs to start mobilising the technology by 2025.  It is useful to contextualise this 22 GW in two ways.  First, Ireland's current peak demand is 6 GW and the proposed Celtic interconnector is 0.7 GW.  When one considers the scale it is clear that this would entail exporting resources to continental Europe.  Second, the resource available within our waters can be measured in the thousands of gigawatts.  In other words, Ireland could aspire to do as much as it wishes in the future.  It is clear, however, that, notwithstanding its peripheral location, Ireland is, given its superior resources, viewed as a potential significant exporter of renewable wind energy.  I recommend WindEurope's Our Energy, Our Future report to members.  It makes for quite interesting reading.</p> <p>  Once one develops a material amount of energy in the European context, connectivity to European demand centres is required.  Irish consumers could not be expected to underwrite such an investment in generation and transmission.  Agreements with importer nations and entities would need to be struck.  Offshore wind is less variable than onshore but there are major benefits to not having too high a concentration of offshore wind in any single region, such as the North Sea, so that we may keep the lights on 24-7.  While Ireland could have the lowest cost of production, considerations around the cost of connecting and continuity of supply will inform the optimum spread of offshore wind around Europe.  The takeaway in this regard is that it is a European problem, not a national one, and we should think of it in that context.  A more integrated European regulatory approach than currently exists is required, as is a more interconnected pan-European grid.  We also need a master plan to try to get a good outcome for Europe, as a continent, by 2050.  Each country may make a case for how much it wishes to contribute in generation.  WindEurope&rsquo;s report states, "Countries with offshore wind resources have a geographical responsibility to lead Europe in this ... enabling higher levels of offshore deployment".</p> <p>  We are of the view that offshore wind will be called upon to increase its share of renewables in the future as other sectors struggle.  Many European countries are constrained due to designations, lack of marine resources and so on.  Ireland's 22 GW reflects an excess potential, but what is the right amount?  We could transmit as much as can to Europe.  Serving 5% of European energy demand by 2050 is not an unreasonable aspiration and would result in circa 70 GW of offshore wind.  This scale of development would result in new indigenous industries to diversify job creation and the tax base, especially in regional areas, and it would regenerate our coastal communities.  The scale of the development would also result in energy security with an avoided annual fuel bill of &euro;5 billion to &euro;6 billion and there would also be export revenue for the State's coffers.  Ireland would be offering leadership in responding to climate change.  Ireland would also exceed its targets and avoid penalties associated with not meeting those targets.</p> <p>  The exact quantum of 22 GW or 70 GW is less important than the concept and the vision of Ireland as a major exporter of renewables.  In this context, indigenous supply chain industries and jobs may be created in a way that they would not be created for a domestic play.  Beyond the vision, the next step is a roadmap to achieve and realise our potential.  Ireland needs to commit to the development of our renewable assets in the context of the long-term vision.  We need to give investors and developers a strong signal - as other countries have - that we are serious about developing our offshore resources.  In the past, Ireland has sparked industries that we had less right to develop than offshore wind.  By setting favourable terms and by supporting the inception of special development zones, such as the Shannon free zone and the International Financial Services Centre, Ireland has brought in foreign direct investment and supported local development.  We can do the same with offshore wind development.  The benefits of sharing the development of our offshore resource with those companies already involved in offshore generation in the North Sea are clear: more decarbonisation and more jobs in Ireland.  All we need to do is provide certainty to the market.  A special development zone is one option in this regard.  Supporting indigenous innovation in order to encourage the development of industries that are sustainable is vital.  We currently have a dormant offshore industry which sends its best people to work in the UK offshore wind industry.  This can be developed and grown to provide local jobs at a number of ports in Ireland, supporting not just the Irish development but also the European supply chain.</p> <p>  Follow through is necessary for the structures and frameworks in order to support a growing and developing industry.  A renewables centre of excellence should be set up with participation from industry and Government.  It is important that there is joint involvement.  It has worked very well in the UK.  Innovation support for new technologies &ndash; again with industry and Government participation - would also be required.</p><p>I would mention test and deployment centres, of which we have some, for offshore renewable energy technologies that deliver innovative projects, not only following technology but developing it.  It would be important for such a project to be pre-consented to the extent that it can be to accelerate that take-up of technology, to have a connection regime and to have a tariff regime for limited energy.</p><p> Furthermore, spatial planning for the optimal use of the marine environment is something to which we aspire.  I commend the Government on its efforts in that respect and it needs to be finished out by 2021.    It is important to have an engineering feasibility study for various levels of offshore renewable development.  I would point to a specifically dedicated zone-cluster for marine renewable technology to encourage companies to start up in Ireland.  Such an approach can give Ireland the chance to realise its potential, help Europe to become carbon neutral and Ireland to become a leader in addressing climate change.  </p><p> I thank the members for their time and if there are any questions my colleague, Mr. Robert O'Connor and I will be happy to endeavour to answer them. </p></speech>

I thank all the contributors for their submissions and presentations.  I will direct my questions first to the representatives of SuperNode and I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for his comments.  What did SuperNode's assessment take into account with respect to how offshore wind has been developed in the UK and Denmark?  Were the representatives disappointed the Government, when it undertook a review of energy security, only included the context of fossil fuels?  Will SuperNode make a submission in the upcoming review of energy security?  Have the representatives any comment to make about fossil fuel lock-in and concerns about how the Government's strategy is potentially facilitating that?  Will they comment on the new marine planning Bill in the context of offshore wind development?  When one of the representatives has responded to those questions, I will address questions to some of the other witnesses.</p></speech>

I will start with Deputy's question on carbon lock-in.  It is incredibly difficult to do deep decarbonisation.  Ireland is probably the leading country in decarbonising our electricity system as an island system.  It is very difficult to decarbonise.  Carbon lock-in will have to be actively tackled in our economy to try to escape from the clutches of carbon  That is an ongoing process that will continue through the coming decades.  We built our economy, in terms of our power, transport and agricultural systems, over 100 years based on carbon.  Therefore, it will be devilishly difficult to extract ourselves from carbon.</p> <p>  It is welcome we will have a new marine planning Bill.  It needed a push and it certainly got that.  I understand by 2021 we will have a marine spatial planning strategy.  It is important that system is streamlined so that people can develop projects in a way that is environmentally and socially responsible.  The marine spatial planning and development Bill is important and it should be expedited as a priority and continue to be a priority. </p> <p>  In terms of our ambitions for energy security and the use of offshore wind or other energies, what I have outlined is a European context.  It is not arguing that offshore wind should be counted towards X% of our energy security system.  There is no doubt it should be but what I am espousing is a vision and a view that we would say we have this incredible resource.  However, it will not get developed.  Nobody will ask us to develop it.  We need to be on the front foot and develop it ourselves.  The primary market for a scale of 20 GW or whatever is the European market and Ireland will be a secondary market.  By virtue of having all that energy on our doorstep, we will enhance our own security of supply.  We need a better network and better connectivity.  I applaud the Celtic interconnector and other forms of connectivity with Europe.  That is the way we will develop the future.  We will not do it as an island power system.  We will have to do it as part of an integrated pan-European system.  </p></speech>

I will move on to the Irish Solar Energy Association.  Mr. Maguire mentioned some legislative impediments.  Will he outline what specific changes are needed in planning law to minimise the ongoing delays in the process?  Will he give a trajectory of what he believes solar energy can contribute to reducing emissions by 2030 and by 2050 in a context of the overall picture?  Does he consider solar energy representing 10% of the overall auction is sufficient?  Will this specific category remove obstacles to solar development?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Maguire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019120400002#F00800"><p>As we have seen not only in the renewable sector but with data centres and elsewhere publicly, to a certain degree much of our planning law is based on UK planning law.  It is quite similar.  One of the businesses in which I am involved, BNRG Renewables, has deployed many solar systems in the UK as have many members of our association.  We have been engaged with the planning authority for the development of a 10 MW site in eight weeks.  There is a statutory obligation on that planning authority to turn around the determination for that development in that time, or in 13 weeks if it is put to a vote in the local authority.  The appeals process is limited to a procedure.  One can only submit an appeal if there is a breach of procedure or if the procedure has not been followed.  That appeals window is open for six weeks and then it closes.  What I find very frustrating in Ireland is that it is very easy to take an appeal.  The appeals process must be robust but there is a great deal of uncertainty about planning.  We have been constructing solar systems globally in different jurisdictions for more than 12.5 years and Ireland is one of the most challenging development jurisdictions in which I have ever deployed this technology.  That is due to the uncertainty surrounding planning.  We do not have planning guidance on this but the planning system is robust enough to assess projects on their individual merits.  The challenge is the risk of the appeals process.  That needs to be reviewed with a view to reforming it.  Specifically, planning in respect of rooftop projects should also be considered.  Deploying solar systems on rooftops is exempt from the formal planning process in many European jurisdictions, whether it be a MW system on a factory of a solar system for a domestic home.  We have had discussions on this issue with An Taisce and other conservation bodies, including the National Trust in the UK which openly welcomes solar systems on listed buildings provided by such systems are installed sensibly.  Currently, that is a barrier to people putting solar systems on the roofs on their houses.  Those are the two areas that should be considered in planning law.</p> <p>  The third area that needs to be considered is the private wire issue, but that is probably a matter for the regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  As a generator, I cannot connect my generating asset to supply electrons to a factory located in a field away from my business but one can do that in many European jurisdictions.  I have to connect to the grid with all the costs that entails.  Addressing that issue would unlock great potential in terms of corporate power purchase agreements, PPAs, in Ireland.  Ultimately, as an industry, we are seeking best value for money for the consumer.  If renewals are oversubsidised in this country, they will just become unacceptable politically and they will not work.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it is widely agreed within Europe from various independent assessments that solar energy is likely to deliver 20% of the entire electricity demand in the European mix by 2030.  In terms of the trajectory we are on in Ireland, being pessimistic, I think we could probably deploy between 3.5 GW to 4 GW by 2030.  Being optimistic, it could be 8 GW.  We are somewhere around 5 GW or thereabouts in terms of capacity.</p></speech>

In an ideal world, how do they think we are fixed as a country with regard to skilled personnel and technological know-how in our workforce?  If the groups get over their planning hurdles and are up and running, do they have the workforce required for each of the three projects?  How can that problem be overcome, if it is a problem?</p></speech>

In Europe there are 17,000 biomethane plants, with two being built in France every week.  When we started, the technology had biomethane generating electricity to feed into the grid.  That is no longer the process and the technology has matured and is very efficient.  This will be led, owned and run by farming communities.  Biomethane will be produced and injected into the grid.  We in the industry extract it on the far side of the grid like we extract green electricity.  It is simple and a well-known technology tried and trusted across Europe.  The fact that we are late to the table is better for us as there have been lessons from all the mistakes.</p></speech>

We have had perhaps 15 years of experience of onshore wind and there is a supply of 3 GW or 4 GW in the country.  We build and service this but there are no export jobs or there is not a significant amount of materials made in this country for export.  I have outlined an export proposal but we do not have the required personnel today.  We would need to plan today to start this and it is not around the corner.  I am not talking about the auction next year or the year afterwards.  I am talking about ten years down the line and developing an approach to set people up and then encourage and foster them.  We can then talk about tens of thousands of jobs to develop industries and to become a leader in an element of the supply chain.  We will not become leaders across the supply chain but there are elements of the supply chain where we could become leaders and grow indigenous jobs that are sustainable and could be a source of wealth and income for the country, even if a turbine is built in another country rather than in our own waters.</p></speech>

I have no fear that we are insufficiently skilled in terms of the workforce required to build out solar here.  We have many people involved in the sector with rooftop solar but with regard to meeting the aspirations of the action plan and the very serious demands that decarbonisation places upon us, it is important to begin at the macro level and remove the barriers that the Chairman has highlighted.  Rooftop solar will create the "energy citizen" and democratise our energy sector.</p> <p>  We need to look at lifting the planning restrictions.  My association met the Minister with responsibility for planning during the summer and outlined our position.  The official line was that wind energy guidelines would dominate the thinking in the Department.  The Minister made an announcement at the start of the week and we expect, perhaps this side of Christmas, that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will make an announcement and take on board the different considerations we have.  The planning system is fairly robust but we want a policy in place that is transparent and operative for consumers who want to enter into the space.  It should also serve a responsible trade association that wants to ensure the highest standards in industry.</p> <p>  KPMG produced an independent report a number of years ago titled, A Brighter Future: Solar PV in Ireland.  It considered all the scenarios for deploying solar power in Ireland and predicted we could create 7,300 jobs by deploying approximately 3 GW of solar power in the system.  As the chairman has said, there is approximately 1.7 GW ready to go and we are awaiting the announcement from the Minister flagged on Monday.  There is a solar pot but 10% of availability in the first auction, which we expect to run in June next year, is under-ambitious.  We will intensively try to persuade the Minister of the merits of increasing that allowance.  There are more than sufficient skilled personnel there.  As a country we regrouped after the recession in the 1980s and the most recent recession to upskill and learn new trades and qualifications.  I have no doubt we can do this again in the renewable sector, particularly on the solar side.  We are ready to do this but we need the barriers removed in order to achieve that outcome.</p></speech>

Mr. Dennehy is here representing the industry.  In our engagement with other large energy consumers, they recognise that the Exchequer cannot carry the burden of the cost of this.  We recently submitted to the Department, and we are mandated to put together, an integrated business case that seeks to map where funding is required on a phased basis.  It is what is required between now and 2030, and there are multiple options for funding.  One is the carbon tax.  For example, approximately &euro;60 million in carbon tax is being collected from the gas consumer and the most recent budget provided for an increase of &euro;6 per tonne in carbon tax.  With large energy consumers we are looking at potentially socialising the cost through a gas public service obligation.  It is another option where the industry is willing to participate.  We are working through a number of different feasibility studies with KPMG around the business case for biomethane, looking at commercial structures and propositions in order to stimulate and enable the industry.  There is some work in progress but on the question of funding, the biomethane industry will play its role.  We need very clear policy from the Government to support it.</p></speech>

My first questions are for the Renewable Gas Forum.  Will the witnesses outline the benefits and potential risks, if any, with respect to the production of biomethane?  There are probably no such risks but I must ask the question.  Would a specific kilowatt tariff be required to get a biogas operation running on a farm versus what would be got back?  Would a certain subsidy be proposed?  The witnesses spoke about slurry storage versus silage.  Have case studies been done on how many cows would generate a certain amount of gas on a certain number of acres?  That is the way farmers would be thinking on the basics.</p> <p>  Some of the questions on wind energy have been answered.  There was mention of 32 GW of wind energy potential but how many windmills would that require with current technology?  What kind of studies have been done on costs in getting this moving and allowing us become a wind energy exporter?</p> <p>  Planning on the solar side was mentioned.  Other than that, are there blockages in the system to people putting a different heating system in a domestic house?  Legislative changes were changed but is there something we can do in marketing industry to attract domestic users to change their technology or go with solar in new houses?  Have the witnesses interacted with any farming organisations?  There are many rooftops over cubicles and slatted units that could be used.</p></speech>

We have no choice.  We buy green electricity already and we have done that for many years.  It is impossible to buy green gas and it will not be available unless we support and build industry.</p><p>If we really want to support decarbonisation, both as a company and nationally, we need the alternative to be located here.  We have spoken about a figure of 12%.  Danone is committed to taking 100%, which is a huge amount, in one company.  Dairygold will take another large proportion.  Dairygold will supply us.  Members can see how the chain will start to come together.  Farmers will also be producing it.  That is the model we are considering.  I will refer to my colleague on how it is done. </p></speech>

For pillar industries such as the agrifood, beverages, biopharma and biomedical sectors, the biggest risk is not supporting biomethane.  The difficult sectors to decarbonise are agriculture and heat production.  We are very confident that with support from the Government and the right policy and legislation, we can assist in substantially decarbonising both of those difficult sectors by supporting biomethane.</p> <p>  One positive aspect is that we can do this in a comprehensive manner.  We certainly look to Europe for the best practices and technology.  We have aligned with the revised renewable energy directive.  The slurry to silage ratio has been specifically and purposefully designed in line with the sustainability criteria pertaining to the production of renewable biomethane gas.  We are very much referring to the best available practices and technology and aligning with our European colleagues, who are assisting us with that expertise and those competencies.  As was mentioned earlier, being late to the table is to our advantage for the simple reason that we can draw on those resources and the expertise and competencies which we as a nation do not currently have.  We are collaborating on a consultative basis with key stakeholders, including Teagasc, industry and consumers, who are very important to our economic activity in rural Ireland.  We are looking at safeguarding current and future investment.  Many of the market drivers affecting biomethane and decarbonising heat are driven by the trade sector and global consumers.  We do not need to explain how valuable that export market is to the agrifood, beverage and biopharma sectors.  Along with creating an additional 3,000 jobs directly in the production of biomethane through anaerobic digestion, we are also looking to safeguard the competitiveness and sustainability of our manufacturing and processing sectors.  Those sectors include Danone, which is represented here today, and others.</p></speech>

I will try to respond as quickly as I can to the two-part question about the number of turbines needed to generate 22 GW of electricity.  We are not a developer and that is not our number.  Given the scale of turbines, we benefit in some ways from not having deployed them over the past five, ten, 15 or 20 years.  At an output of 20 MW per turbine, it would take around 1,100 turbines to provide that very large output.  That would be part of a European network.  There have not been any significant studies of the cost, but I would look at our near neighbour, the UK.  The strike price for offshore wind energy in the most recent auctions was &pound;39 and &euro;44 per MW hour.  If we can get our act together at scale, we have the opportunity to plan development zones producing 3 GW, 10 GW or 22 GW.  As part of a network, these would allow us to achieve prices like that for the consumer.</p></speech>

In response to the question on barriers to domestic generation other than planning, I note that there is no feed-in tariff.  Consumers do not get a fair price for the power they do not use.  It is simply injected into the grid and no price is paid.  We would like to see a fair price for that.  Setting that at the right level will be much more efficient than grant aid, which can come and go at the whim of the next Minister.  Moreover, that could also alleviate fuel poverty.  It would not just be wealthy houses who could afford to install solar panels.  Those that are in jeopardy of fuel poverty would also be able to do so.  Private sector banks will step up in the knowledge that if the power is not consumed, it will come back to households in the feed-in tariff.</p> <p>  The other challenge we face is the difficulty of connecting to the grid.  The time it takes to get ESB Networks to respond and approve a connection for commercial projects, such as on the rooftop of a factory or a milking parlour, is incredibly long.  They are the two core barriers as I see them.  </p></speech>

A common theme in the presentation was the jobs that could be created by this.  The witnesses from Supernode mentioned it.  There was talk about jobs in onshore wind generation for years and they did not materialise, so people are a bit cynical about that.  I would like to know what type of jobs the witnesses are talking about.  Are they manufacturing jobs?</p> <p>  Where do the majority of solar panels come from?  Would they come from China or do the witnesses propose that we might manufacture them here?  Where is the optimal place to get solar panels?  </p> <p>  I welcome the developments around biomethane which the witnesses are involved in.  At what point would what the witnesses are suggesting be a commercially viable endeavour for a farm to engage in?  What herd size or acreage would be needed?  What is the necessary combination of silage and waste material?  What are the logistical challenges for the necessary infrastructure, including pipelines, planning, community acceptance, odours, etc?  Mr. Maguire has been quite exasperated by planning processes in general, whether in connection with the ESB or the planning system.  I have to say I agree with him.  Could the witnesses comment on the difference between offshore wind generation in the Atlantic and in the Irish Sea where commercial viability and price are concerned?  How does that compare with onshore wind in terms of cost?  </p> <p>  It seems pretty obvious to me that we should be putting solar panels on every roof.  Was there ever an audit of how much roof space is available?  Clearly there are lots of challenges involved in building solar farms on greenfield sites.  This mainly concerns microgeneration.  Do the witnesses have any idea of the capacity of rooftop space?</p></speech>

That is because we took an incremental approach.  There was a scheme, a refit, then another scheme and another refit.  We did not have the scale to get the industry jobs.  We missed a trick there.  The point I am making is that offshore wind generation will not emerge in the next year or two.  It is five years away.  Generation on the west coast is certainly a long way away.  We need to plan to have those jobs to-----</p></speech>

I know the committee is under time pressure.  The Senator asked about generation on the west coast versus the east coast.  Load factors are so much better on the west coast but connectivity is a greater challenge, as it always has been.</p><p>There is a trade-off between the two.  The same is true all over Europe.  Europe has to rewire itself anyway, no more so than along the Atlantic.</p></speech>

The point of production costs on the west coast will be the lowest in the world.  The east coast will not be as good because the wind regime is not as strong, but it will be closer to demand centres.  Onshore has lower costs again.  I will provide a number for the committee to take away.  In France, there was an auction for offshore wind where &euro;44 per MWh was the strike price.  In Germany, &euro;60 per MWh is the strike price for onshore wind.  Offshore has proven cheaper because of scale, in that one can go big and get economies of scale that cannot be got in an onshore environment.  The largest offshore wind farm in Ireland is 150 MW, but the typical offshore wind farm is 1 GW.</p></speech>

It would be rural, with the digesters owned, run and led by the farming community.  We envisage its fuel being 50% slurry and 50% crop or grass.  It is a simple model.  The most efficient set-up is a 20 MW unit.  Biomethane is generated and taken away in a tanker.  Gas Networks Ireland is constructing injection points, including in Mitchelstown, and these will be distributed around the country for the biomethane to be injected straight into the line.</p></speech>

The dairy sector can assist in slurry management and offsetting a number of challenges.  There will also be an opportunity.  According to Teagasc's national figures, one third of farmers are losing money, one third are breaking even and one third are making money.  To safeguard the future of agricultural industries, including dairy, beef, piggery and poultry, those farmers who are losing money or breaking even have an opportunity to consider this technology as being complementary to what they are already doing.  For example, half of a farmer's land could go towards supplying feedstock to the AD plant.  Our vision is for this to be agri led and community led, whereby ownership would remain with the community and farmer groups.  The industry is available to provide support, including financial, for construction and whatever else is required.  There is an opportunity to decarbonise agriculture and, in turn, assist the process manufacturing industry to decarbonise as well.  It is a win-win.</p></speech>

Manufacturing only accounts for approximately 30% of the system cost, though, making it the lower added value part of the system cost.  A third of roofs in Ireland would be suitable for solar energy.  Since it satisfies 60% of the typical demand in a family home, it would certainly meet more than 10% of the country's entire domestic demand, if not 30%.</p></speech>

He was the Chairman of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il's environment committee, of which I was a member.</p> <p>  Mr. Dennehy mentioned the agriculture sector in terms of biogas.  Is there a role for the semi-State sector?  Bord na M&oacute;na has tentatively started to move into biogas and has submitted a planning request for one biogas plant.  What role could the semi-States play, particularly given their landmass and sites?</p> <p>  The KPMG report was mentioned, but the European Commission also examined this matter and stated that we were ideally suited, given that we have a large agriculture sector relative to the country's size.  The Commission came down on the same side in that there is a great deal of agricultural waste that could be used.  In terms of fuel, slurry and silage were referenced.  A plant that is operating in Nurney uses food waste and waste from meat factories.  Could that have further potential?  Unfortunately, there is a great deal of food waste.  Some of that cannot be avoided.  For example, it is accepted that the waste from meat processing factories forms a part of it, but the Nurney plant also takes food waste from hotels.</p></speech>

We are being guided by best practice and a European policy perspective.  When the European Commission undertook a comprehensive study in 2016 and 2017, it identified Ireland as having the greatest potential of all other member states to produce biogas.  That is a fact.  We have the resources and ability to deliver.  Interestingly, 95% of that will come from agricultural sources.  We are a population of approximately 4.5 million people and are not the same as, for example, the UK.  The opportunity presented by food waste is being taken up even as we speak.  There is an opportunity, given that there are two separate entities developing or producing biomethane - the waste industry and the agri-led industry.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a member of the Renewable Gas Forum Ireland, RGFI, and we are working closely with it to develop that in the waste sector.  There are opportunities for all parties.  In decarbonising agriculture, for example, there is an opportunity to help decarbonise heat.  No one sector will deliver enough, though.  We need a clear policy that supports biomethane from wherever it comes.</p></speech>

I believe Germany has 6,000 plants.  What steps can be taken to reduce opposition to plants' siting?  There is already opposition.  Some of it will not be justifiable, but some will be.  People have concerns, so we must ensure that this does not go the same way as onshore wind in the midlands where we saw significant opposition.</p></speech>

We need to position ourselves and be strategic about this.  The RGFI is an industry forum that represents the full supply chain.  We are engaged strategically with the potential AD operators on where they are looking to locate their infrastructure.  Through Gas Networks Ireland, we have tested direct grid injection for up to 15 km.  We have favourable positions on policy, with connection and business arrangements from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  There is a positive disposition towards biomethane being transported in the grid.  As such, the fundamentals are in place.</p> <p>  We have the green gas certification scheme, which verifies and validates the sustainability of the production of renewable gas.  It is aligned with European policy, best practice and best technology, and we are fully auditable.  Where biomethane is concerned, it uses the accreditation bodies approved by Brussels.  The end consumer can have confidence.</p></speech>

Mr. Michael McCarthy has heard me say at a previous meeting of the committee in this room that we can use it to solve a problem, to create jobs and to generate power.  That is the good news.</p> <p>  On solar, I have introduced a Bill that deals with planning permission for rooftop solar.  The current planning permission at 12 sq. m is very restrictive in that it does not allow for installation of a standard panel.  The following question is to Mr. Michael McCarthy and Mr. David Maguire.  Should planning permission in respect of domestic dwellings be abolished or should the 12 sq. m be increased to 35 sq. m per domestic dwelling?</p> <p>  On connectivity, should we forget about trying to connect to the grid and focus on the use of the solar energy for self-consumption, such as charging an electric vehicle and so on?  If the preferred option is to try to connect to the grid, what and where are the blockages in that regard?  The many very large agricultural sheds that have been erected all across the countryside present us with a huge opportunity for energy generation via solar panels, particularly those that are west facing.  Where are the blockages to doing this?  For the owner of a shed, a house or GAA clubhouse who wants to install solar panels, what does the Government need to do right now to enable them to do it?</p></speech>

That request is being examined.</p></speech>

The association has asked for a 2 MW exemption.  The principle is important in the sense that the planning permission is a necessary part of a robust planning system.  The ask from the industry in terms of a request to increase the exemption to 2 MW is reasonable.  The exemption was brought in at a time when we were dealing with solar thermal, which is a much heavier panel.  We met the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, during the summer.  The focus of the Department at that time was on the wind energy guidelines, in respect of which the Minister made an announcement at the beginning of this week.  The Department has since committed to examining the proposed ISEA planning permission and we expect some movement on that this side of Christmas.</p> <p>  The point in terms of rooftop space is important.  We can lead the way in Ireland in terms of decarbonisation.  The State can do that by way of the Department of Education and Skills in terms of school rooftops and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine in terms of the roof space on farms.  The blockage to this is the lack of an export tariff.  Nobody is going to introduce a system if what is unused must go back into it.  There is a particular issue around ESB Networks and the export tariff.  This industry deals with a number of organs of the State, including the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the CRU, ESB Networks, EirGrid and 31 local authorities, which is quite difficult at a bureaucratic level.  For most other industries there is probably only a regulator and one point of contact.  This area is populated by many organs of State, all of which are important and necessary.  To meet the aspirations of the climate action plan, the chief civil servant of the State, Mr. Fraser, has oversight of all of the actions.  This industry needs one individual to go to in terms of the various barriers that exist in the deployment of solar.</p></speech>

We need a change of heart and a clear statement from ESB Networks in terms of an export tariff.  We are not here today to complain.  Rather, we are here to discuss the benefits of solar.  The Chairman touched on the improvements and developments that have taken place over the past year or two.  There has been more action over the past year or two than in the previous three or four years.  If we are to meet the aspirations of the climate action plan, we need the organs of State to follow through.  What Deputy Stanley mentioned is inevitable, but we want it to happen sooner rather than later.</p> <p>  In regard to the renewable electricity support scheme auctions, which will commence in June, we welcome that there is provision for a solar pot, but 10% of our overall capacity is only 300 MW.  There is 1.7 GW of solar ready to deploy now.</p></speech>

The first wind farm in Ireland is the one in Arklow, which is on the east coast.  My understanding is that that site was picked on the basis of it having a ridge.  Is sea depth on the western sea board a massive problem?  Obviously, the west also has potential because, as referenced in the Wild Atlantic Way, it is wild.  Is it proposed to use floating turbines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.97" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019120400002#K01700"><p>The Deputy is correct.  Traditionally, the North Sea is a very shallow sea and so it has been very easy to develop a good deal of it using fixed bottom turbines.  In regard to the west coast, where the depth is greater than 30 m to 50 m, this becomes too expensive.  Floating offshore is a technology that is in trial in Portugal, France and Scotland.  Scotland is a great example of a country that has embraced new technologies without necessarily putting its hand in its pocket to pay for them.  It has invited industry in to do its demonstration projects in Scottish waters.  I would recommend the high wind project, which is a novel technology floating offshore wind funded by, primarily, Equinor, which has achieved astounding load factors with floating offshore winds.  This technology is not available here to date.  It will be commercial in the next three to five years.</p></speech>

In the case of onshore wind, if one can do it at scale it is hard to beat in terms of pricing for wind.  The big issue is that it is not possible to scale onshore and there is no space in Europe to do it.  Even if it could work for Ireland, Europe is power hungry and it has a shortage of land space.  It needs marine-based renewable resources so floating offshore is a game changer, which will come on stream in the coming years.  It has been proven technology-wise and it will be commercialised in the first instance in the North Sea by 2025.  It could come here in the late 2020s or the early 2030s.  We need to prepare for it and work out what we want to do with this opportunity.</p></speech>

Renewable energy generation is new to us and so we do not have the necessary skill sets or apprenticeships to deal with it.  Is the industry prepared to run apprenticeship schemes, as was done in the past by the sugar companies and Bord na M&oacute;na?</p></speech>

We are seeing more Irish civil engineers returning from overseas to work in the sector.  We may lack some of the labour to build out the plants but we have the skill sets.  People are coming here from overseas to support the technologies in terms of wind and solar.</p></speech>

We see this as a growth area.  The target we are setting is only touching the tip of the iceberg from our perspective.  From a rural economy perspective, this is a key opportunity for sustainable jobs.  In our view, in the growth phase, 3,000 real, sustainable, direct jobs will be created.  These jobs will assist in the creation of other sustainable jobs with industry in the manufacturing and processing sectors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019120400002#L00100"><p>I am afraid I must tell Mr. Dennehy and Mr. P.J. McCarthy that in my reading of it the best scientific advice runs counter to everything they have said today.  I refer them to the three reports published recently for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, on the bioenergy supply curve for Ireland for 2015 to 2030 published in 2016; the costs and benefits of biogas and biomethane in Ireland published in 2017; and the sustainability criteria options and impacts of Irish bioenergy resources published this year.  The best independent scientific advice makes it clear that the costs of using agricultural feedstock is, at best, marginal.  Perhaps we should look at and refer to the German example.  Germany has been way ahead of us on this with massive investment.  It has stopped that process.  Due to the environmental problems associated with growing maize for biomethane instead of for feedstock Germany stopped doing it.  I believe the same thing would happen here.  The reports also state that if we are going to use the gas, it only makes economic sense to do so if it is used on the farm on site rather than in industrial food production facilities.  That is when it starts to make economic sense.</p> <p>  The reports also state that if we are going to do it then grass silage amounts should be no more than approximately 20% or 25%.  Waste materials are what works.  If we used a higher proportion than 20% to 25% of grass silage there would be net negative climate emissions because we would be engaged in a gas production system.  It would be a continuation of what we are using with high levels of artificial fertiliser and the effects of ammonia and nitrous oxide as well as other environmental effects.  We have destroyed our land with this industrial farming system and we do not need to make the process worse.</p> <p>  The reports also state that slurry is not available.  They completely differ from what the witnesses have just said.  The Northern Ireland route is the subject of utter scandal and corruption with regard to the renewable heat incentive scheme.  Anaerobic digesters are similar to the renewable heat incentive scheme in the way it has led to a massive increase in industrial agricultural production systems where animals are kept indoors and there is a huge expansion in slurry with huge consequences and environmental consequences.  If we want to go down that route for Irish agriculture we might just about have enough slurry but that is not the way we want to go.  We want to keep our animals out.</p> <p>  We do not want to go to intensive industrial agriculture.  We want to be origin brand green and not have an industrial agriculture model.  To do all of this to create an artificial baby milk powder that we ship halfway around the world to replace breastmilk, which is the more natural healthy and genuinely low-carbon and sustainable product, just leads to the entire system from tail to end probably being one of the least sustainable things we do.  We need to be honest and clear with Irish farmers and not send them down the garden path towards a system that will be pulled back because it is not sustainable.  How do the witnesses answer these accusations?  They are based on my reading of the best scientific research.</p></speech>

At the time those studies were carried out they applied and were worked to the first renewable energy directive.  We moved on from that and the second renewable energy directive clearly sets out the best scientific advice and best technology available.  We have moved on from a lot of that data and information.  With regard to the availability of slurry, the competent body to advise farmers is Teagasc and it clearly states the availability of slurry is there.  We have spent the significant sum of &euro;1.54 billion over the past ten years on slurry storage.  This is to cater for the environmental requirements of slurry storage.  Slurry is available.  The figures are there and Teagasc has them.  I would not expect the SEAI to have those figures specifically.</p> <p>  With regard to ammonia and fertilisers, one of the fundamental issues and concerns we had about the assumptions made by SEAI in its study is that while we engaged with the SEAI comprehensively on that particular piece of work, and there were some decent inputs into it from industry and the producers, from a cost perspective the feedstock is there and is available and we are not interfering with any other feedstocks.</p></speech>

The SEAI has a hugely positive reputation for the independent scientific advice it applies on renewable energy.  I must say I know Teagasc is obsessed with industrial grass production as being the only thing we need to do in this country.  I have a fundamental problem with Teagasc in this regard.  I will come back to the fundamental issue that the reports were done by the best international experts and include their assessment that to make the economics work we would have to have a grass price below the current grass silage price for the animal system.  I go back to what I have said about Northern Ireland.  My understanding is that the massive environmentally reckless expansion of anaerobic digestion in Northern Ireland is leading to the generation of new pig slurry quantities equivalent to Northern Ireland having a population of 12 million people creating the same levels of slurry.  We have a question to answer as to whether we want to turn this country into a slurry pit or do we want to go the green organic high value-added agricultural system.</p></speech>

The figures we have from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and from Teagasc are reliable.  The slurry is there and it is available.  We are looking at dealing with current challenges.  With those current challenges are opportunities and the potential to decarbonise.  We did observe, and it is on the public record, that we went back to the SEAI with our concerns as an industry on some of its assumptions.  With the best will in the world, it used artificial fertiliser as part of the costs of production.  From this there was no reference to the better fertiliser value of digestate biofertiliser that goes back in.  That was completely missed.  What we are saying here as an industry is that biofertiliser is of better value.  It is a biofertiliser that goes back in and replaces artificial fertiliser.  With respect, there are some fundamentals in that assumption and those reports are incorrect and inaccurate.</p></speech>

We have a huge comparative cost advantage in offshore wind and we should be thinking ambitiously.  It is part of a European project.  I was just looking through the European report that Mr. Fitzgerald referred to.  Ireland is looking at 22 GW and we have 425,000 km&sup2; of probably the windiest sea area in the world and Poland, with only 30,000 km&sup2; in the relatively becalmed Baltic generates 28 GW, which is 6 GW more than us.  This leads me to think we are not being ambitious enough with 22 GW.  I note the European report divides it between 6 GW in the Irish Sea and 16 GW in the west and with regard to cost very much focuses on the north west rather than the south west, which surprised me.  Perhaps the north west is windier and that is why it is a lower cost.  Let us assume we follow the report's advice and put 20 GW in the north west.  Does Mr. Fitzgerald believe shipping it to the rest of Europe will involve the onshore Irish transmission system?  Are we best landing it ashore in Ireland and using existing and new interconnectors to transfer it?  Has Mr. Fitzgerald thought yet about how that 20 GW of power would be shipped?</p></speech>

It is not our figure, it is a figure it gave us based on a European objective scenario for 2050.  We could do more or less as we so decide.  We have an abundant resource.  The questions are how much we want to do, how we would do it at scale on the west coast and what methods we would use.  We have a transmission system built for 4.5 million people.  It is probably creaking at the seams with the amount of land-based renewables we are trying to put onto it.  It does not have the capacity to accommodate 5 GW or 10 GW of energy in the European context.  It just cannot do it even with the planned Celtic interconnector, which is a necessary piece of infrastructure.</p><p>Domestically it makes sense.  It is not sized for Europe but sized for Ireland.  It is 0.7 GW and we have talked about 20 GW so this will not work and, therefore, one needs dedicated networks.  The good news is Europe needs dedicated networks because very quickly when one gets beyond 40 GW or 50 GW in the North Sea there is a dearth of capacity around the North Sea so Europe has a problem.  We are an extreme of having an excess of renewables and a lack of connectivity.  The problem is around Europe in its entirety so we need to develop better technology, to move that power, and dedicated networks.</p></speech>

That did not happen then because of local national prerogatives but for climate change it has to happen.  Many countries will be unable to decarbonise economically by themselves because they are trying to put in technologies where they do not have a comparative advantage so the cost will go up.  There are a lot of landlocked countries in Europe that do not have a marine resource.  If they are going to truly decarbonise then they will need to co-operate and there will need to be a common European plan.  I hope that the new Commission will recognise that in due course in their climate law and implement it but without that we are doomed.</p></speech>

I will begin by discussing the renewable gas forum.  I wish to make the general point that when we declared a climate emergency we also declared a biodiversity emergency and there is an intersection around our climate and ecological targets.  I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Ryan given that Ireland sponsored the report to the UN on land use, the issue of the transfer of land, for example, to grow fuels versus other things.  Ideally, we must consider biofuels as a by-product of ethical farming practices and that is where we want to move to, and remember that Ireland has a lot of waste products and high levels of food waste. </p> <p>  I will focus on ammonia pollution.  Ireland was found to be in breach of ammonia emission levels in 2016 and 2017, and there are forecasts that we are in danger of continuing to breach the level.  In Ireland, the Nitrates Action Plan has been hugely criticised by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, plus Ireland's rivers have breached the acceptable levels of ammonia and we know that we are in breach.  The witnesses will have heard of some of the other concerns about the North but one of the concerns about the North concerns ammonia as well.  The witnesses have talked about the model moving on, moving towards Red II, and considering artificial fertilisers.  What is happening, what should happen and what can happen in terms of the ammonia levels?  What I say relates to the planning issue, which we have also heard about, in terms of locations.  We do not want a situation whereby having an anaerobic digester located in one's area means damaging the ecology, biodiversity and water supply.</p></speech>

Is there a role for dedicated local networks?  I mean that rather than feed the energy into the grid we could have local networks that feed into specific industries with which there is a relationship.  If data centres were located in Ireland they are estimated to lead to a 34% increase in energy demand.  My query concerns dedicated networks for particular clients.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P.J. McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019120400002#M01500"><p>I hope that I remember all of the questions.  If I miss one, please let me know.</p> <p>  An important aspect, in terms of addressing a number of those issues, is that we need to ensure that biomethane is supported in the National Energy and Climate Plan, NECP, that will go to Brussels in December of this year. </p> <p>  Specifically on ammonia, ammonia is released when raw slurry is spread.  Ammonia is, typically as we experience it, gaseous.  Significantly, with anaerobic digestion technology and the process of having this on-farm, the process converts the ammonia to ammonium.  The process crystalises it and transforms it into molecules so it comes out in the digestate, which is biofertiliser.  That capturing prevents ammonia from being emitted into the atmosphere and one converts it, as part of the biofertiliser, through application to pasture land.  In line with the Red II, those opportunities are clearly outlined, which is where we see significant opportunities and benefits around environmental and biodiversity issues.  It assists certainly with the displacement of artificial fertilisers which, fundamentally, in their manufacture use a lot of fossil fuels.  We could build an indigenous biofertiliser industry.  We know what the ingredients are and we are dealing with the ammonia issue.  One would apply to land a more homogenous material that is absorbed by the soil and readily taken up by plants thus displacing artificial fertiliser and dealing with the ammonia issue.  Also, one avoids the run-off generated by raw slurry spreading and artificial fertiliser thus improving water quality.  We are working with many local authorities and local community groups such as LEADER groups in Ballyhoura, Kilkenny and other regional jurisdictions to solve the problems and improve water quality, air quality and biodiversity.  There are fundamental environmental and ecology reasons to support this.</p> <p>  On specific networks, as mentioned earlier we do not need a dedicated network because we already have gas networks.  The biomethane reaches and meets the same technical standards as natural gas so we do not need any specific dedicated networks.  We are working with some regions where they are considering developing local networks such as Sligo; localised use is fundamental to our strategic approach that anaerobic digesters are located close to networks, or have access to networks, where one has end-use.  In cases where there are gas users who are off-grid, we can certainly consider solving that by way of a virtual pipeline.  </p></speech>

The management of just transition in Scotland has led to great disappointment.  People have lost their jobs in more carbon intensive industries and they hoped that transition would be an area of retraining and the creation of a different model.  In Ireland the process of onshore may have been done slowly.  In Scotland, we are looking quite similarly at the same model but it has greatly disappointed people and there is a real concern that just transition has not been built in.  We also know that the principles of the Just Transition Silesia Declaration require we ensure there is just transition wherever possible and it is a key component of the business.  I ask the witnesses to outline a few key points on the matter.</p><p>We have heard consideration being given to the issue of the potential use of composites.  We know that composites that have been partly funded by the State have been unable to get co-operation from business.  The use of composites is an issue.  Working with apprentices is another issue.  Working with institutes of technology to train people up for the future is a specific question.</p><p> I would like to ask about planning.  It has been mentioned that we are moving towards offshore floating.  We know that wind speeds are increasing globally.  That is the news we are hearing now.  It is appropriate that the planning processes which are starting are long because they need to be long.  We have been told that planning for a model with regard to offshore floating is slightly down the line.  How do we plan for a five-year roll-out that involves offshore floating, addresses the environmental changes that will affect things like wind speeds, builds up local capacity and invests in materials and in the workforce?</p></speech>

A common network will be available to all.  We do not have enough network for the offshore play or the export play.  That is really what I was saying.  I have visited the village of Wick, which used to be one of the busiest fishing ports in the north east of Scotland but was decimated when the herring stock depleted.  This coastal community has been rejuvenated by the offshore wind experience.  It is unlikely that offshore will do much for a coal miner who is 50 miles from the coast.  It is difficult.  I would say that if there are jobs-----</p></speech>

A number of jobs have been created there.  In Ireland, we need to focus on coastal ports when we are establishing clusters of excellence in the renewable energy sector.  The Government must decide what it wants to do.  Along with the institutions and organs of the State, the Government must plan to drive the private sector and the policy in a way that develops jobs for electricians and fitters, etc.  Such jobs are needed for the development of this sector.  The potential exists for the development of innovative technologies in which we can become exporters of products.  Just as we are world leaders in areas like biopharmaceuticals, we can become world leaders in elements of the offshore wind industry, which is still being developed.  It is five years away, but we need to plan if we are going to make it.  If we say five years from now that we want ten turbines, the turbines will be built but we will not get any sustainable employment from them beyond the employment involved in their construction.  We are planning for something that is five or ten years away.</p></speech>

There has not been a significant focus on how much it will cost.  If I wanted to develop renewable energy, I would go to where the renewable resource is at its best.  If it was too difficult to transport it, I would change my approach.  I think Europe needs to take a joined-up approach.  Electricity is the vector to decarbonise transport and industry.  That means we will have much more production of renewable energy in Europe.  We need to think about how we can do that in a sustainable and secure manner.  More grids are needed.  A supergrid will probably be needed beyond 2040.</p><p>We need to start thinking about what we want to do and what role we want to play.  Europe has said that it is feasible to deploy up to 450 GW of offshore wind power.  We have a massive resource.  We could do 5 GW or 100 GW.  We have to think about what we want to do and what needs to happen.  I recommend that we look at some kind of feasibility report that would objectively advise this committee on what the options are.  We can take it on from there.  There is time.  It is all about preparing and planning.  If we wait, we will become a technology taker and we will get precious little out of this opportunity.</p></speech>

It is in the all-of-Government action plan.  We are hearing about the crisis in farming at present.  We are looking at alternative income sources for farmers, to be purely economical about it.  This is in addition to the search for better and more environmentally friendly farming practices.  I take the point that has been made about the anaerobic digestate.  Essentially, a more environmentally friendly fertiliser is being produced.  In turn, that fertiliser will be used on our farms.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about the environmental issues that arose in Northern Ireland.  I appreciate that this is not Mr. McCarthy's particular area.  He spoke about best practice.  Is he confident that we have the oversights here?  I refer, for example, to the EPA.  Are we in a position to ensure environmental breaches do not happen here?  What is the best practice, to return to the phrase that was used earlier?  I represent a constituency that has urban and rural districts.  When I speak to people from the farming community, it strikes me that there is great buy-in from farmers.  They are coming together.  We need to ensure we are rolling this out in a strategic way across the country so that farmers can benefit from it.  All of us need to be able to see the environmental benefits.  Farmers can earn an income from forestry, anaerobic digestion and slurry management, etc.</p></speech>

First, we have set out some fundamentals for the industry to give confidence to producers and end consumers of renewable gas.  Approximately three years ago, we set out a European call on the design process for the green gas certification scheme, which involves a guarantee of origin.  This is not available in the North.  The sustainability of the production of biomethane has not been monitored in the North.  The producers and the members of the farming community need to have certainty that there are clear guidelines.  The certification scheme, which is designed around the RED II, is the first of its kind in Europe.  We have gone for best practice.  After we went to tender on foot of a European call, the contract was awarded to Dena and DBFZ, which are experts in this area of sustainability.  They advise the European Commission.  They are co-authors of some advisory and policy documents at European level.</p> <p>  From an Irish perspective, we have referred to best practices, best competencies and best expertise.  Despite what we might think, we do not have that expertise in Ireland.  We need to draw on the resources, expertise and competencies at European level.  That is the only way we can get confidence.  We are interested in building a robust and sustainable industry.  All sectors can embrace the benefits and opportunities here.  I refer specifically to the need to know what we are doing, and to know it is based on the best available technologies.  We need to draw on the expertise of other member states across Europe, such as France, which have set out some key strategic enablers.  Fundamentally, the establishment of a national co-ordination body is being promoted by the RGFI at present.  This was highlighted in a recent KPMG report.  We are engaging with Teagasc in a collaborative and consultative manner to look at assisting in the development of expertise and competencies.  We are setting up the Teagasc range as a centre of excellence for the development of the best technology and the best advice.  We are looking at facilitating that through the planning process.  We are looking at the best routes for developing biomethane.  The best pathway for those who are interested in developing the industry involves looking at the national strategic advisory body.  The RGFI, along with Teagasc and GNI, is looking to step up to that.</p></speech>

Its representatives have highlighted planning issues in the solar sector.  Briefly, do they have any key messages for the Government as it seeks to implement the all-of-Government action plan?  The witnesses were very positive about the plan.  What would be the key points from our committee?  Over the next few weeks and months, we will bring in Ministers and officials to discuss how to meet the targets.</p></speech>

There is a significant issue here.  As a trade association, we have had a very strong engagement with various organs of the State.  We are grateful for that.  At an overarching level, we recognise that the renewable electricity support scheme includes a solar pot of 10%.  I ask the committee to send a statement to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his officials about the need for this to be increased.  That means 300 MW of solar, but 1.7 GW is ready to deploy right now.</p> <p>  A number of other issues, including the issue of barriers, have been raised.  The export tariff for rooftop solar is a critical issue for creating the energy citizen.  This is a significant issue for the CRU and for ESB Networks.</p> <p>  We expect to have some engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Department on the planning submission this side of Christmas.  We expect that because we have had a very productive engagement to date.  The urgency is now more relevant than it was some time back.</p> <p>  We are thankful for this committee, which was born out of the Citizens' Assembly.  It is very important for us that a multiplicity of stakeholders have bought into an all-of-Government action plan on climate.  The infrastructure of the State must be improved to accommodate the deployment of solar energy.</p></speech>

I think I speak for everyone involved in renewables and all other infrastructure investments in the State when I say that the planning system is very inefficient in terms of its timing and its certainty.  In particular, the appeals procedure makes it easy to appeal and hold up developments that are strategically important to the State.  I do not think we are just talking about solar here.  Serious reform is needed.  To be specific, the qualification of appeals being heard needs to be tightened up.  In the case of solar, I think there should be an exemption for rooftop developments regardless of whether the building is domestic or commercial.</p></speech>

Those involved in solar energy seem to feel that it is the Cinderella of the renewables sector.  Not much attention has been given to them, particularly by comparison with offshore wind and biomass.  Is it the contention of Mr. Maguire and Mr. McCarthy, as business people who want to make money, that although they are looking after domestic needs, there is an obvious need to expand?  How much expansion do we stop at?  There are 7,300 jobs in this sector.  Expansion will be necessary to keep making a profit and to keep the business going.  Maybe the solar energy sector has less potential in this regard than the offshore sector.  The oceans are vast.</p><p>Our territorial waters are also vast so what are the plans?  Is the plan to invade and conquer the whole offshore area around our coast?  Would the sustainability of jobs be dependent on that?  When do we say that enough is enough?</p></speech>

Those days are gone.  We are seeking a stable support mechanism that is an auction for the electorate so industry will drive down the prices.  Everybody in the renewable energy sector will agree the feed stock is free.  Once one is up and running, that cost will decrease.  For solar energy, it could be anything on the range from 6 cents to 9 cents for a kW hour.  Ireland is paying a higher LCOE for wind and solar energy and other technologies than the consumer needs to.  We are higher than the rest of our fellow EU member states because of our connection costs and our planning costs.  That cost is passed on.</p> <p>  On expansion, this is a global business.  We are active building projects in multiple jurisdictions across the globe.  We have projects under construction in the US, Australia and Europe.  Many of the industries one sees in Ireland that are talking about offshore wind energy, onshore wind energy and solar energy are global businesses.  Some of them are Irish.  Ours is an Irish-owned business and it is operated and headquartered here but we have operations globally.  This is not about Ireland and if it was, we would be out of business because we started developing here at the start of 2016 at the same time we entered the US market.  We have since got about 130 MW of projects under construction in the US with lots more to come.  Those skill sets go overseas all the time.</p></speech>

We have a comparative advantage with wind so we can make it.  It has been made in the UK and France for a wholesale price of 4p per kW hour.  That is really competitive.  It does not need a subsidy and we are not asking for one.  We are asking for a framework to work out how much we want to do and to set out a road map to have as much offshore wind energy as possible because as was said, our resource is huge.  The question is how much we want to contribute to decarbonising Europe through our offshore wind resource because that is our strength.  Offshore wind energy and wind energy are what we have.  We are at 55&deg; degrees latitude in the north west.  If we want to do other things we can do them as well but wind is what we have a comparative advantage with.  We want to export and earn revenue from doing that.  It is not about subsidising our industry.  It is about our industry creating wealth for our economy, generating jobs, helping us meet our climate commitments and helping others to meet their climate commitments.  It is about leadership.</p></speech>

This afternoon we are holding our regular post-budget session with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council to discuss the fiscal assessment report.  Before we begin, I would like to ask members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones for the usual reason that it interferes with the sound recording.  I would like to take this opportunity to welcome IFAC back to our committee for what is the third engagement this year.  We are delighted to have back Mr. Seamus Coffey, who is chairperson of IFAC.  He is accompanied by Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Mr. Michael Tutty, Dr. Martina Lawless and Dr. Eddie Casey.  We appreciate all of you giving your time to us again and we thank you for making yourselves available.</p><p>I will read the usual privilege statement and then I will call on Mr. Coffey to make his opening statement.  I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>I</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect to your evidence.  You are directed that only the evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by a name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>I now call on Mr. Coffey to make his opening statement to the committee.</p></speech>

On behalf of the council, I would like to thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting us to meet them to discuss our latest fiscal assessment report.  As the Chairman outlined, joining me are Mr. Michael Tutty, Dr. Martina Lawless and Mr. Sebastian Barnes, who are all council members.  Also joining us are Dr. Eddie Casey, the council's chief economist and head of secretariat, Mr. Kevin Timoney, Ms Ainhoa Os&eacute;s Arranz, Mr. Killian Carroll, Mr. Niall Conroy, Ms Friederike Vogler and Ms Karen Bonner.  We continue to value these engagements.</p> <p>  At the outset, it is important to note that the council&rsquo;s mandate does not cover commenting on the choice of individual tax measures or spending items and priorities, but rather commenting on the overall fiscal stance.  The domestic economy has shown continuing strong growth since around 2013.  It has recovered from a deep crisis and is now operating near capacity.  This is most visible in the labour market with the unemployment rate falling to about 4.8%.  The rate of people working is high as well.  If we take the key working age groups, ages 25 to 54, we can see that 79.7% of these individuals were employed in the four quarters to the second quarter in 2019.  This is above the pre-crisis peak of 78.6%.  </p> <p>  Efforts up until 2015 to turn around a large budget deficit were successful.  Creditworthiness improved, and the budget balance appears to be close to a balanced position.  However, even with large tailwinds in recent years, it is telling that the improvements in the budget balance, excluding interest costs, have stopped since 2015.  Furthermore, if one were to account for excess corporation tax collected in recent years and for the recovery in the economy due to the upswings in the cycle, the underlying structural budget balance, excluding interest costs, is likely to have deteriorated over this time.</p><p>This underlying deterioration reflects fast spending growth, beyond what would be expected for revenues if these were to have grown at a sustainable pace.  Between 2015 and 2018, net policy spending growth rose at a nominal pace of 5.4% per annum on average, and it accelerated to 6.9% in 2018.  Sustainable growth rates would have been closer to a range of 2.5% to 4% over this period.  While spending growth looks set to decelerate in 2019, it is still fast relative to the economy's potential growth and what might be expected for sustainable growth in revenues.  This fast pace of spending growth is, to a large extent, unplanned.  One reason for upward revisions to spending plans is that each budget introduces additional spending measures than had been planned in earlier years.  Another reason is that within-year spending increases emerge over the course of the year.  These within-year increases are outside of the normal budgetary process.  They are, for the most part, not funded by offsetting measures or decisions to increase revenue elsewhere.  They have averaged &euro;0.9 billion per annum since 2015.  Absent these, we estimate that the primary surplus, that is, the budget balance excluding interest, would have been 1.6 percentage points of GNI* higher by 2019.</p><p> Health spending overruns have been a common feature in recent years, averaging &euro;0.5 billion since 2014.  Our report highlights how much of this is accounted for by hospitals spending more than is budgeted for in recent years.  Looking into this in more detail, we can see that the hospitals have not had substantial budget increases planned since 2013.  On average, annual decreases between 2013 and 2018 of &euro;80 million per annum were planned.  By contrast, unplanned annual increases of &euro;280 million occurred over the same period.  The persistent health overruns that have taken place in recent years have been the result of weak planning and weak spending controls.  This has led to a soft budget constraint problem.  That is, the budget allocations are not seen as credible by health managers, and subsequent overruns are largely tolerated.  That can perpetuate unplanned increases in spending and weaker controls on spending.  If overruns are long-lasting, which they have been, for example, often relating to unexpected recruitment of staff, but are funded with potentially temporary revenues, for example, corporation tax, then the sustainability of the public finances can be put at risk.  The concerns that the council has are therefore not with spending itself, but the fact that it is not being planned and budgeted for adequately and that it is not necessarily being funded by sustainable revenue sources.</p><p> The council is concerned about the extent to which potentially temporary revenue sources are being used to fund long-lasting spending increases.  It is our assessment that large tailwinds worth between &euro;10 billion to &euro;14 billion annually have not been used to improve the budget balance, with the deficit instead only improving by &euro;3 billion over the period 2015 to 2018.  These tailwinds include the lower-than-expected interest bill and higher tax and lower unemployment benefits due to the recovery in the economy.  Most important, there is the largely unaccounted for surge in corporation tax.</p><p> The Government has become increasingly reliant on corporation tax to fund spending.  Almost &euro;1 in every &euro;5 of tax collected by the Exchequer is from corporation tax, and some &euro;2 billion to &euro;6 billion of the &euro;10 billion forecast for this year is estimated to be excess.  By excess, we mean beyond what would be expected based on the economy's underlying performance and historical or international norms.  This range of estimates is something that the Department of Finance also finds in its Fiscal Vulnerabilities Scoping Paper, which was released with the budget.  It notes that "scenario analysis based on extreme, though far from implausible, assumptions suggests that, in the absence of corrective measures, a permanent budgetary gap of the order of &euro;2 &ndash; &euro;6 billion could potentially open up".</p><p> The increased reliance on corporation tax for funding public services and supports leaves these exposed to potential reversals.  While corporation tax doubled from 2014 to 2018, the domestic economy grew by just over 20%.  This highlights the extent to which non-domestic sources of income are driving the surges we have seen.  Concentration is another key problem, with half of revenues accounted for by just ten corporate groups.  This concentration, coupled with the fact that 80% of receipts are understood to be accounted for by foreign-owned multinationals, means that the underlying tax base is more prone to idiosyncratic shocks and that the tax base is likely to be more mobile in nature.  Corporation tax is also vulnerable to global tax changes, including the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, proposals, which would include firms paying taxes wherever they have significant consumer-facing activities and potential minimum effective tax rates.  Yesterday's tax data suggests that corporation tax will overperform again in 2019, despite forecasts having already been revised up in the budget.</p><p> An aspect of budget 2020 that we welcomed in this report, and something that the council has been advocating for a long time, was that it incorporated overruns in 2019 into the budget for next year.  This meant that overruns expected for 2019 of some &euro;0.7 billion were to be offset by measures elsewhere in the budget on the Exchequer side.  The 2019 overruns include the expected &euro;0.3 billion overrun in health spending and the payment of the Christmas bonus, which was again not budgeted for in 2020, despite being paid out to varying degrees in each of the past six years.  The health overrun comes despite an extra &euro;1.1 billion being allocated by the Government in last year's budget, an increase of 6.6%.  With the overrun, the health spending increase is likely to be more than 9% this year.  If health spending goes beyond its forecast &euro;0.3 billion overrun or if social welfare spending is revised upwards to reflect higher than expected payments in 2018, that could worsen the upward revisions to spending for the year.</p><p> For 2020, the Government offset overruns on the Exchequer side, but upward revisions to spending outside of the Exchequer mean general Government spending is forecast to expand more rapidly than previously planned.  This includes spending by local government and by approved housing bodies.  While housing increases are to be welcomed, given the lack of supply in recent years, such increases should be fully incorporated into budgetary plans.  They also add stimulus to the economy just as much as central government spending, but there is little transparency about these areas of expenditure in budgetary documents.</p><p> The nominal increase in net spending planned for 2020 is now 4.4%, putting it right at the limit of what would be considered sustainable for next year.  This compares to 3.1% growth set out in April.  The Brexit contingency included in budget 2020, if spent, would raise this further.  As regards the rainy day fund, the first annual payments to be made to the fund in 2019 and 2020 were postponed.  The Government can ensure a prudent fiscal policy where net policy spending growth does not exceed sustainable growth in revenues.  Three reforms would help to achieve this: The first is using the rainy day fund and a prudence account to save temporary receipts, including corporation tax; the second is guiding net spending with sustainable growth rates informed by alternative estimates of potential output; and the third is establishing meaningful debt ratio targets.  These are the types of reforms that are needed to help Irish fiscal policy avoid its next crisis.  I thank the committee for the invitation to come before it.  I look forward to our engagement.</p></speech>

He mentioned the word "crisis".  He is predicting a crisis in fiscal policy based, I presume, on the past.  There is a degree of "Groundhog Day" about all of this when Mr. Coffey comes before the committee so rather than rehash and rehearse some of the points I have made on previous occasions, I wish to put a couple of points to him.  The first relates to the Taoiseach's comments on the over-reliance on corporation tax, and that it could be offset to some degree by an anticipated increase in growth in stamp duty revenues as a result of increased building.  What are Mr. Coffey's comments on that?</p> <p>  My other questions are general ones.  The State is going to spend some &euro;17 billion on the health service this year.  In Mr. Coffey's view, is that enough to run a good quality health service if everything is equal?  In other words, is it sufficient if it took account of the comments Mr. Coffey has made on how health spending has not been controlled in previous years?</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance referred to surplus and there has been another big boost in corporation tax receipts.  He is not putting it in the rainy day fund but he is giving it to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  He is not saying exactly what it is for, but he seems to imply that it will not be using it, in other words investing it, and that it will just sit there until such time as we might need it.</p> <p>  Mr. Coffey indicated in the final lines of his statement: "The Government can ensure a prudent fiscal policy where net policy spending growth does not exceed....Three reforms would help to achieve this", and he outlined what they are.  That involves a move away from the reliance on corporation tax and setting it aside when one thinks it is a bonus.  What is the net impact?  There is clearly an impact on day-to-day Government spending.  What would the impact of that be, because there would obviously be less available funding?  Where would the moneys to replace that come from or is Mr. Coffey saying that the Government will just have to live within the limits below the corporation tax receipts?</p><p>Second, we have a copy of the OECD <i>Economic Outlook</i>.  To a layman, some of it does not seem to refer to us, and global growth might be different from Ireland, but it does call for an urgent need for a much bolder policy action to revive growth.  Obviously, Ireland does not have growth issues but without corporation tax receipts and, perhaps building, there are underlying growth issues.  The OECD points specifically to transitioning towards sustainable growth amidst digitalisation and climate challenges that would trigger a marked acceleration of investment, particularly from the private sector.  If the IFAC representatives were to answer no other question, I would like them to answer this: were the Government to take all its advice and put these portions of unsustainable, unreliable receipts in either a rainy day or prudence fund, where would we make up the difference?  What suggestions does IFAC have on that that are tenable and achievable from a tax perspective?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Martina Lawless" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019120400002#E00200"><p>I will take those in order.  The Taoiseach did suggest that a reduction in the windfall we have identified in corporate tax rates could be made up by an increase in stamp duties.  One reason we regularly warn about reliance on windfall taxes is that we saw large increases in stamp duties in the lead up to the previous crisis.  Has the Government become over-reliant on any one tax heading?  When we warn on corporate tax we are really talking about the unreliability of any tax head or over-reliance on any individual tax or sector.  In the previous context the construction sector was contributing heavily to stamp duties but also to VAT, income tax and so on.  Although we had a lot of money coming in from VAT, one particular sector was driving much of Government revenues and when that sector was particularly badly hit it had a big impact on overall Government revenues.  We would be quite concerned that moving from reliance on one windfall tax to another windfall tax is not a way to sustainably manage the public finance.  We would prefer to see a long-term balanced revenue and expenditure path that would be based on the underlying growth rate of the economy being matched on both the income and the expenditure side.</p></speech>

We cannot comment on that as we do not have all the information but what we have seen is that a budget is set every year for health and during the year it is exceeded.  That is not good budgeting by any means.  It so happens that corporation tax receipts have exceeded what was expected and, hey presto, that offsets the higher expenditure, even though the health expenditure is likely to be permanent whereas nobody knows if the corporation tax will be permanent.  We are not saying that too much is being spent on health but we are saying that there should be better budgeting rather than overruns every year.</p></speech>

If one looks across countries, some spend very little public money, some spend a lot and some get better value for money within that.  It is a choice, and that is the point that we are making.  One makes one's choice and then it should be budgeted accordingly.  We do not have a view as to whether the current spending is out of line with anything.</p></speech>

I think he mentioned the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  It would be impossible to transfer money to the National Pensions Reserve Fund as it no longer exists, but he was referencing providing the funds to the NTMA.  In general, that is what happens.  The NTMA managed the cash and the liquidity of the State.  It has ongoing financing needs to roll over debt.  This year, it was looking at borrowing around &euro;18 billion.  The indication is that any surplus that was available would simply be incorporated into that cash management strategy.  It is not the case that the money would not be used, it would simply go into the general cash management of the State and the NTMA would take account of that when it was looking at its borrowing requirements for the year, particularly when it comes to insuring that we have a liquidity reserve.  Since the crisis, we have maintained large amounts of cash in the fear that we might lose market access.  That might seem remote now but, equally, it might have seemed remote in 2008.</p> <p>  If the Government was to follow our advice on the three things we set out at the end of our submission, what would the impact be?  The Deputy referred to the impact on corporation tax and from where the hole would be filled.  Our advice when it comes to setting spending plans is that things such as corporation tax should be completely ignored and that spending plans should be based on what the Government thinks is the sustainable and hopefully reliable revenue sources.  Looking at temporary or windfall receipts should not impact it.  It should not be a case of seeing additional money coming in and then having additional spending on the basis of that.  As Dr. Lawless said, one must look at the long and medium term at what can be relied on for a number of years.  Taking those proposals into account, one would look at potential growth of the Irish economy.  We have done reasonably well in average growth.  In actuality it is very high or very low but the average is pretty okay.  Perhaps fiscal policy is contributing to that by spending too much in the good times and maybe undermining the economy in the poor times.  The impact would be to ignore those temporary revenues and put things on a sustainable fashion.  That would mean that services, supports and Government spending would be available every year, not just when money comes in.  </p></speech>

If one were to make an immediate adjustment it would, in our estimate, reduce by &euro;2 billion to &euro;6 billion from the budget as the Government has laid out.  We are not recommending that has to be done.  We are simply pointing out, as is the Department of Finance, perhaps in more explicit terms than we have, that it is a potential risk, that a hole could open up in the public finances.  How would we fill that hole?  Initially, one would look to borrow the money but we already have a &euro;200 billion debt and the benign financial conditions we find at present might not persist for very long.  On the impact of our proposals, it is about putting spending on a sustainable path, having it available all the time, not just when windfall revenues pour in.</p></speech>

We look at this on a net basis.  Say the Government wants to increase spending by more, or a potential hole has to be filled, it can be done through borrowing temporarily or by increasing taxes, it does not necessarily have to be a reduction in spending.</p></speech>

We were reminded again this week that corporation tax receipts are well ahead of expectations by more than &euro;700 million for November alone.  While the windfall is very welcome, the Government's reckless use of windfall income demands consideration, as IFAC has outlined.  Overruns are draining resources that could and should be used for the provision of vital services, meeting the demand of our healthcare services to providing social and affordable housing.</p><p>The Government, however, is characterised by its putting waste over spending and the misuse of these receipts.  That the receipts are under threat in turn poses a great risk to our capital projects.</p><p> I have a number of questions so I hope the witnesses might be able to provide us with some insight today into the risks posed by changing the national corporation tax regime.  In the next few years, changes will take place to how and where corporation tax receipts are paid as a result of the OECD-BEPS initiative.  The representatives have rightly highlighted this risk.  While the aim is to clamp down on tax avoidance, it will probably negatively affect our corporation tax receipts.  I would like the delegates to expand on this and give their thoughts on potential BEPS reform.  What will it mean in practice?  How will it affect revenue for the State?  Do the delegates have any ideas on how we can replace the lost revenue to keep our public expenditure at a sustainable level without proceeding to austerity?  It was reported this week that a surge in stamp duty from house sales will offset this risk.  Does the council have a view on that policy?  Could the delegates remind us how a surge in stamp duty to fund spending worked out the last time?  What case is there for using what are effectively windfall increases in corporation taxes to fund capital expenditure on a once-off basis?  Is that more sensible than plugging holes each year, thereby adding the expenditure to the base for the following year?</p><p> What is the view of the council on the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit at this point?  If the danger of a no-deal Brexit receded, what difference would it make to the council's general advice on how to approach the budget in the coming years?  We can discuss how expenditure is accelerating.  Does the council have a view on whether the issue is overspending or under-budgeting?  If overspending happens, as it does every year, is it surely not more logical to say we are being dishonest and under-budgeting in health, for example, rather than overspending?  We need to sort that out over the next couple of years.  We cannot keep going on pretending the budget is a certain amount while knowing expenditure will always be more.</p><p> On the issue of spending being at its maximum, or beyond, are we really not talking about an imbalance?  Spending could be perfectly sustainable but the revenues do not match or are temporary.  If revenue streams were to increase through taxes on wealth, for example, would spending not be sustainable if matched by revenue?</p><p> I wish to finish up on the issue of transparency or the lack of it in respect of local government and housing bodies.  Could the delegates expand on the problems they see and what should be done about them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.223" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019120400002#F00200"><p>Let me take one or two of those questions.  A very good question was asked on whether it would be justifiable to use the windfall corporation tax to fund capital expenditure.  We have two concerns about that kind of strategy.  There is a certain logic to it.  The first concern is that, essentially, the increase in investment we are seeing is really an increase in the level from what was a very low one to a much higher one that would essentially be sustained over quite a long period.  That really requires a matching revenue stream to go with it, which is why we are concerned about sustainability.</p> <p>  There is a second concern, which underlies some of our other answers, and it is associated with the extent to which the economy is able to produce and the risk of overheating.  One of the constraints is that the unemployment rate is very low and the economy is pretty active.  People are fully employed.  Additional investment has to be met within that constraint because the economy just cannot produce that much more on a sustainable basis.  That is another reason capital expenditure has to be thought of together with other forms of spending.</p> <p>  At present, we believe Government policy is probably fairly broadly balanced and that the overheating is not excessive.  However, the Department of Finance's own projections show that the economy will be overheating increasingly over the next couple of years.  That is a constraint on the ability to put more money into the economy.  Of course, if one takes the money out somewhere else, one can allow for more investment but one cannot just keep adding it on because there is a limit to how much the economy can produce.  That is different from the circumstances facing many countries.  A number of continental European countries, for example, are experiencing relatively weak demand.  For them, increasing investment would help to increase the level of output in a sustainable and good way but, in the Irish context, in an economy that is already quite close to full employment, there is a constraint on being able to accommodate future spending.  The economy just cannot produce that amount.</p></speech>

I believe that was an appropriate approach to take at the time.  Since 17 October, a withdrawal agreement was signed.  This is very much reliant on the next week's political developments in the United Kingdom.  We see the risk as having receded quite considerably relative to the circumstances in October and November.  The concern now really moves to what happens over the next year in terms of the negotiation of the second stage.  Assuming the withdrawal agreement is completely ratified, a free trade agreement is scheduled to be negotiated over what is really an incredibly short period.  One year up to the end of 2020 is a very short time internationally for a significant-----</p></speech>

The record is approximately seven months but that was between a very large country and a quite small country.  It was not precisely an equal partnership.  There is a possibility that the transition agreement will need to be extended in order to give time for the free trade agreement to be fully negotiated and ratified but there still remains a small but significant risk that the end of 2020 could be another cliff-edge Brexit.  If there is no free trade agreement negotiated at that point, we will be back to the stage of a WTO crash-out Brexit.  It is not off the agenda as a risk.</p></speech>

It misses a big gap in terms of what we know is Government activity.  I refer to genuine Government activity that matters just as much for stimulating the economy as every other form of expenditure and revenue.  Towards the end of each budget publication, there is what is called a "walk" from Exchequer to general Government.  The general Government figures are the more comprehensive ones that we really care about.  We would like to see the walk from the Exchequer to general Government produced in a very clear fashion.  We would like to see it on a gross basis, which means what is actually happening with spending could be seen.  What is actually happening with revenue could also be seen.  Right now, we cannot tell any of this.  If there were a huge jump in revenue that were perfectly offset with expenditure, we would not see it because the information is all in net terms.</p></speech>

We would care about that but we would also care about the other parts of non-Exchequer spending that are included.  It does include approved housing bodies.  It also includes local authority expenditure and revenue.</p></speech>

We have been trying to find out what that expenditure is and where it comes from.  We are told it is in the local authority and approved housing body area and that the bulk of it seems to pertain to approved housing bodies but we cannot get details on that at all.  We have regarded the money as an extra &euro;700 million that is being pumped into the economy through public expenditure next year beyond what was talked about on budget day.  What was done on budget day was in line with what we expected and what the Government had said it was going to do but we are still trying to work out where the extra &euro;700 million comes from.  Approved housing bodies are obviously good if there are more houses being built but it is the overall level of expenditure on a general Government basis that we are or should be looking at because the fiscal rules are all set in general Government terms, not in Exchequer terms.  We are highlighting that the extra expenditure is occurring and we are still trying to work out what exactly it is.  As Mr. Casey was saying, we would like to see more transparency in the figures published on budget day so we will not be fishing around trying to find this in future years.</p><p>It is inevitable that the budget concentrates on the Exchequer.  Even the figures for the end of November issued yesterday are Exchequer figures rather than general Government figures.  The walk from Exchequer to general Government is important from the point of view of the overall economy and our fiscal rules.</p></speech>

This is not something that has been formally assessed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council but I will give my personal views on the risks and what they might entail.  When we look at risk, we primarily look at forecasts or projections.  These go in both directions.  It could be the case that these changes are positive and result in increases, or it could go in the other direction.  To highlight that, we could go back to 2012 and 2013 when the OECD first started the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.  Various Oireachtas committees identified these changes as significant risks to Ireland but they have actually contributed to the increases in corporation tax we have seen in recent years.  An underlying principle of the OECD's project has been to align profit with substance.  Many of these American companies have significant substance in Ireland and we are seeing greater profit being allocated to that substance resulting in greater receipts for Ireland.</p> <p>  The BEPS project has moved on.  We are now on BEPS 2.0.  One of the principles of BEPS 2.0 is to assign more of the taxing rights to the market countries.  Profits are allocated less to production and some of the other activities to which they have traditionally been allocated and more to the countries in which the customers reside, particularly in the digital sphere.  More money going to the market countries could present a downside risk to Ireland.  There is also a proposal for a minimum effective tax rate.  The impact of such a measure on Ireland is unclear.  If it is a global minimum across corporate groups, the outcome for Ireland could be relatively benign.  If it were to be applied on a country-by-country basis, the outcome may be different.  </p> <p>  The issue we are highlighting is that there are significant risks and uncertainty with regard to corporation tax.  The Deputy asked whether we could replace the lost revenue if these risks have negative outcomes.  We believe that we should not need to replace it all, to follow on from Deputy Lahart's questioning.  We should avoid being in a position in which important key public services on which people rely are provided on the basis of potentially volatile revenue sources.  They should be on a sustainable footing.  We believe that more could have been done over recent years to achieve that.  For example, the Government set out a plan for this budget to increase net policy spending next year by approximately 3%.  We said that the Government should adhere to that plan.  We did not ask for anything additional, only that the Government deliver on the plan it set out.  One reason for adhering to that 3% is that doing so would have offset some of the more rapid increases in spending that have happened in recent years which have been masked by those corporation tax receipts.  The Government delivered a plan of 4.5% however.  This could be considered sustainable but it does not correct some of the reliance on corporation tax we have built up over recent years. </p> <p>  We see significant risks.  The money continues to come in.  We saw it yesterday.  The risks could result in positive or negative outcomes but we are highlighting the uncertainty, the concentration and the potential unreliability of corporation tax as a revenue source.</p></speech>

To follow up further on corporation tax, the financial journalist, Chris Johns, recently drew attention to the fact that the volatility of corporation tax receipts mainly arises in respect of the companies involved in foreign direct investment.  The Department did some modelling of its own with regard to recent developments in corporation tax.  This included some interesting information.  For example, I notice that Luxembourg's rate is twice ours but that it brings in more tax than we do.  Has the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council delved into this issue in the same way as the Department of Finance?  Are there problems with the tax itself in respect of its volatility in addition to the fact that Google, which is just up the road, and other such companies provide such a big chunk of the receipts?  It is remarkable that the Department's own report from last month modelling the developments shows such incredible volatility over a number of years and that forecasting is so bad.  Is something fundamentally wrong?  Does Mr. Johns have a point about the way the tax is applied to indigenous enterprise?  Perhaps it should be making a more significant contribution to general taxation revenue.  He seems to argue that too many things can be written off against an indigenous company's tax liability.  Is there a fundamental problem with the tax, aside from the reliance on foreign companies?</p> <p>  We are now speaking after the budget but we also had the council before us prior to the budget.  Have things changed fundamentally?  Many of us felt the budget was a non-event.  Does Mr. Coffey expect another budget in the next financial year?  The results of the general election in the UK will soon be known, we will know more about Brexit at the end of January, and we will probably have our own general election.  Does Mr. Coffey expect a whole new economic scenario to require a real budget, which the current budget is not?  The council has provided a revised heatmap on page 65 of the report.  Are there fundamental differences between this and what we saw before the budget?  </p> <p>  In response to my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, the witnesses referred to information the council does not have and to improving general Government accounting by the Department of Finance.  Are there still a lot of unknown unknowns or known knowns?  The local authorities and agencies are spending money but the Department of Finance still does not seem to know.  What does the council recommend in that area?</p> <p>  On climate change mitigation, we have new levels of carbon taxation.  It looks like carbon taxes will increase dramatically over the next decade.  What role does the council see carbon mitigation measures playing in expanding the sustainable revenue base of the country?  Those are the main questions I wished to ask.</p></speech>

Even before the recent surge in corporation tax, it was the most volatile of our main taxes.  It is a very cyclical tax which depends on profitability and the economic cycle.  Even prior to what we are now seeing, this tax has always been fundamentally volatile.  The nature of the tax means it can be quite hard to reduce that volatility.  It is a tax on something which depends on the economic cycle.  Other taxes are not as volatile.  Even without the recent surge, that should be taken into account.</p> <p>  With regard to the indigenous sector, one thing to note from recent figures from the CSO is that the share being paid by foreign multinationals has remained relatively stable at approximately 80%.  That means that the share being paid by domestically-owned companies has remained at approximately 20%.  Whereas in 2014 such companies paid approximately &euro;1 billion in corporation tax, they paid more than &euro;2 billion in 2018.  The figure is likely to be a bit higher again this year if the shares remain stable.  There has been an increase in the amount of corporation tax being paid by indigenous or domestically-owned companies.  That is an increase of 100% in the tax being paid by those companies.  The amount of corporation tax being paid by Irish-owned companies now probably exceeds the figures for 2007 or 2008.  The bulk of the payments back then came from the financial and banking sector as a result of the large profits they were booking.  That industry is in a very different environment now.  The amount of corporation tax being paid by other companies is even larger.  The indigenous sector is making a contribution but it is being overlooked because of the large amounts coming from the foreign multinational, whose contribution is much greater than it was before.</p><p>However, I am not sure how we can overcome the volatility inherent in corporation tax because of the type of tax it is.  The issue is how to account for it in medium-term plans.</p></speech>

This is a feature of our fiscal risks matrix on page 111.  We have listed missing our climate targets in the long term and therefore becoming subject to EU fines as both a high-probability and a high-impact risk for future fiscal sustainability.  It looks almost certain that we will miss the 2020 targets, which will mean fines of between &euro;150 million and &euro;400 million.</p></speech>

On the Deputy's other point, I note that, in general, economists oppose hypothecation.  The two decisions of how money should be collected and how money should be spent should be separate.  Hypothecation is not the most appropriate way to go about things.  It could be the case that hypothecation can help with the acceptance of carbon tax at a political and a wider societal level.  In the main, however, economists do not approve of it.</p></speech>

It is important to note that if fiscal policy is managed well, it should be very boring.  What is sustainable does not really change much from year to year.  What happens in good times should be the same as what happens in bad times.  From our perspective, the less drama the better.  For example, we have had very positive corporation tax news since the budget.  However, that should not really affect policymakers' view of what is sustainable.  It is a windfall and it should be dealt with appropriately.</p> <p>  One thing that did change in the budget is the additional overruns in health spending.  That was an obvious disappointment in 2019.  However, there has been a new and welcome development where our advice has been followed.  In 2020, that money is not being put into the base.  Additional measures have been taken to keep the 2020 plan where it was and not shift health spending upwards as happened in the past.  That has been a very welcome development.  It must now be implemented, which will be challenging.  We will look at that very closely in the coming year.</p> <p>  We also got two scenarios for Brexit.  That was very helpful.  Irrespective of what happens in the next few months, we have a good idea from the Government of what it will look like if things carry on along a relatively smooth path and what will happen if things go wrong for some reason.  It may not be very obvious today, but things are very volatile in the UK at the moment.  That is helpful and it all contributes to a sense of smoothness and good management.</p></speech>

The Deputy also asked about the economic picture and how the heat map has changed.  Not much has changed in that specific area, but one interesting area that has changed a bit is the wage picture.  I refer to the growth in wages year on year.  They seem to have picked up quite a bit again, which is not something we expected.  The year-on-year growth rates are running at about 3.6% in nominal terms.  The comparable rate in the eurozone is at about 0.6%.  When compared with historical norms in Ireland, that does not seem that high because we had very high wage growth rates during the 2000s.  However, given that we have low inflation and wages in other eurozone countries are not growing at the same pace, it could become an issue for competitiveness and could contribute to future imbalances.  One other thing-----</p></speech>

The other question concerned other unknown unknowns in the general Government figures.  By virtue of them being unknown unknowns, we do not know.  It is really unfortunate that we cannot see more detail on this stuff because it is so big.  As I say, this accounts for about a fifth of the overall activity that the Government participates in, both in what it puts into the economy and what it takes out.  We just do not have enough detail on it.</p></speech>

It is not as though we have unearthed things that are not publicly available.  We look at the budget documents published by the Department of Finance and the broader Government accounts included with the budget documents.  That information pointed to the &euro;700 million increase in capital spending that was not featured in the equivalent figures in April.  There is publicly available information, but the issue arises in understanding what drives spending, what areas it is in and what type of activity it is.  We pointed to increased spending by the approved housing bodies, but one issue that arose is their purchase of existing houses.  That might not add to economic activity.  Alternatively, that spending could signify the construction of new houses, which definitely would add to economic activity.</p> <p>  When it comes to Exchequer spending, the Department publishes a 247-page report that goes line by line through the changes in Exchequer spending.  That report focuses on 80% of activity.  When it comes to the other 20%, we just get the aggregate figures.  It could be a because of lack of quality reliable information.  This has been flagged by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The OECD recently published a report on Ireland's public finances and recommended a move from the narrow cash-based approach of the Exchequer accounts to a broader accrual-based approach of general Government accounting.  There has been a Government decision to implement the recommendations of that OECD report, and the Government hopes to do so over the next five years.  While there might be problems at present, there is an awareness of those problems.  An external report has found that changes need to be introduced, the recommendations of that report have been accepted, and there has been a Government decision to move in that direction.  Our concern here is that this has had a greater effect when it comes to 2020 than would otherwise have been the case.  By and large, the budgetary changes in the Exchequer account drive budgetary changes in the overall general Government accounts, but that has not been the case this year.</p> <p>  Our expectation is that there will not be another budget for 2020.  We think the budget was real.  Outside of a Brexit contingency, primary Government spending on goods and services, that is, all Government spending excluding interest, is planned to rise by &euro;4.4 billion next year.  That is a real increase.</p></speech>

I will kick off with the area of corporation tax.  The council outlines a scenario in which corporation tax receipts return to 2014 levels.  Receipts have overperformed since then, but is there any evidence that all of this increase is excess?  Could some of it be a structural increase, meaning that 2014 is not an appropriate base year to work from?</p> <p>  The assessment report is critical of the intention not to transfer the &euro;400 million in contributions to the rainy day fund this year and next year.  At the same time the council suggests that the &euro;1.5 billion transfer from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund should be used for a different purpose to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.</p><p>The strategic investment fund discretionary portfolio is worth around &euro;8.5 billion, of which &euro;1.5 billion will be transferred.  A further &euro;1.5 billion is to be targeted towards infrastructure and investments, leaving around &euro;5.5 billion to support economic activity.  Is that not sufficient, and if not, what is?</p><p> The report reads, "There is a case for suspending Rainy Day Fund payments in the event of a disorderly scenario, but the case for suspending payments without the risk materialising is less convincing."  Given the Government is projected to run a fiscal deficit, would it not be unwise to borrow to fund the rainy day fund as well as being financially imprudent given the cost of servicing such borrowing?</p><p> On the technical expenditure, specifically the forecast for a future pay deal, the council is critical of the omission of any provision of a further pay deal in the expenditure forecasts.  Were this included, would it not create a floor for future expenditure rather than working as a ceiling?  What impact would it have on the Government's negotiating position with unions if they could see a specific sum had been set aside prior to going into negotiations?  That is a practicality that must be borne in mind.</p><p> On fiscal rule compliance, the assessment report is 160 pages, including references to three different frameworks for assessing compliance, including the council's own principle-based approach, its old approach, and that of the European Commission.  The report claims that the new approach makes assessment simpler.  Does including additional approaches have the opposite impact and only act to make the assessment of fiscal rules more confusing for people?  Can this lead to a dilution of the messages?  Mr. Barnes referred to the two scenarios around Brexit, and they have been helpful.  Given that budget 2020 was prepared on a no-deal basis, if that does not come to pass, and I take the point Dr. Lawless made earlier, does IFAC believe that the economic growth forecast set out in the summer economic statement is the more appropriate scenario to rely on for future planning rather than the forecasts in budget 2020?</p><p> I note the comments on windfall taxes.  The biggest percentage increase year on year in tax take is not corporation tax at 5.9% but income tax at 8.6%.  Given that income tax is our biggest tax head and one of the most reliant on the real economy, does that not point to the public finances being in a robust position?  There was comment here on not repeating the mistakes of the past, particularly those made by the Government during the Celtic tiger.  Will IFAC comment on the income tax take being 38% of the overall tax take compared with 28% in 2006?  Does that not point to the economy being in a much stronger position?</p></speech>

I will take corporation tax.  What we have done in trying to determine the excess is to take a range of approaches, not just a single one.  The year 2014 is clearly before the most recent surge happened.  We are not saying that everything that happened since then could be considered an excess but it is one of a range of approaches that we use.  In overall terms, comparing the initial 10% forecast for 2019, we are saying that the range of the possible excess is from &euro;2 billion to &euro;6 billion.  It could be that a very large amount of it is structural, as the Deputy indicated.  We are simply highlighting, first, the nature of the increase in recent years, which has been very rapid, and second, that using different measures gives different indications as to what might be considered an excess performance.  We are not hanging our hat on one individual approach but putting a range of them out there.</p> <p>  On the performance of taxes, income tax is up 8% this year.  Something we have tried to highlight is the performance of PRSI this year.  It has grown by almost 10%.  Returning to our earlier point on an overconcentration on Exchequer figures, PRSI is a very significant revenue source that is generally ignored.  Its growth of 10% is quite significant.  It is about &euro;400 million ahead of forecast.  It is very deep within the fiscal monitor.  We can try to figure it out but it highlights the broader question that there should be more focus on things outside of the Exchequer.  Corporation tax for this year looks like it will outperform forecast by 16% compared with what was set out in the budget last year, which was an estimate for this year of just under &euro;10 billion.  It looks like it will exceed that and be close to &euro;11 billion.  One reason the year-on-year performance might not seem very strong is that in 2018 we were informed that there were significant one-off payments that would not be repeated in 2019.  While the headline year-on-year growth rate might look modest enough at 5%, if it is done on the underlying basis and the one-off payment from last year that was not repeated is stripped out, then the growth in 2019 looks stronger again and is probably ahead of income tax and PRSI.</p> <p>  On concentration and income tax being 38% of tax compared with 2006, the Deputy is not comparing like with like.  In 2006, significant revenues would have been collected by the health levy that was then in place.  It was a tax that did not go into the Exchequer and therefore is ignored by and large.  It was collected elsewhere in the general Government sector.  At the start of 2010, I think, we introduced the universal social charge, which combined the health levy, which existed in 2006, and the income levy that was introduced in 2009.  They are now paid into the Exchequer account.  I do not have the figures to hand but a more complete comparison between 2006 and the present day would show that the gap or concentration in income tax is not quite as changed as the figures the Deputy gave suggest.  It does highlight some of the changes that have arisen as the income tax system has changed.  The universal social charge, which is collected as income tax, was introduced and some of the other changes introduced during the crisis have not been reversed.  Our focus on corporation tax is justified, and the growth, when those one-offs are stripped out, is still quite significant.</p></speech>

The fiscal rules are important in providing an anchor for fiscal policy.  In recent years they have provided some helpful signals on both when policy was too loose or when it was on the right track.  When we move towards a principles-based approach, we did think very carefully and precisely about the Deputy's question whether it was complicated enough and why then we needed another framework.</p> <p>  We had two serious concerns about the European approach and how useful it was for us, at least for us as a fiscal council.  The first was the complexity of the European rules, which take the form not only of quite a complicated system laid out in various laws, regulations and treaties but also of a 126 page book provided by the European Commission, called Vade Mecum, which is immensely complicated.  We found we were spending a huge amount of time just trying to understand very arcane rules, often in footnotes, that were very hard to rationalise or to explain.  We also had a more substantive concern that because of the way the Commission measures the economic cycle, there is a big risk that the European rules are procyclical.  In the good times they say to spend more when states should spend less, and in bad times they come back and bite states and say that they should be cutting spending at a time when states should not do that.</p> <p>  Because of this procyclicality, and because in the intervening time the Council and the Department of Finance have provided our own estimates of potential output and the output gap that we think are fairly solid - while it is uncertain, we think they present a reasonable representation of where we are - we thought it was important to reflect that in the fiscal rules.  That is why we decided that for our own assessment and the domestic Irish framework, a principles-based approach that was simpler and reduced the risk of procyclicality was a cost worth paying, even if it was a little more complicated.  We hope that people will find it a useful tool to think about policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Tutty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019120400002#J00400"><p>We have argued in recent years that the excess unexpected income coming in should be put into a rainy day fund.  I would not argue that we should go borrowing to put money into a rainy day fund, but given the strong growth in the economy, we should have been building up through something like a rainy day fund the ability to have money when the downturn comes so that we can spend it then.  Instead, the excess revenue has been going out in unplanned expenditure on health and other areas every year.  We argue that the whole rainy day fund should be available in a downturn to support economic activity.  We are not saying it should be used now to do so because we are reaching full capacity as it is and the economy does not need a stimulus, although it will need it one day when the downturn comes.</p><p>Given that excess corporation tax was even announced yesterday, there could still be scope to put money into a rainy day fund if the Government wanted to do so.  If the money is effectively going to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, to reduce our debt, it is a good use of it as well.</p><p> There was mention of the dangers of putting any estimate of future pay deals into budget forecasts.  That is undoubtedly an issue.  If one publishes forecasts for the next three years on the basis there would be no pay increases beyond what is already agreed, with no provision for inflation - although there may be provision for demographics - one would not really be producing meaningful forecasts.  It would just be a mechanical job of saying that on the basis of current pay and price levels, this is what will happen.  Revenue would be done on a different basis, making assumptions about growth, inflation and wages in the economy.  If we want a realistic forecast, there must be some provision for these factors.  One might not announce a provision for a 5% pay increase and it might be made a little fuzzy.  If something like that is not done, however, the forecast would not be realistic.</p><p> There is no use in saying the budget would be in surplus by X% in 2022 and 2023 when we know the figures behind that are just not realistic.  We have been trying to say that forecasts should be based on realistic figures and not figures which do not take account of realities.  I understand the problem of saying that a pay increase of X has been built in but a realistic forecast needs to build in something.  Otherwise, the forecasts would be meaningless.</p></speech>

If we include a figure of 2.5% as the most we think we can afford to spend, it would become a negotiation straight away.  The unions would accept nothing less and push for more.  I understand the problem outlined by Mr. Tutty but this is a crux.  He must understand there is a problem on the other side as well.</p></speech>

We must also compare this year's overrun to what happened in previous years.

Much of the overrun in the health area has been on staffing and pay, and these are exactly the types of areas where we have seen no provision.  We have not seen wage increases banked for the medium term or pay and price increases, which are really important in the health sector.</p></speech>

Oxfam, Christian Aid and many countries have said that Ireland is a tax haven.  I know it does not fit the technical definition of tax haven but nobody fits that definition.  When the Government argues that Ireland is not a tax haven because it does not fit the definition, it is meaningless.  The world and its mother believes we are Europe's tax haven and Oxfam, Christian Aid and others believe the same.  Do they at least have an argument in saying we are a tax haven?  The council has recognised our vulnerability to what it terms "unreliable" revenue but this is unreliable because the move to deal with corporation tax avoidance could close that revenue.</p> <p>  If we wanted a more sustainable economy, we would welcome the move to make the corporations pay more tax and have a minimum effective rate across Europe or globally.  Ultimately, it would put us in a more sustainable and less risky position.  Is that not at least a fair argument?</p> <p>  It is rarely acknowledged that profits have gone through the roof in this country over the past ten years.  The rise in profits has massively outstripped any rise in wages for workers.

Deputy Lahart reads them too.  The graphs detailing profits are pretty stunning.  They demonstrate that profits of corporations have gone from approximately &euro;40 billion in 2008 to &euro;140 billion, which is stunning by any measure.  I am not sure what rate wage increases have been at over that period but perhaps the witnesses know.  Will they confirm that wage increases are not even close to that level of increase?  To put this in layman's terms, the benefit of the absolutely spectacular economic growth that this country has seen has not gone to working people but rather to corporations.</p> <p>  The witnesses have outlined concerns about expenditure, saying that we cannot borrow to fund public services because of our debt position.  They have argued that we must budget properly.  We cannot stop spending on health, education and housing.  Would it be good to focus on another rarely examined area, namely tax loopholes for the corporate sector?  Will the witnesses comment on whether more focus should go on that area?  Inter-group transactions are profit shifting and this has gone from &euro;9 billion to &euro;16 billion.  These are astonishing figures, leaving aside there was a jump from &euro;2 billion in the previous year to the &euro;9 billion figure.  Perhaps we should be looking at such things.</p> <p>  I have a question on approved housing bodies.  Do the witnesses find it problematic that the Government's housing policy relies on a process where the expenditure on housing assistance rental accommodation scheme payments to the private sector also contains risk from a public expenditure perspective?</p><p>We do not know how much we might be charged by private landlords for providing social housing over the coming years.  Would that also concern Mr. Coffey in addition to the AHBs he mentioned?</p></speech>

I am not quite sure in which circumstances Ireland could avoid being a tax haven in that instance if it is a tax haven when it collects what would be considered to be low and also when it collects relatively high amounts.</p> <p>  On corporation tax, I note that the corporation tax receipts in both France and Germany have doubled since 2009.  It took a longer period for their doubling to take place.  Our doubling has taken place since 2015.  However, in those countries the receipts have increased.  The BEPS process has not necessarily been about trying to get corporations to pay more tax.  It has in large part been about changing that.  One of the risks in the Irish case is that more tax could be taken away from the production activities that were traditionally allocated taxing rights to the more consumer or market end of the spectrum.  It is not necessarily about increasing the overall amount of tax and it could be about the destination of it.</p> <p>  Recently the body equivalent to ours in France, the French Council of Economic Analysis, undertook a study of the impact of the current BEPS proposals on French corporation tax revenue.  When it looked at the Pillar 1 proposal to allocate more taxing rights to the market countries, it found it would have almost no impact on French corporation tax receipts in net terms.  While it found significantly more revenue would be collected from digital companies, online companies and Internet companies, on the other hand it would lose a significant amount of tax revenue from the sale of handbags, cognac, cars-----</p></speech>

The net effect was a reallocation and the overall impact on French corporation tax revenues was modest for those proposals.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked who has benefited from the profit increase in recent years and whether this has gone to the workers.  Many of the changes the first round of the BEPS proposals have introduced have not been necessarily an increase in corporation profits, but a reduction in corporation profits that were declared in the pure tax haven jurisdictions - and there are tax havens out there - with no income or corporation taxes.  These are jurisdictions where the companies have no substance and it was simply unrealistic to say that they could be locating profits in them.  The first rounds of BEPS proposals were about limiting the ability of companies to declare profits in jurisdictions where all they had was a brass plate company.</p> <p>  Some of that profit has now been declared in Ireland where the substance is and it has added to the profit figures the Deputy has suggested.  However, the biggest increase in profits would be in the multinational sector.  I would imagine that is driving a large part of that increase from &euro;40 billion to &euro;140 billion as the Deputy highlighted.  The multinational sector is the best-paying sector in Ireland.  I do not think the Deputy can suggest that the workers there do not benefit.  They are the companies generating the profits and they are also the companies that are paying their workers the most.</p> <p>  The Deputy's final point was about tax loopholes.  I have done a second report on corporation tax.  Some of those changes have been introduced with more to be introduced from the start of next year.  There will be changes to our transfer pricing rules and other things set out in the roadmap the Minister for Finance has published.  Some of the problems in Ireland's corporation tax regime are being addressed and may also be contributing to some of the additional receipts we are collecting.  That is all entirely outside the remit of the fiscal council, but I thought I would deal with some of the points the Deputy made.</p> <p>  Someone else might wish to pick up the housing issues which is also potentially outside our explicit mandate.</p></speech>

It is somewhat ironic to think that at the time of the last financial crash and crisis, notwithstanding the worldwide scale of it or the overdependency of our economy on property related revenues, we had a National Pensions Reserve Fund with &euro;26 billion in it.  We were glad to have it considering the mammoth task that faced the country thereafter.</p> <p>  Fast-forward to today and we are told that everything is being managed.  We have fiscal rules.  We are told that the economy is managed prudently.  We have the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in place to advise and ensure we do not find ourselves at a similar crossroads again in the future.  We have no rainy day fund and yet people ask what we have learned.  We would be worse off now if we were impacted with anything of that magnitude than we were then.  We have not learned a whole lot, have we?  Windfall taxes are being used to plug holes rather than being put into the National Pensions Reserve Fund or the rainy day fund, which is not too prudent.  Despite all those who were pontificating for so long, we have not got very far, which is quite alarming when it is brought down to brass tacks.</p> <p>  The commentary in the IFAC report on health spending overruns is rightly quite damning.  Others have been saying we have had dishonest budgets in the form of the health Vote in recent years.  It needs to be repeated, if we are to learn anything.  When I talk about health overruns, I should qualify it.  The benefit of that spending is not evident to the public, including those I represent.  They get quite annoyed to hear talk of health overruns because it cannot be seen on the ground.  There have been no new home care packages in County Offaly since last June except for a few terminal cases.  I am part of a team that seeks to make advances in that area and tries to target funding specifically at certain areas in the health budget, which is not necessarily possible in the context of framing a budget because it is something that is agreed between the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform thereafter.</p> <p>  People see the closed wards, the waiting lists, the issues with rural doctors and the loss of out-of-hours doctor service in country areas.  Mr. Coffey has said that in the last few years of weak planning and spending control, budget allocations have not been seen as credible by health managers.  Why is that?  Have we learned anything?  For example, we hear that a budgetary process provides for an increase in allocation to the Department of Health.  We would expect improvements, but we do not get improvements.  The increased allocation is just to stand still.</p> <p>  Even in its effort to stand still we realise that the demographics were all wrong this year.  It was &euro;60 million out in the space of a few weeks.  That &euro;60 million could provide 1,200 primary schoolteachers, 2 million home help hours or 240 social houses.  That &euro;60 million might not be much in the context of a &euro;3 billion budget.  It might not be much to economists and experts who study this field every day of the week.  However, it is a considerable amount to a family who cannot get a package for a disabled family member or to an elderly person who cannot come home and live in their own house or be in their own community.</p> <p>  Mr. Coffey has stated categorically that health is a big problem in the budgetary process.  I and others have been saying it is not having the desired effect.</p><p>As I said earlier, we are ten years on from that supposedly and improvements had to be made in all those institutions and insulations were put in place to ensure we never arrived at that crossroads again but we are worse off.  That is the truth of the matter.</p></speech>

I would broadly break them down into two categories, namely, what have we learned and issues related to health.  I will deal with the first category and hand over to my colleagues to deal with the issues related to health.  What have we learned?  A phrase we use occasionally when describing the current situation is that there are echoes of the past.  There are some similarities to what has gone before.  We can get too fixated with some of the problems we had in 2006, 2007 and 2008 because there are differences.  It is possible we are only doing this in retrospect but if we consider the economy in 2006-07, we can clearly see where the significant problems were.  I would point to the over-reliance in the economy as a whole on construction activity and how that over-reliance on construction activity carried forward to a concentration in the public finances in construction related and property-related taxes, so the two were linked.  When we look at 2019, there is a difference.  I do not think we see the same extent of risks within the broader economy.  There is not a reliance on activity in a particular sector or a risk that activity could stop at the rate at which it stopped in 2008.  We do, however, see risks in the public finances with a reliance on a volatile source of tax revenue which is not really related to activity in the economy.  The profitability of the multinationals, which is a key driver of the tax receipts we are seeing, is based on their international operations and on decisions made not necessarily about what happens in Ireland but about what happens internationally.</p> <p>  Some comparison can be made and the Deputy was right to ask what have we learned.  A key objective the fiscal council will have is that we do not forget and that we consider the impact to which some of the mistakes of the past have led.  While there is some similarity we would see differences.  When it comes to the economy as a whole, the Deputy will note from the report one area where we would see added value is in the analysis of what we would call the current account of the balance of payments, taking account of the overall level of spending in the economy and how that compares to our income.  During 2004, 2005 and 2006 that deteriorated.  We were running a current account deficit.  We were spending more than we were earning and that hole was being filled by borrowing, primarily by the private sector at the time.  If we consider the current account in 2018, we are running a significant surplus.  As an economy we are generating an income that is greater than our spending.  We will not give it a clean bill of health.  The corporation tax receipts we earn are counted in that income and perhaps some allowance should be given to that but as an economy we seem to be in a much better position compared to where we were in 2006 and 2007.  Our chief concerns would be about the  public finances and we highlight the risks that are there.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the level of debt we are now carrying that we did not have.  In 2006 and 2007 net debt was close to zero.  There was some debt but, as the Deputy mentioned, there was a significant amount of assets.  We are now in a position where we have &euro;200 billion of debt, we have some modest assets that can be offset against it, but it still is a significantly worse debt position than what we had in 2006.  We see a surge in corporation tax revenue and that surge not being reflected in an improvement in the overall budgetary position.  The money is being spent as quickly as it is coming in.  We hope people have not forgotten what happened but we would not link too much to what happened in 2006-07.  There are differences.  Putting the public finances on a sustainable basis is important.  We saw the difficulties, problems and trauma involved in pulling back public services.  We are not opposed to public spending.  We want it to happen every year.  The hope is that what we have learned is the importance of putting the public finances on a sound footing.  We have seen problems in recent years with spending growing faster than can be considered sustainable and that could lead to problems but, hopefully, efforts will be made to address that spending.  It is set to slow down for 2019.  It is still close to the limit of what would be considered sustainable.  I hope we have learned from what happened.  Our role in the fiscal council is to ensure that the rest of you do not forget.</p></speech>

As a share of the overall health budget, that is not really that large.  That is how we think about it.  We can tolerate some overruns and underruns to an extent when they are small as a proportion of what it is we are spending overall.  I would look at VAT in that context.  Our points about overruns do not really come from the demographic side.  We have looked at demographic pressures in detail and we published a separate report every year called the Stand-Still Scenario.  Basically, we take current policy and ask what would happen if we were to continue growing this set of policies in line with demographic pressures and cost pressures, basically prices, wages and things like that, and what budgetary policy might look like in a few years time given those and how they are expected to evolve.  We find there are not major differences between us and the Department of Finance or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of demographic pressures.  Most of the differences are down to that other element, the prices, wages and cost pressures which they do not account for systematically over the medium term.  Their argument would be that is something for the Government of the day to legislate for in terms of provision.</p></speech>

One point to note is what we are making our analysis based on, which is on the original figures in the budget, looking at what the outturn is and an overrun relative to what was budgeted for versus what happened at the end.  In the report we look at spending on hospitals, which seems to have been a large source of the overruns in recent years.  The budgeted amounts between the 2013-18 were annual decreases averaging &euro;80 million.  The budget set out an average reduction each of &euro;80 million.  The outturns were annual increases of &euro;280 million.  What we are comparing are the figures in the initial budget versus what happened at the end.  That is not to say there have not been changes or an impact on services.  It should be clear what it is we are looking at.  The impact of the overruns might not necessarily be those additional services the Deputy pointed out.  It could just be a combination of inappropriate or unrealistic budgets to begin with and a failure to stick to those budgets throughout the year.  We feel particularly regarding hospitals it looks like it is a combination of the two.</p></speech>

I want to drill down into corporation tax.  We keep saying it is unreliable.  Do the witnesses say that because of the proposed changes in tax law that may be made internationally or because these businesses only have a certain life cycle?  If it is the latter, why do we not squeeze the absolute pips out of them in the meantime if they are going to leave anyway?  We see Intel is making further investment.</p> <p>  In terms of the associated housing bodies, I would say some of that money relates to the purchase of homes.  That is what we would see with respect to the &euro;700 million that was mentioned.  </p> <p>  My final question, which was not answered in the first round of questions, relates to the OECD paper.  Aside from raising taxes as an alternative to corporation tax, is there a policy shift that we can be making to offset our over-reliance on these taxes as the OECD recommends in terms of a digital economy and climate action economy?  Perhaps this does not come within the council's remit.  I may have to leave half-way through the answer but it is not out of disrespect as I have to watch the clock.</p></speech>

To answer the first question, it is partly because of companies' idiosyncratic strategies or profits but it is also because of international developments, such as BEPS, that potentially affect all or many of them at the same time.  With regard to the issues the OECD is raising, which are very worthy issues in terms of long-term investment and the digital climate, there is general advice and there is quite a specific Irish context.  Ireland has one of the highest public debt ratios in the OECD.  It also has an economy that is performing relatively well.  This means that some of the arguments that might apply in other places, such as that those policies can be financed through debt to help stimulate the economy, are much less applicable in the Irish context.</p></speech>

It is correct that some of the spending could be through approved housing bodies acquiring existing properties.  The concern from our perspective is that we do not know.  There should be greater transparency on what activity the spending is leading to.  We are not opposed to the spending.  We are saying if it is included in the budget documents, as it currently is, so that we do see the changes, we should know what is driving those changes.  The provision of social housing and housing in general is a policy area for the Government.  If the Government is achieving its policy objectives through these it should be visible.</p></speech>

What are their feelings on the likely level of contributions we will have to make to the EU budget in the coming years and the way it may be adjusted?  I also want to ask about the comparative spending changes between social protection, health and education.  This brings me back to the first point.  Are the witnesses satisfied that Ireland remains very attractive for foreign direct investment?  We are a trading country.  We are heavily exposed internationally at a period when there are problems and disputes in the world trade.  These are rolling along and may or may not have an effect on us.  We do not know yet.</p> <p>  The appetite of social media companies for bringing property and intellectual property into Ireland seems to be without limit.  In fact, it looks as though Ireland is not just a target for foreign direct investment but it has become very much a preferred investment spot as the country for investment by these companies.  This is significant.  It is something we have to take into account over and beyond the tax elements, which we have often discussed.</p> <p>  Alongside this, we have the prospect of becoming the third to fifth largest contributor to the EU budget in the foreseeable future if the figures keep going in the direction they are going.  These are not necessarily risks but they are issues that will probably be significant for us.  What is the broad outlook of the witnesses on the opportunities and some of the risks involved?  We are going into uncertain territory with Brexit and the UK's EU contributions will fall away.  The Finnish Presidency has tabled proposals for 0.7% contributions to the EU budget.  What are the views of the witnesses on how these are likely to impact?</p></speech>

In my personal view, we are in a sweet spot when it comes to attracting foreign direct investment, particularly from the US.  We are in a sweet spot in all areas with regard to investment, employment and tax being located in Ireland.  We see this not only in the social media companies mentioned by the Deputy but also in companies manufacturing computer chips or pharmaceuticals.  It is something that has been identified as a risk in recent years, with the emphasis on risk being a downside.  What we have seen foreign direct investment holding up and, in many areas, increasing.  A possible impact, as the Deputy has pointed out, would be on our EU contribution.  IFAC identifies our EU contribution as a potential risk.  We do not rate it as a high impact or a high probability but we identify it as something that could potentially have an impact.</p> <p>  Recently, the Taoiseach indicated his belief that over the next six years Ireland's EU contribution will rise by 45%.  It is something that is there.  There is the potential for it to increase even more if the bases on which the contributions are calculated change significantly.  We are getting into the weeds.  One of the bases for the calculation is a country's gross national income, which is a standard measure in international accounts.  We have our own modified version in Ireland.  Traditional gross national income is used at the base.  If this intellectual property moves to Ireland it could substantially increase our gross national income and substantially increase our EU contribution.</p> <p>  We have made a change that means these impacts can be offset and paid for because the cap on the amount of the capital allowances that can be used in any given year against the profits linked to those intangible assets has been reduced to 80%.  We have some of those profits in our corporate tax base and would collect corporation tax on an annual basis if those intellectual property assets were moved to Ireland, as seems likely.  At least for assets that have come since October 2017 there would be additional corporation tax revenue to offset the potential initial EU contribution.  There are other factors that could cause our EU contribution to increase, including the UK exit from the European Union and the fact that perhaps the EU budget could be increased.  With regard to foreign direct investment, there is the risk that intellectual property could cause it to increase.</p> <p>  I would not necessarily say it is the social media companies that have moved their intellectual property to Ireland in recent years.  They have been significant sources of employment growth and have purchased buildings throughout the city.  Figures from the CSO suggests that most of the intellectual property moved to Ireland to date has been in manufacturing sectors, particularly pharmaceuticals.  Much of the intellectual property linked to social media companies remains offshore.  There is the potential for this to come to Ireland over the next 12 to 18 months.  The two possible destinations are the US and Ireland.  Ireland offers certainty but it might be that the companies move their intellectual property back to the US.  There is potential for significant changes to our national accounts, our gross domestic product and our gross national income leading to increases in our EU contribution.  We do highlight this as a potential risk but at least we now have the change from budget 2018 which means the cap has been reduced to 80% and we are collecting some additional revenue.</p></speech>

They have spent approximately &euro;5 billion on capital investment in my constituency over a five year period.  This would be very striking in any EU country, never mind Ireland.  What interests me, looking at the total Government spend figures in the Irish economy at present, is that approximately &euro;21 billion is being spent on social protection, which includes money for older demographics, we have the extraordinary figure in the Supplementary Estimate for health of &euro;17 billion, and another extraordinary figure in education, which is right back down at approximately &euro;11 billion.  Attracting quality and sustainable foreign direct investment involves good salaries and conditions.</p><p>In conjunction with our tax arrangements, our calling card is our supply of people who are well educated, interested and willing to work in local and international businesses.  Notwithstanding the in-flows to the Exchequer, we are not reinvesting in education on the capital or current side in a way that would support the sustainability of the model that, in part, we have developed and, in part, has been visited on us.  The UK being outside the EU area and Ireland remaining in it could heighten our attractiveness in terms of investment.  Many of the witnesses have academic links.  Do they have any concerns about the education budget?</p></speech>

As previously stated by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, there are financial downside risks to our failing to meet our climate targets, including potential fines.  There are also spending requirements in terms of what we need to do.  Much of what we need to do will be supported by private finance but the public buildings retrofit, which is a huge project, and the social housing retrofit, which is a multibillion euro project, and the ramping up of afforestation, will be State supported.  It is possible to transfer the allocation for roads to public transport.  There is a proposal to drain some of the bogs and to use PSO levies to part fund that work.  The PSO levies are relatively small and the expenditure increases are relatively large.  If we do not make that spend, we face the risk of fines yet there is no easy, obvious solution, other than raising taxes in a range of different areas.</p> <p>  Did the Department liaise with the council on the national development plan?  Has the council assessed it and, if so, is that envelope fiscally astute in terms of capital spend over the next ten or 12 years?  I know that the council has an interest in climate issues but I do not know if it has carried out analyses or research of what other funding mechanisms might arise.  We could use the increased corporation tax revenues to increase the budget for the national development plan.  I am sure Mr. Coffey's response to that suggestion is that we should not be depending on corporation tax receipts for current expenditure, never mind climate expenditure.  If his response is that every tax should be raised, that is not politically easy to do.  Cutting current expenditure also is not easy.  It is a difficult political question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019120400002#O01000"><p>As already highlighted, it is very much a political choice.  To increase spend in one particular area does not necessarily require increases in taxes or cuts in spending elsewhere.  We are speaking about an economy that in a benign scenario will continue to grow and generate fiscal resources.  Choices can be made in regard to how those resources are used.  For example, for 2020 we looked at an upper sustainable limit of increasing policy spending of 4.5%, which in monetary terms amounts to approximately &euro;4 billion.  That does not involve cutting the level of expenditure in any area or any additional taxes.  There is a choice to be made in regard to the priorities for the use of that money.  If it is not to be spent on the climate change expenditure areas highlighted by Deputy Eamon Ryan, that would suggest that the political process does not view those as being a priority.</p></speech>

That might not necessarily provide much leeway given that everyone will be looking for their slice of whatever was committed to.</p></speech>

If the money goes to particular areas, then the political system has evaluated that they are the priority.  The funds are available.  The additional fiscal resources can be generated with the continued performance of the economy.  It is not a matter for the fiscal council to decide whether those additional resources should be allocated to tax reductions, capital spend or current spend.  We repeatedly make the point that a well managed economy generates fiscal resources which can be used in different areas.  As mentioned in my responses to Deputy Bruton, we are not being transparent around how those fiscal resources are being used.  Every year, massive Supplementary Estimates are provided.  This money would create a significant amount of funding for climate change priorities.  Supplementary Estimates are ongoing and cumulative.  They could amount to &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million per annum, which means that by year four or five they amount to &euro;3 billion or &euro;3.5 billion.</p></speech>

Prior to budget 2017, we reviewed the planned increases in capital spend and what had happened over the previous decade.  It appeared that Ireland had a level of public capital spend that was low in European terms and ranked us towards the bottom of international comparisons.  This could, potentially, have led to a public capital stop that was not appropriate for the economy and the growth in the economy.  We reviewed the increases that were planned for public capital spend and we came to the conclusion that they were appropriate and should be followed through.  We examined the medium-term objectives of the national development plan.  There were substantial increases.  Capital spend increased from &euro;4 billion in 2013-14 to approximately &euro;8 billion this year, which means it has doubled.  We did not assess whether it was appropriate to meet our infrastructure needs, bottlenecks or climate change actions but we came to the conclusion that it was appropriate given the low levels we were coming from and that it was up to the political process to decide how that money should be spent.</p></speech>

At a meeting of this committee a few weeks ago, I put the following suggestion to the Minister for Finance.  If the minimum corporate tax rate was set at 10% or 12.5%, would it have a stabilising effect in terms of corporate tax revenues in future in the sense that it would result in an increase in revenues and reduce the risk of capital or corporate flight because if the minimum rate is applied by the OECD, it is applicable across the board?  Has the council considered that?  Is it involved in that process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.324" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019120400002#P00100"><p>Again, IFAC has not assessed Pillar 2 of the OECD's process.  On the minimum effective tax, one of the key issues is not so much the rate but how it is to be applied.  If it is a global minimum, the impact on Ireland might be modest enough because, if companies are below the global minimum, the top-up would be paid to their countries of residence where their headquarters are based.  If, however, the minimum effective tax was applied as a country by country minimum - which seems unlikely at present as the trend seems towards a global minimum effective tax - that would have a modest enough effect on Ireland and would also be likely to have a modest enough effect on the companies.  Considering the larger companies that publish their accounts, they are not reporting or generating effective tax rates in single digits.  They might not be much above 20% or close to that rate, but most companies have effective tax rates above what would be considered the low levels of single digits.  The impact of the minimum tax rate on Ireland, if it is applied on a global basis, could be relatively modest.</p> <p>  Could it stabilise our revenue source?  As we said earlier, the biggest driver of the volatility in corporate tax revenues is corporate profitability and having a minimum rate does not really impact on that.  If the profits change, the amount of tax to be collected will be paid.  There have been issues with the global tax system, but there is probably more likely to be agreement on Pillar 1 and the move to having more tax allocated to the market countries.  In the case of digital companies, there probably is a legitimate and strong argument to be made that more of their profits are generated by the customers in the markets rather than by the developers and software engineers.  The impact of the minimum effective tax rate, depending on whether it is agreed, probably will not offer that stabilising force that it might be suggested it could.  </p></speech>

Household debt, as has been said, has come down significantly.  It was some &euro;200 billion in 2008 and it is about &euro;135 billion now.  It has been remarkable that the Irish economy has performed so strongly with such high levels of debt repayment.  It is something that shows up in our improved current account position.  Households are now spending less than they are earning, in aggregate terms, and are reducing that debt by about &euro;5 billion a year.  That money is going into the banking system and it is not coming back out.  That is a withdrawal from the Irish economy and, even with that money going to repay debt, the performance of the economy has been very strong.</p> <p>  Returning to the points we made in response to Deputy Cowen, we do not see the same level of risks in the broader economy, including the private sector, as we can now see for 2006 and 2007.  This is all viewed in retrospect and it is easy to look back now and see where the problems were.  Looking at similar metrics, however, we do not see problems to the same extent.  It is possible, looking at the private sector, that it is potentially an upside risk for the economy that this deleveraging and repayment of debt will stop.  We are talking about mortgages taken out in 2003, 2004 and 2005, some 14 to 16 years ago.  Significant inroads have been made in those mortgages and if that debt repayment stops that money will then become available to be spent in the economy.  With an economy at 4.8% unemployment, do we have the capacity to absorb that additional spending?  There is, then, a potential upside risk to the forecast, but we do take the broader economy and the private sector into account when we are looking at things.  Going back, again, to what we said to Deputy Cowen, we see the key risks in the public finances.  The public sector has not reduced its debt.  It is still close to &euro;200 billion and is potentially becoming reliant on corporation tax because it is running close to a balanced position, even with this surge in revenues.  It is correct to highlight the private sector, but there have been significant improvements in that area.  </p></speech>

I refer to the situation where month by month, in the first four to six months of the year, that Department gets direct extra Supplementary Estimates because of winter crises.  There is also special supplementary funding on occasions such as when the national children's hospital goes wrong.  At the end of the year, notwithstanding all the major injections of cash, the Minister is then able to get another &euro;338 million in an extraordinary Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  I understand that Mr. Coffey is constrained from commenting, but it is unbelievable that a Department can practise gaming the whole process we are overseeing.  That all then goes into the base and Departments such as Education and Skills, significant for the country and its attractiveness, are losing out heavily because of that gaming.  That is because they are not inclined to game the system or because they do not have the knowledge of how to game the system.  I am not sure how that happens, but it means that our budgetary process is subject to significant subversion.  By the way, I would be the first to be concerned if a hospital, another health facility or particular categories of patients were suffering dreadfully.  If we stand back, however, and look at this situation from an overall management context, it is appalling what has been able to go on.  I am not aware of any other democratic country where it would be possible to game the system in the way it is being done. </p> <p>  We also have this perpetual whipping up of crises.  Many of the staff seem to be extremely demotivated because all they read every day about the area in which they work hard is that it has these extraordinary figures.  Has IFAC had a conversation concerning how this might be possible?  I would like to help the Department of Health, but two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il everybody got the Supplementary Estimates for this year.  Some &euro;338 million went to the Department of Health.  It is almost like a drug problem - mainline and more is given.  It defies reason.  Mr. Coffey is an economist and I am just an accountant, but I find this situation extraordinary regarding any kind of commentary on the Government.  </p></speech>

We have highlighted those in several reports.  Yesterday's Exchequer returns highlighted some of the problems we see with the figures for the Department of Health.  For the first 11 months of the year, the spending of the Department of Health is below profile.  We are into early December, and in the Exchequer cash-based figures there is no indication of a problem.  The Department has been below its allocated amount every month for 11 months so far this year.  As Deputy Burton has rightly pointed out, however, a Supplementary Estimate has been flagged of more than &euro;330 million.  There is clearly an issue somewhere.</p> <p>  We are not sure of the reason for this, but it is something that we flagged in this report.  It would be worth looking at the analysis we have done of the monthly profiles, and the fact that even if the profiles seem to be on target significant Supplementary Estimates still seem to be required.  Changes do seem to be needed in how the budget is set, assessed and profiled.  We hope this situation will lead to increased budgetary management.  I state that because, as the Deputy said, one area seems to be getting additional resources in this unassessed and unplanned fashion, when those resources could be having an impact on other areas.  That could be on the public finances, which is where our concern lies, or on other areas of spending.  I think Deputy Burton is right to highlight this issue.  We feel it is a problem and we have done further analysis in this report that is worth looking at.  </p></speech>

I refer to the monitoring group.  That information is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, so those meetings might as well be public.  I agree with Deputy Burton.</p></speech>

It begs some of the questions raised.  I am conscious that we are bang on coming up to 4.30 p.m.  I thank all of the members of the committee involved in the questioning.  I also thank the members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for coming in to us for this third and sustained engagement.</p><p>We appreciate the work Mr. Coffey and his colleagues do and we appreciate their engagement with the committee.  It is a critical part of the committee's role.  We thank Mr. Coffey in whatever guise and whatever way.  Hopefully there will be a Committee on Budgetary Oversight to engagement with him and his colleagues next year but I have no predictions as to what it will be or who will be involved.</p></speech>

Petition 00047/19 seeks to triple the number of Irish resident election observers placed on foreign election observation missions in the next 12 months.  The petition states that Ireland is lagging behind in sending Irish observers abroad.  Do any members wish to contribute?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2019120400002#B00300"><p>I support the overall thrust of the petition in the context of increasing the number of qualified election observation postings.  As somebody engaged in election observation, I can say this is an important element of the work that the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly does but, equally, we have a role through the EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR in terms of how we can enhance the electoral democratic process in many countries.  Election observation is a very important and critical part of that.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - I think it was in 2018 - did close the applications for election observation, but it is important that the range of observation positions is increased.  The petitioner in his reasons for his recommendations makes a good point that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated no recommendations have been made by D&oacute;chas or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is important to recognise that we do and can have a role to play as Members of the Oireachtas but also to assist in the enhancement of election observation.  The point that has been made by the petitioner around us lagging behind is an interesting one.  I am not sure that is actually the case, but he does provide us with a reference graph.  It is important that we have a discussion on the matter and that we do seek to bring about an increased number of election observation positions.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

Agreed.  </p> <p>  On Petition 00048/19, it is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner with a copy of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, advising the petitioner that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has held hearings and is currently preparing a report on online harassment and harmful communications and close the petition.

It is just on the recommendation that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Education and Skills to the petitioner and close the petition.  The summary of what the petitioner is actually looking for references reforms in the primary school structure, which is very positive.  Society is changing in terms of issues such as mental health and obesity, pressures with social media and so on, and the conclusion of this petition tells us a draft curriculum framework was due to be published in December this year.  It would probably benefit us, but it would certainly benefit the petitioner and hopefully the primary schools in the future, to not only forward a copy of the response from the Department of Education and Skills but keep the petition open so that at least the petitioner will have an opportunity to read that report, and if anything comes back, it will be a fair process.</p></speech>

On what the petitioner is seeking in terms of the school curriculum at primary level and wanting to respond to the needs of children in society, from mental health issues to obesity, social media and so forth, I want to recognise what is already being done in schools.  I have attended meetings in the past couple of weeks with the HSE on the healthy eating programme.  I know from my own three children who are all in primary school that this programme which is in operation bans, certainly in the school that my children are in, snacks other than healthy eating snacks.  In terms of going from the academic, desk-based approach to the more outdoor-centred approach, and the response from the Department referencing Aistear, I want to recognise as well the work that Aistear is doing because I have seen its implementation and it is a very good programme.</p> <p>  The evolution of the curriculum over the last decade has been substantial and has been significant in terms of producing a broader and more holistic educational experience for children.  Certainly, I see that at first hand simply because I have three young children in primary school.  In respect of the broader debate on the curriculum, I welcome that this report will published this month, so I support Deputy Buckley in saying we should wait until we examine that further.  We have had the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in here before for extensive debate in respect of something similar in terms of the requirement and necessity for homework at primary school level; that was a hugely interesting debate about the rationale the Department set down for children having written studies after school and so forth.  There is a broader piece of work here, and I think we are right maybe to keep this open and have a further examination of it.  I want to acknowledge that a huge amount of work has been done on issues like obesity through the Department and the HSE on the healthy eating programme, the change from desktop to more outdoor through the work of the Aistear programme in which my own wife is involved.  Young teachers are hugely cognisant of the feelings and emotions and well-being of young children in schools, and it is only right and proper that that be acknowledged.</p></speech>

I would hold the view that there is a reasonable amount of time that one would give to allow people to respond, but one's patience wears thin as well if one perceives that the process here is being delayed in any way.  That petition very much remains open.</p></speech>

I am the chairperson of the board of directors of Scouting Ireland.  With me today are Dr. John Lawlor and Mr Gear&oacute;id Begley. <br/><br/>I reaffirm that Scouting Ireland is as safe an organisation as it can be.  Even in the period since our last meeting, improvements have been made to our already good safeguarding procedures and practices, not least of which was the recruitment of a professional safeguarding manager last April and an expansion in the professional safeguarding team.  Safeguarding our young people and adult volunteers is not a static environment, however.  Scouting Ireland has not rested on its laurels in that regard but instead is continuously reviewing practices and systems to ensure we remain best in class<b></b>at all times, as all youth organisations should.  Scouting Ireland has gone through a major governance transformation since our previous meeting.  The board of Scouting Ireland is now fully a board of oversight.  We will move to full compliance with the community and voluntary governance code by the end of January 2020, with full compliance with the charities regulatory code by year end in time for the mandatory application of the code.<br/><br/>The committee will be aware that we have recruited a new CEO to take office in the new year.  We have also just completed an exercise to co-opt outside directors to the board, enhancing our skill set.  Two new directors have been co-opted to the board, namely, Mr. Donal Lawlor, a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland and former managing director of a multinational company in Ireland, and Ms Lorraine Lally, a barrister and qualified mediator.  We have a positive working relationship with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and her Department for their ongoing support and guidance over the past year.  Similarly, our working relationship with all of the State agencies continues to be positive, including the relationships with Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and the gateway teams in Northern Ireland, the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland, CCNI, and the Charities Regulator in the Republic.<br/><br/>The board of Scouting Ireland has entered into an independently managed evaluation process to ensure proper performance management of the board as a team.  Directors and trustees have completed training to support them in their roles and we are due our first election cycle at our April annual general meeting.</p><p>A full review of all risk in Scouting Ireland has been completed and a workforce plan has been delivered with required resources identified.  New departmental core teams and department managers have been appointed and are operating.  All new positions are implemented via open and rigorous recruitment processes, whether that is at board, sub-committee, core team or CEO level.  We are currently formulating our new strategic plan which will be completed by the end of January 2020.</p><p> A phenomenon which has emerged is the influx of external individuals with no previous connection to Scouting Ireland with the skills and experience to fill competency gaps across our organisation.  We have defined new organisational structures with clear lines of accountability and reporting.  All of this has been facilitated by a dedicated transition sub-committee, along with the assistance and expertise of an external governance expert.  This is a period of significant change for our membership and we recognise the fast pace of the changes.  However, the majority of our membership see the need for such governance changes and have supported the board in its important work in this regard.</p><p> Moving to historical matters, the recent &ldquo;RT&Eacute; Investigates&rdquo; programme again shone a searing light on the hurt done to young people in the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland, CBSI, and the Scout Association of Ireland, SAI.  We recognise the courage and bravery of all survivors who have told their stories directly to us and who featured on the programme.  It is an example of leadership to all and it is humbling.  We again apologise unreservedly to those who were hurt by the actions of adult volunteers in these legacy organisations.</p><p> The picture which emerged of these organisations over the past 18 months is grim and shocking.  Although Scouting Ireland inherited this situation from the CBSI and the SAI, we have not shirked our responsibilities in looking after our survivors, inviting them to contact us directly, which the majority did, and offering support where we can.  We are continuing to deal with the consequences of the betrayal that some adults in the past visited upon our most vulnerable members.  It should be recognised that once Scouting Ireland understood the extent of the problem in the legacy organisations following Mr. Ian Elliott&rsquo;s work, not only did we acknowledge it but it was we who brought it into the public domain.  We have apologised to all individuals who contacted us.  We also maintained the helpline to allow more survivors to share their stories.  Our focus has been to support people coming forward to us with allegations of sexual abuse, as well as to report any reportable offences brought to the attention of our safeguarding team to the statutory authorities, namely, Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Republic of Ireland, and the PSNI and Gateway in Northern Ireland.  Our helpline, 1-800-221199, remains open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for those wishing to report new information to the safeguarding team.  We want to assure survivors that they will be listened to, they will be treated compassionately and every new piece of information provided to us will be followed up.</p><p> The RT&Eacute; programme made several allegations relating to individuals in senior positions in these organisations and their failure to act on information relating to sexual abuse in scout groups across Ireland.  Whereas we cannot comment on individual cases, we can assure the committee, parents, guardians, and our volunteers and staff that Scouting Ireland is a very different organisation from these legacy organisations in which so many were let down and badly treated.  Scouting Ireland has always reported any reportable offences brought to the attention of our safeguarding team to the appropriate authorities.  We adopted mandatory reporting in 2003, 12 years before Children First legislation was enacted in 2015 and 14 years before it became law in 2017.  Our adult volunteers must be Garda vetted and undertake mandatory safeguarding training every three years.  The continual improvement of safeguarding in Scouting Ireland is a priority for the board and the executive.  We have put in place strong governance and safeguarding measures within our organisation to help ensure scouting is a safe place for our members, volunteers and employees.</p><p> In the past 18 months, we have introduced new governance structures within Scouting Ireland that provide greater accountability, transparency and openness in our organisation, implemented the agreed Scouting Ireland-Tusla action plan and fully completed the findings of the Jillian van Turnhout governance review.  As previously stated, we appointed a full-time safeguarding manager and expanded the professional safeguarding team.  Child safeguarding policies and procedures have been independently reviewed by Mr. Ian Elliott and further developed by our safeguarding manager and team.  We developed new procedures for the assessment and handling of child protection disclosures.  We introduced a new disciplinary code and appointed a disciplinary panel of three members, one of whom is external to Scouting Ireland.  We continue to liaise with all relevant authorities, including Tusla, Gateway, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Charities Regulator and the Charities Commission of Northern Ireland.</p><p> This is not to say that we are standing still.  As already stated, we continue to make improvements to our safeguarding structures and look to implement best practices.  Mr. Ian Elliott is conducting a learning review which will appraise the history of abuse in the CBSI and the SAI, how allegations were handled by these organisations and the learnings for Scouting Ireland for the future.  Mr. Elliott's work has been a driver for substantial change in Scouting Ireland to date.  It goes without saying that he is absolutely independent in his recommendations to us and in his judgment concerning safeguarding matters.  Regrettably, for personal reasons, he cannot be here today.</p><p> We strongly assure the committee, our members and employees, parents and the general public that we are acting with urgency and will act immediately when a safeguarding issue is brought to our attention.  We cannot allow the past to define our present or future.  The key credential we present for that different future is the manner in which we are facing up to that past, in those historical scouting organisations.  Scouting Ireland is different.  Scouting Ireland will continue to prioritise safeguarding in order that thousands of children can benefit from scouting in a safe environment.  I remind the committee of the dedication of our youth members, their parents, our adult volunteers and our professional staff team.</p><p> Our unsung heroes are the 14,000 adult volunteers and small but highly dedicated staff who have kept scouting going in their communities across the island through challenging times.  As we advance to a better, safer and engaging future for our young people, Scouting Ireland will retain its standing in our communities and country, continue its important work in developing the citizens of today and tomorrow, always with the young person to the fore.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.</p> <p>  In his conclusion, Mr. Tennant stated Scouting Ireland is different.  He referred to issues raised in the RT&Eacute; programme on historical child abuse matters in scouting.  How is this the case when one of those accused who was referred to in the RT&Eacute; programme was a volunteer in the organisation up until 2018?  That is not historical.  I would like to know Mr. Tennant's definition of &ldquo;historical&rdquo;.</p></speech>

It is probably one of the biggest questions that jumped out from the television programme in question.  While we cannot discuss individual cases, I can assure the committee, as well as the general public listening, that everything that has been reported to Scouting Ireland since 2003 has been and continues to be reported to the statutory authorities.  We continue to take advice and guidance from the statutory authorities on each and every case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019120400002#D00600"><p>This time last year when Mr. Tennant sat in front of the committee, I asked a clear question as to whether there were any members in Scouting Ireland at that moment who were involved in any historical cases.  The answer I got that day was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Why am I to believe Mr. Tennant today?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adrian Tennant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019120400002#D00700"><p>All the information we receive comes in at a different point in time.  In the November meeting to which the Deputy referred, we had our helpline, which has been successful, set up in the interim.  Much new information came to us at that time.  At the time we spoke to the Deputy and made that statement, we only know what we can know.  At that time, we were not aware of any people who were involved in historical cases who were current members of Scouting Ireland.  I will pass the Deputy's question to Scouting Ireland's CEO.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Lawlor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019120400002#E00100"><p>I echo the caution provided by the Chair to the committee at the beginning of the meeting.  Scouting Ireland cannot discuss individual cases.  It is not appropriate to do so.  We are extremely conscious of the confidentiality of those involved.  Where disclosure has been made to Scouting Ireland, the individual making such a disclosure has done so on the understanding that the information they provided will be treated confidentially.  It is essential that that trust is not breached.  Additionally, the discussion of an individual case in a public forum has the potential unintentionally to identify an individual who has made a disclosure that could result in further trauma for the person.  Scouting Ireland is also conscious that to discuss individual cases in a public forum has the potential to jeopardise inquiries being made by State agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p> <p>  Scouting Ireland is aware that individuals have been named in the media.  What can be said in respect of that is that all disclosures made to the child protection and safeguarding personnel in Scouting Ireland have been, and were, reported to State agencies.  In all cases where it was appropriate or recommended that a person would be removed, that was actioned.  I hope that answers Deputy Rabbitte's question.</p></speech>

Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the former special rapporteur on child protection, has said any review must be independent, prompt, effective and transparent.  Ian Elliott is currently working on his report into the historic abuse in the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland, CBSI, and the Scout Association of Ireland, SAI.  How independent can his review be, as someone who was formerly employed as Scouting Ireland's acting safeguarding manager?  Is it not essentially Scouting Ireland investigating itself?  It was said that Ian Elliott is conducting a learning review, which indicates that this report is more for Scouting Ireland as opposed to those affected by any harm done.  Will the witnesses expand on that please?</p></speech>

First, on the independence of Mr. Ian Elliott, he is not here today for personal reasons, but anyone who knows him or his previous work will say that if one wants somebody to look at files or to carry out a review of an organisation and leave no stone unturned, Mr. Elliott is the man to choose.  As I said in my opening statement, he always operates independently.  He has access to all our files and information systems.  He is independent in that regard and in regard to the learning review he is currently undertaking.</p></speech>

Such a review as Mr. Elliott is carrying out has to be something that is open and transparent.  We will share it with the Minister, and if it is the wish of the Chair of this committee, we will also share it with the committee.</p></speech>

As we well know, all matters sent to the Minister are subject to freedom of information requests but the report is not in the public domain and it has not been provided.

We all know the history we have in this country of child sexual abuse and it just seems that this is another organisation with another story and cover-ups.  That is what it feels like to the general public, whether Scouting Ireland agrees or disagrees with the statement.</p> <p>  There are a number of elements involved.  There is the present day and how Scouting Ireland will give people confidence going forward.  As a parent of two, I recently decided not to allow my child to join the scouts.  Some might say that is due to total paranoia on my part, but I honestly did not feel in any way confident in the organisation after everything that came out.  I am generally a fairly reasonable and open-minded person but I still do not feel confidence in the organisation.  One way Scouting Ireland could restore confidence is by dealing adequately with the historic cases and by being open to a genuine, independent public inquiry.  That will not take away anything that happened to those people at all, which was horrific, and here we are again talking about horrific cases, but it would give people confidence and it would also give people the justice they deserve.</p></speech>

That is quite correct and we have owned that since we became aware of it last year.  We broke that story ourselves.  It was horrific and depraved.  While we have inherited strong traditions and other good things from our former organisations, equally we must also own this.  We take the good with the bad.  It is absolutely horrific.  We were as upset as anybody else when watching those television programmes.  I again acknowledge the bravery of those who spoke out and those who have come forward and spoke to us and to other statutory agencies.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about current confidence in the organisation.  As I said in my opening statement, we are in the middle of developing a new strategic plan for Scouting Ireland.  As part of this, we carried out a survey of people involved with Scouting Ireland, including youth members, adult members, parents and some outside stakeholders.  We expected 300 to 400 responses, which would give us a good data set on which to formulate our new strategic plan.  We actually got 1,306 responses.  To help in answering Deputy Funchion's question, 695 of those responses came from parents.  We asked specific questions of those who identified themselves as parents.  We asked them how strongly they agreed with certain statements on a scale of one to ten.  These statements included "My child is safe when attending Scouts", "I am aware of Scouting Ireland's Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy" and "I feel there is good supervision for children at Scouts".  This is very recent information so I am quite happy to share it today.  The average score for each of these statements was 9.1, 9.4 and 9.1 respectively.  The parents who are with us at the moment and to whom we owe a great deal for retaining that trust and faith in us continue to have great confidence in Scouting Ireland because they know the changes we have made in respect of safeguarding over recent years.  It is our job, as the board of directors, to protect that trust and to continue implementing best practice in this area.  On the issue of best practice, I will pass over to Mr. Begley who will speak about what happens now.</p></speech>

That is the challenge for the organisation.  We recognise that.  Public confidence and parents' confidence and trust in Scouting Ireland is very important.  The task facing Scouting Ireland, which my team and I have undertaken, is to put processes in place to make sure that, where a disclosure is made, it is properly recorded, that the decision-making process in respect of the disclosure is also recorded, and that if the disclosure meets the threshold of harm set out by Tusla, a report is made as mandated and all information is provided to the statutory agency.</p> <p>  If the disclosure does not meet the threshold of harm for a mandated report, we ask whether it is still a cause for concern.  Consideration is given to making a report on that basis.  If a disclosure does not meet either standard, we ask whether action needs to be taken.  We then go back to the person who made the disclosure and tell him or her that, after consideration, we have decided that it either came under one of those two categories or that we do not believe it meets the thresholds.  We may have a suggestion as to what action should be taken within the organisation but we tell the person who made the disclosure that, if he or she is not happy with our suggestion, he or she is at liberty to make a report to the relevant State agency, which may be An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla, the PSNI, or Gateway.  If we do make a report, we liaise with the State agency involved.  If it needs any information from our records, we make it available.  On occasion a member of Scouting Ireland may have to make a witness statement that could become part of a criminal prosecution.  That is part of the process.</p> <p>  I could talk about it at more length but it is part of ensuring that systems are in place to record disclosures, the decisions made on such disclosures, the feedback given to those who make disclosures, and the information provided to State agencies in that regard.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  We built on what Mr. Ian Elliott had done.  We are developing it further.  We are always conscious that this is a movable feast.  Things change and we have constantly to review and improve what we are doing.  It will never reach an endgame.  We will always have to move forward to mitigate risk and improve what we are doing.</p></speech>

If a parent contacts Scouting Ireland and says that he or she is concerned about a given volunteer, will that volunteer be suspended from that role pending an investigation?  As Mr. Tennant will know from a previous life, that happens all the time.  It is not necessarily a matter of saying that someone is guilty.  He or she is just suspended without prejudice until an investigation is carried out.  Does that happen?  If so, how quickly does it happen?  Is that one of the things that have been changed?</p></speech>

When an allegation or disclosure is made against somebody, we have to consider the circumstances of that particular case.  A person may be suspended without prejudice if that is the appropriate reaction.  That process would take place quickly because, if there is a risk to a child, it needs to be reacted to promptly.  We have reviewed the process as to how this is done internally, but it still takes place.  The important thing is that the safety of the children is always paramount.  We all understand that an allegation can be made against an adult that may not be substantiated when the process is followed through.  The volunteers have rights as well, and we must be conscious of that in the process.</p></speech>

That is the aim of what we do and that is the process we have in place.  We have looked at how those processes are carried out and we ensure that each case is treated individually, that the facts of each case are carefully considered, and that appropriate steps are taken that may comprise reporting to State agencies or suspending a person without prejudice.  In some circumstances, neither of these actions may be taken.  Recording the rationale for not taking action can be just as important as recording the rationale for taking action.</p></speech>

In fact, Scouting Ireland has been open to co-operating with statutory agencies in both jurisdictions, North and South, since its foundation.  To refer to this jurisdiction, both Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have powers of investigation.  It is the responsibility of Scouting Ireland to report, and we do that.  Both agencies in this jurisdiction, to stick to the Republic of Ireland, have had access to our files since the inception of Scouting Ireland.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has utilised these files in the context of investigations since the beginning of Scouting Ireland.  It is not the case that Scouting Ireland is opposed to a public inquiry.  That is a matter for Government.  We have worked very hard to secure the confidence of the statutory agencies, the Department and the Minister.  The Deputy will know from the previous time we were before the committee, in March, that Tusla said that no organisation had been subject to the same level of scrutiny as Scouting Ireland.  That is true and we welcome it.  We are open to scrutiny.  We have no issue with it.  We have made our files available and made them accessible to statutory agencies.  That has been the history of the organisation since its foundation and that co-operation will continue.</p></speech>

When Tulsa was before the committee some weeks ago, I asked it the same thing around independent reviews, appeals or inquiries generally.  What is Scouting Ireland's view on that?  Any organisation that deals with children and that is getting public money should be open to that.  It shows it has nothing to hide.  I ask it not only of Scouting Ireland but also Tusla why it would not be open to that.  That is why I asked about the public inquiry too.</p></speech>

That is why in the summer of 2017 we commissioned Ian Elliott.  In reviewing our safeguarding policies and procedures and looking at historic cases, we determined that it was important that it be done by someone who was independent, expert and external.  That is why we sourced Ian Elliott and it was on that basis that we gave him his terms of reference.  I understand the suggestion that because he was employed by Scouting Ireland, it compromised him.  I believe his own standing is above that and demonstrates our openness to external examination.  We have no issue with external examination.  It is not the case that Scouting Ireland is opposed to it.  It is a matter for Government how it happens.  We have been open to examination by Tusla and by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Ian Elliott has done a fine job of maintaining his independence in respect of the legacy issues we have had and his commentary on how we should improve what we do in the modern era.</p></speech>

He has access to all the past case files, he is reviewing all of them to learn how cases were managed in the past and how reports were received, and I am sure that he will leave no stone unturned.  We will gain that learning from then.  I do not want to pre-empt anything that will be in the report.  It will be published in February, which is not too far from now.

We all understand that there is Scouting Ireland now.  We all accept that and have given goodwill to the new procedures and protocols that have been put in place relating to governance.  However, Mr. Tennant is here as head of Scouting Ireland.  I argue that he must also answer for what happened in the CBSI and the SAI.  Our job here is to interrogate the dynamic that led to allegations against persons not being dealt with by the organisation.  I am still unclear in my mind as to why, if the Children First guidelines were adopted in 2012, it took a full five years before Scouting Ireland brought in Ian Elliott.  During that time, and arguably now, there were persons in the organisation, and I do not know if they are still in the organisation, who took receipt of information from people who were traumatised and those case files were put into a filing cabinet.  A review was to have taken place in 2012 but we remain blind about where that review went, how those cases were managed and whether there are people who are part of the 2017 to 2019 review who are taking receipt of the information who are still part of the staff.  We want to understand the culture that existed within the organisation.  If, as Mr. Tennant suggests, the new broom is sweeping clean, are there people who were in receipt of information in 1987 and 1996, the years which were subject of the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme, who are still on the staff and are part of the old culture who continue to be employed?  That is the kernel of the matter.  Mr. Tennant speaks of Scouting Ireland opening up its processes and creating helplines, but I find it hard to understand how anybody who was dealt with by personnel in 1987 or 1996 might find themselves being dealt with by the same personnel in 2017, 2018 or 2019.  Does Mr. Tennant understand how that might look extremely bad for an organisation such as Scouting Ireland?</p> <p>  Mr. Tennant is putting a lot of store in the Ian Elliott process.  Everyone here accepts Ian Elliott's bona fides, but what they do not buy is that regardless of whether he is a consultant, he is paid by Scouting Ireland to conduct a review and therefore he is an employee of Scouting Ireland.  We are questioning the independence of the process.  What we are trying to get at is what will arise from the Elliott process when he reports.  Regardless of whether he likes it, Mr. Tennant has an idea of how this will play out because he strikes me as someone who has gamed this, which I do not mean in a pejorative sense.  He knows how the process is going; we do not.  I do not know the contents of Ian Elliott's report.  I am very concerned that it will go into the public domain and the people who made complaints in 1987 and 1996 and the people who were the subject of the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme will have no justice, recourse or right of reply.  Does Mr. Tennant see my point?</p></speech>

We have told this committee previously and told the Minister, including in our report, that Mr. Elliott told us he was uncovering situations where it looked as though cases were mismanaged, there were cover-ups and things like that.  That is in the public domain.  Mr. Elliott's job now is to figure out how that happened and what systems were in place.</p> <p>  There is a lot in what Deputy Sherlock said and I want to ensure that we answer all of it, particularly on the 2012 review, on which I will pass him over to the CEO.  I will bring in the current safeguarding manager to speak specifically on who now receives those calls and the current safeguarding team.  I do not want to move off this without answering each of those questions, so I will pass over to the CEO first part.</p></speech>

There is no record to that at all.  Professional staff were involved in safeguarding in the legacy organisations from the late 1990s and consistently through the history of Scouting Ireland from its foundation in 2003.</p><p>I will leave Mr. Elliott to comment on how these complaints were processed internally in his time and I am confident he will address that in his report.</p></speech>

It is my belief as CEO that our staff have behaved in an exemplary fashion in carrying out their duties.  I am confident the record will show that.  The responsibility of Scouting Ireland as an organisation was to report these matters to statutory agencies and it did so.  It is not the case that disclosures were taken and placed in a filing cabinet and that nothing was done.  That is simply not the truth.  The truth is that when a disclosure was made it was reported to statutory agencies.  The record is clear and consistent through the whole history of Scouting Ireland.  Children First was mentioned and 14 years before mandatory reporting was introduced in 2017, Scouting Ireland was reporting to statutory agencies on a regular basis.  Those files from 2003 and from before the review the Deputy referenced in 2012 were made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and were utilised by it in the context of its investigations of criminal cases.  These are the facts.  It is important to note that before the late 1990s, these matters were strictly handled by volunteers in the legacy organisations.  That is what happened and that is the truth.  That was not a satisfactory situation but I should leave it to the work of Mr. Elliott to help us understand that.  He is open to bringing those matters to this committee when he concludes his work.</p> <p>  On the staff, it is important to say they have behaved in an exemplary fashion.  I will ask Mr. Begley to comment on this but they behaved heroically last year in their work on the helpline in how they empathetically dealt with victims who came on board.  The numbers say so and the data say so.  As I said here in March, the truth was evidenced by that work.  It was an uncomfortable truth for Scouting Ireland.  For those of us who love Scouting Ireland and have loved Scouting Ireland since the time we were children, we have to live with that truth but it is correct we brought that to the fore.  This was brought to the fore by Scouting Ireland, by our staff and by my staff heroically spending hours on helplines under the direction of Mr. Elliott, taking the stories from survivors, dealing with them empathetically, offering them counselling and making sure what they said was recorded properly and was reported to statutory agencies.  That is what happened.  Mr. Begley might be able to assist us in telling us how exactly the helpline worked because he has done some work on this.</p></speech>

Correct me if I am wrong but my interpretation of that was Scouting Ireland failed to carry out a scoping exercise to see if further work was required on the files of complaint.  My understanding is that was never done, that an undertaking was given to carry out such work and that there are minutes to that effect.  What was pertinent there was that Scouting Ireland would carry out the scoping exercise, it would have a statistical analysis for all child protection cases, especially for the files in Mount Melleray.  We are being told it is ongoing process and I am confused why that is so because we are now in 2019.</p></speech>

On the 2012 review, there were two key points of focus.  First, due to an incident that happened a year before it was identified that somebody who had been removed from one of the legacy organisations who had been mentioned in one of the files had found their way back into the organisation and that was dealt with straight away.  Second, a review was carried out on 332 files, none of which was in Mount Melleray.  I do not know where the reference to Mount Melleray comes from but none of these files was ever there, they were always in Larch Hill.  Those files were examined to see if anybody else was a member of the organisation that was named in those files and to see that if there had been a reportable offence, that it had been reported to the statutory authorities.  That review mentioned the traffic light system.  The majority of the files were deemed to be green and so they were fine.  They were up-to-date, reporting had been done and the people concerned were not involved in Scouting Ireland.  There were five files where it could not be determined whether people had been reported by that date to the statutory authorities.  Those cases were reported immediately.  That was the purpose of the review.  From that date in 2012, all the files that were there at that point in time had been cleared to ensure that none of those people was a member of Scouting Ireland and that all those cases had been reported to statutory agencies.  That was a watershed moment in 2012.  I will pass the second part of the question onto the CEO, Dr. Lawlor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Lawlor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019120400002#H01100"><p>I took office in March 2012 and I actioned the 2012 review in July 2012.  I did so because I was deeply concerned at the emergence of a situation where somebody who had been removed from a legacy organisation in 1972 had gained access to Scouting Ireland.  That happened as a result of the change from a paper-based system to databases.  Once we had that information the person was immediately removed but I had a concern there may be other such situations.  It was prudent and correct to investigate that and so it was not just a scoping exercise.  As Mr. Tennant said, the primary consideration was to find out if we had anybody in this organisation who should not have been there.  Deputy Funchion rightly pointed to that concern.  We had to convince ourselves there was nobody in the organisation who should not have been there.  We also wanted to make sure we were up to date with reporting on these issues.  I know Deputy Sherlock has referenced minutes and I do not know what fragment of correspondence he has but there is extensive correspondence between the safeguarding team of the time and the statutory agencies about the work that was done and about what needed to be done.  The follow-on work was done, the reporting was done and subsequent to 2012, the files were made available to and accessed again by both agencies, particularly An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in relation to criminal prosecutions.  The cataloguing that was done was important because it made it easier for those agencies to access the information.  What might have caused the confusion with the reference to Mount Melleray is that the only files we had there were census records so where we had a question on whether an individual was in the scouts in 1972, for example, we would have to go and check the old census records.  However, as Mr. Tennant said, the safeguarding files were always maintained in Larch Hill and from the inception of Scouting Ireland they were always made available to the statutory agencies for their investigations.</p></speech>

There is a Schedule to that Act which says if a disclosure on those particular offences is received, there is an obligation to report it to the State agency, namely An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this jurisdiction.  There are offences that lie outside the Act and there are occasions when we get a disclosure which amounts to a criminal offence and which we report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that is not under the Schedule to the Act because we think it is appropriate to do so.  Our function in Scouting Ireland is not to investigate and make decisions on such matters.  There could be a situation where there is a disclosure about a child.</p></speech>

I was one of those people.  All of the people manning the helpline have been trained as dedicated liaison persons.  When the helpline was commenced in November 2018, they were given a briefing by Mr. Elliot as to how they should take the calls.  The briefing is outlined in some detail in the report on the helpline.  Deputy Mitchell asked whether telephone calls were recorded.  I presume she means electronically recorded.</p></speech>

There is a facility whereby if somebody calls outside office hours he or she can leave a voicemail with contact details to request that we make contact.  There are calls where a person discloses information, seeks advice or asks what happens if he or she makes a disclosure, and the process is explained.  That is not recorded electronically.  A written contemporaneous note is made by the person receiving the call.  The caller is thanked for making the call and it is acknowledged that making such a call can be a very difficult thing to do.</p> <p>  On some occasions we get calls which are silent because the person does not feel able to speak.  We have had people call two or three times.  They may not have spoken on the first occasion, but will speak on the second occasion without giving details and we would encourage them to return by saying if they call again they can give us any name so we know they have called before.  When we get to a point where people are happy to discuss or disclose some information we will take a written note of that and give a heartfelt apology on behalf of the organisation because people who were abused in scouting when they were children were the victims of a major betrayal of trust.  We offer them the choice to avail of a free and confidential counselling service if they wish.  Some people want to take the information or say they are already in counselling and others say they do not want the information and it is not for them.  It is their choice.  They give us as much information as they want to give us.  </p> <p>  Some people have come to terms with what has happened to them and are quite comfortable discussing what can be quite graphic details.  They are not easy calls to take and are as emotionally draining for the person taking them as for the person making them.  We would record whatever information people give us.  Sometimes it can be quite a lot of information, on other occasions it can be a person simply saying, "I was abused".  The only clarification we try to get from people is whether they were sexually abused because then it  immediately reaches a threshold of harm in terms of reporting to Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p> <p>  We listen more than we ask questions.  The person on the line may or may not wish to give contact details.  If we are to provide people with details about counselling, we need some sort of contact information.  The committee has to appreciate that sometimes the people calling us do not want to give their home addresses, their families may not be aware of the abuse and they may not have discussed it with anybody else.  It is unusual to get a call where a person has not discussed the abuse, but on occasion we are the first person to be told that abuse took place.  Those us who take those calls are very conscious of how difficult and traumatic it is for the people making the calls.  </p> <p>  We will examine our documents to determine whether what happened meets the threshold, as I explained earlier.  If it does, and once it is sexual abuse, it is over the threshold and will be reported to State agencies.  We provide State agencies with as much information as we have been given and explain the process to the caller.  We advise callers that what they have told us is confidential but if they tell us something that we have a legal obligation to report then we have to do that.  We qualify that and make it clear that the decision on whether to make a criminal complaint lies with the person.  If a person tells us he or she does not want to talk to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or Tusla, we tell him or her that is fine.  However, we have a legal obligation to report information on abuse and we do so.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

It is set up in such a way that we provide the information to the person who makes the call.  We give the person the contact details and he or she gets a PIN which identifies to the service provider that the person has been referred by Scouting Ireland.  He or she may avail of counselling.  We do not know who avails of it as the bill is paid <i>en bloc</i>to the service provider.  We do not know whether a person attended once or 20 times.

The cost is substantial.  Many thousands of euro a year are spent on counselling.  In general, our approach to counselling has been that whoever contacts us is offered counselling through the professional service with which we have a contract.  Arising from the "Prime Time" programme, an individual contacted us who had never been in the scouts but was affected by the programme and some of what was revealed in it.  The person received an unsatisfactory response elsewhere and came to Scouting Ireland which provided the person with information on our counselling service.  I was very appreciative of the fact that at the last meeting Deputy Anne Rabbitte and Senator Joan Freeman referred to a survivor who had contacted them and gave some evidence of the response the person had received from Scouting Ireland.  That has characterised how we work on the line.  People who make calls are offered a hearing, an empathetic response and counselling.  Reporting takes place where required.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Mitchell.  I have a few questions.  Deputy Neville may come in then.  Mr. Tennant's opening statement included several remarks about published reports.  I have already dealt with the clarity I sought on that.</p><p>That was appreciated.  I understand the volume of work required.  I have spoken to enough of the delegates, individuals among our audience and members, publicly and privately, for several years, and I can safely say, on behalf of the committee, that the only other group we deal with more is Tusla.  Committee members have put a great deal of thought and energy into Scouting Ireland.  I acknowledge the delegates have also done so or they would not be here.  It is important, however, for me to state the need for a sense of immediacy in the production of reports has not really been met in this instance.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon was referred to earlier by Deputy Rabbitte in this regard.  We are still without a report on historic cases.  Given the nature of the report, a significant period will have to be allocated for anonymising and sanitising the document so it can be made public.  That also presents a difficulty because there are thresholds that have to be met from a legal perspective.  I understand that but I wanted to put it on the record because it is worthy of being said.  It has been said to me enough by members of the scouting movement, locally and nationally.</p><p> I have some technical questions on the operation of Scouting Ireland.  What are the approximate legal costs or what is the percentage of the annual budget allocated for meeting legal costs?  Dr. Lawlor might have a very specific answer but I would be happy with a ballpark figure.</p></speech>

The view of Deputy Sherlock is somewhat different from mine.  My observation is that Mr. Elliott was an interim safeguarding manager of the organisation while simultaneously carrying out the historic review.  In my mind, he was an employee.  Therefore, he is not an independent person.  I get that being an interim safeguarding manager is separate from having the role of looking back, which Mr. Elliott is perfectly capable of doing, but I am not convinced that the obligation regarding independence, which others have commented on in recent months, particularly Dr. Shannon, was fulfilled.  That is a comment more than a question.  I am not questioning Mr. Elliott's professionalism, legacy or what he may do in the future but I feel my comment is worth making because many feel what I feel.</p> <p>  Others have touched on the number of individuals who are currently in Scouting Ireland who have had allegations made against them.  Perhaps Mr. Begley might be aware of whether there had been formal suspensions, gardening leave or such arrangements.  Have the witnesses come across such arrangements over the past few years, specifically since this process began?  Perhaps that question is for Dr. Lawlor given that the other delegates are not as long in their current positions.</p></speech>

That was in our code of conduct for volunteers.  Mr. Elliott recommended that the arrangement should be strengthened to a procedure of suspension without prejudice.</p></speech>

In the past, before the suspension-without-prejudice approach, when individuals were asked to abstain voluntarily and did not do so, they were suspended.  Suspension at that stage was a power reserved for the board - the old board before 6 October last year.  The power was strengthened.  In the past, if somebody was asked to abstain and did not do so, he or she was suspended by the board.  There is a record of that happening in a number of cases.</p></speech>

Ms Lorna Lynch produced a body of work on behalf of Scouting Ireland as an independent barrister.  We have spoken about this with the delegates directly in the past.  It has been referred to on many occasions and it is important in terms of the credibility of the hierarchy of the organisation.  It is a matter of concern among the membership.  The delegates speak with them; I do not but I have been contacted by enough of them to know it is a matter of concern for them.  Notwithstanding what Mr. Tennant has said, I would like him to make a comment on that and on what his membership can expect.</p></speech>

The Chairman is quite right that we, in speaking on behalf of our membership, have heard what he referred to a lot.  What he is saying reflects exactly the mood of the organisation.  Owing to the nature of the inquiry and the level of the people involved, the organisation has received very clear legal advice regarding the rights of those subject to the inquiry and on organisational needs.  The national management committee and the sub-committee have worked painstakingly on ensuring these rights have been observed and on ensuring a fair process.  Doing that ensures the integrity of the process.  That takes time.  It is quite frustrating for ordinary members, those directly involved and us, as those charged with leading the organisation, that it is taking so much time but, because of its very nature, the painstaking approach of ensuring the integrity of the process is sacrosanct has taken time.  It is progressing.</p></speech>

As Deputy Neville is aware, I took up this post in April and I work very closely with the staff in Tusla.  In my view, we have a very good working relationship.  That covers a broad spectrum, because obviously we are dealing with different branches of the organisation throughout the jurisdiction.  On a weekly basis, we would have contact with staff in Tusla discussing individual cases, if not once or twice, maybe three times a week.  In my view, we have a good working relationship with the staff in Tusla.  It is extremely important that we have that.  In addition, we have tripartite meetings between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla and Scouting Ireland.  Since March of this year, we have had three of those meetings.  The purpose of those meetings is to ensure that any issues that arise are addressed.  We deal with more strategic issues in those meetings, but the day-to-day contact would generally be with case officers who are dealing with cases that either have been referred to Tusla directly or we have made disclosures and they are doing their assessment based on the information we have.  From our perspective, we do everything to try to assist the people in Tusla in doing their work.  From my perspective, it is a very important relationship that needs to be built on and at the moment I think it is an absolutely excellent working relationship and I look forward to continuing that.</p> <p>  On the second part about our communications, the vast majority of our communications are done by telephone contact or meetings.  If I am correct here, is Deputy Neville examining how we communicate our disclosures to Tusla?</p></speech>

I asked this question about how Tusla interacts with the Garda&iacute;  based on what has happened.  I do not want to learn in 12 or 14 months or years that files have gone missing or this or that has been lost.  What is the communication process?  Is it electronic and as tight as you possibly can make it so that files can be forensically kept?</p></speech>

Tusla has a portal whereby anybody can make a disclosure to it.  If one were to decide to make a disclosure, he or she can do so on the portal.  We have a facility, which is non-retrospective, also for making disclosures on the portal for current cases.  If somebody contacts Scouting Ireland today and makes a disclosure to us that we believe reaches the threshold, either be it a mandated report or a cause for disclosure, that is made by way of the portal.</p></speech>

Then one gets a follow-up from Tusla.  Sometimes it depends on the particular office.  One would either get a pre-prepared form saying we received it or one would get an individual letter from the case officer saying we have received his or her disclosure.  On retrospective disclosures, we have a process in place for Tusla whereby they go to one particular person within Tusla.  They are sent by email to the person and the document is encrypted.</p> <p>  From our perspective, as I mentioned earlier on, we keep a record of the information that we get.  Some of them do not go any further than us offering advice to the person.  As I said earlier on, if they are not happy with that and they feel that this matter should be reported, we say to them they are at liberty of course to make the report directly themselves.</p></speech>

All the data is protected, and also since our last meeting here we have developed a bespoke space for our safeguarding team to operate from which was not there before.  That work is almost complete.  I think it is moving in this month.  Not only is the data secure and on a separate server, we also have a dedicated space for the safeguarding team physically to do their work in a confidential way.</p></speech>

From figures circulating in the media, we note that 321 alleged victims and 247 alleged perpetrators have been identified.  I would have contacted Scouting Ireland myself back in October out of pure and utter frustration, because we were waiting to find a slot for it to come before us.  There were "Prime Time" programmes airing and everything else.  I asked a number of questions.  Scouting Ireland has definitely gone very corporate.  I will say that for nothing, because my response came from Dubheasa Kelly, the information and communications manager of Scouting Ireland, to a number of questions I would have asked.  I am sure Mr. Tennant is aware of all these questions and he has probably had sight of the response.</p> <p>  An interesting part of the response that I got was something I had not been aware of.  We have all talked around the 321 alleged victims and the 247 alleged perpetrators.  The questions I posed were: Is it known how many files are in existence and if so, how many?  Will Mr. Elliott investigate/include these files and, if not, when will these files be investigated?  The response to this was that as of 29 March 2019, Scouting Ireland's safeguarding department held 999 files.  All these files were catalogued as described above.  Earlier, when Scouting Ireland was asked about how many files were in Larch Hill in 2012, the answer was 332.  My question today is how did the number of files increase from 332 to 995, which is a multiple of three since 2012.  How did this come about?</p></speech>

The 995 figure is the number of files held up to March 2019.  They are inclusive of all the old Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland, CBSI, files; all the old Scout Association of Ireland, SAI, files; the Scouting Ireland files, so any file opened by Scouting Ireland from 2003 up to 29 March 2019; and, also what came in on the helpline.  It is the totality of those files.</p><p>The files that were reviewed in 2012 were the CBSI and SIA files - the legacy files - and the files opened in the interim had to be added to that.  In an organisation of the scale of Scouting Ireland, files will inevitably be opened and we need an extensive safeguarding team because of the concerns, issues and cases that arise.  While they are different from what arose 30 or 40 years ago, they are no less worthy of a professional response.  As I stated at a previous meeting of the committee, we open approximately 70 files per year, and they accumulate all the time.  As Mr. Ian Elliott commented in one of his earlier reports, it is a sign of the health of the organisation when we receive more reports.  One of the problems that have dogged the country is the lack of reporting.  We encourage and want people to report, and see it as a healthy sign if we receive more reports.</p><p> The total number up to March was 995.  Mr. Begley can speak to this year's work if it is helpful to the Deputy.  The figure includes all the old files, that is, the 345 the Deputy mentioned, comprising CBSI and SAI, and the Scouting Ireland files and what we received from the helpline that opened in November last year.</p></speech>

We know the legacy figure since 2012 from the two other organisations.  Of the 660 files received from 2012 to 2019, how many are still open?  Our guests clearly stated in their opening statement what is reportable.  How many of the files were reportable and not reportable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gear&oacute;id Begley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019120400002#M00300"><p>All the files may be opened, insofar as historical issues could arise in respect of any of them.  Mr. Elliott will examine some of the files from before 2019.  We will deal with the files we currently have and will keep them open.  I am not in a position to give an exact figure as to how many of the 660 files will be live as opposed to open, which might be a better way of classifying them-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.581" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019120400002#M00400"><p>That is the crux of the conversation with Scouting Ireland.  What defines "historical" and "current"?  Two different conversations are taking place.  "Current" refers to people who are currently in the organisation or who have children, leaders or board members therein.  That has been the definition of "current" since 2012, when Scouting Ireland started.  It is not historical.  I am well aware of the definitions of "current" and "historical".</p> <p>  I will restate the question and would like our guests to answer.  We have always played with the number of 332 but that was the historical number, what Scouting Ireland inherited, and they were the organisation's words, not mine.  The figure has exploded beyond the figure I received from 332 to 995 files.  What proportions of the 660 files are open and closed, respectively?  I know what has happened to the 332 files.  It is a fair question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.582" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adrian Tennant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019120400002#M00500"><p>It is a fair question and I will provide some clarity.  The Deputy stated there was an increase of approximately 600 files since 2012, but that is not the case.  As the CEO explained, the 2012 review examined the 332 files from the legacy organisations.  Between 2003 and 2012, however, there were nine years of operation and we had our own files from Scouting Ireland, from disclosures made to it since 2003.  The 600 additional files to which the Deputy referred includes all the files from 2003 to date and all the files that have been opened as a result of the helpline.</p></speech>

Scouting Ireland was formed in 2003.  How many files did it receive from 2003 to 2012?</p></speech>

The 600 files are a combination of two categories, namely, all of Scouting Ireland's files since 2003, not since 2012, and the high influx of numbers received through the helpline.  The figure has not exploded from 332 in 2012 to approximately 990 in 2019.  It is a combination.  The larger figure is an aggregate of three numbers.</p></speech>

At previous appearances before the committee, I made clear that the order and scale of files being opened every year was approximately 70, and I think it is approximately 86 this year to date.  We are pleased that more people are reporting.  The numbers will always be incremental.  It is important to us that we maintain our reporting record.  I will await Mr. Elliott's work in order to be definitive, but my observation is that since Scouting Ireland started and professional staff were engaged, the reporting record has been strong.  Fourteen years before management reporting was introduced, the reporting record was in place.</p> <p>  I will address the issue of reportable files, on which Mr. Begley might comment further.  The threshold for not reporting is low and the vast majority of disclosures to us are reported.  In fact, it works the other way.  Often, Tusla will revert to us and state that a case does not meet its threshold.  Scouting Ireland always errs on the side of caution in reporting.  That was my responsibility as mandated person until that changed with the introduction of the safeguarding manager.  The reporting record is good and, in the majority of cases, we err on the side of caution and report.  We will then be advised by Tusla as to how we will proceed.  Mr. Begley might wish to comment further.</p></speech>

It is their determination as to whether they have closed their assessment or investigation.  A file we have could be reopened, depending on the State agency's investigation assessment.  It is difficult to say a case will be fully closed.</p></speech>

If we accept absolutely the bona fides of those who bore witness on that programme and accept them as genuine witnesses, it is arguable that there was a failure of reporting in that instance.  That bridges the divide between the historical and the current.  If the complaints go back to 1987 and 1996 and people in 2019 are saying there did not appear to be a process in respect of their individual stories, one would have to contend that there is a failure of reporting.</p> <p>  Irrespective of the processes Scouting Ireland engaged in in 2012, the distinction it makes between the CBSI, SAI and the creation of Scouting Ireland in 2004, the start of the process, the Children First guidelines and the so-called review in 2012, all of those processes map across the narrative of the individuals who bore witnesses on the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme.  Having watched that programme, at a human level I would say there was a failure of reporting and a failure to deal properly within whatever protocols Scouting Ireland had designed post 2012 to deal with the trauma suffered by those people.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Tennant agree that is the case and that we are still dealing with failures of reporting?  We all acknowledge what Scouting Ireland is trying to do with its new governance procedures.  We all acknowledge the involvement of those 14,000 families.  We represent them also; they live among us in our communities.  We are very much aware of the good work that goes on in Scouting Ireland right down to troop level.  At the same time, we need to be satisfied beyond any doubt that the system is robust.  It is hard to be convinced that it is robust in light of the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme.</p></speech>

We cannot say that enough.  Those who spoke on the programme spoke well.  They spoke of horrific times in their lives.  However hard we think it is to listen to that, we can only imagine what it was like to live through that.  We acknowledge that.</p> <p>  Their stories relate to the legacy issues.  They gave examples of how they reported.  Obviously, we cannot talk about the individual cases so I am talking about in general.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that.</p></speech>

Either they were not listened to or there was some veil of secrecy or whatever.  None of that is deniable by us.  That will be forthcoming in the work that Ian Elliot in particular is doing.</p> <p>  This is very important for those 14,000 volunteers the Deputy mentioned, who are working in our communities, and for the parents.  I gave the figures earlier for the level of trust they have in Scouting Ireland.</p> <p>  Since the formation of Scouting Ireland, we have reported.  There has been a strong history of reporting since 2003, well before we needed to.  However, did that reporting take place at the same level in the former organisations?  At the moment, that evidently does not appears to be the case.  To speak fully on it, we await Mr. Elliot's report, but the evidence to date does not suggest the matter was handled correctly by the former organisations. </p></speech>

The F&oacute;rsa delegation today consists of myself, head of health and welfare division, and my staff colleagues at the F&oacute;rsa national health office: Mr. Chris Cully, Ms Catherine Keogh and Mr. Diarmaid Mac a Bhaird.  F&oacute;rsa represents more than 30,000 workers in the public and voluntary health sector across a broad diversity of grades, groups and categories.  A large portion of the F&oacute;rsa-represented workforce consists of health and social care professionals including physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, podiatrists, psychologists, social workers, social care workers, pharmacists, physicists, audiologists and orthoptists.  This list is far from exhaustive.  F&oacute;rsa also represents a very large cohort of clerical, administrative and management grades.<br/><br/>The concept of workforce planning is widely accepted as planning to place the right number of people with the right skills in the right place at the right time.  In the area of healthcare, this should be designed with the sole ambition of providing improved patient outcomes which, in turn, deliver better care and improved quality of life.  There are a number of contributing factors which militate against effective healthcare workforce planning and thus bring about a much-reduced capacity to achieve such improved patient outcomes.<br/><br/>To address taking a step back and reactive planning, the Irish health sector has been pieced together over 90 years as a composite of State and voluntary services.  It has traditionally been dominated by the acute hospital sector.  It is, at best, disjointed.  The Irish health service is resourced with highly-competent workers who work honestly and diligently.  However, such diligence is often compromised by a systems failure which consequently fails to deliver the required levels of improved patient outcomes.  The social and political measurement of the performance of our health services is often based upon the number of patients waiting on hospital trolleys and the length of hospital waiting lists.  This crude measurement leads to reactive and pressure-based planning. The cyclical nature of system failure and reactive planning will never bring about an integrated healthcare system which focuses on health promotion and improvement, community-based health intervention and appropriate acute hospital healthcare.  Effective workforce planning requires taking a step back and planning to resource the type of health system envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare model.<br/><br/>The current model whereby the annual funding allocation is distributed is not fit for purpose for an effective integrated healthcare system.  Inevitably, as overspends arise, a cap-in-hand approach applies in whatever area of healthcare is attracting the most noise at a particular point in time.  For example, if a particular controversy arises in mental health, unplanned supplementary resources are provided to ease political pressure.  This approach can only lead to turf warfare in funding and, accordingly, we will never get to a point where preventive interventions realise their full value to society.  If the fundamental principles of Sl&aacute;intecare are to be achieved, multiannual budgeting will be a necessity.<br/><br/>The responsibility for recruitment of staff lies with national recruitment services, NRS.  NRS is resourced with a cohort of highly-dedicated staff and is, quite simply, operating way beyond its capacity to generate timely staff recruitment.  NRS is inhibited by rules surrounding the recruitment licence in addition to the sheer size of the task of recruiting staff on a national basis.  Furthermore, the lack of a formal staff mobility policy ensures that there is a residue of workers seeking geographical relocation while at the same time residing on placement panels from which they are offered positions in areas outside of a geographical preference.  A mobility policy would greatly ease the pressure on the system in this regard.  The crude instrument of a recruitment freeze also introduces layer upon layer of derogation processes which take months to overcome, leaving vital posts remaining vacant or the utilisation of agency workers at a demonstrably higher cost to the State.<br/><br/>There exists a chronic situation with regard to vacant health and social care professional, HSCP, posts.  The direct effect of this is felt by patients in need of interventions. The rate of churn of HSCPs is in excess of 7%, second only to hospital consultants.  The Sl&aacute;intecare model references the need for an additional 1,400 HSCPs.  This figure does not even take into account the number of alarming and critical gaps in the current structure.  As we seek to move to a model which places more emphasis on community-based health intervention which frees up acute hospital services to deliver what is needed in that area, HSCP recruitment cannot simply be an option.  Without significant HSCP recruitment, the model simply will not get beyond the starting line.  On an ongoing basis, the built-in excess whole-time equivalent planning which applies to cover maternity and parental leave in nursing should apply to HSCPs as 80% of HSCP staff are female.  Additionally, there should be automatic progression from basic to senior grade therapist after five years' practice, subject to competency validation.  This would be of great benefit to isolated rural areas as a therapist who has built up an intervention-patient relationship would not need to move from that rural area to attain career progression.  There is also a clear need for a HSCP advocate in the Department of Health, which would operate in its own stream and not within a nursing reporting arrangement.<br/><br/>With regard to community healthcare organisation, CHO, primary care networks, F&oacute;rsa has given its support and co-operation to the establishment of nine learning sites, one per existing CHO, in the area of primary care.  The establishment of the nine learning sites brings about significant change in the way HSCPs currently work.  In order for the learning sites to succeed, they must be adequately staffed.  If the Minister for Health&rsquo;s proposal to create six integrated care organisations to replace the current configuration of nine CHOs and seven hospital groups comes about, it is likely that the network model trialled in the nine learning sites will continue.  It is therefore imperative that, if the nine sites are deemed to be a success with adequate staffing, growth into more geographical networks are adequately staffed in the same way.<br/><br/>On clerical, administrative and managerial grades, there is an accepted lazy narrative in social and political circles that the health sector is awash with administrative staff and managers.  This is neither true nor fair.  In fact, the proportional number of administrative staff in the Irish health sector is lower than in many international comparators.  Clerical staff are charged with tasks such as paying the wages of doctors and nurses and are often the first point of contact for members of the public.  The acceptance of the narrative referenced above is demoralising for this group of workers, many of whom bore the biggest brunt of the cull in staff numbers during the financial crisis, at great personal cost.  <br/><br/>Health sector managers are vilified for lack of performance and accountability whereas, in reality, the system is failing due to <i>ad hoc</i>planning.  F&oacute;rsa is supportive of a performance system for senior managers as such a system would at least protect senior managers from a generic allegation which is made without any real basis.  It would be hard to find, for example, many workers in the health system with as onerous a responsibility as that borne by heads of social care in the CHO structure.  In fact, the dangerous level of risk borne by these workers has been independently verified.  Recently there was an announcement in the national media, without any reference to this union, of the need to whittle down the number of managers in the system.  This assumption is made without any meaningful analysis.  In fact, this approach was tried before, resulting in a massive deficit of corporate and intellectual knowledge which, in turn, generated a subsequent re-establishment of previous numbers.<br/><br/>F&oacute;rsa once again thanks the committee for its attention and time.  We will endeavour to answer any questions members may have either today or in further correspondence.</p></speech>

These hearings on workforce planning were kicked off by the committee's serious concern about the lack of workforce planning for nurses and midwives, consultants, and many of the other healthcare professionals whom F&oacute;rsa represent.  Mr. Donnelly has gone through some areas.  I will ask him a broad question to begin with.  For the sake of the workers F&oacute;rsa represents and the services they provide, we need to see proper multiannual workforce planning.  We should know how many people we need at particular grades, with particular skill sets, and in different services in different parts of the country.  We should be accounting for maternity leave, training, and mobility around the country.  We should be treating our staff very well so that our retention rates would be high.  The HSE should be a fantastic place to work because, first and foremost, that would provide the best outcomes for patients and, secondly but also extremely importantly, because everyone should a have decent workplace.  That is the ideal.  Some countries are good at it and some are not.  Some parts of the public sector are good at it and some are not.</p><p>Some companies are good at it and some are not.  With respect to the people F&oacute;rsa represents and the services they provide, can Mr. Donnelly broadly indicate how it is going?  He has addressed some specific issues.  Are there parts of the HSE or sections 38 and 39 organisations to which he could point and say that group is really good?  He need not name particular groups but are there parts of the HSE or some of those organisations that are particularly bad, be it by geography or service?</p></speech>

We cannot separate multi-annual workforce planning from multi-annual budgeting.  If one was a systems person and thought there would be a reconfiguration of the health service and that the HSE would be very much streamlined downwards through a move to integrated care organisations that would have autonomy, and if one was workforce planning on an multi-annual basis, one would need workforce planning for that event.  We are currently in a big state of flux.  If everything was to stay the same, which we know it will not because it cannot, one might get away with the cap in hand approach year on year.  However, if we were serious about, for example, relieving the pressure on acute hospital healthcare and were to allow acute hospitals to deliver acute healthcare and to have proper interventions in the community, we would need to have a multi-annual approach both from a budgetary point of view and a workforce planning point of view.</p></speech>

When we talk about the nine learning sites, an anecdotal comment often made to us by our health and social care professional members is that those in management will staff up the nine learning sites to adequate levels to make them work, with the inference being they will then leave everything else as it is and the staff will be under the usual pressure.  If that is the anecdotal evidence, I would say primary care is probably under some pressure on workforce planning.</p></speech>

I talk to various employers within the healthcare system around the country, be it a hospice or whatever the service provider is.  I had a conversation with an employer in one provider that was considering moving from being a section 39 to a section 38 organisation and they were excited about that because of the cuts that had been applied to staff that had not been reversed for section 39 organisations.  They thought they might get some breathing space if they were to become a section 38 organisation but they were warned about that by others organisations and told they should be careful because if they were to do that they would fall under the dreaded control of the national recruitment service which they were told was a nightmare as it can take a year and a half to hire anybody.  First, it is a problem for the organisation in that it cannot get the people it needs when it needs them and, second, most people who have options, who are the type of people an organisation would want to hire, do not hang around for a year and a half.  They will move on and in many cases they will move to Sydney, Boston or wherever it may be.  I was delighted to hear Mr. Donnelly raise the issue of recruitment and he referenced the licence and alluded to capacity.  What the hell is the going on with the recruitment service that it is taking 18 months to recruit people?  Is it that it has a quarter of the staff its need?  It is buried in red tape that is not suitable and should not be there?  What is going on?</p></speech>

First, the Deputy referenced the section 39 agencies.  It is F&oacute;rsa's view that the funding model for section 39 agencies should be in line with our caring at what cost policy, a robust State funding model.  There might be some advantages in an agency having autonomy but there are many disadvantages in having to go cap in hand to its funders every year to see if it can still provide a service.</p> <p>  The national recruitment service was created in Manorhamilton in Leitrim as part of a Government agenda to bring work to isolated rural areas; we are supportive of that.  It is an urban town in a very rural country.  Manorhamilton has a very good cohort of staff but the service is only operating at half capacity.  It is F&oacute;rsa's view that clerical and administrative recruitment should be taken out of Manorhamilton and put into the community.  Clerical and administrative workers have a generic skill set and are easier than other staff to move around.  The service received 21,000 applications for the basic grade of clerical officer.  Nobody in the Manorhamilton office will be able to handle that.  If appointments were dedicated to, say, nursing, midwifery and health and social care professional recruitment, that would ease the pressure on Manorhamilton somewhat.  In addition, when an invisible moratorium, which effectively is a moratorium, is introduced and one has to jump through layer upon layer of derogation, that makes the recruitment job for national recruitment service nigh on impossible.  As the Deputy succinctly put it, people will not hang around for a nine-month derogation to pick up a post, particularly those who are coming out of college who have other options.  The service in Manorhamilton has been hard done by.  With respect to the recruitment licence, if there is a challenge to something we do we can focus on what is the material cause and effect of the challenge and sometimes we concentrate on what might be the result of a challenge rather than 99% of the business which involves running a competition and doing that without getting overly hung-up on every aspect of a recruitment licence.</p></speech>

I have worked in healthcare systems abroad and none of them is perfect but the ones that work best for patients have a reasonable level of trust between the employer and the workers.  It is never perfect but there is a pride in being in the workforce and a general sense that the employer has the worker's back most of the time.  One aspect that strikes me about the HSE, the Irish public health care system, is that it is opposite of that.  There is a total lack of trust and a breakdown in the relationship between the employer - I do not mean individual local employers but the HSE, the ultimate paymaster - and front-line workers.  It seems to be chronic or it may be that all the disgruntled people talk to me.  We seem to be an outlier and it is for doctors, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, primary care workers, health and social care professions.  It seems to be across the system.  Is there something we can do from the State&rsquo;s perspective to rebuild trust so that the workers F&oacute;rsa represents feel valued, respected and listened to and can have a great sense of pride that they work for Ireland&rsquo;s public healthcare system and, ultimately, can have a bit of trust that their organisation has their back?</p></speech>

One can never have trust, particularly between a front-line workforce and a corporate employer, if the way we do things is that every time there is a controversy or a scandal we try to generate a blame culture and react to that then by putting in place resources.</p><p>The senior manager who may want to consult everybody in the world is told to go out and deliver something to alleviate this controversy or scandal.  People then come to us to tell us what is happening to them.  There is no shared vision.  In my 20 years as a union official Sl&aacute;intecare is the first attempt to get on the same page about a healthcare system.  In order to generate the trust Deputy Donnelly talks about, we will need to work on a vision and get away from this turf warfare of one person being more important than someone else.  The patient is the important aspect in all this.</p><p> I do not think it is a lost cause.  We will struggle so long as we continue to react to scandals and controversy, as the dominant dynamo.</p></speech>

There is a great pilot in Connolly Hospital where advanced practitioner physiotherapists are seeing people on the orthopaedic surgeon waiting list.  This values the work the physiotherapist does and cuts waiting lists, and, if we are simplistic about it, at a lower cost to the Exchequer, which is good.  Our health and social care professionals will say they do not have an advocate in the Department of Health.  In talking about trust and respect, that is one key thing we seek.</p> <p>  We have talked about Sl&aacute;intecare and we need to look at the citizen at the centre of this.  Obesity is a problem, but we do not have enough dieticians in the community to deal with this early.  Every bit should be joined up.  We represent home help co-ordinators, who are considered managers in the HSE census figures of managers.  They are grade 6 on a clerical-administrative scale; that is just the pay relationship.  One home help co-ordinator might manage 106 home help care assistants going into 600 homes.  There is great value, but if these grades had a strong advocate in the Department of Health - we have been pushing to reinstate this - it would go a long way to rebuilding the trust the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

It is really chronic with many children and adults suffering.  We need to hire more people, hold on to the people we have and get the most out of them in doing the job they want and know how to do.  What would the witnesses ask the committee to do or ask the Government to do that would make it easier to hold on to these people?  Is it flexibility, maternity care or something else?  What would be the top things we could ask the HSE to do to make their lives better?</p> <p>  I will slip in the following question before the Chairman notices.  This morning's newspapers have reported the Secretary General at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform speaking about the lack of ability to sanction civil servants for low performance.  It is a real problem in the Civil Service.  Do his comments also apply to the healthcare system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.660" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019120400002#E00500"><p>There is a fairly complex answer to those questions.  I will try my best.  Before I came back to the health sector in the trade union movement, I was actually in the Civil Service.  They spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to analyse performance.  Do I believe there should be performance accountability in the Civil Service?  Absolutely, yes.  We are on record as the only trade union to offer ourselves up for that.  Every St. Stephen's Day I hear on the radio that there are 672 people on trolleys and straightaway the hospital manager is blamed.  How can a hospital manager in that capacity stop 672 people being on trolleys when it is a systems failure?  I would rather for that hospital manager to be protected by a performance management and accountability system; it would make more sense.  That should apply to workers.</p> <p>  It is quite simple with health and social care professionals.  At the turn of this century in 2000 there was no career structure whatsoever because a physiotherapist was a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist was an occupational therapist.  Speech and language therapy barely existed.  When people had strokes they were almost losses to society.  The world has changed and we have the skills available.  As a result of our co-operation with the new community health structures, we are in the process of reviewing the career pathway for health and social care professionals.  </p> <p>  We should not underestimate how important it would be to see automatic progression from basic rate to senior grade therapist because it touches on some of the things the Deputy has mentioned.  It must be validated that the therapist is competent so it is linked to performance.  I will use the example of Leitrim and Longford again.  Someone there may have developed a four or five-year relationship or connection with patients.  All of a sudden in order to access a senior grade he or she probably has to go to Sligo to follow where the population is to get on a panel and so on.</p> <p>  We are trying to convince our health and social care professionals, apart from the value to the patient of clinical specialisms, advanced practitioning, that maybe at some stage in their career they might need to say, "I'm going to actually use my expertise and put down my tools.  I'm actually going to populate posts that are responsible for service planning and delivery.  All this stuff you talk about in terms of how you view a service, I'm going to bring my clinical expertise to this."  We then need the creation of directorates for the various professions.  If we had a vision set out like that, remaining on as a health and social care professional in this country would be a more attractive option.  Many of our people look the British National Health Service, NHS.  It is not quite like nurses and doctors where potential hospital consultants go to Australia; our people tend to go to Britain.  We could stem that tide very quickly if we had a pathway mapped for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019120400002#E00600"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their submission.  I agree on the need for managers to direct; we need a command system.  I feel that the command system has failed but I cannot put my finger on the reason for that.  For instance, if people are on trolleys in a hospital I immediately ask why they are there.  Is the hospital the appropriate place for them in the first instance?  Should there have been an interruption?  There is no sense in being vague about it and saying that primary care rests with the primary care area and they can get an equal or better service at home.  Unfortunately, it does not work that way.</p> <p>  To what extent is the healthcare system capable of dealing with the daily influx of patients into our hospitals?  We, as policymakers, were told for years that we did not need more hospital beds.  We need fewer hospital beds because the patients would be dealt with on a turnaround of two or three hours.  It did not happen.  It is not happening, nor is it likely to happen.</p> <p>  We now need somebody or some system to decide to intervene as soon as the patient arrives at the hospital in an ambulance and not to leave the ambulance outside the door with the engine running for three, four, five or ten hours as the case may be, and with five or six ambulances all lined up at the same time.  This is a total waste of resources.  It is a risk to the patient and it is unacceptable.  How can we intervene to stop that?  I believe we need to find out where the logjam in the system lies.  What is stopping the first patient who arrives in the hospital that morning from being processed instantly?</p> <p>  I know people will say that they have been triaged and they are now waiting for a bed.  This is also a total contradiction to what we were told years ago when we were told there was no need for beds and yet strangely we now need 3,000 beds.</p><p>I do not know if we have the information readily available to us but we would need it at this level.  We would need to know what is going on in the various hospitals throughout the country, what is holding up the queue in the morning time, and what is forcing patients to be accommodated in corridors, in waiting areas and in generally unsupervised situations in the hospitals.  It is unfair to the patient, dangerous from a patient's point of view, unfair to the system and unfair to the staff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.663" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019120400002#F00200"><p>There are many observations in that.  First, about managers, I want to be clear that managers form less than 1.5% of the entire health workforce.  The percentage is low by comparison with international comparators.  I was talking about the poor individual soul who is charged with the entire responsibility of running a hospital such as Portlaoise who, as soon as there is a logjam, should be held to account, and that would will never work.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan is absolutely right.  Bed capacity was always an issue.  I do not know how it was decided that bed capacity should be reduced.  The question is who is in the beds.  I have personal experience of my own mother being in one for four months - when, quite clearly, what she needed was a step-down facility with a hoist to deal with her incapacity to get herself up in the morning - in a big hospital in Drogheda where there were trolleys all over the place.  Definitely bed capacity is one issue.</p> <p>  The number of people who land in accident and emergency is a problem.  I would say it is at best probably more than it should be.  I refer to the lack of primary care interventions and the referral system as well.  I do not know,  if one is ever to get Sl&aacute;intecare off the ground, whether we will ever tackle the general practitioner, GP, model but the entire referral system creates logjams in the hospital system because we have grown up over 90 years with a hospital-centric healthcare system and everything lands there.  Until we get away from that, one will have this.  One can increase the number of beds.  If one increases the number of beds by 3,000 one will have probably 1,500 fewer trolleys but one will not solve the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019120400002#F00300"><p>The next issue is the staffing levels and the configuration of the staff.  I came across a situation recently where there was only one doctor available in a hospital.  I do not know who decided that.  I do not know how that came about but it should not happen.  If that is the way it is, there is a reason for it, we need to know what is the reason for it and we need to do something about it.  It is not a complex issue.  It is a simple issue.</p> <p>  If there were 80 patients waiting in a hospital area on Monday of last week, the presumption is that there would be a similar number next week and the week after unless something is done about it.  This is the problem.  We spend our time talking about this and going over and over it which is detrimental to those working in the service but we do not seem to identify the cause of the problem, and the cause of the problem has to be addressed.</p> <p>  From my own observation, we went through a hiatus in this country over the past ten years.  We went from a situation where almost 0.5 million people left the country and services were closed down due to very serious financial issues - there was no way around that and we were told what we had to do and we got to do it - to one where those people have come back with more.  If one tours around the various industrial hotspots of this city and the country in general and looks at the volume of heavy traffic on the roads in the morning about which we complain, the answer to the question as to where are all the heavy trucks coming from and what are they doing is that they are doing their business.  They are producing for home consumption or for export, whatever the case may be.  It naturally follows that the health service must compete and cater for a much bigger market than it did 11 or 12 years ago.  If we do not do that and we do not identify the most immediate issues upfront, we are missing out and we will talk about it forever.</p> <p>  I should say that I am a strong advocate of community care.  I was a member of a health board in the past.  I believe it was a better system because the inspiration for the response came from the ground up where the GPs were involved, where the pharmacists were involved, where the nurses where involved and where the psychiatric system was involved.  Everybody was involved in a consultative capacity at the coalface.  That is all gone and it is now centralised.  The theory is that centralisation is a more effective and efficient method for delivering services.  It is not.</p> <p>  This is the last point I want to make on that.  I refer to recruitment and attraction to the system.  I see no reason we cannot have temporary appointments instead of agency staff.  The temporary appointment - while waiting for the permanent appointment to be approved - could fill the space, provide the service and deliver the service to the public which is what we are supposed to do.  We are not an employment agency.  We are deliverers of service.  We require employers to deliver the service.  Unless it becomes policy to utilise the temporary appointment, we are at nothing.  I am not asking Mr. Donnelly to make a political statement on this.  That is my view on it and I would like to hear the counter view.</p></speech>

While I am a part-time distant commentator on healthcare because of my field in terms of the categories of workers I represent, I can tell the Deputy there is no reason in the world one could not have temporary workers instead of agency workers.  First, it is cheaper.  Second, they do not accrue permanent employment rights for four years.  If one cannot get it right in four years, one is struggling.</p> <p>  I agree that a centralised system has not worked out.  We would be great advocates of the six regional authorities with a scaled-down HSE so long as those authorities do not become hospital dominated.  If they become hospital dominated, what will happen is one will have the same problem in six different areas.  It must be integrated.  It has to be. </p> <p>  The committee will hear a bit of honesty here.  I do not know how many doctors in the system coming through university are not getting jobs but it would seem that the supply system is not great either.</p></speech>

We believe that such staff should be temporary direct employees of the health service.  Part of the reason there are quite a number of staff being employed from agencies is because of the slow process of approving posts for filling and the moratorium that is not a moratorium but is really a moratorium.  We have experience of seeking for a post to be filled, for example, for a maternity cover, and it taking nine months to get approval.  If one has a front-line situation where one needs to have the post filled, if it will take nine months what one will do in the meantime is take in an agency person.  That is what the people on the ground are experiencing.  They are trying to fill the holes because of slow systems that they are a victim of when they are trying to run a front-line service.</p></speech>

I am aware the Chairman is anxious.  I am also anxious, I can assure him, to get parity with everybody in this business.</p> <p>  The point I want to make is this.  There is a proportionality issue as well.  If we employ 10,000 new staff over a period of time, there must be a proportional number of those proposed for the coalface as well as the administration level.  What the proportions are varies from one discipline to another but it is important to recognise that there is no use employing 10,000 administrators and no medical staff.</p> <p> On the slowness of the appointments, I both accept and do not accept it.  On this one, I am for and against.  I honestly believe that it is simple to figure out, first, whether the person applying for a temporary post is qualified for the post.  Second, while the rest of the appointment process is laboriously being entered into, they can be at work notwithstanding the fact that they may or may not be still a candidate for the position.</p><p>They may have changed their mind and gone elsewhere.  The longer a person is kept waiting, the more expensive the system becomes.  We need to address that as a matter of urgency.  To conclude, there is no sense in having 100,000 administrators if their numbers are out of proportion to those at the coalface.  It is not going to work.  It cannot work.  We can have all the people in the world telling us what should be done and when, but there must be operatives with the required expertise at the coalface, putting their fingers on the various sensitive areas to identify how the flow can be best assisted.  I am not sure that we have done that.  We have not done that for a long time.  We need those people to move the queue along.  The critics will say that I am another politician trying to jump the queue.  I do not want to jump the queue at all.  I want the queue to move along, for God's sake.  How long must we wait before we all realise that?</p></speech>

At no stage are we suggesting that there should be a disproportionate number of administrators.  We find that narrative quite demoralising.  The proportion of administrators in the entire health service is about 10%.  That is comparatively low.  We are not suggesting that there should be any more.  We are suggesting that we should be valued for what we do.  If a patient presents himself or herself to cardiology, somebody has to hand the consultant the chart and make sure that chart is accurate and reflects the proper medical histology.  Is that or is that not a part of the coalface?  It is classified as administration.  Ms Keogh already referenced home help co-ordinators.  The net produce of one home help co-ordinator affects 600 homes.  They are counted as administrators.  The people who pay the wages of doctors and nurses are administrators.  We are not suggesting that there should be a disproportionate number.  We are not looking for more administrators.  We are simply saying that we find this simple narrative tiresome.  An assumption is made, without any analysis, that the administrative cohort of 10% is somehow disproportionate and is inhibiting the health system from doing what it should be doing.  Deputy Durkan is dead right to say that purpose is putting front-line workers at the coalface.</p></speech>

It is a difficult area.  There are so many different areas in the health service, including doctors, nurses, care assistants, cleaners, porters and administrators.  It is complex.  One problem I see with the health service is that everyone is fighting their own battle.  There is a huge problem.  There is no team effort.  I have come across a few cases where nurses were not given support when there was an adverse outcome.  I was really disappointed when somebody recently came before the committee and spoke about the lack of support offered when there is an adverse outcome.  That applies to administrative people, nursing staff and doctors.  That puts people on the defensive for the rest of their lives.  Their attitude is shaped by the experience of not getting support when they needed it.  I am really worried about that in the health service.  That has happened time and time again to people I know who work in the health service.  We need to work on that.</p> <p>  This is not a criticism; it is just an observation.  Since December 2014 the number of staff in the HSE has increased to 135,000.  It has increased by 16,000 full-time staff.  Meanwhile there is a perception out there that an embargo is in place and no new staff are being taken on.  It is unfortunate that this impression has taken hold among the public as if nothing has been done.  Actually 16,000 additional full-time staff have been taken on.  That is a huge increase in staff numbers.  However, during that five-year period there does not appear to have been a plan outlining which crucial areas needed more employees.  It appears to have been a case of who shouted the loudest.  That is my worry.  </p> <p>  I will come back to the issue of administrative staff.  This is not a criticism, because I know a lot of staff were laid off.  The actual number of administrative and management staff has gone from 15,030 in December 2014 to 18,600 in March 2019, the last time for which I have figures.  That is a 24% increase.  I have no problem with that.  My problem is that this was disproportionate.  There was an overall increase of 17% in the number of HSE staff but administration and management increased by 24%.  I have a problem with the fact that the number of public health nurses only increased by 3.7%.  It appears that no-one was fighting their corner.  Public health nurses play a very important part.</p> <p>  This is not a criticism of administration and management.  However, it appears there was no plan which took account of numbers and of needs for the next 12 months or two years and determined how to use the budget.  That is one of my concerns.  I do not know the witnesses' views on that.  It does not appear to have been a priority.  The public perception is that there are fewer doctors and nurses but that is not the case.  In fact there are more doctors.  Comparing the current figures to those of 2009 shows that we have gone from 7,000 doctors in the HSE to 9,000.  That includes consultants, the number of which has risen from 2,100 to more than 3,100.  The number of junior doctors has also increased by more than 1,000.  The number of care assistants has increased, which is a huge advantage because they provide a very good service.  That number has increased by 2,000.  I am still concerned.  No-one is saying at the start of the year that we need an extra 500 care assistants.  The increase seems to have happened in bits and pieces around the country.  From their own dealings on this issue, what are the witnesses' observations?  Some 16,000 additional staff is a huge number to take on without any overall corporate plan.  Certainly if a private enterprise decided to take on 16,000 people there would be a clear two-year, three-year, four-year or five-year plan.  That does not appear to have been in place.  We need to set clear targets when planning.  Let us talk about the targets first and then talk about how to resource them.  We seem to be deciding to hire people on the basis of the money we have for a certain year.  We need to do that far better than we have done.  I do not know what the witnesses' observations on that are.</p></speech>

Members may have read in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>the week before last about the director general's announcement of a targeted redundancy for managers.  That throws everything into the mix.  As an advocate of workforce planning I say that if that is what is required, that is what we will deal with.  However, there must be some analysis of whether this is the right fit before we make sweeping statements.  This is what I keep saying.<br/><br/>If members wish to consider this after our session I would draw their attention to the HSE staff census in 2009, when we were really bankrupt.  The reason there has been a 23% or 24% increase in the number of managers is that those roles faced the biggest cull at that time.  The proportionate increase is from a much lower base.  Moreover, a redundancy package was part of that cull.  That one crude instrument removed a pile of corporate knowledge.  Then people wondered where the knowledge had gone.  The result was that people were rehired on a consultancy basis into positions that had been deemed fit for redundancy.  This caused a bigger spend.  That is not right.  I am all for embracing the problem.  If people think we are awash with managers, let us analyse it and have an adult conversation about it.  We cannot proceed on the mere statement that the number has increased by 24%.  There is a deeper-rooted history to that. <br/><br/>Secondly, if the Senator is talking about increasing the workforce I agree with him.  The fact of the matter, however, is that we have a bigger population.  It is getting older.</p></speech>

People are now presenting with conditions that require more care so obviously one will have to consider an increase in staff numbers, and in the care industry with which I agree.  Again, if one increased the HSE's staff headcount one might be in a different position.  If one had a regionally accountable health service that delivered services at the heart of the community it would relieve the pressure on acute hospital care.  Such a health service might be a better fit with multiannual budgeting and workforce planning, which is where we started the conversation.</p></speech>

When one considers the numbers, administrative is not strictly administrative and is just the way people's jobs are described in the statistics.  For example, assessment officers assess children for disability, under the Disability Act, but the officers are categorised as administrative staff.  One cannot say numbers have increased by 20% or whatever because there are people who do very serious and important jobs, such as assessment officers, but are paid on an administrative pay scale and, therefore, fit into the administrative scheme of things.  There are other categories of staff just like that.</p></speech>

Local authorities present a five-year plan that outlines what they want to develop but that is not done in the health service.  We have Sl&aacute;intecare but we still need an overall plan.  Mr. Donnelly made a valid point about many people ending up in accident and emergency units who should not be there at all.  We need to consider how to deal with the issue.  There are super clinics in other countries that offer a range of services.  The minor injuries unit in St. Mary's Health Campus in Cork works very effectively and takes approximately 8,500 people out of the accident and emergency departments in the Mercy University Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  Maybe we should consider a similar scene for around the country.  Well over 75% of the people who present at accident and emergency units do not require a hospital stay.  Yes, they require some care and treatment but they do not need a hospital bed.  We need to work out how to move those people away from accident and emergency units into a proper care provision without clogging up the hospital system.</p> <p>  Forward planning seems to have disappeared and, by way of explanation, I will outline one of my big criticisms of the current recruitment of consultants.  In the past the old health boards were aware that a consultant would retire in a particular year and 12 months before that a recruitment process would be put in place.  Now we seem to wait until the person retires, then a locum is selected to cover for the consultant and only then the recruitment process is undertaken.  Do witnesses know from their own experiences any way that process can be changed?  Nurses are recruited in similar fashion.  No one thinks outside the box when it comes to the recruitment and retention of staff in a whole range of areas.</p></speech>

Let us say it is a head of discipline or a therapy manager who manages a service.  He or she could be replaced on a temporary basis but somewhere along that line, and probably most likely at a basic grade level so it is at the level of direct intervention with a patient, one will lose the person.</p> <p>  The Senator made interesting comments about consultants.  If one is about Sl&aacute;intecare then it is not just about knowing a consultant is retiring and replacing him or her.  One must also tackle the public-private mix in hospitals.  There are all sorts of other associated arguments that we are familiar with.</p> <p>  I will outline my own view, and I am probably making the fatal mistake of thinking on my feet.  One needs to know what one is planning for.  If we are planning for all of the things that appear in Sl&aacute;intecare I would say there a number of historical and cultural inhibitors that would stop us from getting all of that journey.  It would not be too wild to imagine a system of six integrated care organisations or redefined health boards that do not have a political layer.  We could start planning for that.  I do not think that is too big an ask because it is necessary whether Sl&aacute;intecare, in its entirety, happens.  </p></speech>

The number of people who are over 85 years will also quadruple in a decade so additional services must be put in place.  We certainly need to start planning for that situation.  It is not just a matter of writing this in black and white; it is about implementing a plan year by year between now and 2030, which is a serious challenge.  The demographic is not going to change and it will put huge demands on the health service.</p></speech>

I broke my arm in Athlone and ended up in Roscommon County Hospital on a Friday afternoon where I received a brilliant service.  I was in denial about having a broken arm but it turns out that I am no good at self-diagnosis after an X-ray proved that it was broken.  I was working in Athlone that day so I returned to work after a plaster of Paris was applied to my arm and before I left the hospital I was given a note to go to Beaumont Hospital as I live in Dublin.  When I went to Beaumont Hospital I had to queue again but this time in its accident and emergency department.  Therefore, I visited two accident and emergency units with one broken arm.  Before I left the county hospital I was given a CD that contained copies of my X-ray.  When I presented my CD to the staff in Beaumont Hospital a couple of days later they could not read the CD so they had to cut my plaster and perform another X-ray.  My arm was X-rayed, a diagnosis made and plaster of Paris reapplied but I needlessly clogged up the unit in Beaumont Hospital for four or five hours.</p> <p>  Earlier my colleague, Ms Cully, referred to the definition of administrative grades.  In terms of administrative grades, planning, joined-up thinking and integrated services, my experience of having a broken arm showed there is no proper IT system.  Within those admininstrative management figures are IT people.  Again, the IT personnel are highly qualified and perform a highly responsible job.  We agree with the Senator that planning is needed but throwing numbers into the system will not suffice  and we stress that a targeted approach is needed.    </p></speech>

However, there must be an IT system that ensures when a patient moves from one hospital to another that he or she does not need, as in my case, to have to endure the reapplication of a plaster of Paris.  I am a hardy middle-aged woman but it would be unacceptable if an elderly person had to wait in an accident and emergency unit for a second time and, being practical, it is not economically sensible.  F&oacute;rsa strongly advocates local and regional thinking.  That is why F&oacute;rsa got so heavily involved with the learning sites because we advocate bringing things back to the local level and empowering decision-makers.

There needs to be adequate administrative numbers because nurses need to nurse, doctors need to diagnose, physiotherapists need to be doing what I said they are doing in Connolly Hospital and take people off the lists of surgeons, occupational therapists or OTs need to get people back to their homes, and dieticians need to help people learn how to eat again after suffering a stroke.</p><p>A strong original administration team, including secretarial support, is needed as well.

One of Sl&aacute;intecare's main recommendations was that there should be a move away from a hospital-centric model to a model that is centred on community and social care and where people are looked after in the community.  It is hoped that this will prevent unnecessary attendances in hospital, which should be kept for complex and acute care.  The witnesses represent physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, podiatrists, psychologists and social workers, all of whom are key members of community care teams.  Unfortunately, many of our community care teams are missing many of these important specialists.  This inhibits the delivery of care in the community.  Is there a lack of such specialists applying for jobs?  Is the moratorium inhibiting the recruitment of people?  Is the complex nature of recruitment the problem?  Many teams are deficient.</p></speech>

In other words, we will not have enough people trying to come through the system because it will not be attractive anymore.  At the moment, the problem is more one of hiring and planning than one of availability.  The people are there, but they will not always be there if this problem is not captured.  We may have to look at graduate training models and stuff like that.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about the learning side of primary care.  There are nine areas at the moment.  If it works, it will be fit for conversion into six.  It is envisaged that all of these people will work in a co-ordinated way on the teams in question.  That would be a massive benefit for patients.  That is why we are so invested in it.</p></speech>

If we decide to allow providers to provide on behalf of the State, we must consolidate their position within the funding model.</p></speech>

It certainly grinds people down when they see that they cannot do continuing professional development because there are three vacancies here and two vacancies there.  In any event, there is no real hard and fast policy for continuing professional development in the profession.  That is just not sustainable.</p></speech>

They do that completely at their own cost.  Other professions within the health service, which are not represented by this union, have better access to supports from their employer.  They are given time off and financial support to engage in continuing professional development.</p></speech>

They want to be valued, to have a work-life balance, to have proper career progression and to be valued within the health service.  It is not purely about pay.  Is that taken into account when recruitment takes place?  I know that this question has been answered, more or less.  I hear many people saying that they got a job, but they were not valued or taken into account when decisions on planning were being made.  Front-line staff are rarely consulted on how services should be planned.</p></speech>

Health and social care professionals would feel more valued if they were involved in the planning and delivery of health services.  They have a lot to contribute.  They feel they are not listened to when services are being developed.  That is a key thing.  They should be at the centre of service planning and delivery at all levels of the Department of Health and the HSE, etc.</p></speech>

We lose 7%, which is high.  The proximity of the UK system is a particular attraction for health and social care professionals.  It is a community-based model.  That is where the UK system excels.</p></speech>

With the exception of the hospital consultant grade, our grades have the highest rate of turnover.  This can be attributed to the fact that the community-based model in the UK places a much stronger emphasis on multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary working.  The staff in the UK feel more valued.  If we could introduce a proper system of mobility that would allow people to make progress in their careers in the geographical locations that suit them, we would see better career progression.  If this was accompanied by continuing professional development and the presence of an advocate in the Department of Health, staff would buy into the greater experience rather than focusing on the pay element.</p></speech>

There was a time when we would ask for a workforce planning sheet and be denied access to it.  That is about the level we are at.  When we look at the pressures on the health system, it is clear that a multi-annual budgeting and workforce planning arrangement is needed.  People in the union movement do not need to be workforce planners.  That is not our function.  The function of the people who plan the service is to act as workforce planners.  When the union is asked to give a commentary on some of the pressures on the health system, it needs to say that multi-annual workforce planning, based on where we want the health service to be four or five years from now, is a must.</p></speech>

I will ask one or two questions in respect of the recruitment of mental health services staff.  I may have spoken to our guests at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  Has there been any change in the recruitment process relating to mental health services in the past 12 to 18 months in the context of timelines, etc.?  Has there been any change regarding the flexibility of panels?</p> <p>  On Tusla, when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, Bernard Gloster referred to trying to appoint people to permanent posts.  Is any of that starting to happen in the mental health services area, particularly in circumstances where agency staff are employed?  Have there been any contract buy-outs or any attempts to convert temporary posts to permanent ones?  Where a person in the private sector is a contractor for six months or more, he or she is brought in as a permanent employee.  In the opinion of the witnesses, have there been any improvements in that regard?</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy to bear with me, the picture will become clear.  Some 100 people might have been placed on the 2016 panel and then supplementary panels might have been set up in 2017 and 2018, despite the fact that there were still people on the initial panel.  I refer back to points made before the Deputy arrived, namely, that people are using the recruitment process as a means of mobility within the system.  Let us say, for example, that I am a senior physiotherapist but  I still apply for placement on the panel.  I get onto the panel but am offered another.

The senior posts are those in respect of which one finds this happening in the most.  These are done as a national panel.  Let us say that I am a senior occupational therapist, OT, and I want to become a senior OT as a basic grade.  I see a national panel and I apply for it.  Equally, I am already a senior OT but want to move to a different area geographically and the only way I can do so is by applying for the national panel.  In 2016, in the case of 20-odd positions - we can share this information with the committee because the HSE has shared it with us - a great amount of work was done by the NRS to qualify 425 active candidates for an OT panel which ran for three years.  There are still 400 people on that panel because most of those who were offered jobs did not want them because they were not in the right geographical areas.  We were given figures at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which indicate that 50% to 60% of any panel at any time is made up of already established HSE staff.  From an administrative and resource point of view, a great amount of work goes into qualifying all of these people, when they do not really want to be on the relevant panel.  They want to be on transfer panels, which is understandable.  They are young, they qualify from college, they take their first jobs and they may want to move back home due to family commitments and all that goes with such commitments.  Following two extensions, the 2016 panel with the 425 qualified candidates on it expired on 10 October last.  Those 425 people are still looking to be moved around the country and they have nowhere to go.  They will start being reinterviewed next year in order to be placed on another panel.  A supplementary panel with 224 people on it now takes over.  The NRS will start working its way down through that, offering jobs to people because there is no geographical alignment.</p></speech>

The Bill was published on 21 November and, as Deputies are aware, concluded its passage through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il last week.  I welcome the support received in the House for the core principle of community rating, which is a long established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market.  This is a short and technical Bill comprising six sections, all focused on the specific issue of health insurance regulation.  The provisions outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market, as well as health insurance policies at an affordable price for all citizens, young or old and sick or healthy.</p> <p>  To support community rating, which is one of the fundamental principles of Irish health insurance, legislation is needed each year to update and revise the scheme that enables the sharing of risk across the insured population.  As part of the process, the Health Insurance Authority, which is the independent market regulator, carries out an annual evaluation of the market focused on the claims cost that every insurer has paid over the year.  Based on this analysis, the authority recommends the level of credits and stamp duties that should apply the following year in order that risk may be shared across the market and the principle of community rating is maintained.  The rates for next year recommended by the authority have been considered and accepted by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.  This year's Bill will provide for a general decrease in the credits across genders and age groups and there will be some changes in the stamp duty levies on contracts.</p> <p>  The stamp duty in respect of products providing advanced cover will be slightly increased by &euro;5 to &euro;449 per adult and by &euro;2 to &euro;150 per child.  The stamp duty in respect of products providing non-advanced cover will be reduced by &euro;20 to &euro;157 per adult and by &euro;7 to &euro;52 per child.</p> <p>  It is important to note there has been no increase in stamp duty on health insurance contracts for the past two years so this 1% increase for policyholders with advanced contracts is not only necessary to support more affordable policies for older and less healthy people but is also extremely modest as the first increase in three years, bearing in mind much more significant increases in years gone by.</p> <p>  As I have said, the Bill allows us to maintain our support for the core principle of community rating, which is a long-established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

People who take out private health insurance go through a checklist with the insurance company and are asked which tertiary hospital they are most likely to attend.  People like me from Roscommon will be asked whether we want to go to Galway or Dublin and a number of private hospitals are listed.  It has recently come to my attention that the insurance companies do not provide cover in all of the model 2 hospitals.  I can understand with regard to a model 4 hospital if people want expert care for a heart attack they are asked whether they would go to the Mater Hospital, the Beacon Hospital, the Galway Clinic or the Blackrock Clinic but the insurance companies should not refuse cover in small hospitals such as those in Ennis, Roscommon, Mallow or Bantry.  People should automatically get cover in these hospitals.</p> <p>  I presume the reason the insurance companies are selective is because there are expensive fees in some of the big private hospitals but there are standard charges for level 2 hospitals in the country.  We should be actively encouraging people to go into our level 2 hospitals because if they go to hospital in Bantry, Ennis, Nenagh or Roscommon it takes pressure off the model 3 and 4 hospitals throughout the country and takes pressure off our accident and emergency departments.  Admission charges for urgent care centres should be reduced to incentivise people to go to them rather than accident and emergency departments.  Every insurance company should be obliged to provide cover to the smaller local hospitals.</p> <p>  The reason this has come to my attention is a private patient who attended Roscommon hospital found out when the insurance claim went in that the policy did not cover the local hospital.  That person ended up having to pay.  This causes two problems.  People must pay out of their own pockets because they do not have the cover and they are discouraged from supporting their local hospital.  There is an anomaly that is being exploited by the insurance industry at present.  I am giving notice that I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage.  I hope that in advance of Report Stage this anomaly can be addressed in the short term.</p></speech>

I wish to seek clarification from the Deputy.  Is his issue that it is prescribed in the policy that people do not have cover in a level 2 hospital or is it that it is not obvious in the policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.791" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#B01600"><p>It is not obvious and it is with regard to named level 2 hospitals.  People have cover in some level 2 hospitals.  Why, for argument's sake, would people living in Roscommon have cover in Bantry hospital but not Roscommon hospital?  I cannot understand it.  There does not seem to be justification for it with regard to level 2 hospitals.  I fully understand why insurance companies would ask people whether they want cover in all of the more expensive high-level hospitals and what level of cover they want but local people are sometimes not being made aware of the fact that their own local hospital is not covered by the insurance policy.  It should not come down to people having to specifically name a hospital.  For example, if I am on holidays in west Cork, why should I not go to Bantry hospital rather than go to Cork where there will be problems in the accident and emergency department?  We should encourage people to use our level 2 hospitals as a policy decision by the Government.</p><p>Insurance companies should not discriminate against any level 2 hospital.  If we can get increased volumes of elective surgery in our small hospitals everyone benefits.  It makes no sense from a policy point of view and the insurance industry should not be allowed to exclude any level 2 hospital in terms of cover.  There is no justification for it.  The charges in the level 2 hospitals in Nenagh, Bantry and Roscommon are the same as in any other level 2 hospital because they are all HSE owned hospitals, not private hospitals.</p></speech>

This is the first I have heard of it but I will have my officials examine it between now and Report Stage, at which time I will have more extensive response for the Deputy.</p></speech>

I strongly support the views expressed by Deputy Naughten.  There should be no situation where the patient finds out after the event that he or she is not covered because the treatment was provided in a particular hospital.  The insurance companies need to make up their minds.  The patient is entitled to full information prior to treatment.  It should be clearly stated in the policy document that the patient is not covered for X, Y and Z if treated in a particular area.  The policy should also include a written explanation for that decision.</p></speech>

If the person's private insurance covers the charge in another level 2 hospital or a level 3 public hospital, why then should he or she be liable for the charge in a smaller hospital?  There should be no exclusions.  I can understand the differentiation in regard to the more expensive hospitals but I am speaking about small, local, public hospitals with a small number of private single rooms.  We should be encouraging people to use their local hospitals.  There should be across the board blanket cover on all of the level 2 hospitals because they are all public hospitals and that benefits our health service.</p></speech>

I again welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and I thank him for the briefing material which was received by the committee secretariat yesterday at 6 p.m.  I now invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.812" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#C02100"><p>I thank the select committee for the opportunity to bring this Supplementary Estimate for Vote 38 before it.  The total additional funding sought for 2019 is &euro;338.1 million, &euro;90 million of which relates to decisions made subsequent to the national service plan, including pay agreements, escalation of no-deal Brexit planning, winter planning and CervicalCheck.  The balance relates to the impact of the level of activity demand coming into 2019 and the continued growth in that demand during the year and the overrun in settlements by the State Claims Agency.</p><p>While the amount sought is significant in monetary terms it represents 2% of overall health expenditure in 2019.  The level of funding sought represents a significant improvement on previous years and is indicative of significant efforts undertaken to balance the service challenges in health with the priority of Government to maintain fiscal stability.  The enhanced focus on financial management in 2019 is particularly important given the uncertainties arising in regard to Brexit.  Over the past five years, the majority of additional health funding has been allocated to pay cost pressures associated with Government pay policy and to maintain existing levels of service, taking account of demographic changes.  These allocations are balanced with new developments, seeking to continuously improve the Irish health system.  In addition, the growing costs arising from pensions and the State Claims Agency must also be addressed.  </p><p>I will now set out the items which make-up this year's Supplementary Estimate.  In March, the Government agreed to the establishment of an <i>ex gratia</i>scheme for those affected by the non-disclosure of the CervicalCheck audit.  The scheme is designed to provide an alternative, non-adversarial and person-centred option for those affected by the CervicalCheck non-disclosure issue.  To date, 161 of the 221 cohort identified have made applications and all have been paid.  In addition, the CervicalCheck tribunal was set up in July to provide an alternative system for dealing with claims arising from CervicalCheck, reducing the adversarial nature of hearings for the women and families affected.</p><p>On pensions, for which &euro;24 million is sought, the budget allocation to cover superannuation costs in the HSE for 2019 is &euro;490 million, inclusive of the first charge from 2018 of &euro;24 million.  While expenditure on superannuation during 2018 has been broadly in line with expectation, there was no scope to offset the incoming first charge.  On the winter programme, &euro;26 million is sought for the 2019-20 winter plan, with additional funding for the 2020 impact included in the HSE's national service plan for 2020.  This funding is crucial to reducing overcrowding pressures in our hospitals and will deliver additional home care packages, transitional care beds, necessary aids and appliances and will allow for the activation of winter action teams to manage unscheduled care performance through various initiatives.  Demand for acute hospital services exceeded the resources available in 2018, resulting in the system entering 2019 at an expenditure level beyond the approved level of funding.  This was to be addressed through achieving affordable levels of staffing and other savings outlined in the service plan.  However, demand continued to grow in 2019 and this countered the impact of any targeted savings achieved and, along with the growth in costs associated with the management of antimicrobial resistance and infection control, contributed to the estimated funding shortfall by year end of &euro;50 million.</p><p>A further &euro;50 million is sought for disability services.  The deficit within disability services arises from demand for emergency placements, an increase in the provision of home support hours to help alleviate the urgent demand for placements, the changing needs of clients in receipt of services and regulatory compliance.  All such factors create significant pressures within disability services, resulting in considerable challenges in maintaining affordable levels of service.</p><p> A further &euro;43 million is sought for the nursing agreement.  It will assist with the recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives in the public health service.  Significant funding will be provided for a range of tangible and specific enhanced nursing practice measures, including an enhanced practice role for nurses and midwives, increases in allowances and an extension of a range of allowances.  The implementation of the framework on a safe staffing and skills mix is also a key to the agreement, and a &euro;5 million investment will be made to continue its implementation.  It is anticipated that the agreement will achieve savings through a reduction of agency spend where the framework is in place and through productivity measures in the new enhanced practice role.  The HSE has a detailed implementation plan in place and a report on all aspects of the agreement, including savings, should be available in the new year.</p><p> A further &euro;3 million is sought for the job evaluation scheme for support staff.  The funding will ensure that the relevant grades of support staff are uplifted to the recommended pay bands using the methodology and timeframes set out in the Labour Court recommendations.</p><p> The State Claims Agency has a statutory responsibility to manage claims to ensure that the State's liability under the clinical indemnity and the general insurance schemes, with their associated legal and other expenses, is contained at the lowest achievable level.  Its role also includes the successful recovery of costs from third parties.  The agency has informed the Department that, in actuarial terms, the clinical indemnity scheme, established in 2003, has yet to reach maturity and is not expected to plateau in respect of volume and cost of clinical claims until 2020 at the earliest.  We are informed that the increasing costs of the clinical indemnity scheme are not due to the increasing numbers of claims but rather to the increasing costs of awards and the high costs associated with catastrophic injury claims.  In addition, payments relating to historical Medical Defence Union, MDU, have to be taken into consideration.  Such payments arise due to an arrangement put in place in 2005 between the then Minister for Health and Children, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation to ensure that in the event of an adverse clinical incident involving medical negligence, no patient would be left uncompensated and no doctor who was a member of the MDU would be left without indemnity insurance cover in the event that the MDU refused to indemnify him or her.  Under the arrangement, a consultant can request the assistance of the Minister in meeting the cost of damages arising from a claim.  The State Claims Agency manages the claims.  Subsequently, in settlement of litigation related to indemnity cover, the MDU paid the State &euro;45 million.  Due to a recent High Court action that was settled, relating to an MDU case, a final lump sum payment of &euro;17.5 million will be paid out of the Department&rsquo;s Vote in early December.</p><p> A further &euro;13 million is sought for Brexit planning,  In 2019, the Department and the agencies under its aegis, in particular the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, were required to be proactive in preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit by ensuring that detailed contingency measures were in place.</p><p> A further &euro;157 million is sought or the primary care reimbursement service, &euro;77 million of which is to fund the 2018 first charge, with &euro;80 million to fund the 2019 current deficit, which was primarily driven by overruns in the high-tech arrangement and the long-term illness scheme.</p><p> A further &euro;45 million is sought for appropriations-in-aid.  They are received by Ireland from the UK in respect of health services provided under EU regulations.  Following discussions, a sum of &euro;270 million was agreed for 2019, a surplus of &euro;45 million over the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume, REV, amount.  The surplus will offset the gross supplementary requirement of &euro;383.1 million, resulting in a net Exchequer supplementary of &euro;338.1 million.</p><p> In summary, the Supplementary Estimate seeks to address the funding requirement arising from decisions made subsequent to the national service plan, particularly central wage agreements and shortfalls arising from increases in eligible demand for medications, access to overseas treatments and the overrun in settlements by the State Claims Agency.  The new leadership team in the HSE has succeeded in maintaining the additional pressures in the health sector at less than half the level of last year.  In addition, the new HSE governance board is in the final stages of preparing a 2020 national service plan with improved health services for citizens, without carrying over a large financial overhang from this year.  Since the Supplementary Estimate was presented to the Government, however, additional costs associated with the State Claims Agency and pensions have emerged.  Both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform were conscious that this was a possibility, given the inherent forecasting risks associated with the demand-led areas.  The additional costs arising in 2019 will result in a first charge in 2020, which is currently under discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the 2020 REV to ensure there will be no impact on the service level set out in the HSE's national service plan.</p><p> The issue of sustainable health funding is a major challenge, not just in Ireland but internationally.  Dealing with a growing and ageing population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs, and the increasing cost of health technology will continue to pose a financial challenge into the future.  Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a new roadmap to support the delivery of high-quality care to our citizens, improving the way services are organised and delivered, and reducing costs to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs must remain our focus.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service continue to demonstrate good practice by delivering the best healthcare within the significant level of resources made available by the Government for 2020.</p><p> I seek the committee's approval for the Supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>

On a serious note, I will start with the process.  The Minister of State, the Chairman, Deputy Durkan and I were in the House until 10 o'clock last night to vote.  The briefing, which is detailed and concerns almost &euro;500 million of taxpayers' money, was received at 6 p.m.  We in the committee started work at 9 o'clock this morning.  I was on my way back to the House at approximately 6 a.m.  When were we supposed to have time to interrogate a document concerning &euro;500 million of taxpayers' money, given that we received it at 6 o'clock last night, we worked in the House until after 10 o'clock, and the committee meeting started at 9 o'clock this morning?</p></speech>

I suspect it was a case of, "Events, dear boy, events."  Nevertheless, I take the Deputy's point on board and appreciate that it is frustrating to be given that amount of time.  Particular circumstances pertained to events in the House last night and members had to return to attend the meeting at 9 a.m. today.  I will take it on board and feed it back to the Department to ensure it will not happen again and that more time will be given.  I appreciate the seriousness of the issue to which the Deputy referred, namely, the Supplementary Estimate of approximately &euro;338 million to be approved at the meeting and the lack of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.816" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#D00400"><p>Last year, we received the briefing at 10 o'clock the night before.  The health service is running over to the tune of approximately &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million per year of taxpayers' money.  Men and women work their backsides off to earn the money in order that the State can pay it.  There is yet again a massive overspend.  The children's hospital is massively overspent.  It is the job of the Oireachtas to interrogate the money.  That is the job we are supposed to do today, but we received the information with zero time to interrogate it for the second year in a row.  That says a great deal about the level of financial management and the view from within the Government as to how seriously it takes oversight of taxpayers' money.  It is an outrageous insult to every person in the country who pays tax or uses the hospital system.</p> <p>  The money involved is not really &euro;338 million.  By my count, it is closer to &euro;456 million because the &euro;338 million includes a reduction of &euro;45 million, due to a contract negotiation with the UK Government over treatment abroad schemes.</p><p>It has nothing to do with the provision of services.  It is just an unexpected negotiating quirk and an accounting issue, which reduces the total amount required but does not reduce the amount overspent.  When the additional &euro;45 million is added back in to try to get to the overspend one gets the &euro;383 million.  Then there is the extraordinary line of &euro;73 million which is also taken off the overspend for what they call time-related savings.  I was curious to understand, in the limited time we had to interrogate the documents, what time-related savings are.  It sounds like a good thing, that we have managed to reduce the overspend by &euro;73 million through such savings.  What it actually means is things that were meant to be done this year that did not happen.  Going through the document, page 6 refers to the &euro;73 million and says that time-related savings happen because facilities open later than they are supposed to, because negotiations to buy things take longer than they should and recruitment into designated roles does not happen as quickly as it should.  That &euro;73 million is, therefore, due to not doing things that the health service was meant to do and has nothing to do with the overspend.  One must then add that figure back in.  When the accounting quirk with the British Government is removed along with the item that is not a saving at all but is just not doing things on time, the overspend for running the show is north of &euro;450 million.</p><p> Before we get into the detail, then, I have a question.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, said that the overrun in health this year and in previous years is so big that it threatens the entire financial picture and the financial stability of the country.  It has done some very useful analysis on the overruns and their figures, not mine, are as follows: in 2005, the overspend was zero and there was no conversation on overruns; between 2006 and 2010, inclusive, it was also zero; between 2011 to 2013, inclusive, it started to increase to &euro;200 million, &euro;250 million, &euro;300 million; and for the past few years it has been averaging &euro;500 million a year.  The current Minister came into office in 2016.  Between 2015 and this year, the combined overrun is &euro;2.3 billion.  One question this committee must grapple with is how year after year, despite multi-billion euro increases to the health budget beyond anything that has ever been seen here or  in other countries, waiting lists are getting longer?  How is the Government spending more money at a phenomenal rate, up from about &euro;12.5 billion in 2014 or 2015 to &euro;18 billion next year but everything is getting so much worse so quickly for so many people?  Part of the answer is the overruns.  When one starts adding up &euro;500 million a year one gets to several billion euro that is expended on plugging gaps in places, not on service provision.  Before we get into the detail, what was going on that for the first five or six years of the HSE there were no overruns, then from 2011 they were modest and now we are up to annual averages of &euro;500 million?  </p></speech>

We can keep turning the figures and presenting them in different ways but that is what I am seeking approval for.  I do not want to muddy those waters.  I have outlined that &euro;115 million relates to an overspend from last year which I inherited this year and approximately &euro;90 million relates to decisions taken since.  That is either a prerogative that the Oireachtas would like to retain or we can absolve ourselves of.  I refer particularly to issues on which the Deputy was extraordinarily animated such as increasing pay for nursing staff - a political decision that was taken outside of the projections in last year's national service plan - and the CervicalCheck <i>ex gratia</i>scheme.  That &euro;90 million resulted from political decisions taken by the Oireachtas and the Minister during that period.  As long as that facility is available, there will always be potential for an overrun.  We can have a debate over whether the Oireachtas should not have any say in the running of the health service and it should be as it is projected in 2019 or 2020 at the beginning of the year and we can accept that, but we cannot have it both ways.</p><p>The Deputy asked about the general overrun.  I cannot answer historically for the HSE about what happened in 2005 or 2006.  I was a county councillor at that time and had no involvement whatever in national politics.  I was a member of the regional health forum and that was as much input as I had into the health service then.  In general, as the Deputy knows well, it is a demand-led scheme.  Much of the money is spent on pay, on which there are many pressures and demands.  Politicians, from all sides, continuously demand pay increases and demand that we pay the people who work in the health service better.  It returns to my point that we can stick rigidly to the budgets.  I was here this time last year when there was an overspend of &euro;655 million.  We do not agree that is acceptable, we do not want that level of an overspend in the HSE, it is not our ambition and we are not satisfied with it.  To be fair to Paul Reid and his team in the HSE, and the team in the Department, I am here with an overrun of &euro;338 million rather than &euro;655 million.  That is not where we want to be but it is progress.</p></speech>

No one has suggested that we seek not to be able to add things to the budget but, as he said, that amount is &euro;90 million.  If he was here looking for the &euro;90 million that the Oireachtas agreed for extra services, that would be fine but that is not what this is.  It is &euro;90 million of a &euro;450 million overspend so the measures that the Oireachtas sought account for one fifth of the total overspend; it is the other four fifths with which there are issues.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State was not a Member between 2006 and 2009, inclusive, but for five or six years there were no overspends and in the time that he has been here and in a ministerial role the overspends have been approximately &euro;500 million.  It seems reasonable that anyone in a ministerial role when overspends were that high would look back to the period when the overspends were zero and have a view and would have asked officials to run the numbers to see why.  It is reasonable to expect the Minister of State and the Minister to have a considered answer to that because therein might lie some of the ways by which we deal with the overruns.</p> <p>  There seems to be an absence of performance metrics.  Some are detailed but quite a few are not.  In acute hospitals, for instance, it says the money needs to go here and there.</p><p>Can the Minister of State explain why there are no desired performance outcomes accompanying a request for very large amounts of taxpayers' money?</p></speech>

If the Deputy wishes to use the figure of &euro;456 million, he must accept that &euro;115 million comes from 2018.  I have already outlined how the sum of &euro;90 million was allocated at the discretion of the Oireachtas, as Deputy Donnelly and I agreed.  That leaves a figure of approximately &euro;275 million.  That is not where we want to be.  I would prefer not to be before the committee looking for that additional money.  However, I have to make the point that last year the comparable figure was &euro;655 million.  That was not acceptable either and two wrongs do not make a right, but we have moved significantly.  It is not possible due to a range of pressures such as central wage agreements, pensions issues such as changes to pension-related deduction, PRD scales, the cost of drugs and medicines that become available at any one time-----</p></speech>

The specific question is this.  There are no performance outcomes associated with these figures.  For example, a very large number is quoted for the drug reimbursement scheme.  I will try to find the number.  As I said, we only got this late last night.  However, no reasons are given.  The number is in the tens of millions.  Some &euro;85 million of the primary care reimbursement scheme funds is for high-tech drugs.  This document does not specify what drugs are being covered and why.  Is the Minister of State looking for an extra &euro;85 million because the forecast was wrong, or because certain high-tech drugs were okayed whose approval was not forecast?  Alternatively, are we paying a higher price than was forecast?  Why are we paying &euro;85 million?</p></speech>

I must clarify that I needed to make some of those broader points in response to the Deputy's points.  There is an onus on me to respond.  I note that the HSE manages the health service.  Neither I nor the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, manages the health service.  That is the HSE's responsibility.  Some of the questions Deputy Donnelly is asking would be more appropriately directed to the HSE.  It has a quarterly meeting with the Oireachtas committee next week.  The Deputy will be able to pursue some of the detail which I do not have in discussions with management.  I am discussing headline figures within a &euro;17 billion budget.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about drugs and gave the figure of &euro;85 million.  The actual reimbursements for high-tech drugs during the period from June to October 2019 were higher than expected.  This was primarily driven by higher reimbursements for rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology drugs.  High-tech drugs reimbursements are now forecast at &euro;797.9 million, which is &euro;94.9 million higher than the original 2019 budget. </p></speech>

I will not make a long statement.  The Minister of State is seeking &euro;157 million in additional funding from the Oireachtas.  I know the Minister of State did not write this, but his officials have provided two sentences with no detail.  That certainly does not strike me as proper governance, and I doubt it strikes the Minister of State that way.  This is not really a matter for the quarterly review.  This meeting is the moment to interrogate requests for extra money.  A two-sentence explanation provided the night before falls a long way short of what we should expect to justify an extra &euro;157 million for drugs.</p></speech>

Otherwise there is no sense in some of the rest of us coming in until the Opposition is finished.  I could come back tomorrow.  If the Chair gives me notice I will be quite happy to do that.</p> <p>  I want to draw attention to some of the fallacies in my colleague's remarks.  We have had a long debate about various new medicines becoming available.  There has been a strong debate in the House and outside of it, and we all know the demands that have been made in the course of the last year.  They are legitimate demands.  We have to listen to them and take them on board.  We also have to take on board the concerns of the patients and families who depend on these innovative medicines and are hoping for a reimbursement programme.  There is no sense in coming here at the end of the year and asking what all that was about, where it came from and what has gone wrong because we did not think about it before.  That is not acceptable behaviour at all.  This is nonsensical stuff.  We are having a debate that we should not have at all.  It is a waste of time.  We are returning to every item of expenditure on the basis that the children's hospital overrun is causing all the problems.  It is not.  If people had followed the debate that has taken place in this country in the past three years they would not have to ask those questions.  It is misleading to the general public to pretend that this is the answer to all their prayers.  If people want to say that we should not continue with the new children's hospital, by all means let them say it.  Let them embrace that ideology.  Let them come forward with it.  That puts an end to the debates.  They can then spend all the money that was going to be spent on the children's hospital elsewhere, provided, of course, that it meets the criteria.  However, fantasising in the committee or in the House about where money should be spent after it has been spent is a waste of time, energy and resources. </p> <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has opined on this issue.  That is correct.  I have listened to its opinions repeatedly.  The council has a job to do and I fully respect the need to stay within budget insofar as it is possible.  I suggest its officials should go to the hospitals and ask the patients on waiting lists and their families what should be done in respect of A, B, C or D as it affects them.  It is about time that we copped ourselves on.  We must get away from repeating colourful nonsense in the media.  I am not interested in that sort of thing.  I want to see something done directly about the subject in question.  There is a flaw in the system.  We need to identify a contingency sum in the health Estimates on an annual basis, one that is sufficient to meet the projected overrun in demand.</p> <p>  I note the figures for 2012, 2013 and 2014 as compared with 2007.  There was a vast difference in circumstances.  The country was broke in 2007 and it was very easy to come up with an Estimate that fell within the required levels, even though achieving that level left the country even more broke.  We have a situation now where we have to anticipate the growth in demand facing the system.  The health service is a demand-led service.  We have to make up our minds in this committee, in the House and in the debate nationally.  What do we want to do about it?  Do we intend to make a cool, calm and collected decision about what is required to run the services at the beginning of the year, given the number of imponderables likely to come before us?  The Chair has spoken about this, as we all have.  We need to cut out the pretence and actually identify it.  I believe that we should be budgeting for a higher level of excess expenditure, for want of a better description, in order to cater for the continuity of the services throughout the year.</p> <p>  There are two groups of people who can deal with that.  They are the managers of the system and the economists of the system.  There are those who will say that over the years economists have strangled the health services, that their activity and inactivity in other areas have caused problems for the patients and the general population.  We have to deal with that.  We have to establish the level of growth.  To put that in context, members should think of the number of people who left the country in the period from 2005 to 2014.  In the latter part of that period there was no money in the country to pay for anything.  We must compare like with like.  It is utterly outlandish for any spokesperson for any party, Government or Opposition, to pretend that if we curtailed expenditure on the children's hospital we would somehow solve all our problems.  We would not.  We have a budgetary problem that needs to be addressed.  The current budgetary problem is the annual budget for a Department.  This is one of those Departments.  It is the one Department where outlay is determined by demand.  We either meet the demand or we do not.  I ask that we confine ourselves to those areas, because they are important.  </p> <p>  I wish to mention another area that comes to mind.  I will address these points collectively.  I will not go through them individually.  I read them insofar as I could and I had the same difficulty.  I was travelling yesterday and I did not get the chance to read them.  I must say this.</p><p>The mental health services are still the Cinderella of the system.  For example, it is impossible to get treatment for a child who is in need of a programme in any service at the current time.  It cannot be done.  People are admitted to the accident and emergency departments of general hospitals and spend the whole day there, but there is nowhere to go.  There are no beds and no permanent programmes.  There are permanent programmes in place to deal with drug addiction and other health matters, but there are no programmes for mental health patients, especially children, who require attention of an ongoing nature as well as treatment and care under supervision outside and inside of a family setting. </p><p> In the course of the preparation of the Estimates, I ask the Minister to outline to what extent attention was given to that area.  It needs attention.  I know of a child who was waiting for 12, 14, 18 or 20 hours on a trolley in an adult hospital, having been diagnosed four years ago as being in need of urgent attention and a programme.  The child has failed to get access to a programme from any agency, such as Linn Dara, St. John of God's and so on, for a variety of reasons.  However, it all comes down to one thing, namely, the availability of a necessary framework and structure to accommodate that patient. </p><p> Can we be assured that there is something to deal with that within the Estimates this year?  Whatever happened before was not sufficient.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.849" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#G01900"><p>I thank the Chairman and Deputy Durkan for his contribution.  I accept the point he made about projections and building in a bit of overhead room for contingency planning.  It is a very reasonable and valid point.  It could probably be calculated to a degree actuarially because it is a demand-led service.  Increasing numbers of people are attending accident and emergency departments and so on.  I could speak at length about the changing goalposts.  What the Deputy said is that there should perhaps be a contingency fund, which is a valid and sound point, rather than having a debate every year about overruns.  We will focus relentlessly on that overrun and that has been the priority for the Government and the HSE for the year, with some degree of success.  Others may have different views on that.</p> <p>  The Deputy's substantive point was on mental health, an area very close to my heart and for which I have responsibility.  I am quite happy to engage with him on that.  It is difficult to comment on an individual case for obvious reasons and I do not know the background to the case to which he referred.  </p> <p>  On the overall issue of accommodation for young people in mental health units in the country, only three counties in Ireland have inpatient beds for young people, namely, Dublin, Cork and Galway.  These figures have not been verified, but this year there were in the region of 300 admissions to inpatient units for young people and teenagers.  </p> <p>  I visited Linn Dara in Dublin recently.  What it is doing is particularly impressive.  It has developed a high dependency unit which is working well.  It is also dealing with eating disorders in young people, which are very difficult and challenging for the system because there are young people in acute hospital beds who are medically unwell while also being mentally unwell.  Linn Dara is treating such patients very successfully.  It has had in the region of 110 admissions this year, which is a significant increase on last year.  It has also had a significant increase in the number of discharges, which is very important.  </p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to young people in adult settings.  The numbers have reduced significantly this year, which I am glad to see, in particular in the second half of the year.  This is due to the very good work being done by Linn Dara, which has reduced the reliance on young people being admitted to adult wards.  There will also be a certain cohort of young people admitted to those wards, because of geography and the fact that parents may make a choice that they do not want to go to Dublin, Cork or Galway.  As I have said, a 17 year old may be very strong and, therefore, be better off in an adult ward, rather than a ward for young people, even though the arbitrary age for such a ward is 18 years.  We acknowledge that there are situations where there is no capacity, but they are reducing in frequency thanks to the good work of Linn Dara.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about the consideration given in the preparation of Estimates to mental health for young people, in particular.  There are 70 community CAMHS teams and last year we created a lower level of infrastructure, namely psychology services, in the community.  There are now 130 psychologists and assistant psychologists specifically for young people and a phone line was developed, which was launched last week, to direct people to the appropriate services available.  </p> <p>  When we started our research, we found almost 1,100 mental health services were being funded by the HSE.  However, people are not being appropriately referred, and either do not know where services are located or cannot find them.  People are not always in a position to go to a GP, for financial or time reasons, to find out where to access services.  The phone line is a significant development in terms of creating a more appropriate referral pathway.  </p> <p>  The waiting lists for the 70 community CAMHS teams was 2,500 in January, but had reduced to 2,000 by October, a reduction of 20%.  I hope there will be a 25% reduction by year end.  That is a direct result of the introduction of psychologist and assistant psychologist services at community level the length and breadth of the country.  The better way forward is early intervention and allowing people to access services sooner because there can be continual escalation of issues if people's mental health is not treated in a timely manner.  I hope the change to waiting lists for community CAMHS teams for young people is sustainable.  As Deputy Durkan knows, our ambition is to treat people in the community and give them the best services there.  In the 1960s, there were 20,000 inpatient psychiatric beds in Ireland, but today there are just over 1,000.  We have moved significantly away from inpatient beds, but there will always be a cohort of people who will require inpatient treatment.  Portrane is being developed and will open in the coming year - the keys will be handed over in the next month or two.  The number of beds in the Central Mental Hospital will increase from 120 to 170, a number of which are for young people.  We will have increased capacity for CAMHS patients and teenagers.  Mental health is very much a consideration in our budgetary planning for the year ahead.</p></speech>

The overspend this year is &euro;338 million, going on the figures provided, compared to &euro;655 million last year.  The Department of Health is getting closer to remaining within budget.  Of course, we understand it is a demand-led service and an aging and growing population will place more demands on it.  When the new CEO of the HSE took up office in May, one of his first priorities was to try to keep within budget.  This may be a reflection of the efforts he has made.  There is a balance between supplying a service and staying within budget.</p><p>There is much unmet need with respect to waiting lists, access to hospital services, outpatient services and waiting for elective care.  Remaining within budget has an effect on unmet need so how does the Minister of State see that panning out over the next year if the 2020 budget is to remain on target?  Will this adversely affect unmet need because waiting lists are not improving substantially?  They are increasing instead.  How will this be balanced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.852" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#H00200"><p>It is a very fair, important and interesting question.  The Chairman will appreciate that the answer is not simple.  There is a continuous challenge to keep a healthy tension between the pull and drag in this.  We cannot have an open door, with money for everything, in a demand-led service.  We have to achieve a scenario such as that driven by the chief executive officer, which is to get people to live within their budget.  That is all part of the drive coming from the political side to not have overruns.  We cannot on one side tell the chief executive officer that he must meet every demand and deliver every service looked for while at the same time telling him he cannot come back to look for more money.</p> <p>  On one side there are Government and Opposition Deputies saying there cannot be an overrun and the chief executive is doing his job in telling every health manager under his remit that we need to live within budget and if more is needed at the end of the year, a conversation can be had on the amount.  On the other hand, there is the issue raised by the Chairman, as patients are real people.  They are our mothers, daughters, sisters, brothers, grannies and other loved ones.  If we see them on trolleys etc., we are given a challenging pause for thought.  There is much more to this system than just money and that is where we can bring in Sl&aacute;intecare's move away from the current process.  Any additional euro we are putting into the system, such as with the nursing wage increases, are negotiated with respect to process, change and better productivity, with more efficiencies and an increase in capacity in our health care system.  That can be done and there are initiatives such as the lean sigma programme.  I have referred to Sl&aacute;intecare and the Chairman is well aware of the GP contract.  There is also care of patients with the likes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other chronic illnesses in the community, which is a better way.</p> <p>  This is about achieving efficiencies that increase capacity in the system.  There is a healthy tension that will continue and must be maintained.  We cannot just say that we will give everybody what they need but we must continue to monitor the finances.  We are dealing with real people and patients and getting that balance right is not an easy call.  There must be structural and procedural change.  We must look at how we do what we do and find better ways of doing it.  This can only be brought about by having this kind of tension and attention to finances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.853" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#H00300"><p>There are specific items in the Estimates.  There is the treatment abroad scheme and the cross-border directive process, which are demand-led schemes.  There is increased allocation for those, and the treatment abroad scheme is used because people cannot get treatment here in a timely manner so they go to another jurisdiction.  It is an area that could be addressed with more efficient service so people would not find it necessary to go abroad.  It should be dealt with through the budget for our services here.</p> <p>  There is also the question of the State Claims Agency and the increasing amount paid out in claims against the State.  It is again probably a reflection of the pressure the health system is under that there are so many claims against the State.  I believe there is contingency for future claims of &euro;1 billion, although I am not quite sure if that is the correct figure.  How can the Department and the HSE deal with those additional demands?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.854" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#H00400"><p>They are both very pertinent and obvious in looking at the Estimates.  We can see there are two pinch points that have been identified very astutely by the Chairman.  They are recognised readily.  I agree with the Chairman that they need continued focus.  The first is the cross-border scheme and it relates to capacity in our system.  We can keep purchasing the services where there is capacity or we could use that money to invest in infrastructure.  To its credit, the HSE has opened an additional cataract theatre in Nenagh this year, as the Chairman knows.  Waiting lists for that treatment have decreased significantly, and numbers have almost halved.  I do not have the figures off the top of my head but we will have them for next week's quarterly meeting.  The numbers have been significantly reduced because of the additional capacity.  There could be further capacity and we might be better off spending &euro;2 million, &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million on a new theatre as opposed to spending that money in other ways.  People are waiting for the treatment today, however, and a theatre takes a year to come on stream.  It is about getting that balance right.</p> <p>  I mentioned in my opening comments that the number of claims to the State Claims Agency is not rising, which is interesting, and an increase in awards is driving up the figures.  Every day we get up our first priority is patient safety and we must continue to drive that agenda from every aspect of the health service.  It is ultimately the best way to deal with this.  In tandem with this, the level of awards, which is outside of my direct jurisdiction, is an issue across the board in society.  It is being addressed currently.</p></speech>

There are always external factors that can catch us, such as the State Claims Agency.  Something like that could leave us with an overhang or well above projections but we do not anticipate the day to day or bread and butter work of the HSE in delivering services will leave an overhang with respect to the service plan.  External factors such as the State Claims Agency or the cross-border process are a bit beyond our control.</p></speech>

One of the matters raised by consultant representative bodies when coming before the committee is the lack of training posts.  As a result of the loss of experienced medical people to other jurisdictions and the reliance on locums, we now have the potential for a legacy issue as approximately half our non-hospital consultant doctors are not in training posts.  We do not have expertise in the pipeline.  I am particularly concerned about it because we have said so many times that it is not just money that gets people back but rather conditions.  We discussed the children's hospital here last week and we hope it will be the best children's hospital in the world so we can attract the best people to work in it.  I have concerns on how we will staff it with respect to junior doctors and training programmes.  Is there anything the Minister of State can tell us today that will address the matter so that in 2022 we will have the best doctors to treat our children when this much-needed hospital is eventually built, despite many people's best efforts to not have it built?</p> <p>  The treatment abroad fund is very helpful to people who are waiting a long time for treatment but there are administrative costs borne here in our regular budget.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is separate.  Without oversimplifying the matter, it is not as simple as sending a patient abroad and we never see him or her again once he or she is fixed up.  There is still an administrative burden here.  The information from abroad must be sown into the system.  It is a good idea but I get alarmed every year at the increase in budget.  It is good because we are treating more people but I would prefer to treat them at home and they should be in our system.  There has been a year-on-year increase over the past number of years so how will we try to reverse this so we can have our people treated in our hospitals by our doctors?</p> <p>  With regard to the State Claims Agency, we had the CervicalCheck scandal this year and it had a large cost arising from administration and insurance payouts.</p><p>I understand the weight of the claims are predominantly based in the obstetrics and gynaecology area.  While it is great to have a large budget of &euro;1 billion or whatever it is, no money will ever pay for a catastrophic incident at birth.  While it is great to have the money there, my preference would be to have no budget for claims against the State, just as with the NTPF, because we would not have any claims and we would not send people abroad.  As we try to address legacy issues from the recession and the impacts they have had on staff quotas, staff morale and the loss of expertise, how can we get our act together to move out of the recession period and repair our health system to serve people with the benefits of modern medicine, demographic pressures and so on?  How will that be managed in the future?  I acknowledge that is a broad question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.862" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#J00200"><p>I will do the best I can.  We will have the quarterly meeting with the committee next week so there may be some more extensive responses available to the Deputy at that stage and that might provide a better opportunity to put questions to the HSE and so on.</p> <p>  The consultants and skilled staff issue is an important topic that gets a lot of attention and focus in the Department.  We want to ensure that, as the Deputy said, when we build the children's hospital, we can address that.  I have the same issue in my portfolio in that the new central mental hospital is due to open next year and we want to ensure we have the requisite number of consultants.  The Deputy began by asking about training posts.  That is something I had occasion to look into recently as well and I am glad that there has been a significant increase in my area in funding next year for higher specialist training that is necessary to work at consultant level.  I do not have the numbers to hand but the numbers being trained have increased across the board year on year and more funding will be provided next year again in a number of pinch point areas where there is a deficiency.  We are also looking to the challenge whereby consultants can move on after their training and we are competing with the global market and that is linked to terms and conditions.  The children's hospital and the central mental hospital in Portrane will be two state-of-the-art environments for people to work in and be part of.  That environment is a help.</p> <p>  Significant progress has been made on a number of outstanding issues relating to consultants in the past 12 to 18 months but some issues remain that we would all like addressed and we are trying to get to those remaining issues on a piece by piece basis, notwithstanding what we have achieved in negotiations with consultants on their conditions.  The training of advance nurse practitioners, ANPs, across all skill sets is highly important as well.  That is a positive development in the health system that offers enormous potential and, again, they work well in my area.  They call ANPs physician assistants in the US where there is another level below the consultant level but above hospital doctor level.  We have a lot of work to do in Sl&aacute;intecare to look at identifying the skill set and the skill match.  A great deal of work is being looked at in the framework in order that we can meet those demands but that is an ongoing challenge.</p> <p>   I concur with the Deputy on the cross-border scheme.  I would prefer if we had the capacity here to treat our own patients but under EU law every EU citizen has a right to travel for healthcare if they so wish, if the treatment they need is not available in their area and we have obligations in that regard.  It works both ways.  I recall a meeting with the head of the police in Dubai.  They are anxious to work with us again as they have been availing of coronary care in Ireland.  Any members of the Dubai police force who require coronary care and heart procedures are sent to Ireland.  That is obviously not covered by the EU directive because the United Arab Emirates is not in the EU and they are using private hospitals so they are not causing a blockage.  People will always travel for healthcare.  I would prefer us to have increased capacity but the difficulty is that the money being spent on that scheme could build additional capacity but that lifeline cannot be cut off.  It would be illegal to do so.  People have to have the right to migrate.</p></speech>

It will always be a case that where humans are delivering a service, there will be error.  Until such a time that we reach a 100% robotic delivery of a healthcare system, there will be no scenario in which mistakes are eliminated but they can be significantly reduced with better conditions and a better physical environment.  All those matters are improving bit by bit and we have increased capacity but there is no silver bullet for that challenge.</p></speech>

I refer to the issue of recruitment embargoes or freezes or to the practice of only employing staff within available resources or budget allocations.  It can be counter-intuitive that by limiting staff or freezing recruitment, money is saved.  Of course money is saved in one budgetary silo but patients generally do not go away and, therefore, if they are not getting service, they will either get it elsewhere in the emergency department or they will deteriorate and require more complex treatment when they eventually get treatment.  If there is a limitation on staffing levels, that does not necessarily mean money is being saved.  Money may just be transferred to a different budget that providers for more urgent or complex treatment instead.  We have been looking at workforce planning in recent months and we have had many different groups before the committee.  The consistent message from all of them is that failing to recruit or staff to an appropriate level is costing additional money and no money is being saved.  Does the Minister of State have a view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.868" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019120400002#J00800"><p>I believe personally, politically and professionally that if we always do what we always did, we will always get what we always got.  If we continue to keep hiring and throwing more money at the problem, we will not fix the healthcare system and I am not suggesting the Chairman is proposing we do that.  The other extreme is not to hire any more staff so there is a balance to be struck between those two positions.  I spoke earlier about the constant tension between the desire to continue to recruit and looking at what we have done.  It is about reorganising healthcare delivery and the budgets.  We are here as politicians and one day we are giving out about an overrun and the next, we will give out that the service is not there and so on.  How do we fix that?  It is about structural reform.  The regional integrated care organisations, RICOs, are an important development as opposed to the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, because it was maddening to see people in the community considered not to be part of the problem if they were on a trolley or on a hospital bed for an extra week.  That did not bother the people in the community who were in charge of home help in the slightest because if one person was in the hospital, that was one less person for them to take care of.  That siloing we did in healthcare was not helpful with budgeting.  We can continue with additional recruitment in acute healthcare but we could look at more proactive ways and means of avoiding admissions to acute healthcare.  Perhaps there should be more recruitment for community healthcare.  Recruitment in and of itself is a solution but it is not the solution to everything.  Putting a cap on it is about getting people to work within the budget they have so they cannot have an open-ended budget.  Otherwise, we will be back here again next year looking for an &euro;800 million Supplementary Estimate</p></speech>

We had evidence from a consultant a number of weeks ago to the effect that if the number of consultants in rheumatology, for instance, was increased from two to four or from one to two, the waiting list would dramatically drop for that service.  I refer to that targeted recruitment, not just recruiting for recruitment's sake.  Where there is a bottleneck in a service, targeted recruitment improves the outcomes and reduces the waiting lists.  That is the type of recruitment I am speaking of because that then leads to better outcomes and probably saves money in the end.</p></speech>

It is about getting the balance right through continued recruitment and finding better ways of providing services.  It is a combination of both.  I take the Chairman's point.  Of course, targeted recruitment will continue for the year ahead.</p></speech>

How can the waiting lists be dealt with?  It is not rocket science.  If we have a waiting list of 1,000, we should be able to figure out how long it will take to deal with it.  This is where the planning comes in.  Where are the deficiencies that prevent us dealing with that waiting list now?  If we cannot deal with that waiting list within a specified period, we should know the specified period within which it should be dealt with and we can then do the budget again.  If we cannot do both and identify exactly what is required, the waiting lists will go on forever.  If a waiting list is half a mile long this year, it will be two miles long next year because we will have not shortened it.  The only way to deal with that is to attack it from all ends together.  If that means reverting to the treatment purchase scheme or the private sector, we need to deal with it.  There is no good talking about it.</p> <p>  I recently came across a case where the patient was due to come back in two or three years because the condition was supposedly controllable or containable.  It was not and I was proved right.  If we are telling patients things like that, we are reducing public confidence in the system.  I do not attribute blame to anybody in particular, but we all need to recognise it.  It is no good talking around the subject; we need to deal with the subject.</p> <p>  Just as in the PC sum to deal with unforeseen issues that come up during the year that we have to deal with - we have to deal with emergencies anyway - we should also draw up a plan to tackle the logjams.  It is a farce to have people hanging around in emergency departments all day long and the following day.  We have older people sitting on trolleys for two or three days.  We should not be dealing with that at all.  It is demoralising.  Why do we not have a bed to put them into?</p> <p>  Earlier today we had a discussion with representatives from F&oacute;rsa on step-down beds.  There are step-down beds for women in St. Brigid's Hospital in Crooksling and the Government is closing the place on the basis that the facilities there are old.  They are not old; all they need is ongoing maintenance.  Such facilities could come on-stream to relieve the pressure we are now facing.</p> <p>  We need to look again at how we are doing it.  If we put one doctor into a hospital emergency department and leave him there for three or four days, I guarantee that he will be out the door and down the road after a week.  It is not possible for one person to deal with full weight of the demand at any given time.  We need a relief system and we must be prepared to recognise that that will arise.</p> <p>  People will claim that I am speaking like an Opposition Member.  I am speaking as I have always spoken, as a member of any health committee or body; I have been on a few of them over the years.  There is no difficulty dealing with the political element, which means nothing in terms of a contribution to alleviating the problems that now assail the health services.  To lift that siege, we need to be able to reassure people with a plan for reducing waiting lists in the coming year.</p> <p>  The IFAC needs to know that as well.  I do not propose to take on the council because I know where we went in the past.  However, it needs to take into account those areas of current expenditure where we need to deal with the size of the problem as it arises.  The result is we do not do anything about it in which case the service becomes run down.</p> <p>  Ireland is the third most expensive of the OECD countries and 27th in public satisfaction ratings.  There is something wrong there.  I do not know what the problem is.  I am not an expert in these issues.  I do not need to be an expert, nor does anybody else.  However, somebody somehow and somewhere needs to say, "Okay, we're going to merge these two areas.  We are going to deal with them.  We are going to identify the contributory causes."  We are continuously told about the Dutch and Swedish models.  They do not work, for God's sake; they have the same problems.</p> <p>  It all comes back to identifying the scale of the issue in a service that cannot be postponed forever.  If it was a road building project, it could be postponed, but when somebody's health is at issue, it cannot be postponed.  Doing nothing scares the public and demoralises those involved in the service.  It avoids facing the decision that has to be taken eventually to deal with the patient.</p></speech>

The politics is one side of it.  To use a medical analogy: we can treat the symptom or treat the cause.  Much of the time our energy and money is focused on treating the symptoms and not the cause.  The Deputy referred to access to care.  In 2020, we will to publish an access plan for unscheduled care looking at how we can deal with this issue.</p> <p>  Talking about the politics of it and politicians, a few months ago a lady approached me.  She said she had been out of work for a year and a half because of an injured shoulder and was now fit to go back to work.  She needed to be signed back on by her consultant.  She rang the consultant's office to find out if she could see him.  He told her he would see her in 2021.  She told me she did not want to draw disability allowance for the next 18 months or two years, while waiting to see a consultant for five minutes to sign her back to work.  She asked if I, as a Minister of State, could so anything for her.</p> <p>  I wrote to the consultant and asked if there was any possibility he could see this lady for five minutes.  He wrote back to me saying that he would not discuss any of his patients with me and suggested it was more in my line, as a Minister of State, to provide more money.  That shows what happens when people look to politics to solve these problems.  There are structural issues.  I tell that story for two reasons.  One is to illustrate the Deputy's point about the politics of it.  More important, it is to look at how we fix the structure.</p> <p>  In one particular discipline in the south of the country, I have sought information from the HSE through the Secretary General of my Department on the time each of the consultants in this discipline is giving to private and public practice.  There are enormous anomalies in the one I am looking at.  These consultants were contracted by the State and are supposed to be spending a certain amount of their time delivering to the public.  These are issues affecting waiting lists because they are all on the public side.  Obviously, on the private side there is no waiting list and a patient can be rushed through and there are incentives for people.  I am not saying that is widespread, but I have come across one area where it is certainly an issue and I am doing further investigating to try to get to the bottom of it where there is a particularly long waiting list.</p> <p>  Structural reforms like that will fix it as well as just policy and, as the Deputy would suggest himself, not soundbites.</p></speech>

The purpose of this morning's engagement is to discuss the issue of citizenship rights in the North of Ireland in light of the recent ruling of an upper immigration tribunal in the case of Ms Emma DeSouza.  We are joined by Emma DeSouza and I want to extend a very warm welcome to her on behalf of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  She is accompanied this morning by Professor Colin Harvey, who is very welcome back before the committee, and by Ms Una Boyd of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ.  The witnesses are all very welcome here.  I will shortly invite you to make your opening statements in the order in which I have introduced you.  Before I give the privilege reminder, I wish to encourage our witnesses and anyone in the Visitor's Gallery to please switch off their mobile phones as they interfere with the recording equipment.</p> <p>  I must draw the attention of our witnesses to the situation in relation to privilege.  Please note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and of the Houses should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I would now like to invite Ms DeSouza to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.884" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma DeSouza" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019120400002#C00300"><p>I would like to begin by thanking the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for having me here today and for the opportunity to speak about our case.  I am an Irish citizen.  It is not a choice or a decision I made; it is simply who I am.  I have not held a British passport or claimed British citizenship and yet I have found myself in an unprecedented situation.  In 2015 when I married my American husband Jake, I discovered that through the UK Government&rsquo;s failure to give domestic legal effect to the birthright provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, my lifelong Irish identity is evidently considered secondary to an unclaimed British identity.  This additional and entirely imposed citizenship deprives me of my rights as an Irish citizen and an EU citizen.</p> <p>  I am here to discuss the 14 October 2019 ruling by the Upper Tribunal which overturned a previous ruling that I am an Irish citizen only, who has only ever been such.  I will be covering three themes today, namely, the implications of this ruling for citizenship rights in Northern Ireland; the incompatibility of this ruling with the Good Friday Agreement; and what actions the British and Irish Governments could be taking. </p> <p>  The implications of this ruling for citizenship rights in Northern Ireland are as follows.  On 14 October the Upper Tribunal ruled that the people of Northern Ireland remain British citizens even if they identify as Irish.  The Home Office, after years of appeals, has now successfully argued that Northern Ireland citizens have no right to choose their nationality, regardless of the birthright provisions outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.  Rather, they are permitted to identify on a personal level as Irish, yet are in fact British at birth.  This sets a dangerous precedent, reducing an integral right to choose one&rsquo;s own national identity - in this case, to identify as and be accepted as Irish - into a right to merely feel Irish.</p> <p>  The 14 October ruling was primarily based on three grounds, namely, that the birthright provisions of the Good Friday Agreement do not include the ability to choose one&rsquo;s citizenship; that the absence of Article 1(iv) from the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was entirely deliberate; and that even if this provision was to amount to a right to choose one&rsquo;s own citizenship, this right is not present in domestic UK law, therefore we cannot rely on it.</p> <p>  The tribunal stated that under the UK's dualist system the Good Friday Agreement and annexed British-Irish Agreement are not binding in domestic law save insofar as its provisions have been incorporated into domestic law through the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  The tribunal agreed with the Secretary of State for the Home Department that the British Nationality Act 1981 is compatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  Both the Secretary of State and tribunal interpret the agreement as a right to identify as Irish or British or both, not a right to choose citizenship.  The tribunal took no issue with the process of renunciation of British citizenship, a process that the Home Office  requested that I undertake, which requires a declaration that an individual is in fact a British citizen.  It also requires that a person proves that he or she is British, pay &pound;372 to do so, gives up his or her freedom of movement for six months and afterwards he or she can be exposed to further immigration controls.</p> <p>  As a result of this ruling only one of the three categories of citizenship that are provided for under the Good Friday Agreement is respected.  Ireland amended its nationality laws after the 1998 referendum, moving Irish citizenship away from an automatic conferral to that of an entitlement.  As a result of Ireland taking the appropriate legislative steps, and while the UK has resisted legislation in this area, only those who identify solely as British have their birthright under the Good Friday Agreement upheld.  There is no conferral of Irish citizenship on those who do not wish to hold it.  However, those of us who identify solely as Irish must first accept that they we are British, renounce being British, and go through a lengthy, costly and often traumatic process in order to be accepted solely as Irish.  Dual nationals in Northern Ireland also have rights restrictions in this way.  This undoubtedly breaches the principles of parity of esteem and equality under the Good Friday Agreement.  There cannot, nor should not, be preferential treatment for one community but an equal opportunity to make a free choice without differential or detrimental treatment.</p> <p>  The ruling also raises an important question over citizenship in the event of reunification of this island.  The tribunal and the Secretary of State rely entirely on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional position within the United Kingdom to assert British citizenship.  If this decision is allowed to stand it will set a precedent that may affect those wishing to hold British citizenship in a united Ireland, as this region would no longer be a part of the United Kingdom.  The tribunal claims citizenship flows from the British Nationality Act 1981 and not from the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  A further ramification on citizenship from this ruling is that it cements a British first, Irish second policy in the United Kingdom.  Those of us who identify solely as Irish are considered British while in the UK.  This creates two tiers of Irish citizens, those who were born in the South, who are resident in the United Kingdom, who can access and retain their full EU rights and entitlements, and those of us born in the North, who cannot.</p> <p>  The second theme is compatibility with the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not believe that the 14 October ruling is compatible with the Good Friday Agreement.  Not only does this ruling create a distinction between identity and citizenship under the agreement but it also negatively impacts a number of convention rights such as Article 8, the right to private life, and Article 14, freedom from discrimination.  Article 1 of the Good Friday Agreement recognises the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as British or Irish or both, as they so choose and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments.  This can be read from the text constituting a duty on both states to accept the people of Northern Ireland as British or Irish or both, as they so choose.  The choice of identity is limited to the same categories as citizenship, and rights to hold both British and Irish citizenship is in light of many states not permitting dual citizenship.</p> <p>  The view that the Belfast Agreement is in fact a constitutional document is now widely accepted.  In determining whether, and to what extent, the UK requires a codified constitution, the fact that Northern Ireland is regarded as already having one is seen as a matter for consideration.</p> <p>  It is recognised that there exists a hierarchy of rights wherein constitutional rights should be and are afforded greater respect than ordinary statute.  They form part of a higher law.  Regardless of British citizenship law the Home Office accepted Northern Ireland-born persons as solely Irish until 2012.  Imposing citizenship in this way is a relatively new policy and represents a departure from the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p> Through this process I have had to outline every moment in my life that my Irish identity has been evident in order to prove to the courts that I am Irish, including things as mundane as the fact that I did Irish dancing when I was a child.  I have had to put that into a written court statement as proof that I am Irish.</p><p> A key objective of the peace talks was to establish equality between the two main communities and to establish a shared society based on the principles of parity of esteem and mutual respect.  Yet I have witnessed at first hand the negative impact and emotional trauma caused by expecting Irish citizens to declare themselves as British in order to access their rights.  We have met families that have lost years in courts, fighting against this conferral; families that cried whilst renouncing British citizenship; and families that simply moved away from their homes, families and livelihood.  No one should be forced to adopt or renounce a citizenship he or she has never held in order to access rights which were meant to be granted at birth, but that is what is happening today in Northern Ireland.</p><p> I would like to move on to what actions, if any, the British and Irish Governments could or should take in response to this ruling.  It has been encouraging to many that the Irish Government has become more vocal on this issue since the ruling on 14 October, and I am sure there will be those who will take solace in this committee hearing today.  However, the denial of rights continues and has a real-time effect on people across Northern Ireland.  Last week I met with another family renouncing British citizenship.  The week before that, I met another family simply leaving the country to access their rights.  An urgent and effective response is required to deal with this.</p><p> Mrs. Theresa May pledged a review into these issues in February of this year, but unfortunately this review was not released before she departed.  There is speculation that a review exists, but we have no timeline, no terms of reference, and no indication that it will ever be released.  I believe there is a little bit of a reliance on the outcome of this review, and I do not think it will ever see the light of day, to be honest.</p><p> We have been informed that counsel on behalf of the Home Office is taking direct orders from the Secretary of State for the Home Department in our case, and I believe this contradicts the British Government&rsquo;s claim that it is seeking a resolution here.  I have seen no indication of any political will or appetite to find a solution that is in line with the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement in all of my correspondence with British officials.  I have seen statements made that the British Government cannot be held to the spirit of a treaty, that it is the British Government&rsquo;s view that an international agreement such as the Belfast Good Friday Agreement cannot supersede domestic legislation and that there is nothing in the Belfast Agreement to prevent the automatic conferral of British citizenship.  On 14 October, when the ruling came in, the Home Office released a statement that it was pleased with the outcome of that ruling.  All these statements, combined with the resources and time invested into pursuing this case against us over the past four years, demonstrates that the British Government is not committed to the Good Friday Agreement, or to finding a resolution in line with the birthright provisions.</p><p> It is noted that there is no official dispute mechanism within the Good Friday Agreement, nevertheless there remains a responsibility on the Irish Government as a co-guarantor to uphold and protect the agreement in all its parts.  It is clear that an amendment to the British Nationality Act 1981 is necessary, and a number of parties in Northern Ireland support this, including Alliance, Sinn F&eacute;in, and the SDLP.</p><p> There is also, in light of Brexit, a restriction on Northern Ireland born Irish citizens accessing the EU settlement scheme, which the Irish Government could pursue.  Increasingly, those of us in the North, in the face of a British Government abdicating its responsibilities, are looking towards Dublin to safeguard our rights.  If the British Government can arbitrarily disregard rights guaranteed to the people of Northern Ireland under an internationally binding peace treaty, what safeguards are in place to prevent further diminution of rights?  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I would like to make clear that I am speaking today in a personal capacity only.  I am participating in the University and College Union, UCU, strike action in my university, so I am speaking as an Irish citizen living and working in the North.  I would like to commend Emma and Jake on their courage and the stand that they have made on this issue.  They speak for many people, and as so often is the case in relation to matters of human rights and equality, all of us depend on courageous civic leadership, and I would like to commend Emma and Jake on the work they have undertaken on this issue.</p> <p>  What we are talking about today is very simple.  It is an implementation gap in relation to the Good Friday Agreement, and there are a number of implementation gaps.  Let us be clear.  The implementation gaps that we are talking about harm everyone in Northern Ireland.  I want to concentrate today on two themes.  First, I want to say something about the wider context in terms of the agreement, and second, I want to say something about the birthright guarantee under the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  First, in terms of context, it is important to frame the conversation today in relation to a wider implementation gap that is the cause of instability in the North at the moment.  Keep in mind that a number of reasonable expectations from the Good Friday Agreement have not yet as yet been delivered.  There is no Bill of rights for the North, and as I note in my written opening statement, the Human Rights Commission in its advice in 2008 addressed this question in its proposals.  There is no charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement contains a right to self-determination, linked to the principle of consent, and many people on this island are increasingly worried about the lack of adequate preparation and planning when the day arrives for those referendums to take place.  There is no Irish language Act in the North.  People await the referendum to be held on voting rights in presidential elections which will have huge significance for Irish citizens everywhere.</p> <p>  In relation to Brexit, there are a multitude of issue and problems, but we have the withdrawal agreement and the protocol.  Will the guarantees that are there be effectively implemented in British domestic law, policy and practice?  What we are hearing this morning, and what we know is, that 21 years after the Good Friday Agreement, many of the guarantees there are still not reflected in domestic law, policy and practice in the UK.  Also in relation to Brexit, a rather neglected issue is whether Northern Ireland will have a voice in the European Parliament in a post-Brexit scenario.</p> <p>  I list these as simply illustrative of a number of examples of ongoing problems in relation to lack of implementation, and in relation to the human rights and equality crisis in the North.  As the committee is aware, there is a lot of focus at the moment on the restoration of power sharing and on the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly and getting that up and running.  I would like to underline and make something clear to the committee all this morning.  Think back on all the issues that I have just listed.  Many of those, if not all of them, are within the gift of both Governments to deliver, so it is vital that both the British state and Irish State work to advance these issues as a matter of urgency.  Speaking personally, one of the most troubling and one of the dangerous narratives that has taken hold across these islands at the moment is that the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly will solve all the problems of the North.  That is just not true.</p> <p>  The second theme is the right to be identified as British or Irish, or both, as we have already heard so eloquently from Emma.  We are talking about a foundational constitutional commitment flowing from the Good Friday Agreement.  We know, as a matter of fact, that it is not properly implemented in British domestic law, policy and practice but it is even more disturbing than that, as we have already heard.  There is no genuine grasp evident in the British system of the significance of this birthright guarantee.</p><p>In fact, I would press that a bit further with the committee today.  There does not seem to be any genuine grasp of the significance of the Good Friday Agreement itself for all the people of this island, and there does not seem to be any genuine grasp of the impact of the failure to comply with the birthright guarantee on respect for human rights and human dignity of all those affected.  Very troubling indeed, I think, is the British Government's rationale for the approach that it is adopting.  The British Government appears not to be saying that this is an implementation failure.  The British Government is saying that its interpretation is right, and I think what is worrying about the Upper Tribunal decision is that it appears to go along with that rationale.  If one adopts that approach, there is not a problem to remedy.  That is why I think the Irish Government has been absolutely right to point out that this is a misreading of the Good Friday Agreement - in other words, the British Government is simply wrong in its approach to the agreement.  That is not the first time that has happened, and I suspect it will not be the last time.  There is an implementation failure.  It is an implementation failure that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, and for reasons that we have heard.</p><p> We are facing, I think, an implementation crisis, and while much of the narrative often falls on the absence of power sharing and the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, we should keep in mind this morning that many of these issues we are talking about, and the issue we are talking about specifically today, rests with both Governments to take forward as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government must move to resolve this implementation failure, and bring law, policy, and practice into line with the agreement.  What it is raising is something that has been troubling constitutional lawyers and those with an interest in the agreement for some time, and that is the question that within the UK system, there is inadequate political and judicial acknowledgement of the constitutional significance of the Good Friday Agreement for this island and for these islands.  Something constitutionally significant happened in 1998, and that needs to be more fully recognised in the British legal and political systems.</p><p> I am increasingly worried about the status accorded to the agreement in the UK system by politicians and judges, and keep in mind the context that we are thinking about today.  The context is Brexit, and conversations about another agreement - a withdrawal agreement and protocol and in a number of years' time many people do not want to watch yet another agreement not properly implemented, so it is absolutely vital that this is faced by both Governments as a matter of urgency, as a matter of demonstrating respect for the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p> This is not about creating winners and losers.  It is really rather simple.  More than 21 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, many of us are seeking to ensure that agreement is implemented in law, policy, and practice.  There are no winners and losers here.  The winners will be everyone who lives in Northern Ireland.  This is about the British and the Irish Governments working to create a level playing field in the North, so that the institutions and the values of the Good Friday Agreement might flourish in the future.</p></speech>

The committee very much appreciates your supportive commentary to the opening statement you provided.  Ms Boyd, it is over to you on behalf of the Committee on the Administration of Justice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.890" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Una Boyd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019120400002#E00300"><p>We are very grateful to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for the invitation to attend today.  As the committee may know, the Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ, is a Belfast-based independent human rights organisation.  We co-convene the Equality Coalition with UNISON, and we are the NGO partner in BrexitLawNI, a joint project with the law schools of Queens and Ulster Universities.  I run the immigration project at CAJ which focuses on the impact of Brexit on the immigration regime, and through this, rights and equality in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  We are all familiar with the background of the DeSouza case.  In refusing an immigration application the Home Office revealed its policy of treating all persons born in Northern Ireland as automatically British, stating that they can become solely Irish only through the process of renouncing that British citizenship for the price of &pound;372.  The reason for this policy is that most dual British and EU nationals are excluded from exercising European Economic Area, EEA, family reunion rights, so this policy comes down to preventing people from bringing family to the UK.  This policy is not compliant with the Good Friday Agreement, which recognises the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be recognised as British, or Irish, or both, and this is a treaty-based duty on both states.</p> <p>  When this issue was raised, instead of taking action to ensure compliance with the Good Friday Agreement, the UK Government instead pursued litigation in which it defended its choice to ignore its obligations under the agreement.  A review into the matter, promised by former Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, had no terms of reference or timeframe, and has never come to light, and the UK Government continues to implement this policy.  This will have a wide impact, particularly in the face of Brexit.  The policy means that Northern Ireland born Irish citizens will be among the only EU citizens in UK jurisdiction who are excluded from the EU settlement scheme, which is the domestic mechanism allowing EU citizens to retain legally enforceable EU rights under the citizens rights provisions of the withdrawal agreement.  This also creates tiers of Irish citizenship, where an Irish citizen who is born in the Republic or even elsewhere, can apply to the scheme, but an Irish person born in Northern Ireland cannot.  Take the example of neighbours born in Donegal and Derry, respectively, living in the UK.  Both are Irish citizens, but both will have totally different rights protections post-Brexit.  The policy makes a mockery of the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, undermining trust in the peace agreement and causing tension among communities.  Emma and Jake were successful in challenging the Home Office decision at the First-tier Tribunal.  The Home Office chose to appeal this to the Upper Tribunal, and in the recent decision the Upper Tribunal overturned the First-tier Tribunal decision upholding the original Home Office decision.</p> <p>  In its appeal, the UK Government advocated a reinterpretation of the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, which is not in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Good Friday Agreement as a treaty.  The UK, downplaying the duty on both states to accept Northern Ireland born persons as Irish, or British, or both, instead sought to reinvent the provision as one separating the concept of identity from the legal bond of citizenship.  The UK Government argued that the provision of dual nationality and the option of renouncing British citizenship equate to compliance with the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and duality approach means that on signing the British-Irish Agreement, the UK should have then legislated to bring its nationality law in line with the Good Friday Agreement's citizenship provisions.  The UK failed to do this, resulting in the citizenship provisions not being directly enforceable in the domestic courts.  Emma and Jake face an uphill battle overcoming this through UK courts, and the process of litigation also carries huge personal and financial burdens for both of them.</p> <p>  The need for action beyond the courts is becoming increasingly clear.  DeSouza has highlighted the need for urgent legislative reform of the British Nationality Act to give effect to the Good Friday Agreement.  The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, NIHRC, has recommended that the British Nationality Act is amended to reflect the birthright provisions, and I believe it has commissioned a report on this which should be published soon.</p><p> In the meantime, the Home Office could amend its policy to allow for Northern Irish-born Irish citizens to assert their right to Irish citizenship only, in line with the Good Friday Agreement.  We know it can do this because this was its policy prior to 2012.  The Northern Irish Human Rights Commission has also recommended that a right to be British or Irish, or both, is enshrined as a right in the Good Friday Agreement-mandated Northern Irish Bill of rights, which the UK is yet to discharge its duties and legislate for.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I thank the Committee for the Administration of Justice for the provision of its detailed submission for our consideration.  Having heard the three opening statements, I would like to again record my thanks to the Joint Committee Justice and Equality for unanimously taking the decision to host this address here this morning.

What they have been through is totally unacceptable and the position of the UK Government is totally contrary to the Good Friday Agreement and they are 100% right to oppose it and I am glad to see the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste offering the Government's support, and I am very hopeful that this committee will do the same.  I am also glad to see that our Taoiseach has correctly indicated that the British Government's approach is a misreading of the agreement.</p> <p>  It seems that the heart of this case is about preventing the automatic conferral of British citizenship.  One of the suggestions made was to amend the British Nationality Act to enable this.  Could the witnesses describe how that would work in practice?  Should it be that in order to avoid statelessness a child born in Belfast is automatically given British and Irish citizenship, and would simply be able to say later on that he or she is solely Irish without needing to pay and formally renounce British citizenship?  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  If the issue is having citizenship at any point, how would citizenship be dealt with at birth?  Should the parents choose?</p> <p>  If we say one needs to have some citizenship at birth, how would one be enabled to choose between them or indeed choose both?  If the default is not both citizenships at birth, what should the default be?  I want to get the witnesses' ideas on that, because we need a system that respects the right to be Irish, or British, or both, under the Good Friday Agreement.  There is no doubt about that.  I want to get an idea of how it would work in practice.</p></speech>

Under Ireland's nationality laws, if another entitlement to citizenship exists, then Irish citizenship is an entitlement - it is not automatically conferred.  In terms of statelessness in Northern Ireland, there would be entitlement to Irish and British citizenship, therefore one cannot be rendered stateless if one has an entitlement to both of those.  In terms of how that would be enacted through legislation, I am awaiting the outcome of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's report, which I believe addresses a lot of these issues and how one could amend the legislation.  There are legal solutions there, and one can look at Ireland's legislation as an example of that, and at international law and how it operates with statelessness.  My understanding is that under international law if an entitlement to citizenship exists, then one cannot be rendered stateless.  It has to be a personal choice for each individual to make as to whether they want to be Irish or British or both.  I do not think that both being automatically conferred at birth would necessarily be the right solution.</p></speech>

However, this raises another issue that may need to be considered.  That is the question of equality of citizenship in the North in the longer term.  In addition to the issue of choice, British or Irish or both, the question of a detriment arising around that choice will need to be addressed.  Work is being done on the notion that we may need to move into a system that recognises the unique circumstances of the North, whereby we move to a system which looks very like equality of citizenship in relation to British and Irish citizens.  That is why, in the earlier intervention, I tried to underline that the agreement is not only quite good at talking very specifically about issues of nationality and identity, but also about wrapping those around a broader framework about the human rights of everyone in the North.  That is why the implementation gap on issues such as the Bill of rights, the charter for the island, leaves us devoid of a comprehensive rights and equality-based framework in the North.  That is why we are feeling that loss, and that absence.</p></speech>

I think the Irish legislation provides a really strong example of an entitlement to citizenship, not an automatic conferral, which is also drafted in a very careful way to prevent statelessness.  The Home Office has made quite a lot of the statelessness argument itself and the tribunal picked up on it.  The UN convention on statelessness states that one can only be rendered stateless if one does not have citizenship by operation of the law.  If, like Ms DeSouza said, there is an entitlement to two different citizenships, then one would not be stateless and we are waiting to see a significant body of work on this that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has done which will hopefully be published quite soon.  It will really be interesting to see.</p></speech>

I wish to assure them of my support, and the support of practically everybody in the Oireachtas for the position they have taken and the courageous efforts they have made to set out a basis for equality.  That is really what this is about.  It is not about one being better than the other, although sometimes it is presented in that way.</p> <p>  In Ms DeSouza's submission one point stuck out.  She said that the absence of Article 1(iv) of the Good Friday Agreement from the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was entirely deliberate.  I would like to tease that out a little.  It would appear that the view taken by the British authorities is that their position on citizenship for people living in the North is the historic position, and that they are refusing to change that due to the implications of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  I think all contributors spoke to the issue of what this means in the context of a position which is going to come about where we are looking at a poll on Irish unity, where that brings us and how that works out.  One of the issues that comes up is people who identify themselves as British citizens, or as having a British identity.  That is not entirely exclusive to people living in the Six Counties, and I am sure there are some of them who live in this jurisdiction as well.  What needs to be done, in terms of preparations, to reassure people that they will not be treated in the way that Ms DeSouza has been treated in those circumstances?  I would like to hear what considerations Professor Harvey may have in respect of that.</p></speech>

I have tried to frame my contribution today around an implementation gap that rests with the British and the Irish Governments as co-guarantors of that agreement.  There is a bigger problem that the constitutional significance of the Good Friday Agreement for this island has not made its way fully and effectively into the British constitutional legal system, be it politically, or legally as well.  That is something we need to think about remedying in the time ahead.</p><p> We are in a context where we are talking about a Brexit conversation as well and where we do not want to be in a situation in a number of years time where we cannot do anything if some of the guarantees that are being given at the moment are not being realised in practice.  That needs urgent work and legal reform within the British system, but it is an endemic problem.  The reason for framing it in relation to the agreement is that we are on a pathway towards referendums on constitutional change on the island, and I mentioned this at the start.  I refer to the right to self-determination.  When people talk about human rights in the agreement they tend to skip over this one, but it is an important one.  It is in the agreement and it is linked to the principle consent, and there is a conversation on the island about planning and preparing, in a prudential way, for those referendums that are coming.  Nobody wants the Brexit mess on this island.  It is about planning and preparing, and central to the planning and preparing is the framework of the Good Friday Agreement, and the values that are there, and the birthright guarantee is crystal clear on this.  Those guarantees are intended to persist into the future, and those are guarantees for British citizens in the future.  Those are guarantees in relation to unionists and loyalists in the future, that rights will be respected, and it is absolutely vital that we have that Good Friday Agreement framework.  That is why when one sees the Good Friday Agreement undermined in the way it is in the here and now, that should give us all pause for thought about the future, and it has been why there is bit of frustration around these debates.</p><p> I tried to underline at the start that this is not about winners and losers.  Emma's and Jake's courageous stand around the birthright guarantee will benefit everyone who is protected by that guarantee, now and into the future, wherever the future may take us, and so many arguments about the Good Friday Agreement are on that basis.  The implementation gap harms everyone in the North, and that is why it needs to be addressed.</p><p> Just to repeat myself, which I am prone to do, it is about both Governments creating a level playing field so that the Good Friday Agreement, and its institutions and values, might find the space to breathe.</p></speech>

For me, that argument being made by the Home Office and the British Government signifies an almost rewriting of that provision.  There is no evidence to support that submission either.  There are no statements from 1998.  There is no evidence supporting the current view that it was deliberate, that this was to be left out in 1998.  If anything, we have seen people like Jonathan Powell state that this has been overlooked and it is a mistake that it has not made it into legislation.</p> <p>  First, it is quite concerning that it is taking that path.  It is a minimising of the right.  It is watering it down from a right to choose ones nationality and hold Irish or British citizenship, or both, to a right to feel Irish or British, or both, and I do not think this is what was intended in 1998.</p> <p>  With regard to British citizens in the event of a unification, there is a real issue here because only Britain can decide who is or is not a British citizen, and if the Home Office is successful in watering down the birthright provisions to a right to just feel Irish or British, or both - that we do not have citizenship stemming through that - then it raises the question of what would happen to British citizens in the event of a united Ireland, and what could Ireland do because it cannot grant British citizenship to British citizens.  One has a situation where potentially in one to two generations British citizenship could become at risk for those in Northern Ireland who want to hold it.</p> <p>  A point I would like to highlight is that this situation that I am in does not just affect people who only identify as Irish.  I have met many families who are unionist and who have renounced British citizenship in order to access their rights, and that is very difficult for them to do because they are having to give up their identity in order to access rights.  There are plenty of people in the North who are very happy and content to hold British and Irish citizenship, and they are in a situation where they have to choose one or the other to access their rights, and it basically puts everyone in a very difficult position where their identity is being questioned by the Government.  It is not a good place to be.</p></speech>

I think it described it as clearly being fully aligned with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, so it comes back to this idea that there is no will here.  There is no acceptance from the British Government that there may have been something that was overlooked, that there may have been something that was not properly enacted.  It is firmly standing behind the argument that its position is right, that the British Nationality Act is compliant with the Good Friday Agreement.  As Ms DeSouza touched on, to do this it has essentially reread the citizenship provisions.  What it is doing is separating the identity and the citizenship into two separate parts, which we do not have a lot of information on.  We do not have preparatory documents that tell us exactly what was intended when this was drafted, so what one has to go to is the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty.  A person has the right to identify and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, and accordingly, Irish and British citizenship are protected.  There is a very deliberate link there, and the British Government has very intentionally reread that in a way that allows it to downplay the right to this - the idea that a person has every right to identify, but that does not mean there has to be any legal right to citizenship.</p></speech>

In that context, would the witnesses concur that the Irish Government has a responsibility - if not to put pressure on - to create a situation where the British Government has to come up with a responsible situation with regard to Irish citizens?  How can that be done, because as long as both states are part of the European Union, we have that overarching body which we can look to as a means of trying to progress things?  However, with Brexit approaching, that creates more difficulties, and I would be interested to hear how the witnesses believe that can be done in the context, particularly of Brexit, but more so in the context of the responsibility that both Governments have in regard to the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

I know there has been political pressure on it over the last year or two years with our case, but clearly it remains undeterred, so I do not necessarily know how a person might pursue that in a stronger way.  Certainly there needs to be urgency because of the real-time effect it is having on people in Northern Ireland, and the fact people are going through this right now.  It needs to be addressed as quickly as possible and as strongly as possible, and I hope that it is something the committee might be able to look to doing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.916" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019120400002#G01100"><p>I echo the comments.  If one thinks about it very simply, we are now 21 years on from the Good Friday Agreement and we are having this conversation, so there is a particular responsibility on the Irish Government to press this.  We are in a multiplicity of negotiations at the moment, in a variety of contexts.  Ms DeSouza has an enormous amount of support.  The Good Friday Agreement, as we have seen this week in relation to the US and the European Union, is gaining ever more support around the world, so the Irish Government has to work very hard to make sure that is implemented.  Ultimately, governmentally lessons have to be learned, so if there are negotiations - This was very much to the fore in the negotiations around the withdrawal agreement and the protocol - people cannot be put in the position that Ms DeSouza is in in the future, where rights guarantees end up becoming meaningless in the British system.  This is a problem, and it has been going on for a while.  The British legal and political systems have not fully recognised the constitutional importance and significance of the Good Friday Agreement for this island, and that needs to change.</p></speech>

The DeSouza case has done us all a very strange favour in that it has really drawn the UK Government out on exactly how it will treat the Good Friday Agreement when it is held up to it, when it is asked to respect its obligations under it.  The amount of time, resources and effort that have gone into it fighting against being asked to respect its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement is extremely telling.  From the perspective of the Irish Government, it is a co-guarantor of this agreement and there has to be action from it to protect the agreement.  For a lot of people in Northern Ireland as well, these are Irish citizens who are seeing their rights being refused, and they look to the Irish Government to protect them, as Irish citizens.</p></speech>

I had a look at the decision of the Upper Tribunal and parts of it are curious, other parts indicate, as Professor Harvey said, that there has not been full implementation.  If one looks at the Good Friday Agreement, there are two agreements to it - there is the multi-party agreement, and there is the agreement between the two Governments.  It is expressly provided in it, that persons are entitled to identify themselves, and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose.  Clearly the two Governments agreed to that and the parties endorsed that agreement.  I wish to ask Professor Harvey, in terms of the breach of an international treaty - I know the argument is it has not been implemented into British domestic law - if that provision has not been implemented into British law, what is the remedy there for Ms DeSouza in the first instance?  Is it an obligation that rests on the other party to the agreement, the Irish Government, to try to invoke it, and if so, where does it go?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.936" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019120400002#H02000"><p>That is a great question.  It is one of the challenges as we know with the Good Friday Agreement, the multi-party agreement and the bilateral international treaty.  To cut a very long story short, as a matter of international law there is very little that the Irish Government can do to remedy this situation.  Dispute resolution is one of the weaknesses in the British-Irish Agreement, and it is one of the things I mentioned earlier.  The lesson has been learned in relation to the discussions around the withdrawal agreement and the protocol, that there are things that can be done, so it is a big problem.  As the Deputy will know, the British constitutional legal system is still very much anchored around this concept of parliamentary supremacy.  It is a dualist legal system, which means that unless and until an international legal text is translated into the domestic legal system - it is more complicated than that but that is a summary - then effectively for individuals there is very little they can do to enforce those rights.</p> <p>  What we have here is a concrete example of where a binding international bilateral treaty has not been effectively implemented in domestic law, policy, and practice in the UK.  It is one of the big problems with the UK system, that one can reach what one thinks is a political agreement.  One can even agree an international treaty with the UK, and there are obligations around good faith interpretation, but if that international agreement does not have an effective system for resolving disputes, then individuals are very reliant on what happens in domestic law, policy and practice.</p> <p>  For me and for many people, as we said today, the problem here is an implementation gap.  It has not been reflected, but it is not the only concept from the agreement that is not reflected in British domestic law, policy and practice.  One problem that I have, among many, at the moment is that on issues such as parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality of treatment between British and Irish citizens, as well as some of the human rights and equality issues I have mentioned, there is a yawning implementation gap.  Until that is addressed effectively one is not going to get any form of sustainable power-sharing operating in the North, because that level playing field will not be there.  One cannot have a situation where one has a bits and pieces approach to implementing the agreement.  I am giving the Deputy a very long answer to the question-----</p></speech>

There are weaknesses in relation to enforcing those, and the Irish Government is limited in what it can do.  That does not undermine the fact that there is an international legal obligation on the UK Government to implement in good faith, by amending its domestic law, in order to reflect this crystal-clear birthright guarantee.  That we are sitting here 21 years later talking about this is frankly remarkable, and should give pause for concern to everybody who is currently in negotiations with any British Government about any political agreement now or in the future.</p></speech>

There are significant gaps in the Northern Ireland Act, across a whole host of areas.  As many people who were around in the late 1990s will recall, there was a bit of a tussle even getting the bits of the Northern Ireland Act that are there now.  It is a major problem that needs to be addressed legally.  It can be done, and there are solutions there.</p></speech>

If one looks at the argument made in the court case, Ms DeSouza's lawyers argued that the section should be read as reading that a person born in the UK after commencement shall, if he or she consents to identify as such, be a British citizen.  If that amendment was made to the British Nationality Act, it would deal with Ms DeSouza's concerns.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

I thought the Upper Tribunal decision was coherent until I got to paragraph 39, which I thought made very strange reading, because it says that the agreements do not, in fact, involve giving the concept of self-identification the meaning for which Ms DeSouza had argued.  It goes on to say that if the parties to the multi-party agreement and the Governments of Ireland and the UK had intended the concept of self-identification necessarily to include a person's ability to reject his or her Irish or British citizenship, it is inconceivable that the provisions would not have dealt with this expressly.  I would have thought that they dealt with it expressly.</p></speech>

In that context, entirely understandably, people have tried to point out quite rightly the impact on Emma's and Jake's human rights in relation to the approach that has been adopted, and the human rights and human dignity of people affected by this, that is, of having a nationality conferred on them against their wishes, given this international legal right to choose.</p></speech>

A person has to provide his or her parents' birth certificates, and their marriage certificates, and the knock-on effect of that system is that the trauma is often passed on then to the whole family - an Irish family then has to accept that they are all British in order for their son or daughter to renounce being British.

Everything in Northern Ireland is unfortunately contested, and there is contested identity, and it is contested territory.  It is very important - this is not an obligation on Ms DeSouza, but on all of us - to try to communicate to the unionist population as well that this is of benefit to everyone living in Northern Ireland, because if there is going to be referendum change in years to come, we all must recognise that the unionist population in Northern Ireland is entitled to remain identifying as British.  That is a big issue that is going to have to be dealt with, and we need to communicate that more.  One of the problems we have sometimes on the nationalist side of this island is that we spend a lot of time talking to ourselves, and that is no criticism of Ms DeSouza.  She is fighting for her rights as an individual, but as politicians we sometimes converse too much with ourselves, and we need to communicate the benefits of Ms DeSouza's interpretation of the agreement to the unionist population so that it knows there is protection for its British identity in the long run.  I would like to thank Ms DeSouza for coming in, and I commend her on the case she is taking.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, I am not a member of this committee, but I am attending it as a members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and indeed the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  This issue has been raised on numerous occasions.  I have two important questions that need to be asked, and that is in the context of hearing people like Robin Walker, and our Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, who have been pressed on this issue and say that they are negotiating and that they are trying to find a solution to it.  Ultimately, what Professor Harvey has said about having an implementation crisis, and the fact that there is no dispute mechanism there, is key to part of the resolution of Ms DeSouza's issue.</p> <p>  We are supposed to be here to help, and hopefully we are.  I would like to ask what Ms DeSouza's view would be on an all-party motion in the Oireachtas calling on the British Government to honour its commitments to the Good Friday Agreement, and indeed to possibly seek a dispute mechanism within the Good Friday Agreement in order to avoid what Professor Harvey has described as an implementation crisis.</p> <p>  To what degree is Ms DeSouza aware that the issues and obligations to the international treaty have been raised within the context of the British withdrawal agreement?</p></speech>

We are at a point now where it would really be almost necessary.  This has been going on for a long time.  Our case has been going on four years, and it is now going to be five years when we go into 2020.  However, there have been other cases before ours.  Other people have spent years in court doing the same thing and trying to fight for their rights.  People are in a really desperate position now in the North where they saw this ruling in October and they feel like they are being left behind, that their rights are not being respected and that they are not being upheld.  Who do we have to turn to?  Who is going to take a stand for us in the North?  A motion in support of finding a resolution and in support of those of us in the North would be very much welcomed, and I would hope to see that.</p></speech>

In relation to the Good Friday Agreement, recall that the protocol includes Article 2.  It includes a reference to no diminution in relation to rights and equality, and specifically references a part of the Good Friday Agreement in the protocol, so it is very likely in the future that the Good Friday Agreement will find itself being discussed within that architecture.  A second aspect to keep in mind is that we need to be mindful that, with any agreement that involves the UK Government, whatever guarantees are there need to find their way fully and effectively into British law, policy, and practice.  Bear in mind the majority of people in Northern Ireland do not want to leave the EU, but if Brexit happens, it is vital to ensure that the guarantees that are in the withdrawal agreement, for example, in relation to rights and equality, are fully reflected in that Bill as it goes through Parliament.  To repeat myself, we do not want to end up in a situation here where the committee is hearing evidence in the years ahead from individuals affected, whose rights have been infringed, but there is no way for them to do anything about it.  To be fair, some of the lessons that have emerged from the agreement have been learned in the context of those negotiations between the EU and UK in relation to the enforceability dispute resolution and adjudication of the guarantees that are given there.  They are not ideal, but it is clear that there are lessons that have been learned, but it will need to be watched carefully in the time ahead.</p></speech>

What this is going to draw attention to is that paragraph 52 of the joint report committed to protecting EU rights of persons, including where they reside in Northern Ireland.  That vanished.  We did not see that reflected in the withdrawal agreement, and what we have in the withdrawal agreement is part two which outlined citizens rights, so it is things like workers' rights, residents' rights, and the rights to family reunion.  There is a commitment that those rights will be protected for life, but already Northern Irish born Irish citizens are excluded from those because the only way of accessing them is the EU settlement scheme, and the only way of applying to the EU settlement scheme is to not be considered a dual national, so we have come full circle in terms of protections under the withdrawal agreement.  Northern Irish born Irish citizens are not going to be able to access them in a legally enforceable way because of the policy that we are dealing with, which comes right down to respect for the obligations under the Good Friday Agreement, as has already been said, they are going to come head to head.</p></speech>

That is as England is interpreting the law, totally against the Good Friday Agreement, totally out of line with the Good Friday Agreement, except that is interpreting it to suit itself, to justify that approach.  The difficulty lies then with the Good Friday Agreement does it not, in the way that it was drafted?  My colleague here asked a question on a dispute mechanism, and I have that highlighted here as well.  Theoretically the Good Friday Agreement was excellent and revolutionary.  In practice, it allowed for various interpretations without an appropriate mechanism to resolve issues that arose, is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.967" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma DeSouza" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019120400002#K00600"><p>I wish to comment on that.  What the Good Friday Agreement sought to do was address the identity issues that were present in Northern Ireland.  What is often forgotten is that identity was at the centre of decades of violence and conflict and what the Good Friday Agreement sought to do was creatively find a way to put identity on an equal footing and then remove it as a source of conflict, which is why we have this creative "Irish or British or both" clause which is unique within the United Kingdom.  The real failure there has been the fact that (a), there has not been a dispute mechanism and (b), that it has not found any expression in UK domestic law.  If one just looks at the language under the article it clearly points to it being a right to hold both or either.  What is happening is a reinterpretation on the British side to find a way to excuse themselves from having to implement change.</p></speech>

That is reflected in the British-Irish Agreement.  There is a good faith obligation on the British Government to implement its international commitments.  In this case it simply has not done so and it needs to do so.  In many ways it is as clearcut as that.</p></speech>

However it is not clear really.  To the witnesses' reading and my reading it is crystal clear, and certainly it was very creative, allowed for a just solution, allowed for people to choose and all of that.  I agree with all of that.  However in retrospect, it allowed for a completely different interpretation by one party.  There is no dispute resolution mechanism to deal with that within the Good Friday Agreement.  Is it not right that there is no way of dealing with that different interpretation in a speedy way and in an effective manner?</p></speech>

The weight of opinion, I have to say, is on the side of the Irish Government, and with Ms DeSouza's reading of this provision.  The focus should be on the British Government, in good faith, implementing its international legal obligations.  The Irish Government needs to ensure that happens, in the context of European Union support for the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and support for the Good Friday Agreement in the US and elsewhere.</p></speech>

However, all agreements have to have some type of dispute resolution because with the best will in the world, the good faith, and given the history of Ireland and England and the various pieces of legislation which I read, it was a constantly evolving process in relation to citizenship was it not with different pieces of legislation going back to 1922.  It was wonderful on paper but it was clear there would be issues with it in practice.  I do not quite understand how the UK or any country can simply ignore its obligations under an international binding agreement.  That has huge implications for all international binding agreements does it not, that it can simply ignore it?</p></speech>

I think that is why it is trying to say it was never meant to be a right to choose one's nationality, and if it can find success and favour with that argument through the courts, then that will absolve it of any responsibility to implement change or legislate for that provision.  That is the reason it is trying to redefine the definition of that provision.</p></speech>

A person is stateless when under operation of the law he or she cannot become a citizen so in this scenario he or she would have, under operation of the law, access to two citizenships, so it would not be a situation of statelessness.  Statelessness is really intended for people who, under operation of the law cannot access a citizenship and it is interpreted by the UK itself quite narrowly.  We would say that a position - the Irish legislation being a very good example - where a person has an entitlement under operation of the law to a citizenship, and in this case, to two citizenships, he or she would not be considered stateless.</p></speech>

The reluctance of the Home Office and the British officials to release the review is clear as they will not give us, in any freedom of information requests, or any parliamentary questions, any indication of a timeline, timeframe or terms of reference.  We have been told that it is an informal review, it is not formal, and we have during that time a new Prime Minister, a new Home Secretary and potentially others again next month.

We saw this come up after 2012 when the McCarthy decision caused the Home Office to change its policy, and we started to see families coming in who were affected by this.  The simple fact is there are very few people who are in a position to take a fight that is going to be lengthy litigation, and potentially years of uncertainty.  One's spouse could end up, as Ms DeSouza's husband, Jake, did, without a passport, without the right to work or the right to drive.  For many of these people, they have young children, sick relatives, employment needs and they need to be able to travel.  What I typically saw as a solicitor was that people would either make the decision to renounce, with everything that comes with that, or would choose to make one of the UK visa applications at the cost of thousands of pounds - or they would move.</p><p>A lot of people simply chose to move with their family members, to leave the UK.  I have said it before but Emma was pretty much the first person who was stubborn enough to say, "No, I really can't accept this.  This goes against all of my rights and I want to fight it."</p></speech>

I personally know and work with maybe two dozen people who are affected by this situation and other families who have tried to go through the courts.  It is going to be impossible to pinpoint it in terms of figures because every other week there seems to be someone else stating that they are now renouncing British citizenship, and I cannot get a hold of these figures from the Home Office.  I do think that it affects more people than we realise, and with Brexit it will certainly affect many more.  Really it should not be happening, full stop.  If one person is suffering a rights infringement like this then we all lose.</p></speech>

Sometimes that gets lost in the conversation around the agreement.  Second, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission - I declare an interest in that I was on the commission at the time we submitted the advice to the British Government in 2008 - spotted a lot of this in 2008.  What we noticed was that a lot of the core concepts in the agreement, particularly those around parity of esteem, mutual respect, and equality of treatment, were not reflected in domestic law.  We proposed, as part of a comprehensive set of proposals on human rights, a bill of rights that included those things.  I think we feel that absence, and it is part of the wider implementation gap that needs to be addressed.  It is also part of the reason I think we have the problems we do at the moment in the North.</p></speech>

This concerned a British person who acquired Irish citizenship through descent.  As Emma touched on, there was no real factual connection and it did not really reflect on Northern Irish-born Irish citizens or the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  In their eagerness to prevent people bringing family to the UK through the EEA route, however, the Home Office took it and applied it across the board to anyone they would consider a British and EU dual national.  This is when it began stating that everyone in NI was British automatically, therefore excluding them from exercising those rights.</p></speech>

This is an example of where Good Friday Agreement rights come up against immigration law in the UK and the Home Office, and it should be noted who the casualties are when that happens.  In the context of Brexit, I think we have to keep a close eye on that because it seems to be the outcome when Good Friday Agreement rights come up against the Home Office and immigration law and policy.  That is something we need to be very mindful of in the time ahead, that the Good Friday Agreement is not the casualty of some other priorities of the British Government.</p></speech>

There has been a broad range of fairly extensive legal questions, understandably given the legal complexities of this case and the challenge, so I will not rehearse all of those.</p> <p>  I wish to make a couple of observations.  I suppose the core political component of this is that there should not be a dispute around this and that a dispute mechanism should not be sought, because of the nature of the agreement.  For all of us, this may have been disputed beforehand but ultimately it was agreed.  The British Government were a co-guarantor and a co-signatory to the agreement, and the agreement is explicitly clear in terms of the right not just to identify but also to be accepted as Irish, as British, or as both.</p> <p>  The other challenge and the other consideration for us in the Oireachtas is how this stance by the British Government does not just run up very roughly against the Good Friday Agreement but also runs up against Article 2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in terms of our rights to be part of the Irish nation.  There is a consideration for us, and Deputy Breathnach makes a very valid suggestion in terms of that cross-party motion.  There is one on the Seanad Order Paper, which the Deputy's colleagues and others have signed, so maybe it is something that both Houses can pursue in equal measure going forward.</p> <p>  I am also encouraged that the T&aacute;naiste has finally agreed to meet Ms DeSouza later this month, with me and a number of colleagues from the North as well.  One of the things that we could do, if it is in order, is to suggest that this committee write to the British Secretary of State seeking an update on the review, because my experience, along with our visitors' experience, is that it has been like trying to grab smoke.  I am not suggesting that we will have any additional success in that regard, but it is worth actioning off the back of today's meeting.</p> <p>  The question I always like to ask, and it has sort of been covered already, is what we can do, what pressure we can bring to bear on the Irish Government.  The Irish Government, to be fair to it, has said all of the right things in terms of upholding Ms DeSouza's rights, and that it considers her to be an Irish citizen, which is very good of it 21 years after the Good Friday Agreement.  Nevertheless, it is important that that is said.  Perhaps the witnesses could expand on what they have said to colleagues already on the challenges and the work for us both as members of this committee and as individual Members of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Are there other avenues through existing institutions?  Is there a concern in this in terms of how it impacts upon Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, and Article 2 thereof?  What more could the Irish Government do?  Professor Harvey referenced the referendum on voting rights, which it is hoped will be upcoming.  However, while the Irish Government keeps telling us consistently that we are Irish citizens, there are no tangible actions in terms of enfranchising that citizenship.  I am curious whether, within the confines of the Good Friday Agreement and the Constitution, there are tangible actions that the Irish Government could take in the here and now and over the short to medium term that would tangibly enfranchise those of us who are Irish citizens resident in the North beyond simply the holding of a passport?</p></speech>

We need more political pressure at this point, and there are a lot of negotiations happening right now around the withdrawal agreement and around Brexit.  A lot of conversations are happening.  I would personally like to see this start to creep its way onto those papers and onto those negotiations, and potentially have some sort of political weight put behind that as to finding a way to find a resolution in order to safeguard our rights.  In terms of other avenues, maybe Professor Harvey would have something more on that than I do.</p></speech>

What today is underlining is that Ireland made fundamental constitutional changes as a consequence of the agreement.  The overriding concern at the moment is, for reasons that are about the peculiarity of the British constitutional legal system, the agreement has not found the home it needed to find within that system, and I think that needs to change.  If that means changing domestic law to reflect these things more effectively, then that must be done.   </p> <p>  I am going to underline something today speaking in a personal capacity.   I found myself in the public sphere recently in relation to a range of interventions, some of which have not been entirely pleasant, and somebody commented to me about what would be the case if we had an executive in the North.  It made me think about this evidence session today because that is an incredibly problematic narrative and it is suffocating political discourse on the island at the moment.  The idea that the answer to all the problems in Northern Ireland rest in an executive and an assembly is fundamentally wrong.  It is not true, and I think it is creating a dangerous narrative and expectations around any power-sharing administration that may return.  The things that we are talking about today rest within the gift of both governments to show leadership - to show, not tell.  This is a call today for both the British and Irish Governments to show, not tell.  The implementation gaps that we are identifying today primarily rest with either or both governments.  So in the spirit of showing and not just telling, it is about time both governments worked harder, as co-guarantors of that agreement, to take these forward and make them meaningful.</p> <p>  There are British-Irish negotiations ongoing around what is happening in terms of the power-sharing administration, but perhaps most significantly in the time ahead are the EU and UK negotiations, in which Ireland has a very significant voice.  We have seen the interventions from the US this week as well.  I am not somebody who overplays legal remedies, as important as they are.  There are also political negotiations upcoming on which pressure must be brought to bear on the British Government to address the range of implementation gap - including in Emma's and Jake's case - that we have outlined today.  The negotiations around the withdrawal agreement and protocol - as flawed and problematic as aspects of that are - did show there are ways to do this, so I think it is time for both governments really to step up in relation to the implementation gap that we have mentioned today. </p></speech>

We can see clearly in this Upper Tribunal decision, and in the Home Office arguments, the stance that the UK Government is taking, which is this idea that the citizenship provisions were never enacted because that was the clear intention of the drafters - that there was no need and the British Nationality Act has always been in compliance with the Good Friday Agreement.  That is not even touching on the fact that UK policy and practice does not follow the Good Friday Agreement.  It does not reflect that, but the Irish Government following the Good Friday Agreement made significant legislative change to enact the citizenship provisions and it would be good to see a strong stance coming from the Irish Government on what the intention of the provisions were, and coming back against that argument that it is inconceivable that this is what it intended.  If this is the stance that the British Government is going to take, I would like to see a strong stance against that from the Irish Government, particularly in reflecting its own legislative actions, and perhaps on a smaller scale it would be good to see engagement with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's report and fresh calls for the Northern Ireland bill of rights.  Those are really increasing, and it would be good to see the Irish Government engage meaningfully with that as well.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m go m&oacute;r roimh Emma, Colin agus Una.  I just want to very quickly speak about the<b></b>empirical<b></b>experience.  First of all, let us start from the premise that this is entirely malicious.  I was one of the people who negotiated The Good Friday Agreement.  I was always uncomfortable that we were negotiating rights issues.  I always thought the best option was just to adopt best international practice.  I always thought it would come down to governments which are notoriously reluctant to give legislative effect to people's rights, and also given the nature of the North.  However we are where we are, and we got the Good Friday Agreement and it was a keystone agreement.  There were huge difficulties trying to get the British Government to give proper legislative effect to the agreement.  For example, we do not have a bill of rights, and it is not that the British Government do not know that, or that it has not been raised week in and week out for the last 21 years.  Neither do we have a charter of rights, because the Irish Government was supposed to bring in a charter of rights, and there was to be an all-Ireland charter of rights.</p><p>In this institution, the Good Friday Agreement falls victim to partisan politics, all the time.  It is only when one gets this sort of in-depth discussion of some of the issues involved that one can almost see people here starting to come to an understanding of what this is about.  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann was changed, but the other side of that was that the Irish Government as of right, as opposed to having an aspirational symbolic - and in my opinion meaningless - constitutional claim to the North, was to have an involvement in all of these matters.  The onus therefore, I believe, is on the Irish Government, if one starts from my premise that this is entirely malicious.  Why do I say that?  It is because the British Government will always act in what it perceives to be its own interests.  If there is some immigration issue, or some other issue that the Home Office has responsibility for, that will take precedence and priority, and the people on the island of Ireland, or the northern part of the island, will fall victim to that.  They will be a secondary consideration.  The onus is very clearly on the Irish Government to act in this issue.  No matter how strong a statement there is from an Irish Government in these issues - and of course strong statements are very welcome -  they are not read in Downing Street.  They are not paid any attention to in the British Home Office.  They are not listened to even though it is important that the Government sets out its position in robust and strong terms.</p><p>The Government has to reach above itself.  Notwithstanding all the difficulties, we saw how the diplomatic weight of the Government, with the support of the parties in this institution, could be used to secure the least worst Brexit so far.  That approach also needs to be taken on this issue.</p><p> Time out of number, the Taoiseach has fudged a very important point.  Paragraph 52 of the political declaration, which declared that people in the North with Irish citizenship would have European citizens' rights, is not in the withdrawal agreement.  This provision was heralded as being bulletproof.  I cannot remember the various terms used to describe it but it was supposedly armour-plated.  It is not in the withdrawal agreement and, as such, we fell at the first hurdle when it came to the rights of people in the North.  The Government needs to accept that and work honestly on that issue.</p><p> After that meander, I would like to return to Ms DeSouza's case.  Every day, I and others see that ordinary people have to become activists and experts and have to put themselves out to secure rights in a large number of areas.  In that regard, Emma and Jake are to be commended on what they are doing.   Who is funding their case?  Working people have to go and raise funds by running raffles and ballots and holding fundraising events in local pubs.  That should not be the case.  I do not know if protocol allows it but back in the day an Irish Government took a case to the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of internees who had been tortured.  There should be some exploration of the possibility of the Government using diplomatic and other avenues.  It must also take responsibility.  If the people of the North are not to be left behind again by an Irish Government, this is a d&eacute;an &eacute; n&aacute; habair &eacute; moment.  The Government should something about this by adopting this case.  That in itself would put pressure on the British Government by showing that an Irish Government is prepared to support a legal case of this kind.  The question, which is not directed at the witnesses but at the committee, is whether there can be some space to show very practical support to Ms DeSouza because if she loses, we all lose.</p><p> Obviously, Brexit brought this case to a head but as we meander our way through Brexit, unionists will lose because they will lose their right to claim British citizenship.  Incidentally - I am going off on another tangent - there is no concept of British citizenship.  We are British subjects, not citizens so there is no definition of that.</p><p> To come back to my main point, however, everybody loses if Emma and Jake lose.  For this reason, I commend to the committee that it at least explore the possibility, among whatever other remedies it may have, of seeking practical support from the Government by having it adopt this case.</p></speech>

It is a very difficult case for me and my husband to pursue for such a long period without any financial assistance or support.</p> <p>  I also want to address the point the Deputy made about paragraph 52 of the political declaration.  I agree that the fact that it did not make it into the withdrawal agreement is a failure.  As a citizen, I do not understand why that happened.  This ties into another point around citizens' rights.  We know that it falls entirely within the remit of Ireland to extend MEP seats to the North.  As a citizen, I do not understand why that option is not being pursued.  In the Brexit negotiations, we are seeing a watering down of rights.  The fact that, under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland born Irish citizens cannot access the EU settlement scheme whereas all other Irish citizens can is almost a breach of the agreement before it has even come to pass.  There are definitely big concerns to be raised about negotiating those rights.</p></speech>

The Deputy will not get an argument from me on the British Government's track record on international agreements and human rights.  There is a sense that international pressure is important and that internationalising some of these issues can have an enormous effect.  What has been interesting about the Brexit discussions and the involvement of the United States and other parties is the way in which the British Government has been the weaker party.  I cannot remember another time in history where the British Government has been the weaker party in a negotiation where the Irish Government has been on the other side of the table.  In the context of that sort of negotiation, it is vital that outcomes are maximised, particularly where people are talking about the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.  There is an imperative on the European Union, and the Irish State as an EU member state, to ensure that in the negotiations going forward the language of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts means something.  We are talking here about a right provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  Congress in the US has made itself clear in relation to any future free trade agreement and the commitments that would apply under the Good Friday Agreement.  Again, this is a right under the agreement so the more international pressure that is brought to bear on the British Government, the better.  It will not do so on its own but it can be encouraged to do the right thing in relation to the agreement.  As has been said, the British Government does not have a wonderful track record in implementing a number of aspects of the agreement.</p> <p>  Regarding the paragraph 52 issue, we have discussed a range of human rights and equality issues today.  I want to speak personally again.  I am an Irish citizen living in the North and this has a direct effect on me.  I underline the human rights of everyone in the North and on this island but there is a big problem in relation to the Good Friday Agreement that we have to state.  Certain Irish citizens are second class citizens on this island by some distance.  Irish citizens in the North who are now facing into Brexit will find themselves being second or third class European Union citizens as well.  That is a fundamental problem.  Now, 21 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, there is a stark problem with regard to parity of esteem, mutual respect and equality of treatment that specifically impacts upon Irish citizens in a broader context of a human rights implementation gap.  We have to be able to say that out loud and it has to be addressed.  It is one of the reasons, but not the only one, that the North is in the mess it is in.</p> <p>  Deputy Adams is absolutely right that remarkable and courageous civic leadership has been at the forefront of achieving change in relation to rights and equality.  I can only commend Emma and Jake on taking this courageous stand.  As I have made clear, they speak for many others in the work that they have done.  The Deputy also rightly raised the issue of capacity.  There comes a point in a range of civic conversations on this island, and on the question of civic leadership, where governmental resourcing and governmental level support and assistance are urgently required.  The Government needs to move beyond reassurances and the welcome warm words about the Good Friday Agreement and match those with actual practical action to support the implementation of the agreement in all its parts.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, this came down to an immigration matter.</p><p>As was said, Brexit has really taken this beyond that.  We are now seeing how this policy alone will cause huge issues.  We have Northern Irish-born Irish citizens not able to access the EU settlement scheme, and there is no guarantee of how they will be able to legally enforce and protect their EU rights after Brexit.  We have seen the massive flaws and gaps in the common travel area exposed through this.  It has certainly gone beyond one family, and Ms DeSouza trying to have her husband live with her in the UK.</p><p> We are now in a position where the UK Government has made its stance very clear.  We know some of what we are facing with Brexit, and we need to be able to act now to pre-empt that, to protect those rights and to ensure that, going forward, no one ends up in a similar position.</p></speech>

Does Senator Devine wish to speak?  She is very welcome to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.</p> <p>  We are at the end of our engagement with Emma, Professor Harvey, and Ms Boyd.  There were a couple of proposals that we should certainly take up.  One was correspondence with the British Secretary of State in the North regarding an update on the review.  Are members happy that we would write as a committee to the British Secretary of State seeking an update on the review?  Of course, we will share what information we receive, if any, with you all.</p> <p>  It strikes me that we are looking at a situation here where British taxpayers' money is being used to crush Irish citizens' rights - that is really where we are at.  I refer to the point Deputy Adams made on the weight of this, not only in terms of taking on the case, but the additional factor of how all of this is financed.  I would like to suggest that we write to our T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to that say we fully support the efforts of the Government to pursue the matter, as it has demonstrated it is doing, but to explore what other avenues, if any, that it can employ in order to, significantly if possible, ratchet up the pressure.  Added to that is a request for consideration in relation to the cost of Emma's case because it is not just about Emma and her husband.  This is something that goes much farther and much deeper.  Are we in agreement that as a committee we write to the T&aacute;naiste and cover those issue?</p> <p>  I am not going to rehearse any of the points made, which have been excellent.  I want to commend all the members, the non-members, and those who have attended and engaged here today.  There is just one thing I want to say to Emma, and it sums up my personal position, and I think that of the whole committee.  In our deliberations today, she has been awarded the stubborn badge, and nobody is more entitled to wear it proudly.  Well done Emma and thank you very much on behalf of all of us.</p> <p>  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I wish to thank Ms Emma DeSouza, Professor Harvey and Ms Una Boyd.  I am going to invite them to join us for a photograph to record their attendance this morning.  I look forward to progress on the case and the opportunity of engaging again in the future.</p> <p>  I am going to suspend the session for a few minutes.  We will resume in private session to address the report on direct provision.  I appeal to members to please come back in once the photograph is taken.</p></speech>

I hope it is the sum of his ambitions for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  I am pleased to be here this afternoon.  I am joined by Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, Ms Liz Downey and Mr. Seamus Clifford from my Department and Mr. Michael Culhane, who is from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I thank the committee for making time available to consider the Supplementary Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Department of Justice and Equality Votes.  The net amount of the Supplementary Estimate is &euro;17.5 million for the Garda Vote and &euro;33.3 million in respect of the Department of Justice and Equality Vote.  The Supplementary Estimate requirement in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote comprises a gross expenditure requirement of &euro;32.4 million that is offset by a projected surplus in appropriations-in-aid of just under &euro;15 million, giving a net additional requirement of &euro;17.5 million for the Garda Vote.</p> <p>  Significant measures have been taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the year to remain within budget and minimise the amount of any Supplementary Estimate that might be required.  The additional expenditure requirement mainly arises as a result of the security costs associated with the visits of United States President Trump and United States Vice-President Pence to Ireland this year.  This accounts for approximately &euro;15 million of the additional requirement.  The balance of &euro;2.5 million is to maintain capital expenditure for certain information and communication technology, ICT, projects, including the deployment of mobile technology.  This amounts to approximately &euro;1.5 million and additional investment in the transport fleet of approximately &euro;1 million accounts for the balance.</p> <p>  The additional investment in transport is mainly to replace older vehicles now reaching end of life and the increasing demands on existing fleet resources to support extra members assigned to front-line duties.  This brings the total capital fleet allocation to &euro;11 million in 2019, with a further &euro;9 million being provided in 2020.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in receipt of Internal Security Fund, ISF, funding for certain ICT capital and other projects.  On receipt of clearance from the European Union, EU, funding typically amounting to 90% of relevant expenditure is received.  Funding of almost &euro;3.4 million has been received in 2019 to match prior year expenditure of &euro;3.7 million.  As part of the Supplementary Estimate, a technical adjustment is being done to charge the expenditure to the relevant subheads and reflect the EU funding as an appropriation-in-aid.  The largest ICT project being funded in this manner is the Pr&uuml;m project, the objective of which is to provide for automated sharing between EU member states of certain categories of information for the purposes in particular of combating terrorism and cross-border crime.</p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that the Government is in a position to provide an additional &euro;17.5 million to the Garda Vote in 2019 to effectively provide for once-off events.  The Garda budget has been increased to a record &euro;1.882 billion for 2020.  This includes funding for recruitment of up to 700 garda&iacute; and additional Garda staff, depending on the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision on the balance required.  This allocation includes a capital provision of &euro;116.5 million a further increase of &euro;24 million, or 26%, from 2019.  This will provide for continued investment in ICT in the order of &euro;75 million, &euro;9 million for the Garda fleet and &euro;32 million for the capital building and refurbishment programme.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being provided with unprecedented funding and a major reform process is being supported to ensure the best possible policing services are provided to communities on the ground in all regions of the country.  I acknowledge the work of the work and engagement of the committee with the Garda Commissioner and his team in this regard.</p> <p>  Turning to the Department of Justice and Equality Vote, there is a requirement for an additional &euro;33.3 million in the current year.  This arises despite every effort being made to deal with the pressures within the Vote, including with respect to the scale of the demands on direct provision, subhead E5.  It is estimated that the total outturn in this subhead will in the region of &euro;130 million compared with a budget allocation of &euro;70.65 million and this is the reason for the Supplementary Estimate this year.</p> <p>  The challenges in this area are well documented and were included in the spending review report published in August.  In summary, the trends underpinning the increasing costs in direct provision are as follows.  There has been a significant increase in the number of people seeking protection, and that number is up 60% to date this year.  As of 17 November 2019, there are 6,058 applicants being accommodated in 39 accommodation centres located nationwide across 18 counties and a further 1,499 applicants are residing in 37 emergency accommodation locations in hotels and guest houses.  This brings the total number of applicants for international protection to 7,557.  By comparison, the numbers in all forms of accommodation at the end of 2018 was 6,139 and in 2017 the figure was 5,096.</p> <p>  In order to manage matters the Department has put in place a number of measures aimed at reducing the time it takes to determine applications.  The International Protection Act 2015 introduced the single procedure process for the determination of protection applications.  Under the single procedure, all elements of a person&rsquo;s protection claim, including refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain, are considered together rather than sequentially.  The aim of the single procedure is to help reduce waiting times significantly.  The Department is aiming to reduce processing times for all first instance decisions to nine months by the end of this year.</p> <p>  The Department is also actively working on securing additional capacity both in existing centres and through sourcing new centres.  The International Protection Accommodation Service has sought expressions of interest from parties that would be interested in providing accommodation and related services and has also launched a nationwide, regional tendering process to source new accommodation centres.</p> <p>  The funding requirements and policy responses relating to direct provision will need to be kept under review on a whole-of-government basis throughout 2020.  An interdepartmental group has been established recently to enhance the provision of services from the range of Departments and agencies involved in providing direct provision services.  As part of that group's work, it is considering the use of State-owned sites.  The interdepartmental group is due to report shortly and the group&rsquo;s recommendations will have an impact on this area of expenditure.  The report will undoubtedly be on the committee's agenda early in the new year.  Former European Union Commission Secretary General Ms Catherine Day is currently chairing a separate group examining international best practice in the provision of services to international protection applicants with a view to advising the Government on medium to long-term service provision.</p> <p>  There are a number of other areas in the Vote where there are overspends and underspends and they are set out in the Supplementary Estimate briefing provided to the committee.  The overspends primarily relate to a number of the administrative subheads, including salaries and ICT, criminal legal aid, the Magdalen fund, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the coroner service.  The objective of providing an additional &euro;2.3 million to the Magdalen fund subhead is to finalise applications under the scheme at the earliest possible time.  It has been possible due to underspends in certain subheads and surplus receipts to offset these additional requirements and reduce the amount in respect of the costs of direct provision.</p> <p>  The larger underspend relates to the capital provision for the forensic science laboratory.  An amount of &euro;19.5 million, including capital carryover, was provided in 2019; it now appears that the underspend will be in the region of &euro;17 million.  Site preparation works have been carried out but the construction work has not commenced, pending the outcome of the tender process, which I understand is due to conclude very shortly.  Project management and delivery, including planning, procurement, architectural, mechanical and electrical aspects, will be the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, OPW, with funding being provided from the Department of Justice and Equality capital budget.</p><p>The OPW will chair the project team, comprising representatives of the OPW, Forensic Science Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department, and this will remain <i>in situ</i>for the duration of the project.  It is expected there will be surplus receipts of about &euro;20 million, which will also reduce the amount of additional Exchequer funding.  The surplus receipts are generated from a continuing upward trend in immigration registration and visa fees, together with approximately &euro;6 million in additional EU funding, mainly under the European Social Fund and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.  I thank the committee and I look forward to engagement on this issue.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>

On additional investment in transport, I note the total Garda fleet allocation of &euro;11 million in 2019.  I come from a Border county and live in Dundalk.  It is important that we see a Garda presence along the Border from Omeath to Donegal.  The Minister referred to end-of-life vehicles.  There are problems with some of the Garda cars in Dundalk caused by high mileage and so on.  Where will the &euro;11 million be spent?  The Minister mentioned the front line.  Will most of it be spent in the Border areas, Dublin, Cork or elsewhere?  Will many extra vehicles be provided and will many vehicles be taken off the road?  Will this money be used to replace old vehicles or to pay for additional vehicles?  With Brexit, the M1 corridor and easy access to motorways, the last thing we want to see is fuel laundering, people coming across the Border and everything else.  In what way will this &euro;11 million be spent on the Garda fleet?</p></speech>

In the northern region, transport has seen a greater level of engagement, consequent on the investment.  A further &euro;11 million is being provided this year for augmenting the Garda fleet.  The projected figure is for in the region of 300 vehicles, be they patrol cars, vans or large sport utility vehicles, SUVs, for the armed support unit, with which the Deputy will be familiar as they are very much in evidence in the Border area.  As of 31 October, the &euro;11 million allocation has delivered 287 vehicles.  The disbursement of those vehicles across the various divisions is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner has prioritised the Border areas with particular reference to ongoing criminal activity.  I refer to the new armed support unit in Cavan that is up and running.  As well as having up to 23 personnel, the new unit also has vehicles.  There have been armed support units <i>in situ</i>for a number of years in Dundalk and Ballyshannon.  The extra armed support unit in Cavan will augment Garda personnel and equipment, including vehicles, in that area.  I am happy to assure the Deputy that new vehicles are on stream in the area.  On the replacement of vehicles, members will be aware the stock within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in need of ongoing replacement.  It is estimated that once a Garda car travels more than 300,000 km, its life is probably at an end.</p></speech>

Will the new vehicles replace 287 vehicles?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.1039" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019120400002#C00500"><p>No, there will be a net increase, depending on the area.  The allocation is made by the Garda Commissioner.  The priority is areas of need but the 287 new vehicles already been procured and the balance of approximately 13 or more to come before the end of the year will allow for a net increase.  The latest figures I have show that 22% of the fleet is under two years old compared with 5% of the fleet being of that age in 2012.  We are ensuring that, over a period of time, emphasis can be placed on replacing the older vehicles in the fleet that are standard vehicles with high powered cars, vans, motorcycles and 4x4 vehicles.  I can give the Deputy a note on the position in Dundalk and County Louth but, as it is his constituency, he will be familiar with the situation in Drogheda where we saw a considerable increase in Garda numbers and appropriate equipment to meet a specific requirement in recent times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.1040" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1441" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019120400002#C00600"><p>I am concerned not about the age of the vehicles but the mileage.  Many of the cars in the Dundalk and Drogheda areas could be used on a 24-hour basis and it would not take long to get 300,000 km on the clock.  The vehicle could be only two or three years old.  The age of the vehicle does not bother me.  The figure of 287 new vehicles seems high but I have a feeling that many more cars are coming off the road.  That is my main concern.  I appreciate the Minister's statement that he will revert to me with more details.</p> <p>  I welcome the increase in the budget for 2019 to 1.882 billion.  That is a large amount of money for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but it will be money well spent.  The Minister referred to the larger Garda presence in Drogheda, County Louth, which, in fairness, seems to be working.  I also welcome that 700 extra garda&iacute; passed out from Templemore in 2019.  It is important to see more garda&iacute; on the beat, more patrol cars and more speed checks.  A couple of years ago, the Minister stated that approximately 400 civilians would be employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take over clerical work.  I note that part of the &euro;1.882 billion is for additional Garda staff.  Will they be civilians?  The sooner we get these people trained and working, the sooner we will have more garda&iacute; on the streets doing the job they are supposed to do.  What is meant by the reference to additional Garda staff?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.1041" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019120400002#C00700"><p>I welcome what the Deputy has said about the investment.  We will continue to invest in the Garda fleet to allow the Garda Commissioner to ensure he has the best possible tools available to him.  Some 53% of the Garda fleet is less than four years old, whereas 12% of the fleet is less than one year old.  I take the point the Deputy makes about the mileage or number of kilometres done by Garda vehicles.  That is an issue I have discussed with the Garda Commissioner.  It is important the Garda ensures its fleet is up to the highest standard.</p><p>The object of the exercise, in terms of Government policy and also in terms of the ambition of the Garda Commissioner and his team, is that by 2021 we will have a Garda service of 21,000 personnel.  That will comprise 15,000 sworn members, of which we have just over 14,000 now, 4,000 Garda staff and 2,000 Garda reservists.  The Garda staff is extremely important in the context of the overall composition of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Commissioner is recruiting specialists in many areas, for example, in human resources, bookkeeping and accountancy, and IT.  An important theme throughout the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is ensuring that a level of expertise is available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that oftentimes involves more than just the involvement of sworn members of the Garda.  There are currently just under 3,000 full-time Garda staff undertaking administrative and technical duties, which accounts for up to 15% of the Garda service.  Progress is continuing to be made on the matter of civilianisation.  Since 2018, over 500 garda&iacute; have been deployed from what might be regarded as desk, administrative or office duties to front-line policing duties.  Members of this committee will be very much aware of what the people want.  Citizens feel most assured by the availability and visibility of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I know the target is 4,000.  I welcome the extra 500 front-line garda&iacute; in the area.  Will the extra Garda staff coming on stream in 2019 help to increase the civilian staff from 3,000 to 4,000?  Is that going to happen in a short period?  If we can get a couple of hundred more garda&iacute; on the beat and on patrol, it would be very good.  I cannot complain because, in fairness, the situation we had in Drogheda was very serious and when the Garda Commissioner and Minister were asked to come, they left no stone unturned.  The people in Drogheda can sleep an awful lot better at night.  The sooner we can get the other 1,000 civilians into the Garda, the better.  I welcome that the Garda force is 14,000 at present.  By when is it hoped to have the full strength of 21,000?</p></speech>

If I may say by way of concluding comment, this is a very difficult undertaking.  We need to acknowledge the extent and breadth of change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Commissioner Harris and his team and the modernisation project.  It involves recruitment of specialist administrative staff.  It also involves change in work practices and issues that impinge upon industrial relations.  I am satisfied, as is the Garda Commissioner, that the Government objective of having 15,000 sworn members, 4,000 civilian staff and 2,000 reservists by 2021 is on target to be met.  The reservists figure is subject to implementation of the findings of a review.  I am sure the Garda Commissioner will have an opportunity to explore this further with the committee as we move nearer to 2021.</p></speech>

To give one example, a competition for lawyers yielded a far lower candidate pool than was envisaged.  That resulted in the under-filling of posts in that area.

The system where people are deemed wards of court is progressing until such a time as this office is up and running.  We clarified that recently.  The final two matters are Garda overtime and the cost of the asylum process.  I welcome the fact that there are two committees.  I wish that they had been set up much earlier in a proactive manner.  The increasing numbers in direct provision is unacceptable.  It was eminently foreseeable by the Department.  We raised it many times at the Committee of Public Accounts and we have asked for forward planning.  Subject to being corrected by the Department, some 847 currently have permission to stay, and while I do not like the word "stuck", they have to remain in the direct provision system, which is unacceptable.  We have 1,500, or one less, in emergency accommodation.  If we look at the past 20 years, with the Committee of Public Accounts having published a quarterly report recently, since it was brought in as a temporary measure, this year is no higher than other years.  There were three or four years where the figures were also very high.  If one looks at the graph for the 20-year period, it was eminently foreseeable that there would be ups and downs in the numbers that we have to take under our obligations.  At this stage, we have set up two committees.  The Minister said in his opening statement that one would report in January.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Since he has taken office, the overtime budget has been reduced by more than &euro;11 million.  This year it is running to a figure of the order of &euro;100 million.  This is a sensitive issue.  It often surprises me, and sometimes disappoints me, to see so much of the debate on Garda issues focusing on overtime.  I support the Commissioner in the management of overtime.  This issue has engaged this committee and my Department.</p> <p>  In the context of the recruitment of garda&iacute;, if there is a net intake of 400 or 500 garda&iacute; each year, allowing for the retirements of 250 to 300 garda&iacute; of retirement age, the overtime budget will not need to be as high.  We now have thousands of additional garda&iacute; engaged in full-time duties up and down the country.  The Garda Commissioner is keen to manage the overtime budget over the coming years in a way that will not impact upon the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ensuring that communities are protected and safe.</p></speech>

That was a recommendation of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have the greatest respect for An Garda.  I want to see more garda&iacute; on the street and out among the communities.  To do that, we have to use finances effectively.  The money has to be allocated appropriately.  I am not making an issue of overtime.  I ask the Minister and the Department what policy analysis, as recommended by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has been carried out?</p></speech>

In fact, one of the reform initiatives with regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on which my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have engaged relates to multi-annual budgets.  The best means by which to adequately plan is to ensure that budgets are secured.  The Garda Commissioner and I are keen to make further progress on that, particularly with regard to an issue that accounts for as much of the Garda budget as overtime.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the additional policing costs arising from the visits of President Trump and Vice President Pence are not to come out of existing Garda resources but the Minister will agree that they represent a significant amount.  Additional policing for the two visits cost &euro;15 million.  We want to be hospitable and welcoming but perhaps we should be careful in the manner in which we issue invitations to high-powered and important guests.</p> <p>  With regard to the direct provision budget, the estimate for the year was &euro;70 million but that costs have increased to &euro;130 million.  I hope that we will be able to challenge and deal with this issue in the near future, particularly through the provision of secure accommodation, which will not result in excessive charges on the State.  Does the Minister wish to comment on either matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-04a.1089" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019120400002#F00500"><p>VIP visits are important to the State's conduct of its business and to our international relations.  The Government is often not in immediate control of the timing or extent of such visits.  In that regard, it is important that security issues are met to ensure the smooth conduct of such visits.  They are not new and I have no doubt they will continue.  I accept that they are the main reason for this Supplementary Estimate.  As Minister, I am keen to ensure that we manage our budgets in a way that obviates the need for Supplementary Estimates.  We have discussed this at the committee in the past.  Suffice it to say that the Supplementary Estimate we are discussing is, by and large, a result of a visit from the President of the US and a visit by the Vice President later in the year.  I would not call the visits unexpected or unannounced.  They are part and parcel of the work of the State.  Having regard to the special relationship between Ireland and the US, it was essential that an appropriate welcome to the State was given, with all of the attendant security issues attached thereto.</p> <p>  On the matter of direct provision, this is one of the greatest challenges within the Department.  It is not possible to say with certainty the amount that will have to be expended next year.  I point to the two committees Deputy Connolly mentioned.  One of these, the interdepartmental committee is of great importance as it acknowledges that direct provision requires a whole-of-Government response rather than a response from the Department only.  We must engage with the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Rural and Community Development and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I agree with Deputy Connolly that we have almost 850 overstayers, as they may be regarded.  These are people who have been given status and who are in a position to work and engage in our society and economy in the same manner as Irish citizens but who are unable to transition.  This is why I acknowledge the work of housing agencies, particularly Depaul Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust, and the local authorities in ensuring a reasonably smooth transition.</p></speech>

I come from County Louth where two garda&iacute; were murdered in recent years.  When a garda leaves the house for the day, there is no guarantee that he or she will come back.  I have always said that the Garda does a fantastic job and has done over recent years, especially when Templemore college was closed and Garda numbers were decreasing.  It is great that the Garda college is open again and all these new recruits are coming out.</p> <p>  I refer to direct provision.  The increase from &euro;70 million to &euro;130 million seems like a lot.  The Minister mentioned in his report that the Government is considering using State-owned sites.  Does he have any in mind?  What locations are being talked about?  He also says that he is looking for expressions of interest for the provision of accommodation and sites.  Does he have any places in mind for this?  There are 39 accommodation centres.  At present more than 6,000 people live in them.  There are also 37 emergency accommodation locations housing approximately 1,500.  This has been steadily increasing in recent years, increasing from 5,000 to 7,000.  What are the Minister's plans for the future?  As he has included this proposal in his statement, I am sure he is looking at some sites.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who works most assiduously in this challenging area, and I are anxious to look beyond the private sector.  We are now looking at State lands and premises across the public sector estate to explore the idea of the public sector playing its part in making suitable premises available, if possible.  It is important that at all times we speak about suitable premises.  In this regard, I will mention the importance of the McMahon principles and the work of independent persons such as Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, the Ombudsman, who I understand was recently before the committee, and the Ombudsman for Children, all of whom act as independent agents to ensure high standards.</p><p>I do not underestimate the challenge we are facing or the less than satisfactory nature of what we are doing.  I am keen to improve this area, but we must acknowledge our national and international obligations in what is, from an accounting point of view, a demand-led scheme.  This year, the number of people arriving at our ports and shores has increased by up to 60%.  We often receive up to 50 or 60 people a week who are in need of international protection.  When they apply for international protection, we have a solemn duty as a State to ensure they are given appropriate accommodation, shelter and food, and that their well-being is looked after while their applications are being processed.  I am keen to move towards a mix of public and private sector accommodation, rather than relying exclusively on the private sector as we have done up to now. </p></speech>

We are again joined by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and his officials.  They are all very welcome.

I appreciate the committee making time today not only for the Supplementary Estimates, but also for this Bill.  I acknowledge that this meeting falls in the middle of a busy week, and indeed, that any time is a busy time for this committee.  I very much welcome this opportunity.</p><p>I am joined by my senior officials: Ms Madeline Reid, Ms Noreen Walsh, and Mr. Terence O'Hagan.  The Bill gives further effect to the thirty-seventh amendment to the Constitution by removing the statutory provisions that define an offence of blasphemy.  Members will recall that the Thirty-Seventh Amendment of the Constitution, which was approved by the people in last year&rsquo;s referendum, removed the requirement that publishing or uttering blasphemous matter shall be considered a criminal offence under Article 40.6.1(i).  Notwithstanding that referendum, the offence of blasphemy remains on the Statute Book, by virtue of sections 36 and 37 of the Defamation Act 2009.  These sections were included in the 2009 Act by the then Government in an attempt to define an offence of blasphemy that would be consistent with the Supreme Court judgment in Corway <i>v. </i>Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Ltd.  This Bill proposes to repeal those sections, thus abolishing the statutory offence of blasphemy.</p><p>Section 1 is an avoidance of doubt provision, which aims to make it absolutely clear that the old common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel no longer exist.  Sections 2 and 3 remove the references to &ldquo;blasphemous&rdquo; in section 7 of the Censorship of Films Act 1923 and section 3(2) of the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Act 1925, which relate to civil matters.  While these amendments are not technically necessary to give effect to the referendum on the constitutional amendment, they are within the spirit of it.  Section 4 repeals sections 36 and 37 of the 2009 Act, thus abolishing the statutory offence of blasphemy and a related provision.  Section 5 is a standard citation and commencement provision. </p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, in 2019, as the Government advanced its original preparations for the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, supplementary funds were not available for new initiatives or programmes.  However, the Department has successfully secured funds to support its ongoing work in some key areas.  As a result, &euro;10 million has been agreed with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to boost investment across the transport, tourism and sport sectors.  The &euro;10 million is being allocated as current expenditure, primarily in the two programme areas of public transport and tourism.  The Estimates for 2019 already provide an overall current allocation to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport of &euro;755 million.  This additional money will now bring the total allocation to &euro;765 million.  Our total allocation is used to provide vital tourism investment, as well as to support the ongoing delivery of the remit of the National Transport Authority, NTA.</p> <p>  I will briefly go through the areas receiving this additional money.  As part of the land transport programme, in the public transport area, &euro;617,000 has been allocated to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  This is to fund an estimate of &euro;308,000 in pensions non-pay which arose during the re-profiling of the pension estimate in 2018 from pay to non-pay.  Some &euro;309,000 is to assist in the purchase during 2019 of preliminary breath test devices used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to test drivers for alcohol consumption.  A sum of &euro;583,000 has been allocated to the NTA to purchase approximately 325,000 anonymous Leap cards to ensure that sufficient stocks are in place early next year.  A further &euro;1 million has been provided to the NTA, with &euro;100,000 being allocated for additional general administrative expenditure, &euro;450,000 for ICT infrastructure licensing and system updates, and &euro;450,000 for rental costs associated with additional accommodation.  Those costs are required to be paid in advance under the terms of the rental contracts.</p> <p>  Turning to the sports programme, some &euro;800,000 is being allocated to Sport Ireland for high performance sport.  This funding will be used to assist athletes&rsquo; preparations for major competitions, including the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo and key World and European Championship events.  In the tourism programme, &euro;1 million will be spent by F&aacute;ilte Ireland on domestic marketing, with a particular focus on the Border counties.  This marketing will include social media campaign engagement with Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland consumers, data analytics on Northern Ireland consumers, a domestic print campaign and a local expert programme supporting Border counties.  Some &euro;6 million will be spent by Tourism Ireland on a programme of reassurance concerning Ireland as a tourist destination, given the uncertainties raised by Brexit.  The new deadline for Brexit means that the UK can still leave with no-deal if the withdrawal agreement with the EU is not ratified by the British Parliament by 31 January 2020.  As a result, it is vital that my Department continues to take steps to provide as much certainty as possible in our tourist markets.</p></speech>

The rent is usually payable quarterly in advance.  Due to the constraints on administration grant funding, occasionally we have been paying these rentals in the relevant quarter, rather than strictly in advance.  Due to additional funding being available this month, the rentals for quarter one 2020 will be paid in December 2019.</p></speech>

I welcome the money for the "high-octane" sports, for want of a better phrase, but what about minority sports and women's sports?  I am thinking in particular of the hockey team.  Will there be money available for it?  The committee members would, I think, like to see more funding provided to minority sports and women's sports, such as hockey, rowing, karate etc.</p></speech>

Regarding Hockey Ireland, its high performance programme is also fully funded to the end of the year.  There is no more requirement, as far as I know, from Hockey Ireland.</p></speech>

From the figures the Chairman has in front of him, he can see that the Olympic Federation of Ireland is getting &euro;250,000 and Paralympics Ireland is getting the same amount.  Turning to the costs of the high performance programme, Rowing Ireland is getting &euro;70,000; the Irish Amateur Boxing Associations, IABA, is getting &euro;50,000; Swim Ireland is getting &euro;40,000; Horse Sport Ireland is getting &euro;70,000; Cycling Ireland is getting &euro;40,000; and Gymnastics Ireland is getting &euro;30,000.  This is all additional funding.</p></speech>

Those are all high performance sports and I welcome the funding.  Is there any additional funding for women's sports, however?  In particular, is the hockey team, which has qualified for the Olympics, included in this funding?  If it is not, why not?</p></speech>
