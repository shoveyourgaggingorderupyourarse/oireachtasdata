I hope everybody had a good break.  No apologies have been received.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, is here as a permanent witness to the committee.  Members participating remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present in the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  The public business before us this morning is as follows: minutes, accounts, financial statements, correspondence, work programme and any other business.  Before I turn to that business, we will go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters before resuming in public session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We do not have witnesses this morning so we will not be keeping anyone waiting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.7" nospeaker="true" time="09:30:00" ><p>The committee went into private session at 9.34 and resumed in public session at 10.15 a.m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#E00100"><p>The first item is the minutes of our meeting of 14 July, which have been circulated.  Do members wish to raise any issues in respect of those minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.  The next item is accounts and financial statements.  There are a substantial number of these before the committee this morning.  There is a total of 67 accounts and financial statements listed.  The list includes 2020 financial statements and accounts presented to the Oireachtas Library in December 2021 but not yet noted by the committee.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening to the floor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#E00200"><p>As the Cathaoirleach has said, quite a lengthy list of financial statements and accounts has developed since the committee last noted any.  One of the exercises carried out by the liaison officer over the summer, in consultation with my office, was to look back on the accounts that had been presented and any that may have been missed.  There were two sets presented in December that were not picked up.  A kind of filtration system is in place between the Library and so on to identify these.  One of those that were presented in December but which we did not catch is the accounts for University College Dublin for 2019-2020, which were presented on 3 December 2021.  These accounts received a clear audit opinion but I drew attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, which is standard for universities, and some procurement non-compliance in the college.  The second set of accounts that was missed in that trawl was the accounts for the National Concert Hall for 2020.  Those accounts were presented on 21 December 2021 and received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  I will now move on to accounts presented between the last meeting of the committee and earlier this week.  With regard to departmental and other funds, the accounts for the carbon fund for 2021 were presented on 18 July and received a clear audit opinion.  The finance accounts for 2021, which is one of the biggest accounts totalling &euro;70.9 billion, were presented and received a clear audit opinion although I will draw attention to statement 1.5 in the accounts, which discloses exceptional payments made from the Central Fund to the EU arising from an audit of customs.  Further information on that matter is given in statement 1.5.  The credit union fund account for 2021 received a clear audit opinion.  The local government fund account, which is again quite a large account with a turnover of &euro;1.2 billion in 2021, also received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the education sector.  The accounts for the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board for 2020 were presented on 3 August.  They received a clear audit opinion but attention was drawn to non-compliance with procurement rules.  The 2021 accounts for Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board were presented on 22 August and received a clear audit opinion.  The accounts for Waterford Institute of Technology for 2019-2020 received a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to note 28 of the financial statements relating to a continuing going concern there.</p><p>It is something I have drawn attention to over a number of years.  The situation seems to be improving but there is still an issue in relation to that.</p><p> For 2020 to 2021, Dundalk Institute of Technology received a clear audit opinion.  On Athlone Institute of Technology, I refer to dissolution or cessation accounts for the body.  They cover the period 1 September 2020 to 30 September 2021.  That is a 13-month period.  It received a clear audit opinion.  Regarding Limerick Institute of Technology, the accounts are cessation accounts.  The two of them have been merged into a technological university.  The same accounting period applies: 1 September 2020 to 30 September 2021.  It also received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> Next are the accounts for the Institute of Technology Carlow for the period 2020 to 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> With regard to the National College of Art and Design in the period 2020 to 2021, attention is drawn to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset.  This is standard for universities and colleges.  The college presents accounts on the same basis as universities.</p><p> The accounts for the University of Limerick received a clear audit opinion for the period 2020 to 2021.  However, attention is drawn to recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, which, as I said, is standard for universities, and to an element of procurement non-compliance.</p><p> The accounts for Mary Immaculate College received a clear audit opinion for 2020 to 2021, again drawing attention to recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, as for universities.  There was procurement non-compliance in that case as well.</p><p> With regard to the National University of Ireland, the accounts relate to the calendar year 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, Caranua, received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies received a clear audit opinion for 2021.</p><p> The Higher Education Authority received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  There was quite a sizeable account there, with a throughput of &euro;1.8 billion.</p><p> SOLAS also had a big account, amounting to &euro;834 million in 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> Next are the subsidiaries of the National Asset Management Agency.  These are designated-activity companies.  There are ten or 12 of them.  I do not propose to read out all the names.  With regard to one of them, I draw attention to a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of underpayment of professional services withholding tax in the period 2013 to 2016.  The settlement included interest of &euro;1 million and penalties of &euro;0.1 million.  I am drawing attention to that.  Otherwise, all the subsidiaries received a clear audit opinion, and they were all presented on 13 July.</p><p> In the health area, St. James's Hospital, received a clear audit opinion for the accounting period 2021, but I draw attention to non-compliant procurement.</p><p> Dublin Dental University Hospital received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board received a clear audit opinion, again for 2021.</p><p> The Food Safety Authority of Ireland received a qualified audit opinion for 2021.  In this case, the accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable.  However, that is standard accounting treatment for a number of health bodies at the direction of the Minister for Health, but it does not comply with a true and fair view and therefore I have to qualify in relation to it.  Otherwise, the accounts give a true and fair view.</p><p> The Health Insurance Authority, for 2021, received a qualified opinion on a basis similar to the one I have described for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</p><p> The Risk Equalisation Fund, which is managed by the Health Insurance Authority, had quite a sizeable account for 2021, amounting to &euro;803 million.  That received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> The Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal special account and the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal reparation fund account both received a clear audit opinion for 2021.</p><p> The Health Products Regulatory Authority received a qualified audit opinion for 2021.  The same issue arises as the one I described for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements as they become payable.</p><p> With regard to State bodies and their subsidiaries, Enterprise Ireland received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The Office of the Planning Regulator received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The Road Safety Authority received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The Marine Casualty Investigation Board received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The Health and Safety Authority received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The State Examinations Commission received a clear audit opinion for 2021.</p><p> The R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann and Irish Retired Greyhound Trust accounts relate to the accounting period 2020.  The accounts were certified on 12 May 2021 but were presented only on 4 August 2022.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#F00200"><p>What exactly is the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#F00300"><p>It is a trust fund that was set up for the benefit of retired greyhounds, or their welfare.  It received a clear audit opinion.  I believe I mentioned earlier that R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann's accounts for 2021 were signed at the end of June but they have not been presented yet.  I think they are overdue for presentation at this stage.</p> <p>  For 2021, IDA Ireland received a clear audit opinion.  The Economic and Social Research Institute received a clear audit opinion for 2021.</p> <p>  The Heritage Council's account for 2020 was signed off by me on 29 September 2021 but was presented only on 15 August 2022.  It received a clear audit opinion but I think it would be standard practice for the committee to follow up with the council and relevant Department to ascertain why it was late.</p> <p>  The Gathering Project 2013 is actually a dormant company.  It is a subsidiary of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  There is nil turnover on the account but it is maintained as a subsidiary in existence.  Therefore, I have to audit it.  There is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The Royal Irish Academy of Music received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  The Private Security Authority received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  </p> <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman received a clear audit opinion for 2021.  However, I draw attention to note 9 to the financial statements, which deals with superannuation arrangements for staff.  Discussions are ongoing between the office and the Department of Finance on the funding of liabilities under the scheme.  This is something that has been going on for a number of years.  The negotiations have been in train but they have not yet been brought to completion.</p> <p>  Next is the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  It received a clear audit opinion for 2021.</p> <p>  Horse Racing Ireland's group and subsidiary accounts have all been presented.  I signed the group accounts on 28 April.  They were submitted on 12 September.  They received a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to two matters.  First is the loss of &euro;1.8 million in 2020, relating to Horse Racing Ireland's investment in an associate company, Curragh Racecourse Ltd.  This comes after losses in previous years, to which I have also drawn attention.</p><p>The second matter I draw attention to is a disclosure of a loss of &euro;105,000 incurred on the disposal of land through a land swap deal undertaken by the subsidiary the Tipperary Race Company Plc in 2020.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G00200"><p>Has this issue come up before of funding being transferred with regard to Curragh Racecourse Limited?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G00300"><p>Yes.  That is correct.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G00400"><p>Horse Racing Ireland is due to come before us.  I want to clarify that Curragh Racecourse Limited is a separate entity.  It is a limited company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G00500"><p>It is a limited company.  It is an associate rather than a subsidiary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G00600"><p>Mr. McCarthy does not audit that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G00800"><p>My concern is that this loss of &euro;108 million is funding by public money that has gone into this company, and the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have access to audit their accounts and, therefore, the Committee of Public Accounts does not have any remit to examine them.  We should note this for when Horse Racing Ireland is in before the committee.  It is a serious matter that funding is being transferred and the Comptroller and Auditor General has said that there is a loss of &euro;108 million.  Will Mr. McCarthy explain "loss" in this context?  Is it that there is no benefit received from that &euro;1.8 million?  What way is the loss explained?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G00900"><p>The loss is, effectively, on the books of Curragh Racecourse Limited.  The &euro;1.8 million is the share of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, in that loss, so the loss is actually bigger.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G01000"><p>What is the total loss?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G01100"><p>I do not have the detail Chairman.  Certainly we would have that for next week.  I do not audit this associate company because HRI's interest is less than 50% in the associate.  I believe it is about 34%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022091500002#G01200"><p>Okay.</p></speech>

I do not propose to read out the names of all of the subsidiaries there.  They all received a clear audit opinion but with regard to the Tipperary Race Company Plc, I again draw attention to the loss on the disposal of land there.</p> <p>  The final set of accounts that have been presented for noting relate to Waterways Ireland.  This is one of seven North-South bodies that I audit jointly with my counterpart in Northern Ireland.  This relates to 2020.  The accounts were certified on 14 December 2021 but only presented on 2 August.  Again, there is a delay there.  The committee may wish to follow up and to seek an explanation.</p></speech>

It would be very beneficial to have a meeting on that.</p> <p>  On the University of Limerick and Mary Immaculate College, both of which are Limerick based, unfortunately Limerick keeps recurring.

We can pursue that beyond there.  On No. 23, NAMA, and the settlement with the Revenue, withholding tax is always an item that jumps out at me because of the particular entities involved.  Again, that should be something we pursue with them.  This arose also between 2013 and 2016.  When they are in before the committee we should make a note to have a discussion with them about that.  They are not on the committee's work plan at the moment but this would be a residual in that we would have them in pretty much every year.</p></speech>

I just do not know off-hand whether or not it was presented by R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to the Department.  Therefore, if it did not have it, it would not be able to forward it.  Also, because this was a voluntary establishment of a trust fund, I think there may not be a statutory basis for it to be required to be presented.

One relates to the Financial Services and the Pensions Ombudsman.  I refer to the fact that discussions are ongoing between the office and the Department of Finance about funding of liabilities under the schemes.  It may well be useful for us to have them in to discuss that to see where it is at because the issue of pensions keeps cropping up.  At some point in the future I think that that is one we are going to have to put on our work plan.  I also flag that one.</p> <p>  Finally, as for No. 58, did Horse Racing Ireland get prior permission, or would it have required prior permission, for the decisions it took where there was a loss?  Would Mr. McCarthy know that?  I refer to whether it would have to seek authority from the Department in that regard.</p></speech>

It was probably a different environment.  Covid, obviously, had an impact, but there were losses incurred already, even before Covid.  Therefore, if you like, the value of the State's investment in that has already eroded quite significantly.  The 2021 accounts are in preparation.  I have cleared them.  It may be able to provide further information relating to that investment when it appears before the committee next week.</p></speech>

It is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Health, and is dated 15 July.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the Department of Health on 26 May.  Topics addressed include issues regarding CAMHS, that is, child and adolescent mental health services; a progress update on the recommendations in the value for money review on nursing home care costs; dental services; and expenditure to date on the national paediatric hospital, with just over &euro;1 billion of the capital budget of &euro;1.4 billion, which was approved by the Government and has now been drawn down.

The only thing of note I have seen in it is the fact that the figure has now gone over &euro;1 billion, so we are already into a situation where the cost exceeds what the original estimates referred to and we are still some way away from opening the doors of the hospital.  There is nearly another three years, potentially, to go on that project.</p> <p>  I want to raise an issue with dental services.  While there seems to be a budget, a shortfall in staffing for dental services is given.  In the case of Cork's public dental health service - it refers here to children up to their 16th birthday - there are four vacancies, moving from a situation where there was none in December 2021.  We know there is not a large number of staff in some of these services.  In the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dublin south there is a gap of 8.7 whole-time equivalents, and in the case of Louth-Meath they are almost ten staff short there.  It does not state how many staff they have, but I am just thinking there is substantial funding going into that, and positions are not being filled.  I think it is something we need to raise with the HSE again when it is before us.  What is happening here?  Are they not able to recruit?  If they are saying that in CHO 8, in Louth-Meath, they are short ten dentists, I would like to know how many are needed and how many they have.  We have a figure here for what the gap is, but the gap is ten whole-time equivalents.  That is really a serious issue.</p><p>In the midlands CHO, there is a gap of 2.3 FTEs, which is almost 2.5 FTEs.  I wish to raise the fact that there are substantial gaps in areas represented.  </p></speech>

The Minister in question is sitting on a report on the services and education of orthodontists.  We have been unable to get that report from the Minister.

They are not being seen in County Laois, in most cases, before the age of 16, which means that they go to secondary school without ever having seen the school dentist.  The public system for adults, provided through the medical card scheme, has completely collapsed.  People who are already in the system cannot access dental services and dentists will not take new patients.  There are no dentist that we can find who are willing to do it.  We have checked, and my secretary has gone to a lot of effort in doing so.  There is not one who will take on new medical card patients.  There is no dental scheme, so what is the money going into?  Why is there a budget?  Are dentists being recruited?  Are the terms of employment not adequate?  Are they being offered three-month contracts that are useless, or something like that?  What is the problem?  Surely, in a developed economy, we are capable of training dentists and having dentists in place to provide services, such as this.  In the 1960s, they used to do it.  I know, because I attended them.  All the other members here, regardless of whether they are 20 or 60, will have seen a school dentist.</p></speech>

As Deputy Hourigan said, it is gets to the extreme stage.  Therefore, it is really important that this issue is tackled, because a price is being paid, whether it is pain or remediation later on.

It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I flagged this item.  In the correspondence, Mr. McKeon outlines the current situation, stating that the employment status investigation unit, ESIU, is examining the social insurance status of approximately 500 contractors; and that RT&Eacute; provided the Department with lists of those engaged in contract work in 2018, 2019 and 2020, which formed the basis of the investigation.  The correspondence states: "A worker's employment status will still be examined where an individual is no longer engaged or employed by RT&Eacute;.  Therefore, it is possible that some workers, under investigation, are no longer under contract or employed by RT&Eacute;", which clarifies that investigations can be retrospective.  That is welcome.  Mr. McKeon also states that "...7 former contractors who were not included on the original lists provided by RT&Eacute; as being engaged during the period 2018-2020 have contacted the Department directly to be included in the review.  RT&Eacute; has been informed that any individual has the right to seek an insurability decision from the Department of Social Protection."  In fairness, the Department seems to be going back through it.  According to the Department, "Where an individual is determined to be, or have been, in a position of insurable employment, PRSI arrears will be assessed against RTE for the entire period of the misclassification."  The confirmation of that from the Secretary General is welcome.  At the end of his letter, Mr. McKeon notes that "In order to protect the integrity of the investigation process the Department does not normally comment on the status of ongoing investigations.  As previously accepted by the Committee in February...we have committed to providing a report on the outcomes of the investigation upon completion."  I certainly look forward to receiving that report from the Department when it is available and welcome the commitment to provide it.  Do any other members want to address this issue of correspondence?  No.  We will note and publish the item.</p> <p>  No. 1373B, from Ms Dearbhla O'Brien, chief executive officer, Greyhound Racing Ireland, dated 22 July 2022 is a response regarding availability to attend a meeting in September 2022.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Ms O'Brien stated that Greyhound Racing Ireland is happy to attend the committee, but she needed to check availability with the chairman as they have a board meeting.  Later on 22 July, Ms O'Brien came back to say that the date suggested was not suitable as both Mr. Frank Nyhan and Ms O'Brien were unavailable due to prior commitments.</p><p>As we set out in our earlier discussion, we will try to get them in. </p></speech>

That is agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1374B is from Mr. John Hogan, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 22 July 2022, providing information requested by the committee regarding the separation of Irish Water from the Ervia Group.  Members will have noted that, according to the Department, post separation, Irish Water will become accountable to the committee.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  This matter has been a big bone of contention with some of us who were Members of the Thirty-first D&aacute;il, including Deputy Catherine Murphy and me.  At that time, we raised the fact that there was a fatal flaw in the establishment of Irish Water in that it was not going to be accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General or to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is to be welcomed that that is now happening.  Deputy Murphy also flagged this.  </p></speech>

Can we clarify whether the Attorney General will define the economic identity of Irish Water when it is separated from Ervia?  This is quite complicated.  It is more complicated than I appreciated.  When Irish Water was set up, it was intended it would have a very different function from what it has now.  It has control over a very large amount of money and we do not have the kind of oversight this committee requires.  It is one of the entities that would be before us every year, if it was audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This has been going on a very long time.

It appears that the Department does not see a direct role for itself, as the Department responsible for public expenditure, in ensuring that there is transparency in relation to the billions of euro of public funding that goes into the not-for-profit sector each year.  That said, the letter states that "if a public service body were to bring forward a business case to assume a lead funding role predicated on the use of the 'Teckal' exemption, such an arrangement would necessarily form part of the business case assessment".</p><p>No. 1378 B has to do with Benefacts.  We know the substantial role it played in making sure there was transparency.  No. 1403 B is related to this.  It is an issue we might wish to raise with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when it comes before the committee.  Some of the information in the correspondence shows that Benefacts was providing substantial benefits.  Deputy Catherine Murphy had to leave early due to other parliamentary commitments.  She has flagged this issue.  We will hold these items over until next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 1384 B is from Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and is dated 29 July 2022.  It provides further information requested by the committee regarding withholding capital funding from the University of Limerick.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This question came up, as committee members will recall, because funding was withheld.  The letter contains further information on this.  It is a matter we will revisit.  Do members wish to comment on it?  As they do not we will note and publish the item of correspondence.</p><p> No. 1385 B is from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and is dated 29 July 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from the meeting with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 23 June 2022.  It includes a wide range of information on 17 issues spanning 29 pages.  A response to an 18th issue will be forwarded separately.  These arise from the committee&rsquo;s examination of the oversight and governance arrangements in place in the local government sector.  It is somewhat surprising that on page 25, in relation to recommendations made by the Local Government Audit Service, it is stated that no central record of the implementation of recommendations made is maintained by the Local Government Audit Service.  This is an issue we discussed.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Do members want to comment on this?</p></speech>

That would be standard practice.  If the response is that centrally it is not collated and tracked there may be an issue.  Perhaps the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, might take a view.  Particularly where we have more than 30 organisations effectively doing the same type of business if there is a recurrent recommendation for five, six or ten of them perhaps there is something systemic that would need follow-up.  Perhaps a query to NOAC might provide something additional.  At the end of the month, I will publish a chapter on central government funding of local authorities.  It remains an issue.  The oversight and assurance system in place for the committee will always be an issue for discussion.</p></speech>

Normal practice in smaller local authorities is that two elected members are on the audit committee along with external people with accountancy experience.  Their report is presented to the councillors.  The problem is that the councillors may not have the resources or adequate information to be able to scrutinise it properly.  In my experience I never saw it getting the attention it deserved.</p></speech>

It is very difficult for councillors to give it the time and attention it needs.  We are speaking about the local authorities as though they are independent groups or organisations. In other European countries, local authorities can generate their own revenue.  We do not operate in this way in Ireland.  The local authorities draw from central funds.  The fact there is no central record of the implementation of recommendations is quite extraordinary.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General quite rightly identified, we cannot see trends or study the data.  It does not seem like good oversight.</p></speech>

It might be the best thing to do.  We can highlight that we have concerns about this.  While each local authority is an independent political and administrative structure, it receives substantial funding from central government.  In view of this there is a gap, in that there is little or no accountability.  We can ask its view on how this can be rectified.  Would that be satisfactory?</p></speech>

We will also query this issue with NOAC. We will note and publish the item of correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 1390 B is from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, assistant secretary at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and is dated 4 August 2022.  It provides a further update on recommendations made in our report on the examination of the 2019 and 2020 appropriation accounts for Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications and expenditure on the national broadband plan.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I have flagged this as several issues arise.</p><p>There are a couple of issues of note to mention.  One that jumped out was the progress on the national broadband plan.  Things are falling way behind.  As of 30 June, 63,662 households or premises had been passed.  That is a fraction of the original target even bearing in mind that there was a hold-up relating to the pandemic for a number of months.  Of even more concern is the number of connections.  One section of the correspondence relates to key updates and the current targets for National Broadband Ireland, NBI.  The target is that by January 2023, only 102,000 households will be passed.  There will be some 284 community connection points and 679 schools will be provided for.  Those two targets are okay.  However, the target for the number of premises passed has fallen way behind.  The correspondence refers to milestones achieved.  The number premises passed is ahead of target at the end of June, according to this document.  These are moveable targets that keep being changed.  Some 15,000 premises have been connected to the NBI network.  That is 15,000 of more than 500,000.  It is a concern, considering the money that has gone into the project.  Those figures tell me that many of the people in rural areas where the plan is being rolled out have been serviced by another wireless provider.  They are saying they are grand and have not switched over to the NBI system.  We are due to have the representatives of NBI before the committee in the coming weeks and we need to raise this issue with them.  They are way behind and have achieved a fraction of the original targets for premises passed.  Even more concerning from the perspective of value for money and from the point of view of the committee is the section of this document touching on current targets and milestones achieved.  It refers to quarter 2 of 2022.  This correspondence is from 30 June.  Only 15,000 premises have been connected to the NBI network.  We are considering value for money.  Are people suddenly going to decide to switch over?  To date, the rate is minuscule.  Almost &euro;3 billion is going into this project.</p><p> We do not have to do anything at this point, particularly if we are due to have representatives of NBI before the committee in the coming weeks.  However, those are the central issues we need to raise with them.  Does any other member wish to comment on this correspondence?</p></speech>

We will hold back No. 1410B and deal with it next week.</p> <p>  No. 1422B is from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, dated 29 August.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding energy ratings of local authority-owned social houses and the numbers serviced by solid fuel central heating systems and with single-glazed windows.  It is proposed to note and publish the correspondence.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I have flagged this correspondence for discussion.  Members will see the figures included.  I know that substantial work is being done in the local authority sector, in some counties at least, on energy upgrades for local authority housing.  Some of the older housing stock has not been touched yet because those houses are constructed with mass concrete and require more extensive work, including external wraparounds and that type of thing.  That is obviously an issue of concern.  Mr. Doyle sets out the progress to date in respect of cost.  He also states that a certain amount of information is held by the local authorities themselves.  Some &euro;85 million was provided under the programme for 2022 to allow for the retrofit of 2,400 homes.</p></speech>

Some of the local authorities have done very good work to increase the energy efficiency of homes.  That is to be welcomed and the more of it, the better.  Individual local authorities have engineers who are focusing specifically on this type of work and who have expertise in the area.</p><p>The correspondence states: </p> <blockquote> 	Local authorities are asked to ensure that the average cost per home drawn down under the programme is circa &euro;36,000, including project management fees.  Adhering to this average would ensure the maximum number of homes can be retrofitted ...   </blockquote> <p>The cost of the works seems to be coming in around that figure.  I do not have an answer to the following point.  Some of the premises that are being retrofitted were built in the 1990s and others in the 2000s.  We also need to consider houses that were built in 1937 and that have not yet been touched.  I have raised this issue with the Minister.  It is something we should continue to push in our political groups.  Perhaps next year we should try to get external wraparounds on those older houses.</p></speech>

I live in a 1930s poured concrete building.  It retains heat.  Some of the insulation standards from the 1990s were lower.  That might be some of the thinking involved.</p></speech>

Thousands of such houses do not have any insulation or concrete walls, with no dry lining or anything on either side of the walls.  We need to push this matter within our political groupings.  We will note and publish this correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 1424B is from Mr. Dave Walsh, chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, dated 30 August 2022, providing information requested by the committee during our meeting with the board on 14 July.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

We are in the middle of a housing crisis, but when we specifically asked the chair of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to point out where in the specific planning policy requirements, SPPRs, it stated there were minimum densities, he replied with the same letter that he sent two years ago, despite the fact that, after receiving that letter, the Minister declared in the D&aacute;il that there were no minimum densities.</p> <p>  This is a complicated planning policy issue and this is why we do not have housing stock.  Densities are pertinent to urban areas where there is transport infrastructure, so they can be dictated there.  They cannot be dictated in rural Ireland on the same basis, yet that is what is happening.  When county development plans are being drawn up, the Planning Regulator is insisting through his office that minimum densities are imputed as a matter of law, but they are not.  That is why we have a judicial review bill of &euro;20 million.  I do not accept that the chair of an organisation like An Bord Plean&aacute;la can give an answer that he clearly knows I received previously.  I asked the question again because that answer was incorrect, yet he has sent back the same reply.  Either he needs to be reprimanded or he should be asked for the specific answer to the question that was put to him.</p></speech>

The real issue is that houses are not being built.  Planning permissions are not being applied for because minimum densities are being imputed.  With a minimum density of 35 dwellings her hectare, we are getting terraced houses and apartments.  Apartments are expensive to build.  I am not talking about Dublin or city-oriented policy, which really only means Dublin.  I am talking about rural and regional towns where such projects do not fit.  Developers are not applying, which is leading to a housing shortage.  They cannot afford to build apartments for less than the open market price.  Clearly, they will not build apartments if they cannot sell them, meaning we will just be providing social housing rather than affordable housing.  The densities should be imputed by local councillors at their own discretion based on their local knowledge.  SPPRs are included in certain legislation, but they do not stipulate minimum densities.  The Planning Regulator, purportedly the overseer of his own policy, says that there are minimum densities, yet no one from his office to the chair of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to the Minister has been able to show me where it is in legislation.  This issue is causing untold hardship and the housing crisis.</p></speech>

It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will now move on to correspondence from and relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 1362C, which is from an individual and dated 13 July 2022, is further correspondence to the committee regarding the social welfare appeals office and the alleged use of test cases.  The individual previously corresponded with the committee and, at the meeting of 2 June, we agreed to advise the correspondent that our report on the examination of the 2019 Appropriation Account for Vote 9 &ndash; Office of the Revenue Commissioners recorded the committee's position on the matter arising from the evidence that was presented to it.  Regarding the correspondent's question as to whether the committee has found evidence of a test case, this matter has been raised with the Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in writing and during engagements.  The committee has received conflicting accounts on the use of test cases but it is not an adjudicative body.  However, in terms of the wider issue of bogus self-employment, the committee will continue to pursue the matter in a manner consistent with its role.  It is proposed to advise the correspondent accordingly.</p><p>There are two pieces of correspondence that are kind of relevant to this.  Just bear with me for a second while I reference these.  I looked at these last night and had a discussion with the clerk about this.  One is No. 1009 from Revenue.  Basically, the correspondent is asking whether we have proof of a test case.  </p><p> Please hold for one second while I clarify this. </p><p> I was just checking which one was published and which one was not.  The clerk is going back through the records of the committee to check this.  No. 1009 was published and it is from 4 August 2000.  That is how far we are going back.  It was sent to Jerome Flanagan, who was, at that time, part of the secretariat here.  The relevant part of it states that for the purpose of insurability under social welfare law, a motorcycle courier was found to be self-employed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs appeals tribunal some years ago.  The decision was not challenged further through the High Court on a point of law and, consequently, would stand for social insurance purposes.  That is the reference.  </p><p> There is another letter, but it was not published.  Therefore, we are not in a position to do anything with that.  The one that is published is, obviously, a committee document.  It is published and out there.  I would suggest we help the correspondent by supplying the letter to him, referencing correspondence No. 1009 from 4 August 2000 to this committee.  It is 22 years old.  Thanks for that.  Please bear with me because I am juggling a number of pieces of correspondence.  We will bring the published correspondence to the correspondent's attention.</p><p> The next piece of correspondence is No. 1366C from Deputy Catherine Murphy.  It is dated 19 July and is a proposal to request information on track attendance at Shelbourne Park Greyhound Stadium from Greyhound Racing Ireland.  Deputy Murphy flagged this and it is her correspondence.  I suggest that we put it to next week, if that is agreeable.  Agreed.</p><p> I will move on to our work programme.  In our last meeting, on 14 July, we agreed to the following engagements for this term.  Horse Racing Ireland will be here next week, 22 September, with representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board.  On 29 September, we will engage with the HSE, focusing on mental health expenditure in Community Healthcare Organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8.  If there are specific issues within either of those areas, we should put those on the agenda.  I know there is one in CHO 8 that has to be included.  In CHO 4, there are matters that have been identified.  On 6 October we will again engage with the HSE about expenditure on emergency services and its 2021 financial statements.  Along with the emergency hospital services, the ambulance service was a specific issue that we wanted to address.  On 30 September, which will be budget week, the Comptroller and Attorney General will publish the 2021 appropriation accounts and the report on the accounts of the public services and that will assist us in planning engagements for the term.  </p><p> We have already discussed a number of potential engagements and will discuss those further once availability has been confirmed for October.  Do members wish to raise any other matters in relation to the work programme?</p></speech>

We invited officials and want them to come before us in October.  That is it.  The Secretary General has mentioned unavailability.  However, the secretariat will revert back to them and we will confirm that we are actually requesting their attendance here and there is a requirement on the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to attend.</p> <p>  That concludes our consideration of the work programme.  There is another matter of business.  I raise the issue of the Siteserv investigation inquiry.  Obviously, the inquiry has happened and has been a six-year project.  It has cost in the region of &euro;30 million.  I only caught the headline figures on this, but the main finding was that the maximum potential loss to the taxpayer from the sale of Siteserv by the Irish Bank Resolution&rsquo;s Corporation, IBRC, would have been in the region of &euro;8 million to &euro;30 million.  It took six years to find that out.  </p> <p>  The Moriarty tribunal, as I recall, was in the region of &ndash; I have a note here &ndash; &euro;66 million at the end of 2021.  That does not count third-party costs, which normally match that or will be well in excess of it.  The figure will probably be in the region of &euro;150 million by the end of it.  </p> <p>  I refer again to the &euro;30 million for the Siteserv inquiry.  Members will recall it had a value of &euro;140 million and IBRC sold it to Denis O&rsquo;Brien for &euro;41 million, if I recall.  It was in the newspapers last week.  There was then a six-year inquiry into that sale that cost &euro;30 million.</p></speech>

I think the figure is an expectation of third-party payments, which would perhaps bring it to &euro;30 million.

The expected figure is &euro;30 million.  There are hundreds of millions piling up.  The question has to be asked why some of these cases are not referred in the first instance to the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na white-collar crime squad to investigate.  There has to be a quicker way of trying to get to the bottom of what is going on.  When the report of the inquiry comes out &ndash; which it has in this case &ndash; if the white-collar crime unit wants to look at it, it can do that.  However, is it the case that it should be the other way around?  Is there a better way of doing these inquiries?  My understanding is these are set up under the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

As Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, I have serious concerns that there are bills of hundreds of millions of euro being landed on the taxpayer for these inquiries that take years and, in some cases, decades to carry out, and no one ever prosecuted at the end.  The findings are made and they go onto a shelf.  The inquiry into Siteserv will now join Moriarty and all of the other tribunals on the shelf.  The bill was paid.  The only benefit is to the legal profession, which charges huge fees.  The whole Siteserv thing and the Moriarty and other various tribunals may have scandals within them.  From the taxpayers' point of view, they may have something to say perhaps after we send over what we have done.  However, there is a huge issue here in how we are going about investigating these.  There has to be a better way.  I certainly would like to hear expert opinion on this.  Is there a better way of carrying out these inquiries?</p><p>Should they be referred in the first instance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Is the Garda white collar crime unit, which was set up a number of years ago to deal with white collar crime, the body that should be looking at these in the first instance?  I do not think we can sit back as the Committee of Public Accounts.  There will be another of these, and then another, over the next couple of years, regardless of who is in government.  If tens or hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money is spent, what will it be spent for?  Will it be to gather dust on a shelf?  When this came out last week, I thought, "Here we go again".  As Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, I will not stand over this.</p></speech>

I reiterate that we all think that these things should be investigated.  We need to get better at investigating them.  If something is being investigated and the investigation costs more than the wrongdoing did, it does not make any sense.  Could this committee do something to include the Revenue Commissioners in this discussion?  Maybe Revenue could be included to address an issue of this scale.  That may be a pathway to prosecution.  I do not know how we would normally interact with the Revenue Commissioners.  I did not read the 1,500 pages of this report and I am not sure that anyone will ever read it.  What is the purpose of this report?  It must be referred to somebody for further action.</p></speech>

Maybe somebody else will dispute them.  I have not sat down and spent nights and days reading through them either.  The costs of this process have escalated into hundreds of millions of euro.  The process issues a report after many years.  It gets a day of coverage by the media, which is fair enough, since the media are doing their job.  That is it, then the report goes onto a shelf.  There has to be a better way to do this.  What models are used internationally?  Are there better ways to do this?  Are there less expensive ways?  Might a lesser inquiry have a time-limited first-stage examination of the facts available, by a legal person and an accountant, or another team of suitably qualified people, who could then decide whether to make a recommendation that this should go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or to a commission of inquiry?  Instead, we have these lengthy processes with a bill that potentially runs to over &euro;100 million.  From the point of view of the public money of the taxpayer, when there are people in Mountjoy for not paying their television licence, where they are brought for one day before being sent home again, or for shoplifting, maybe for stealing cigarettes from a shop because they have an addiction, or drink worth &euro;50 from an off-licence-----</p></speech>

There have been a number of tribunals.</p></speech>

I think, as the Committee of Public Accounts, that we need to apprise ourselves of how much has been paid for various tribunals and inquiries over the last 25 years.  What are the expected final costs?  The Moriarty tribunal is not fully paid for.</p></speech>

The previous committee made that inquiry, so there may already be data up to 2019.  It would just be a matter of adding the other information.  I think it was addressed to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform rather than the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Department of the Taoiseach has responsibility for the Moriarty tribunal, the Cregan report and the Cooke commission, but other Departments have other commissions.  I think the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform pulled it together.  If my memory is correct, that may already be there as a base.  When the appropriation accounts are published, if a commission of inquiry is being operated, the accumulated expenditure is in the appropriation account.  In a couple of weeks, we will be able to bring those up to date, to the end of 2021.</p></speech>

We would at least have the facts.  Then we can maybe see the options with regard to what has been happening.  As a State, I do not think we can allow the situation to continue the way it is going.  It seems bizarre.  The thing that jumped out at me was that there is an expected final cost of &euro;30 million.  I am not disputing the finding.  The finding was that the maximum potential loss to the taxpayer may have been another &euro;8 million higher.  In other words, it would have been sold for &euro;48 million or &euro;49 million instead of what it was sold for, which was &euro;41 million.</p></speech>

I think we have been through this before, where it has been found that inquiries or commissions were ongoing for lengthy periods.  There have been a number of iterations and a number of models have been used and are being used now, which may be different.  For example, in the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach, there is a tribunal of inquiry and there are commissions of investigation.  This was a commission of investigation, which was supposed to be the better, more effective and cheaper model.</p></speech>

One does not want to start many inquiries into matters of rumour because it is so expensive to investigate and inquire into matters.  One needs evidence.  That is the issue that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might have.  If there is no evidence of something going wrong, it is not likely to commence an investigation.</p></speech>

I see that we have some members present in committee room 4.  Apologies have been received from Senators Craughwell, Buttimer and Warfield at this stage.  We have substitutions.  Deputy Quinlivan is substituting for Senator Warfield and Senator Maria Byrne is substituting for Senator Buttimer.</p> <p>  The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, have published a Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community from March 2022.  Face masks should continue to be worn when people are moving around the campus and during the meeting except when speaking.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.  We ask for full co-operation on this.  </p> <p>  First on our agenda is to approve the minutes of the private and public meetings on 6, 7 and 13 July 2022.  They have already been approved at a virtual private meeting, but we must do this for procedural reasons.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>   I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Our next business is the engagement with the officials from the mental health services at Cork Kerry Community Healthcare, Cork Mental Health Services and Capital and Estates HSE South of the HSE board on Petition No. 00042/21 on saving the services of the Owenacurra Centre, Midleton, County Cork from Ms Joanna Curtis.  </p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references to other persons or evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue the remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with such direction.  Before we hear from our witnesses, I propose we publish their opening statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On a side note, we would like to remind members that we are here to tease out issues rather than individual cases at Owenacurra where the person is identifiable.  </p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I would like to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Jim Ryan, acting national director of community operations and assistant national director, head of operations of mental health services; Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer, Cork Kerry Community Healthcare; Dr. Sinead O&rsquo;Brien, executive clinical director of Cork Mental Health Services; and Mr. Alan O&rsquo;Connell, assistant national director of Capital and Estates HSE South.  I understand that it is Mr. Michael Fitzgerald who will make the opening statement and I suggest he should make it for around ten minutes.  We will then have questions and comments from members.  We will give each member around ten minutes, which should allow members to come in more than once.</p> <p>  I now invite Mr. Fitzgerald to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Dr. Sinead O&rsquo;Brien, executive clinical director of Cork Mental Health Services and consultant psychiatrist, Mr. Jim Ryan, head of operations of HSE Mental Health Services and Mr. Alan O&rsquo;Connell, assistant national director of HSE Estates.  I take this opportunity to thank the committee for the invitation to address it and discuss Petition No. P00042/21 on saving the services of the Owenacurra Centre, Midleton, County Cork.</p> <p>  First, I acknowledge the moving testimony given to this committee by Dr. Orla Kelleher when it discussed the closure of the centre earlier this year.  We understand that moving from the Owenacurra Centre to a new home is difficult for residents  and we are working hard to ensure that every resident&rsquo;s transition is as supported as much as possible.  I hope that the details that we share today explain the reasons for the difficult but necessary decision to close the centre.</p> <p>  The Owenacurra Centre is a single-storey mental health facility that provides a continuing care service as approved centre unit with the Mental Health Commission in Midleton.  The service is provided by Cork Kerry Community Healthcare mental health services and it is registered with the Mental Health Commission to deliver an inpatient service for up to 24 people for long-stay psychiatry of later life mental health rehabilitation and continuing mental healthcare rehabilitation.</p> <p>  I refer to the rationale for the closure.  For the information of the committee, the original plan for the Owenacurra approved centre was to refurbish the day centre section of the building to address privacy concerns for residents of the centre.  The current building simply did not allow for the kind of care and recovery that a modern service should provide.  As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, these works were delayed.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that there were no conditions attached to the registration, escalation or enforcement actions since the previous inspection in 2020, the Mental Health Commission completed an inspection between 16 and 19 February 2021, raising serious concerns with regard to persistent non-compliance with regulation 22, which refers to premises.  On foot of this, Cork Kerry Community Healthcare committed to providing plans for the Owenacurra Centre to work to address the non-compliance.  These concerns echoed the ongoing concerns of local management about the condition and unsuitability of the current building to serve the needs of the people using the service.</p> <p>  During quarter 2 of 2021, service planning and delivery started to recommence in a more normal way as Covid measures eased.  Covid-19 also had the added effect of focusing additional attention on the standard of accommodation available in residential settings across the community healthcare organisation, CHO.  Subsequently, the originally proposed works in Owenacurra were revisited and reviewed in both this context and in the context of other concerns evident in the centre, including fire risk assessment, asbestos survey, infrastructural deficiencies, etc.</p> <p>  Following a review by HSE Estates of the independent fire risk assessment, asbestos survey, mechanical and electrical infrastructure reports and taking account of the structural design of the Owenacurra Centre, all of which were undertaken to identify risks and potential solutions, the view was formed that the investment of significant capital did not represent the best use of public funds in providing the best solution for the service.  Given the unacceptable deficiencies in the accommodation and the extensive level of investment required to provide a centre that would meet the resident&rsquo;s needs, the decision became clear to close the centre and identify alternative appropriate options for the residents.  </p> <p>  The following outlines the centre's further deficiencies and issues.</p><p>The findings of a fire risk assessment report survey that was undertaken detailed works required to address these deficiencies, which were significantly more than repair works.  An asbestos survey detailed findings of a decorative coating throughout the ceilings in the centre that contains chrysotile asbestos, which would need to be removed when completing necessary fire risk works to a significant number of ceilings within the building.  The presence of asbestos was also noted in the flooring.  Essential systems such as heating, electrics and building fabric are beyond their end of useful life.  HSE clients continue to live in 7.5 sq. m bedrooms with no en suite facilities, when the current best practice to achieve is 22 sq. m. including an en suite facility.  There is a lack of social spaces, therapeutic spaces and essential staff support accommodation.  The fact is that investment of significant funding into the building still would not bring the unit up to an acceptable accommodation standard for residents and other service users.<br/><br/>As has been outlined previously, the Owenacurra Centre is currently circa 1,050 sq. m.  Based on existing standards of accommodation for the client profile in the centre, a new facility with the same number of bedrooms would need to be approximately twice the size of the current centre, that is, a facility in the order of 1,800 sq. m to 2,000 sq. m would be required.  This does not include other essential requirements necessary on-site, such as secure, external recreational and therapeutic spaces, appropriate parking spaces, as well as creating an independent day centre.  The age and type of construction of the building, a Roh-Fab building with a useful life span of approximately 40 years that has currently been in operation for circa 50 years, means the ability to comply with current building regulations and Government energy performance requirements would not be capable of being met.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the above, a further significant factor regarding any potential refurbishment options is that the existing structural design is not capable of facilitating such major renovation works without requiring a complex and extremely costly engineering solution to maintain its integrity while any works would advance.  In addition, it would be impractical and inappropriate to undertake works of such significance on a phased basis, with residents in place, due to issues including health and safety, the overall welfare of residents and staff, fire control, asbestos and aspergillosis risks due to the nature of the works involved.  As there was no way to bring the centre to a standard where it would be fit for purpose at a realistic cost, HSE Cork Kerry community healthcare was left with no choice but to close the centre.  The replacement of the building is now proposed as the most effective way of ensuring a facility that meets with residents' needs, meets with best practice guidelines for such accommodation, meets current building standards and will meet the Government's energy target requirements for public buildings in a cost-effective manner.<br/><br/>The difficult decision to cease services at the Owenacurra Centre was taken by me as chief officer, having considered the information pertaining to the condition of the building, its requirement to comply with regulations and its future appropriateness to provide specialist residential services.  The decision was supported by the mental health head of service, the area director of nursing for mental health and the executive clinical director for mental health.  There has been significant public debate on whether it would be possible to refurbish the existing Owenacurra Centre, with residents remaining on-site during the works.  The position is that this would not be safe and would not be in the best interests of residents.  The expert reports outlined and taken into account in the decision make it clear that investment in the current building would not deliver the quality of accommodation that residents deserve, in line with modern requirements and regulatory standards within a realistic budget.<br/><br/>On consultations with families and residents<b>, </b>the assessed needs and will and preference of residents have always been to the fore in the context of their relocation to other appropriate settings.  The HSE has been very conscious of the need for engagement with residents during this difficult period and has extended the closure period of the centre while the services and residential requirements of residents are being identified and sourced.  This assessment consists of individual care plan multidisciplinary reviews with the residents, consultant psychiatric reviews, formal family meetings and informal family contacts.  At all times, residents have been given the option to approach named members of staff to provide supports and information relating to their assessed needs and will and preference.  There is an ongoing advocacy service available and in place to discuss and support residents&rsquo; concerns.<br/><br/>Mental health services in Cork Kerry community healthcare are working in close collaboration with the affected service users and their families to find more appropriate accommodation.  This process is being handled with sensitivity with regard to the wishes and preferences of each individual resident and is aligned to his or her current needs, including his or her health and safety and provision of appropriate treatment and care.  Residents are moving on a phased basis and engagement with each resident is ongoing.  Eleven residents have moved to a variety of new settings and our staff remain in contact with them.  Their new homes include nursing homes and community residences, and these new placements fit each person&rsquo;s individual assessed needs.  Residents are settling into their new homes and continue to receive support in a more appropriate environment.<br/><br/>For the remaining residents, the supports being provided as they move through what is a difficult process for them will continue, as will the engagement with them and their families.  Our priority now is to work with the remaining residents to identity new homes for them, which will meet their needs as assessed by medical experts, as well as their own will and preference.  This work by our clinical<font color="#FF0000"></font>experts will continue to be a support to the remaining residents in the Owenacurra Centre.<br/><br/>As regards commitments in Midleton, we remain committed to providing quality mental health services for the population of east Cork and the wider region.  We strive to support the principle of maintaining people in their own homes and communities where possible, and bringing the specialist services required as close to homes and communities as possible<b>.  </b>We have provided assurances that we will explore options to relocate and reinstate the day centre in the town as soon as possible.  The day centre has moved to a new location and is operating there successfully.  The longer-term plan is to provide this service at the redeveloped Midleton Community Hospital site.<br/><br/>I wish to advise that we will provide a new ten-bed rehabilitative focused residential unit in Midleton town.  This service will have 24-hour staffing, and will have a focus on supporting people to return to their homes and communities.  We will appoint a development team, which will conduct an options appraisal and engage with people using mental health services in the area.  The Owenacurra site will be among the possible locations considered.  A capital submission initiation document for this proposed development has been submitted for the approval of the national capital and property steering committee of the HSE.  A meeting of this committee is scheduled for the end of September when this proposed development will be discussed.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, we will also provide at least one community residence in Midleton town for three or four residents.  The model for this service will also be rehabilitation focused, with healthcare professional staff supporting the residents and with 24-hour staffing in place.  A suitable property, located within Midleton, is being pursued for this purpose and a property transaction approval form for the purchase of this property has also been submitted for the approval of the national property review group.  Our plan for residential mental health services in the east Cork area will ultimately deliver a modern service into the future and in line with Government policy.<br/><br/>I hope that this detailed account of the rationale for the closure of the current Owenacurra Centre, and the future transition of the services with a rehabilitation centre and community residence service for Midleton and its environs, will see the further transition of service to a much more community-based recovery approach.  The supports being provided to current residents as they move through what is a difficult process for them will continue, as will the engagement with them and their families.  The recent restoration of day services is also a key component of the transition.  Cork Kerry community healthcare acknowledges the challenge it faces to implement the transition and the fact that many of its mental health residential centres in Cork, in particular, require replacement or refurbishment.  The mental health management team of the CHO are committed to work through these issues to ensure a modern and proactive service is achieved to meet the needs of the community.</p></speech>

Before I allow other members in, I have a few points myself.  Can Mr. Fitzgerald give us a date on which the closing of Owenacurra was discussed?  The <i>Irish Examiner</i>has given a date of 2019, while other reports have stated that it was 2021.Is it not strange that a development that would upend people's lives so much apparently took place during meetings for which no records were kept?  We talk about best practice.  Is it not strange that these types of meetings take place at which no one records the discussions that go on?</p></speech>

As the Chairman knows, it was not initially the intention to close the facility.  It was the intention to look at it in the context of some refurbishment to be done.  I took the decision to close it on the basis of the totality of the information.</p><p>It must also be looked at in the context of where we were with Covid and what we had learned around it.  The decision was made by me but it certainly was based on the availability of the information, not just from a single source but from a perspective accounting for the capacity of the building, what we needed to do to it and what we needed to invest in it, as well as a serviced site.</p></speech>

The buildings are so old that they all have the same problems.  How was Owenacurra singled out?</p></speech>

While there has been significant investment in many centres &ndash; I can speak for the CHO area across Cork and Kerry &ndash; we have significant deficits in a number of centres.  Some will need either significant refurbishment or replacement.  We have developed an overall plan from a strategic perspective around those.  There is a specific aspect to be considered concerning the information I provided in my opening statement on the fabric of this particular building, its nature and its lifespan.  No more than with any of the other buildings in which we are investing, even by way of an interim arrangement until we have to replace them, the issue with the building in question was that once one started to work on it, all the other issues would come to the fore very quickly.  That was the specific issue with regard to this particular building.</p></speech>

Was Owenacurra chosen just on a financial basis?  None of the recommendations we have seen states it should have been closed.  The Mental Health Commission has consistently given the wards of St. Stephen's and St. Finbarr's hospitals lower compliance ratings than Owenacurra.  Was Owenacurra chosen for closure on a financial basis rather than anything else?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022091500002#D00500"><p>Absolutely not.  It was not chosen from a financial perspective at all.  Mr. O'Connell might talk about the fabric of the building itself.  Certainly, the fabric is a significant issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022091500002#D00600"><p>Mr. Fitzgerald is correct.  Initially, before Covid, the plan was to refurbish a section of the building to provide a day centre whose entrance would be separate from that of the residents' living space.  It was the case that the day centre had to be accessed through areas where residents were living.  The provision of privacy at this level was regarded as involving interim works.  After Covid, when the projects were being reviewed in the context of the fire risk assessment works that were required, part of those works involved the replacement of a significant number of ceilings, amounting to approximately 80% to 85% of the total throughout the centre.  Because of the amount of refurbishment required, the building itself would have had to have been decanted of residents.  The work required on the ceilings, considered in the context of the Mental Health Commission's observation that patients' bedrooms were too small, not en suite etc., would trigger a number of works that would have to be reviewed in order to provide a centre of the standard required by the building regulations.  The knock-on effect of starting a chain of refurbishment works means the investment required quickly adds up in a building whose infrastructure is such that those works cannot be done in a cost-effective manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022091500002#D00700"><p>The HSE has taken up the very foundations of community care, that is, of people being looked after in their own community.  They are being spread out among facilities that are in some cases questionable.  It is not me but the Mental Health Commission that states they are not up to the standard of the Owenacurra Centre.  There is no comparison between taking people out of single rooms and putting them into double rooms in addition to making no allowances for public transport for families who wish to visit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022091500002#D00800"><p>I thank the representatives for attending.  Where do I start?  We are back here again.  In the opening statement, Mr. Fitzgerald said his organisation is working very hard to ensure every resident's transition is supported as much as possible.  We are not talking about individual cases here but about more than one.  Mr. Fitzgerald will be aware that the engagement with the residents of Owenacurra Centre on the transition has not been very good.  It has been worrying.  Some of the family members have approached me on the possibility of coercion and on how there has been no engagement with them.</p><p>The HSE's submission refers to the rationale for closure.  It states that as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the works were delayed.  However, there were works prior to that.  I have a record of works that were supposed to have been done in 2016.  That is well before the onset of Covid.  I have said before that the HSE is the landlord&ndash;proprietor of the buildings.  We will talk specifically about Owenacurra.  The spin seems to be that it is the Mental Health Commission's fault because it has said the place is not fit for purpose.  It is telling the truth but my argument is that the HSE, as proprietor, should have been maintaining the buildings all along.  This never happened.  It is now handy for the HSE to say that, because the building is not fit for purpose, it will just close it and move the patients out.  They are not patients; they are residents.</p><p>It is not just a question of the building and the area but of all the services that go with the centre.  I include long- and short-term respite and chiropody services.  The dentist is across the road.  The centre is fully integrated.  I met a resident of the centre in my own town last Thursday.  He had the luxury of being able to go down the main street.  He was sitting outside a shop having a cup of coffee and some chocolate cake.  He will not be able to do that at St. Catherine's or Sarsfield Court.  He would be better off in Fota than in Sarsfield Court because he is not going to meet anyone there.</p><p>The HSE is on about the best possible outcomes for these people.  The HSE is moving them from the Owenacurra because of the compliance rating, yet the two premises it wants to put them into are less compliant.  On top of that, the system seems to be working perfectly right now, despite the delegates' statement that the building is not fit for purpose.  The staff have not been treated very fairly given the lack of information on what is going on.  Members of the public have signed the petition.  There is much public anger and in a petition several weeks ago, we collected over 600 signatures, of which I can give a sample.</p><p>Those were the points I wanted to make but I also want to refer to the size of the building and what is needed.  The delegates know the location of  Owenacurra Centre and that the community hospital is across the road.  There are many acres across the road there are not built on.  It is possible to do a new build there while the remaining residents stay <i>in situ</i>in Owenacurra Centre.</p><p>Let me outline the fear.  I have not heard anything about the ten-bed unit the delegates are talking about, who is building it and whether planning permission has been sought or approved.  It is pie in the sky.  These things take a very long time.  The demand for the services exists.  There were 26 on a waiting list for the two short-term beds before Covid.  I have had five cases in my office in the past three weeks looking for identical services in the area but we cannot get them in anywhere.</p><p>Between 2000 and 2002, there were 69 suicides in east Cork.</p><p>One can add more onto that, up to 2022.  We have an ageing population.  I am sure the HSE has data similar to what we have with constituency dashboards on demographics to show what is going on.  One can predict, more or less, what will happen.</p><p> The biggest fear here is that the 600 people plus who signed those petitions and I do not believe that we will get the same level of care in Midleton and east Cork, specifically on respite and mental health services and the additional day mental health services.  The fear is that once the service is gone, it is gone.  It looks like this is being replicated in other parts of the country.  I watched a while ago on the news about the scaling down of services in Bantry.  We have the community health centre out the road in Castlemartyr being scaled down because it is not fit for purpose.  There seems to be a tsunami in this regard.</p><p> Mr. Fitzgerald stated in his statement: "Our priority now is to work with the remaining residents to identity new homes for them, which will meet their needs as assessed by medical experts, as well as their own will and preference."  The only medical expert is the person himself or herself who is living in the Owenacurra Centre.  They call that their home.  We spoke to them repeatedly.  Their preference is to stay at home and their home is the Owenacurra Centre.  They have told me St. Catherine's is not their home and Sarsfield Court is certainly not their home.  There is a rights-based issue here as well.  The HSE is saying the building is not fit for purpose.  The HSE should leave those people there - it has the facilities across the road to expand - and replace it with what the HSE wants, that is, a modern up-to-date proper service, but do it in tandem.</p><p> The public trust has been lost.  That is sad to say.  We are dealing with some of the most vulnerable people in society who most of the time do not have the capacity for decision-making.  It is a pity that the decision support services are not up and running because I would be reporting the HSE on this as a human rights issue, not as an aesthetic issue.  They are all talking about a building and a service.  I do not care about that.  That is the HSE's problem because that is where it failed at the start.  The HSE did not maintain it.  The HSE cannot blame Brexit for it.  It cannot blame Covid for it because we have the documents here.  There were repairs to be carried out, in 2016 and 2017.  Therefore, we are not buying that.</p><p> I do not think Mr. Fitzgerald is able to give a commitment on what I am looking and hoping for here.  What the people of Midleton and east Cork want is to maintain all the existing services, not to break any of them.  If that building cannot be rebuilt or refurbished, the HSE should build a new, proper one with the same number of beds in Midleton and keep it integrated within the town and community-led.</p><p> Mr. Fitzgerald stated that, "A suitable property, located within Midleton, is being purchased...".  Has a property been bought in Midleton or not?  We need to know.</p><p> This "ten-bed ... focused residential unit in Midleton ... [with] 24-hour staffing ...".  That "24-hour staffing" seems to be a new one.  Are St. Catherine's and  the other one outlined above staffed on a 24-hour basis?</p><p> Mr. Fitzgerald also stated: "Our plan for residential mental health services in the east Cork area will ultimately deliver a modern service into the future in line with Government policy."  That, "into the future", is the problem.  This could take ten or 20 years.  What happens to all those people who need services?  It will be gone.</p><p> I have a lot to say on this.  This is not a personal attack on the HSE officials.  It is an attack on the system which is not working but on which, we hope, with the HSE officials' support, we could work together.</p><p> We have received responses from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Petitions.  We also have a response from the Joint Committee on Health.  It states that the Joint Committee on Public Petitions fully supports the Joint Committee on Health in expressing its dissatisfaction and concern with the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for older people and mental health, Deputy Mary Butler, on the decision that the Owenacurra Centre is to be closed and also calls on the Minister of State to reverse the decision urgently.  It states that it is enclosing for my own information the text of the petition as provided by the petitioner in addition to a link to the meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Petitions on 7 July 2022.  It also states that they did not buy the HSE's original submission on why the building was not fit for purpose.  We are still not buying it.  We do not want to be dragging them in here every day, every week or every month, but the biggest problem here is we have been going over a year, we have been told the same story over and over again, yet we have seen zero concrete evidence that anything is moving forward.</p><p> All that is moving in Midleton, in that Owenacurra Centre at present, is residents being moved out.  I am being honest here.  It is not of their free will.  How can one push people out of a residential unit that they class as their home?  Surely there is a constitutional requirement, as a human being never mind as a professional, to give those residents the best level of care possible and also respect their rights and wishes to remain in that centre.</p><p> In summary, and I thank the Chair's indulgence and patience on this, I would like to know if the HSE has bought any premises in Midleton.  I would like to know if the HSE has looked at building a new centre across the road.  I would like to know why we are going from 22 beds down to a ten-bed unit when we have a growing population.  Cork city, Cork county and the east Cork populations are predicted to grow by over 12% in the next couple of years.  Can we get clarity on why this is happening in this day and age?  When I talk to the layperson in the street, he or she says the worst of this is that they are moving the residents from a centre because of compliancy issues but they are putting them into other centres that are less compliant than the one they are in.  It is like saying we will take them out of the hotel room and put them into the mobile home.  I ask Mr. Fitzgerald to explain how that is rights-based best decision-making and a rights-based place to put people, and how it will be for their betterment.  I cannot understand how that can be.</p><p> I thank the Chair.  I know there is a lot in that.</p></speech>

There are a couple of things to pick up on.</p> <p>  I would be concerned that early on in his statement Deputy Buckley mentioned the word "coercion".  I would be concerned that that phrase is out there with regards to coercion.  Certainly, in the process and in the methodology that is supplied to discuss the movement, I would be very concerned if there was anything remotely like coercion.  I would have to say, if there was, we would certainly want to hear the detail of that because that would certainly be totally inappropriate and it certainly is not part of the ongoing process as far as any of us here is concerned.</p></speech>

Mr. Fitzgerald can change the word from "coercion", but it is still wrong.  If it is an issue, we can always go with the family members down the protected disclosure route.  We are not here to make accusations.  We are here to ask whether the HSE officials are aware of this and to state that it is neither the proper procedure nor the rights-based approach to the matter.  That is why I used the word.  Also, the family members used that word.</p></speech>

It might be helpful to say in this context that we understand this is a very difficult process.  It is a change for residents and particularly people who were long-term residents there.  It is a change.  Any change for any of us is an adjustment for people.  Of course, it will bring its own issues for people.  We understand that.  We also understand that it is not an easy thing to go through for families.  People going to see other centres, in my head space anyway, is appropriate.  As we said it is about will and choice.  People also need to see what they are moving to, what it is like for them, what the feel of it is like and would they be comfortable there and with the services that are provided there.  Those also are all important pieces.</p> <p>  If there are issues of that nature which are concerning to the Deputy, we would be quite happy for him to bring them forward to us and we will investigate them and come back in case there is anything untoward.  </p></speech>

Yes, we are in significant negotiation on a particular property.  As I said in my opening statement, there is a process within the HSE around proposing that for purchase.  The property is being considered through that process.  Mr. O'Connell might fill in details around that process.  We have not purchased a property but we have one in mind that is going through our approval process to purchase.  We are very hopeful that it will emerge on the other side, which would be helpful in this regard.  Part of the plan for the future is that it would be there as another stepping stone for people to live as independently as possible in Midleton and the general area.</p> <p>  The opening statement also outlined where we are on the ten-bed rehabilitation-style residential centre that we intend to build there.  We have to do an options appraisal on that because we have to say what the best location is, whether it is possible and whether it is the appropriate place to build on the site.  Is it appropriate to build on the site across the road, on the community hospital, as the Deputy said, or should it be on another site given the requirements for doing it?  There is an approval process around how we go around that Mr. O'Connell might talk about too.</p> <p>  The other important thing I want to reiterate is that we completely understand that this is not easy.  If we had the perfect accommodation somewhere else and quite close to it which would be more or fully compliant with the commission that would be helpful particularly for those people who require a level of specialist service around them to meet their particular needs.  We do not have that.  We are not suggesting that all of our residential services are all modern and appropriate in the context of fully complying with regulation.  They are not.  It is certainly our intention and our plan that a significant refurbishment and replacement programme will be required right across Cork for many of the centres in question.  I do not think that we ever said that we were able to find places that were better but we do need to make sure that the people's needs are met.  It might be an appropriate location to meet those particular clinical needs and that balance has to be there as well.  </p> <p>  I hear the Deputy's concern, particularly that the service could be taken away and how you could have no service there.  What we are striving to do, in accordance with Government policy and with what we know is the right thing to do, is to make it very much a community-based service for Midleton, east Cork and the greater area right across the CHO.  In the development of a ten-bed unit or in the development of a house or a type of residence, and along with the other services such as our home-based treatment team, with a focus on rehabilitation, our view is that in accordance with policy, you maintain more people at home, well and independent for as long as possible.  Unfortunately we still live with an institutional mindedness, perhaps, which surrounds us and we are only coming away from that with the closure of significant large centres that were not the appropriate place for people to live out their lives and where they did not have the opportunity of living their life as independently as possible.  That is what I recognise as a rights-based service into the future.</p> <p>  The Deputy said it was into the future and I think that is the reasonable thing to say as you have not got it in your hand at the moment.  But there are certainly aspects of that service in place already through the home-based treatment team and the supports that are there in the community.  I think that we need to start talking in a positive way about the future service that can and will be achieved in Midleton and the area.  We have to embrace that.  It might be different.  Like change, it might be different to what we felt before but it has the capacity to support people and to support people to support themselves to maintain wellness as long as possible.  Mr. O'Connell might speak on the processes around the two developments that we talked about.  </p></speech>

It is not too far from the town in walking distance.</p> <p>Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned the ten-bed unit and the specialist care.  He is right on the specialist care but these people cannot live independently at home.  They need this specialist respite.  Even the short-term respite is there to give families relief.  That is the kind of care that we still need in the town.  I understand where Mr. Fitzgerald is coming from but if we lose those services, families are going to struggle.</p></speech>

The committee has discussed Owenacurra a lot.  Throughout I have been reminded of a healthcare facility in my constituency.  It gave incredible care, had amazing staff and undying community support but it simply did not have a building fit for purpose.  It failed HIQA assessment after assessment as a result and ultimately it closed and residents were relocated.  I share that to demonstrate I fully understand how emotive an issue this is.  In some ways, the situation in Owenacurra is similar.  It is the building that is not fit for purpose.  The committee has heard testimony about the incredible care, amazing staff and community support.  Deputies in the local area have spoken about how ingrained the facility is as part of the local community, how it is so central to other facilities and amenities nearby and how that it makes it a really valuable space.</p><p>We have policies and regulations in place to govern facilities such as this.  Residents and their protection are at the heart of those policies and regulations.  I am minded to ask if this opens questions for a wider discussion about the practical repercussions of policies on congregated settings.  Peamount Healthcare in my constituency, for example, includes purpose-built cottages in which people with intellectual disabilities live together.  That model which works so well in practice is out of date in the context of the policy to decongregate settings.  The fire safety works are absolutely necessary and must happen.  The structural defects need to be addressed and the ceilings need to be replaced.  I would welcome any estimates that Mr. Fitzgerald has for the cost of that level of repair.  If those things were addressed, are congregated settings the next hurdle?  Is that where the main challenge will arise?  If those things were invested in, will it be the case that the facility still will not meet the criteria?  </p><p> Everybody values the incredible care that has been provided at this facility.  We have heard from many people with family members who have benefited from that care.  That is where this resistance is coming from.  It is a good thing in that people are fighting for an amenity in their area.  We need to ensure the service is provided in an appropriate setting and in as best a way as possible, with the patient at the heart of it.  It would be helpful if Mr. Fitzgerald could give me an estimate for that remedial work.  Perhaps he or Mr. O'Connell could provide some input on congregated settings and whether that policy is having an impact.</p></speech>

Rather than in mental health services, they are more often used in the context of disability services.  The Deputy is correct about the policy which intends to move forward with smaller, individual units.  What might have once been a very large residential facility in disability services may be decongregated and reduced to a population of four or five people, who would take up a new residence together.  The best way to look at that is to go and visit such a setting one, two or three years after its decongregation and compare it with the model that was there previously.  In my time, I have seen centres decongregated.  I have compared the services that were available before decongregation and after it.  People's lived experience in the smaller setting is very different.  A person-centred model of service is available in a smaller unit compared with a larger unit.  That is a specific thing in the disability services in particular.  It is unquestionably the correct approach in that area.  It is a difficult thing to do because there is an impact from a housing perspective and on the provision of services.  However, it is certainly a good model.</p> <p>  In older person services, we still have larger settings such as nursing homes etc.  Through HIQA regulation, there is a push towards fewer multi-occupancy bedrooms and that type of thing.  Over the coming years, as we replace units and services, there will be more smaller units.  There will be more space for privacy and dignity for people who reside in such settings.  That is a common trend across all of those particular services.  People are, in general, happier to live in those circumstance when they have the experience of doing so.  Services in places such as those can maintain the privacy and dignity of people in those settings much more easily.  That is always the challenge of regulation.  We are probably always going to be following regulation as opposed to being ahead of it.  There is a financial challenge involved, both from a revenue perspective and a capital perspective.  They should go hand-in-hand but these are very large models to move away from and towards a model of smaller facilities.  Mr. O'Connell might be able to answer the Deputy's question about costs.</p></speech>

The ceilings will be replaced in their entirety.  Because of that, there is a requirement for the building to comply with the current building regulations.  The building was designed and built in the 1970s.  Bringing that particular building up to current regulation standards would include adhering to the Government's climate action plan in respect of the energy performance of the building.  It will be an extremely expensive exercise to bring that particular building up to the standard required to meet current building regulations.  If that were to be taken in isolation and no other works were done to the building, we would have to justify spending a considerable sum of money to meet current energy standards and building regulations while also having residents' bedrooms and spaces that were not up to the level of the best practice guidelines for layouts.  Taking all of that into account will require an investment of a significant amount of money.  It would be difficult because of the ro-fab nature of the building.  The cost of doing all of that means it would be better for the building to be replaced rather than refurbished.</p></speech>

I am thinking outside the box.  I have been talking to family members who have requests.  Would it be possible to move the existing residents across the road into the Midleton Community Hospital section?  If the building is not fit for purpose, is it possible, as our guests have suggested, to knock it down and replace it?  Can that be done?  There are things I would include on a wish list that are not going to happen.  I know this is based on trust, belief and whatever else.  Is there a guarantee that the existing services and associated services will be protected, will not be reduced and will be improved?  Is there any way the HSE can give that commitment to the committee?</p></speech>

He asked is it possible to move the remaining residents of the centre across the road.  The Deputy suggested moving them to the community hospital setting.</p></speech>

What we need is to develop services that recognise that a variety of services and a variety of supports will be needed.  Absolutely, we will need services for people who will need a higher level of support on a 24-hour basis.  We also need, however, to embrace the fact that people can gain and regain skills and can have, therefore, a better quality of life and, as we have seen from the international evidence and evidence here, can move after having periods of rehabilitation.  We have already appointed a consultant in rehabilitation psychiatry, and there are a number of other multidisciplinary team members in the process of being appointed.  We are therefore already putting in place additional resources to assist people in their recovery journeys.  That, coupled with a facility such as a residence, where people can have more independence and practise more of their everyday activities, the same way we do, will allow people to have a step-up, step-down model of support.  That will be very positive.  It will then be coupled with people moving on to the community, where they can have the east Cork home treatment team and a seven-day service.  All of that together will be the hallmarks of a very modern service that will benefit everybody.  I can therefore certainly tell the Deputy that we are absolutely committed to further developing the services in east Cork and Cork as a whole.</p></speech>

What she says about the variety of services and so on is very much welcome.  I just do not want the point lost that, while people can recover, progress and so on, there will always be a demand for what specific beds we have there already.  What I have tried to do here is get clarity so the people of east Cork will know that those services will be protected and complemented by the variety of additional services as time goes by.</p></speech>

The response from the HSE at the time was that it was being looked at because it is a stand-alone building.  Three other buildings, Carraig M&oacute;r in Cork, Mount Alvernia Hospital in north Cork and old Caherina House in Tralee, are also stand-alone buildings, yet for some reason they were not mentioned as being for sale.  Why was the same investment not talked about in 2019?  As Deputy Buckley said, this was before Covid.  Why was that kind of investment not looked at for Owenacurra Centre instead of looking for the sale?  It was mentioned twice to go for sale in 2019.</p></speech>

No more than with any meeting, the view was out there.  If we do some development, we have to look to see, when it comes to the value for money and what will be spent on something, whether it will continue and, if something else has to be done, whether the value of what was first invested in is lost.  There was never any further movement on the sale of Owenacurra Centre.  It was never tabled or even up for discussion as a decision.  We did not even get it valued or anything of that nature.  No more than with any other building, however, we would ask what its value is; whether we can replace it; whether we can refurbish it; and whether, if we were to build it somewhere else or to buy something somewhere else, it could present as a sale opportunity for us in the future in order that its value would be realised.  That is as far as any question about it went.  It was certainly discussed, but not in any serious way such that it moved on as a determined factor of our getting it valued or putting it forward through our own approval system, because we would have to get approval for that in the context of selling any type of building.  It did not proceed any further than that.</p></speech>

If I am selling or buying something at home, I go on DoneDeal and start looking for different prices.  Mr. Fitzgerald is trying to tell me that a meeting took place about selling Owenacurra Centre, or it came up for mention twice in 2019, and no one decided to try to find out how much money Owenacurra Centre could make for us.</p></speech>

Under the HSE's plans for east Cork, continuing care needs will now be in St. Stephen's Hospital.  How does the HSE justify a situation whereby people with the highest level of mental health need in the east Cork area will now not be able to live in their own community?</p></speech>

We are committed to developing the services in Midleton.  The Chairman is absolutely correct that what we are looking for are different levels of support to allow different people to be able to live to their best quality of life.  Therefore, we are looking at allowing people to get more support when they need it and to get multidisciplinary rehabilitation.  Then people can move to other levels of support and, indeed, on to wherever they choose to live and to independence if that is suitable at the time.  In essence, we are aiming to provide a wide variety of services that will allow a much bigger number of people to benefit from this service and then to move on and, ultimately, to have the best quality of life they can have.</p></speech>

The HSE is not giving them that option at Owenacurra Centre - and not just at Owenacurra Centre, because we have been involved with St. Brigid's Hospital, in Carrick-on-Suir.  How many other centres like Owenacurra Centre and St. Brigid's Hospital has the HSE earmarked to close down?  It just seems that bit by bit they are being closed down.  I remember being at a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and she threw out a figure of 350 more beds.  Will we see ten at Owenacurra Centre, 12 at St. Brigid's Hospital and so on in other places?  That directly goes away from what the HSE states in its own policy document, "To successfully live in their chosen community".</p></speech>

None of the witnesses answered that.  Do they consider it best practice to have meetings that affect people's lives and communities all across this State at which no one takes minutes?  I am involved in a residents' association.  If we talk about putting down a flower bed, we take minutes at the meeting.

To go back to the Chairman's question asking what are our plans to close other centres or whatever, I have no view in terms of the HSE having a masterplan to close lots of centres around there.  I do not believe that is the case and certainly, speaking for the Cork-Kerry CHO, we do not have such plans in place.</p> <p>  We do have challenges, as I said earlier, to meet the requirements of regulators in a broad sense.  I do not blame the regulators.  Having regulation and a regulator to ensure that we provide services which are fit for purpose is very appropriate.  We very much welcome that but it takes investment and adherence to Government policy.  A very significant investment is required for us to put all of our centres in Cork right in the context of regulation and will take time.  Such an investment across a range of centres where we have issues, which must be put right from the perspective of the environment, is going to be a costly set of plans and in the environment in which we find ourselves it will take a period to do so.  We are in that space where that is happening.  Thankfully, we have some investment already under way and planned in some of our centres.  That is ongoing at the Carrig M&oacute;r and Mercy centres where funding is available for a very significant refurbishment of both.  I do not think that it can all be achieved in a day and certainly it cannot all be achieved without significant resources.  It is our intention to redevelop the two centres so that we have a modern service with supporting infrastructure.</p> <p>  Sometimes we do not take stock of the things that happen.  Therefore, I wish to note that there has been a very significant development of primary care centres in Cork and Kerry.  Mental health teams have been provided accommodation in an integrated way with primary care centres right across the system.  A few years ago that would not have been the case as they would have been very much based in old psychiatric hospitals, etc.  Now many of our teams across Cork and Kerry provide services in those centres and to people in their own homes.  One might not see that service as it is not the same as seeing a centre with a name on its door.  That is a hugely powerful level of service that is being provided to people right now and that is important to state.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked a question about the decision-making.  While we do not have a specific note on the specific decision that was made, it was I who made it in consultation with the mental health team and in consultation with my colleagues in estates.  I viewed the documentation that was available to me at that particular point in time and weighed up very strongly the requirement for a service provision for the people in residence at that particular point in time versus the challenges.  That was provided through the view from my colleagues in estates and with the reports that were available to them as to whether we were to move forward with that or not, or were we actually to let people stay in what at the end of the day was a building that was not fit for purpose.  I have to say that I made the decision that we should not keep people in a place that was not fit for purpose nor was it possible, in any kind of a financially viable way, to continue to do so.  </p></speech>

The documentation is in the public domain with regard to the expert reports that were made available by the estates division and, indeed, by the estates division to me.  There was no disagreement on the unfortunate decision we had to make.</p> <p>  Many times people like me are challenged because we do not make or cannot make decisions or whatever, and when a decision is made then it can be a difficult one.  I can say that this was a very difficult decision to make but nonetheless I stand over my decision because of the following considerations.  First, were we to continue by putting money into a centre that still was not going to be fit for purpose and where the escalation of the issues that would be there with regard to the regulator were going to continue?  We did not need the regulator to tell us that because we knew it from the actual reports that we got.  Second, were we to continue to provide services in a building that was not fit for purpose without a plan of how we were going to do something different for them?</p></speech>

I have no issue with Mr. Fitzgerald making his decision but find it strange that these decisions were not recorded.</p> <p>  We invited representatives of the Mental Health Commission to attend this meeting and they informed us that they could not.

Mr. Fitzgerald has said that the HSE is investing in property.  We do not care about that because the HSE, as an entity, is obliged to invest in people and look after them to the best of its ability.  That obligation has got lost and, therefore, the residents and their families have suffered the most from the HSE's inability to maintain these buildings.</p> <p>  What if there was political will whereby the HSE was asked to get a cost, knew how much it would cost to build a new centre in Midleton while locating it somewhere temporarily?  As Mr. Fitzgerald and I know, once a centre is up and running there will be a demand for its services.  I have approached the Minister of State many times about the centre.  If there was the political will could the HSE replace the services in Midleton and maybe even with half of them in the Owenacurra Centre and the remaining half across the road?</p></speech>

The issue is that the two services are very different in terms of their components and people's needs in a broad sense.</p><p>To be honest, resolving it in the way outlined by the Deputy would not be possible.</p><p> However, I do take his point.  For the likes of the Owenacurra Centre and other centres - I speak from a Cork-Kerry perspective - significant investment is required and, in fairness, it has been an issue for some time.  Has sufficient funding not been available to us to refurbish buildings over the years?  Yes, absolutely.  Were there occasions in which we tried to refurbish buildings that were not fit for purpose in the long term?  Yes, that is also true.  Would we rather be in a different place with a better environmental structure in respect of our services?  Absolutely, but we are not there.  That is going back many decades.  We must remember and put it into the context that some centres, like the Owenacurra Centre, were built as the next move on from what were the psychiatric hospitals of old.  They moved wards out from those hospitals according to what the State was able to afford or what was seen as the appropriate thing then.</p><p> I have to keep coming back to this point.  For the likes of myself and my colleagues here, we have to keep our eye on the current and future model of service going forward.  I believe there is a bright and appropriate future for services in Midleton and the greater east Cork area, as well as across Cork.  However, we will have to stay steady about it because if we keep saying that we will go back to a residential model of service, that is what will happen but I do not think that is an appropriate thing.  Over the many decades I have been working in the services, that type of a residential institutional model was detrimental to people.  It is much better for people to be maintained in their community, as the Deputy said, where they lived their lives, as best as they possibly could be with the supports we provide to them.  I honestly believe that.</p></speech>

We would also like to have an engagement with the Deputy and his colleagues locally in order that, across the community, we can talk about a new, modern model of service.  That would be an important thing for the community.  If you were peripheral to the service, you would get the sense that everything is being lost in the area.  In fact, what we are talking about is the future.  We need the community support to make that happen.  We will reach out to the friends, the broader political spectrum and the community to talk about that going into the future.  That is all I wanted to say.</p></speech>

Petition No. 2 of 2022, "Homelessness is a Cancer ... blocked-up houses are not a cure", is from Mr. Eamon Broughan.  The committee recommends that the response on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage be sent to the petitioner for comment within 14 days; that the response on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage be sent to Kildare County Council for comment within 14 days; and that Kildare County Council be invited to appear before the Committee on Public Petitions to discuss this petition during the autumn session as part of the committee's work programme, should the time allow it.  Is it agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. 6 of 2022, "Bye-By Elections in Ireland may comply with legislation however they do not comply with the Constitution.", is from Mr. John O&rsquo;Malley.  The committee recommends that the petitioner's latest response be forwarded to Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for his consideration.  Is it agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. 13 of 2022, "Call for a public inquiry into Covid-19 residential care deaths.", is from Dr. Stephen O&rsquo;Shaughnessy.  The committee recommends that correspondence from the Department of Health be forwarded to the petitioner for comment within 14 days.  Is it agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. 14 of 2022, &ldquo;Raise the Defence Forces&rsquo; Upper Age Limit.&rdquo;, is from Mr. Stephen Martin.  The committee recommends that the response of 7 July 2022 from the Department be forwarded to the petitioner for further comment within 14 days.</p><p>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. 22 of 2022 regarding an investigation to identify whether Irish citizens have been spied on illegally is from Mr. Carles Pujol.  The committee recommends that the response from the Department of Justice be forwarded to the petitioner and that he be advised that the petition is now deemed closed.  The response from the Department advises, among other things, that if the petitioner has any evidence to suggest that an Irish citizen has been the target of illegal spyware, he should inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The committee highlights this to the petitioner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. 26 of 2022 regarding carer's allowance is from Ms Margaret Keogh.  The committee recommends that the correspondence of 6 July 2022 from the petitioner be sent to Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection and that the petition and associated correspondence be sent to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, for consideration.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. 29 of 2022 regarding research into topical steroid withdrawal is from Ms Neave Tugwell.  The committee recommends that the response from the Department of Health be forwarded to the petitioner for comment within 14 days.  Is that agreed?  Agreed?</p><p> Petition No. 33 regarding amendments to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 is from Mr. Liam Doran.  The committee recommends that the correspondence from Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, be forwarded to the petitioner and he be advised that, as the Department considers the current entitlement is sufficient and has no plans to extend the minimum break times laid out in the Organisation of  Working Time Act, the petition is deemed closed.  Is that agreed?</p><p> Petition No. 34 of 2022 regarding the erection of a First World War memorial stone in Clondalkin park to commemorate those from Clondalkin who died in that war is from Mr. Liam Doran.  The committee recommends that the correspondence from Ms Lorna Maxwell of South Dublin County Council be forwarded to the petitioner for comment within 14 days.  Is that agreed?

This petition relates to the difficulties people have in getting insurance for residential and commercial thatched properties.  The committee recommends that an email be sent to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance, Deputy Fleming, seeking a response to the petition and that the response from the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, be forwarded to the petitioner for reply within 14 days.  The committee further recommends that the petitioner and up to two individuals supporting her petition be invited to a meeting of this committee to discuss her petition and that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, be invited to a meeting to discuss the petition following his Department's publication of a study of the issues around insurance for thatch, which is expected in late September 2022.

The committee recommends that the response from University Limerick Hospitals Group be forwarded to the petitioner for comment within 14 days, that the petition and the correspondence from UL Hospitals Group be sent to the Minister for Health and that the HSE be advised of same.

I thank the Chairman for allowing me to attend this meeting.  I agree with all of those recommendations but I have a further request.  The emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is consistently the most overcrowded in the State and is not fit for purpose.  The report of a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, inspection in March of this year was damning.  The hospital was assessed under four distinct categories and the results were absolutely appalling.  Of the four categories, UHL was found to be non-compliant in three and only partially compliant in the fourth.  This review confirmed what most of us already knew, which is that the emergency department is not fit for purpose.  It is too small and is understaffed.  In 2021, there were 76,473 presentations at UHL where there are only 530 beds.  By comparison, St. James's Hospital, which has 698 inpatient beds, had an attendance of 48,397.  To bring UHL up to the average bed capacity across the State would require an additional 200 beds.  I also understand, as per a recent response to a parliamentary question, that there are 68 non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, vacancies at UHL.</p> <p>  In that context, I ask the Chairman to include a recommendation that this committee invite the Minister for Health to a meeting to discuss the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.  The plan is to build a 96-bed unit on the site but it has been confirmed in response to a number of parliamentary questions that the unit will only have capacity for 48 beds.  Today there were 45 people on trolleys and while that is an appalling number, it is actually one of the lowest figures this year.  On more than 15 days this year, over 100 people were on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  Statistics show, as verified by the petitioner, that those waiting over a certain number of hours in emergency departments are patients who require a hospital bed.  The plan of the HSE and the management of UHL to deal with this issue is not sufficient.  A response from the Minister is required and I ask the Chairman to invite him before this committee.</p></speech>

If not, I am happy to accept Deputy Quinlivan's suggestion that we invite the Minister before this committee.  It was only a matter of time before a petition such as this one came before this committee or the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  I thank the petitioners for submitting it because it is a matter that must be investigated further, either by this committee or the health committee.  There is no doubt that the region needs a comprehensive plan to deal with the severe capacity deficits in Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary.

I remind members that we now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or may join the meeting via MS Teams from Leinster House offices, as some of our colleagues are.  Of course, members may not participate in the meeting from outside the parliamentary precincts.  If joining on Teams, I ask that they mute their microphones when not making a contribution and that they use the raised hand function.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to be respectful of other people&rsquo;s physical space and adhere to public health advice.</p> <p>  I would like to welcome the witnesses to our public hearing.  I welcome Professor Helen Russell, a member of the expert advisory group to the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  Professor Russell is accompanied by her colleagues from the ESRI, namely, Dr. Paul Redmond, who is very welcome, and Dr. Dora Tuda, who is joining via Teams.  Our other witness, who I would very much like to welcome, is a great friend of mine, Professor Yvonne Galligan, directory of equality, diversity and inclusion at Technological University, TU, Dublin, and a leading expert on women in leadership.  We are grateful to Professors Russell and Galligan and their colleagues for joining us today.  </p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read out an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Those participating from a location outside parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the precinct does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can to be given on whether or the extent to which the participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  Before inviting the witnesses to make their opening statements, I wish to again express our gratitude to them for coming in to speak with us.  Since the beginning of our work, our focus in this committee has been on how best to implement the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality, which we see as setting out a clear blueprint for change and bringing about a gender equal society.  We are focusing today&rsquo;s hearings on the recommendations on gender equality regarding leadership in politics, public life and the workplace, recommendations 20 to 25, inclusive, and, indeed, pay and workplace conditions, recommendations 32 to 26, inclusive, where appropriate.  We are very grateful to our witnesses for coming in to speak with us on those recommendations. </p> <p>  I will call first Professor Russell, who will be followed by Professor Galligan, after which we will open it up to members.  I invite Professor Russell to give her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.305" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen Russell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak today.  In my opening statement, I will focus on recommendations 32 to 36, inclusive.  These are the recommendations around pay and work conditions.</p> <p>  I will start with the gender pay gap.  The citizens' assembly set out ambitious recommendations to reduce and eventually eliminate the gender pay gap.  The latest figures show there has already been a decline in the hourly pay gap since the one that is in the recommendation to 11.3%.  This figure hides a good deal of variation across occupations.  It is much higher, for instance, in the private sector than in the public sector.  It also differs across the wage distribution.  Recent ESRI research has found that the unexplained wage gap is much higher at the top end of the wage distribution, that is, the top 20% of earners.  The gap is much wider there.  In contrast, the gap at the bottom of the wage distribution is much narrower.  This points to the importance of addressing barriers in occupational and wage progression for women.  In our submission we focus on our recent research findings on the factors behind the pay gap and other labour market inequalities.  We focus on the policy levers that the assembly proposed to address these.</p> <p>  In recommendation 36, the citizens recommended introducing a statutory right to flexible working.  There is a broad body of evidence that employment flexibility facilitates those with caring responsibilities to remain employed and combine work and care.  However, some types of flexible working, particularly part-time work, is associated with a pay penalty.  Therefore, increased flexibility needs to occur also in higher paying jobs and jobs with good prospects in order to reduce the pay gap.  Enhanced flexibility also needs to be accompanied by greater take-up among men.  We do not want it to be the case that all of these flexible options are only taken up by women, because that will just exacerbate inequalities.  It is important that there is a greater take up of men and a more equal sharing of caring roles within families between men and women.  </p> <p>  The introduction of paid parents leave is an important step in that direction because this is the first paid leave that is available, apart from the two-week paternity leave.  This is additional leave of two months for fathers.  Looking across Europe, we know that take-up of that leave by fathers is dependent on the rate of replacement pay.  The flat-rate payment that we have here is likely to limit take-up by fathers and we see that in figures so far.</p> <p>  The provision of affordable, quality childcare is also key to reducing labour market inequalities.  I know that was one of the other recommendations of the assembly.  The committee will probably be addressing that in another session, so I will not dwell on it here.  There has been much policy development.  We were starting from a very low base, so we are still in a situation where our costs to families are among the highest in the OECD.  The ESRI has undertaken a lot of research in the area.  I am looking at those policy developments that were included by my colleague, Dr. Tuda.  We are very happy to discuss those in the questions and answers as well.  </p> <p>  I will move on to pay transparency, which was recommendation 33 of the assembly.  The citizens recommended the prompt implementation of the gender pay gap information Act.</p><p>Lack of transparency creates an opportunity for discrimination and bias to occur.  Greater transparency in pay scales and the absence of discretionary payments such as bonuses is one of the reasons for the much lower pay gap in the public sector.  The UK has introduced a policy similar to the policy here.  Recent research has found that was associated with a reduction in the wage gap of 1.6 percentage points which is quite a big impact.  That was mainly seen as a reduction in male wages.</p><p> Turning to recommendation 34 which relates to minimum wages, the citizens' assembly recommended aligning the minimum wage with the living wage over a period of three years.  Based on the 2021-2022 figures that would be an increase of about 23% in the minimum wage.  Research by colleagues in the ESRI and others elsewhere have shown that the introduction of the minimum wage in Ireland was quite significant in terms of the pay gap.  It lead to a big reduction in the gap among low-paid employees.  Some recent research by colleagues in Maynooth University looking specifically at the living wage and introducing that found that women were over-represented in the group affected by that change because they are more concentrated in low-pay work.  They found only a small effect on the gender pay gap.  This goes back to my earlier point that the gap is widest further up the earnings scale.  It has an effect or is likely to have an effect but that is likely to be small.</p><p> Minimum wage policy also needs to be cognisant of the adverse employment effects.  Evidence for Ireland indicates that the recent minimum wage increases did not lead to job losses.  This is based on work by my colleague here.  However there was evidence of a reduction in hours worked among some minimum-wage workers.  In implementing that policy there needs to be careful consideration of employment effects.  That is recognised in the recommendation itself.</p></speech>

The evidence from comparative research is that countries with stronger collective bargaining systems have lower wage inequality overall and have lower gender pay gaps.  This is an important step in the right direction.  It is also consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment under a range of international agreements such as the European Social Charter and the International Convention of Economic Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR.</p> <p>  To conclude that whirlwind, gender inequality in the labour market clearly involves many factors and we need to use multiple policy levers to address it.  It also involves multiple actors such as Government, employers, unions and also change within families in terms of gender roles.  That can be supported by policy.  We need to look at these in the round and consider them alongside the recommendations around care and welfare because they all interact. </p></speech>

I am grateful to her for that and for giving such great insight into the context for implementation of recommendations 32 to 36.  I appreciate that and colleagues will have many questions for her and her colleagues on that.</p> <p>  I will now move to Professor Galligan who is dealing with the recommendations 20 to 25.  I should say we grouped citizens' assembly recommendations together into modules because our timeframe is so short.  Hence the reason for considering the two sets.  However, as Professor Russell said, these are all inter-related with the care and social protection recommendations which we have already considered and heard from other witnesses on.  I invite Professor Galligan to make her opening statement and then we will throw open the discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Yvonne Galligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#E00500"><p>I thank the Chair.  My statement will focus primarily on three themes and recommendations.  The recommendations on politics are encompassed by recommendation 20.  The recommendation on public boards relates to recommendation 21 and the recommendation on family-friendly practices relates to recommendation 23.  I will then make some brief comments on social media, to which recommendation 24 refers and workplace equality to which recommendation 25 relates.  Recommendation 22 is addressed in my written submission.</p> <p>  Looking first at politics, the gender quota recommendation came in two parts: one was to extend the candidate gender quota to all political electoral contests, and the second was to increase the candidate gender threshold from 30% to 40% and apply it to all elections.  An analysis of gender patterns of candidates at general, Seanad, local and European elections concluded that a relatively small number of additional female candidates would be required to reach the 40% threshold.  Therefore, based on the most recent set of elections, it would be feasible for parties overall to meet the 40% candidate gender quota.  It is also realistic to have this quota extended to local government elections.</p> <p>  A related recommendation focuses on increasing penalties for party non-compliance.  This issue has not arisen to date in a general election context, so no change is required at the moment in the current provision.  In regard to local elections, a financial penalty could be linked to party funding in that regard.  Seanad elections are somewhat more complex given that parties do not directly nominate candidates but looking at the balance of candidates on the panels, it appears that the Agricultural Panel is least gender-representative with only 20% female candidates.</p> <p>  In regard to public boards, there are 194 public boards with an overall female membership profile of 45% as of February 2022.  This masks wide variation in board gender representation.  For example, 63 of those boards had less than 40% female members at that time.  Some boards have a tiny membership and that militates against a 40:60 gender balance - for example the Army Pensions Board and the Credit Union Restructuring Board have only three members each.  At any time there are a number of board vacancies.  In February 2022 this amounted to 165 vacancies.  Were these vacancies filled only by females the overall gender proportion of board members would come closer to equal that it is at present.</p> <p>  Recommendation 21a is to make funding to these boards contingent on achieving gender balance by 2025.  Boards at risk of a funding penalty need to examine closely ways of improving their gender balance.  This requires targeted action by all involved.  This could include encouraging nominating bodies to put forward female nominees or signalling interest from female applicants through a strong statement in the advertisement for members.  It also requires a risk analysis by each board on the viability of its work in the context of reduced funding consequent on not reaching the 40% target.  My main conclusion around this is that the consequences of applying that recommendation in terms of reducing the funding to public boards needs to be teased out a little bit more to understand the effect it would have on different boards if it was applied.  Some more work needs to be finessed there.</p> <p>  In regard to family-friendly practices, my comments here are an update note to my written submission because on 28 June 2022, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, received Cabinet approval to introduce maternity leave for city and local councillors.</p><p>This goes some way to implementing recommendation 23a and is a positive beginning to bringing elected representatives into the ambit of family-friendly practices that apply to all other working parents.  Applying this provision to Deputies and Ministers could require a referendum on Article 15.11, and, possibly, on Article 41.2, which I know the committee has already considered.  Lessons and practices derived from Covid-19 on remote meeting attendance and decision-making could offer a way of making flexibility in parliamentary working practices routine and disrupting gender stereotypes before a referendum is undertaken, especially if Article 15.11 were the subject of that referendum.  I say that because the clause deals with in-person voting in Parliament.</p><p> Turning now to social media, recommendation 24 addresses the urgency of providing a legislative and policy framework for making technology and social media companies accountable for their publication and dissemination of online sexual harassment, bullying and other abusive behaviour targeted at women and girls.  The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 addresses the individual experience, but there is further safeguarding work to be done by making social media sites accountable for the publication of such abuse.  In that regard, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 being considered by the Oireachtas could address this recommendation.  I look forward to the debate on this legislation in the weeks to come.</p><p> Recommendation 25 relates to ensuring that workplaces implement gender-neutral recruitment and promotion policies.  It would be helpful in promoting gender equality for the committee to reiterate the importance of this recommendation to employers, unions, employees and the public.  Encouraging widespread adoption of good practice in this area would enhance equal opportunities between women and men in the workplace, especially as women are more likely to work part time and, post-pandemic, also being more likely to work remotely.  I look forward to questions and comments.</p></speech>

The written submission goes into far more detail, particularly on the issue of the feasibility of reaching the quota in different elections etc.  She has given us a clear indication of a recommendation we might wish to make regarding filling vacancies on public boards with women.  I now invite my colleagues to contribute.  We usually have a time limit on exchanges to enable everyone to get in on a second round, if necessary.  Therefore, these are limited to eight minutes.  Deputy Clarke must leave early, so I call her first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#F00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their time and expertise.  It is invaluable to have them here so we can tease out these issues.  I wish to focus on one specific area contained in the opening statement.  It concerns the level of wage replacement.  What is the norm in other jurisdictions where parental leave is in place regarding employer obligations and the rate of State parental leave payments?  It is currently set at a rate of &euro;250 a week here.  What impact does Professor Galligan see this having?  Are there examples from other jurisdictions that we should be looking at in respect of best practice?  I am sure Professor Galligan is familiar with the global gender gap report published in July which found that it would take us more than 130 years to reach gender parity.  I note that some of the countries mentioned in respect of being the best performers in this area are countries this committee has heard being referred to before in this regard.  I refer specifically to the Nordic countries, which seem to be doing good work in this area.  Can Professor Galligan give us an example of the impact of parental leave and the parents benefit rate being set at &euro;250 a week?  Is there another jurisdiction that we should be looking to in respect of the best proven practice in this area?</p></speech>

An international committee produces a document annually which tries to bring all this information together.  When we look at the length of leave, Ireland compares quite favourably across all these different headings.  It is becoming complex because we have many different types of leave, such as parental, maternity, paternity and parents leave, for example.  When we take all those together, we compare favourably on the length of leave.  Moving to consider the generosity of the payments, however-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen Russell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#F00600"><p>That happens in other countries.  We are in the low-performing group concerning the payment.  We are much lower than the average rate.  As Deputy Clarke said, the Nordic countries and some of the other northern European countries also have much more generous payments.  What we see therefore is that fathers are much more likely to take up this leave if the payment rate is higher.  In some countries, there is a full replacement rate.  There are also top-ups from employers.  Potentially, we could have some employers here topping up payments, if not perhaps to the full wage rate.  The situation in this context is similar to that with maternity benefit, in that it is quite unequal.  It is the people who are already well paid and in higher-income brackets who get those top-ups from their employers.  Therefore, it is divisive in the context of social class.  It is better if the payment is not dependent on the discretion of the employer.  I do not give the figures off-hand for the replacement rates in other countries, but this information is produced regularly and I could pass it on.  There are certainly many examples of good practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#F00700"><p>That would be interesting.  The reason I ask this is because I do not think anyone is unfamiliar with the current cost of living.  These things almost ebb and flow.  I refer to the situation where there may be a cap on the amount of money that a father, especially, can take home when on leave.  When we talk about gender equality, we do not just talk about it from the perspective of women; we speak about gender equality in the round.  In that context, are we denying fathers the opportunity to avail of this leave and of spending time with their children because of issues like the cost of living?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.318" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#F00800"><p>Regarding the comparison in the context of paternity leave, the research shows that it is leave targeted at fathers that is important in reducing the gender pay gap, and not necessarily parents or parental leave that either a father or a mother can avail of.  As my colleague said, our length of paternity leave is comparable with other countries, but the &euro;250 rate of paternity benefit does not compare.  When we look across other European countries and those countries in the EU, it is not unusual for the replacement rate to even be 80% to 100% of the father's income.  Therefore, one of the key components in addressing gender equality is to try to address the share of the burden of childcare divided between genders.  When we compare Ireland with other countries, this is one area where we find that we are a good bit lower than what is achieved elsewhere.  This relates to the fact that we often talk about fathers being less likely, as my colleague said, to take leave.  We again see this occurring across the EU, but the latest figures for Ireland show that less than half of fathers entitled to paternity leave take it.  We might wonder why that is.  As was said, it is because of the cost of living-----</p></speech>

If the rate of paternity benefit is &euro;250 weekly, then many people will not be able to take that leave.  Therefore, this is one area that could potentially be targeted.  I say that because when we talk about general parental leave, or even maternity leave, it is a bit more complicated, because it is not clear how an increase in those levels will impact on the gender wage gap.  Research exists which shows that if maternity leave is increased it could have the opposite effect of that intended by extending the time women are outside of work.  Therefore, it is the policies that target fathers and that try to address this division of labour that are important.</p></speech>

I will pick up on the point made about the balance between men and women when taking leave and returning to the workplace.  Cost and pay are a major part of that but culture affects it too.  Until there is a culture at senior level in commercial organisations of men freely taking leave or adopting a flexible week for three years after their partner has a baby, it is impossible, through pay or otherwise, to overcome the cultural barrier.  Men must see that ahead of them.  It must become normalised and acceptable for a man to do that as part of his career, as much as anything else.  Do our guests wish to quickly respond before I move on?</p></speech>

Those gender norms are very important in influencing behaviour.  We need to actively encourage men to take up flexible work options, as I said, to try to rebalance so that it does not become a penalty on women to do that.</p></speech>

I introduced a Bill to change the Constitution to remove the barrier requiring Members to be here in person and to make provision for the Houses of the Oireachtas, under their rules, to set the circumstances under which a Member could apply for a period of leave.  It anticipates that this could be maternity or paternity leave because there are men in the House who have had babies recently.  The Bill would allow Members to vote remotely for a period in order to be available at home.  Other circumstances we could anticipate include somebody going through cancer treatment who is immunosuppressed and wants to continue doing the job but cannot be in the crowded environment of D&aacute;il Eireann and further future emergencies similar to the pandemic, for example.  The Government supports the Bill.  I ask our guests to give their views on that and the politics of having that conversation.  I worry about this proposal being perceived as a day off for politicians or making life easier for politicians.  How do we reconcile that because I worry about it?  People are concerned about making sure the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, can do this.  It is worth teasing out the issue now.</p></speech>

This measure should be framed in the context of modernising the Oireachtas as a workplace, because it is a workplace for many people - Deputies, Senators and all the staff around the Houses.  The Constitution implies that Members will be in the Chamber and voting in person.  The interpretation of what voting in person means has changed to one that was never envisaged in 1937.  If one were to change that and bring it to a referendum, it would have to be in the context of other changes that also modernise the Oireachtas as a workplace in a way that enables male and female representatives to genuinely reconcile their work and family lives in the same way as all other members of the workplace can do so.</p></speech>

CyberSafeKids argues that if a parent sees something about their child or a video that is being used to bully their child, they should be able to contact the social media company in question and it should be required to take the material down within 24 or 48 hours or they can make an emergency complaint to the Information Commissioner.  The effect of that would be, we hope, that the social media companies would take responsibility for either taking it down or dealing with the consequences later.  This is obviously especially important with respect to minors.  In Australia a model was introduced where minors were looked after first and the measure was then extended to the broader population.  However, we can see how misinformation and problem information about politicians are impacting on democracy and what people know and believe.  Is there anything we can do to try to protect democracy through social media through a measure like that or something else?  Do our guests see what I am trying to say?  It is about trying to get rid of genuinely wrong information.</p></speech>

There is a process and well-worked routine for the traditional media to address false information, namely, by taking it down, making retracting statements and taking all other necessary measures to amend the record and in some way redress the harm done to the individual, group or whatever else.  Social media providers need to be considered in that context.  In that frame, they must be considered responsible for publishing online this misinformation or whatever it may be and should be held accountable, in a similar fashion as the traditional media are held accountable, for those statements and for taking action if those statements can be shown to be misinformation.  That is my response on that.  It is interesting that the anonymity behind these platforms is also an issue.  That feeds into part of the misinformation.</p></speech>

On the one hand, social media has provided the public with many good things, so let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  On the other hand, because of the anonymity often associated with these pages, accounts or whatever and the very simplistic messages that come across through these accounts, it is very easy to overly influence the understanding of complex problems.  That is leading to many expressions of anti-democratic sentiment across Europe, which is a matter of concern.</p></speech>

It is great to be in the room with such expertise.  We will try to get everything we can out of them while they are here.</p> <p>  I want to address the minimum wage and flexible working, which I will come back to, however, Deputy Carroll MacNeill raised the point about politics which I will tease out further.  She chaired an excellent session at yesterday's Parliamentary Symposium which was on the issue of gender and participation.  Ms Rachel Weston Eschenbacher, the regional policy specialist on political participation and governance for the UN, raised an interesting point.  She said that in Malta, if they do not reach a certain level of elected women, ten extra seats will be allocated to be filled by women.  This is somewhat similar to the Seanad, where we now have 40% women but we did not get anywhere near that percentage elected through the ordinary process.  Nine of the 11 nominees of the Taoiseach were women and that is what made up the difference.  I wonder whether there should be a policy instrument to force people to do that.  It would be a different way of looking at democracy in order to have better representation.  Much legislation has come through the Seanad that specifically addresses some of the issue for women, regarding stalking and character witnesses at rape and sexual assault trials for instance.  That is one point I wanted to make as an aside.</p> <p>  I am the chair of the Green Party, one of the roles of which is to find people to run for election.  It is often difficult to find women candidates, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill has identified, and it is something we want to do.  Some 50% of our elected councillors are women.  There is a retention problem.  Once women start having children, they find they cannot deal with a full-time job, a part-time job and motherhood.  It is quite hard to do.  I would love to hear the witnesses' thoughts on retention.  Changes to maternity and paternity leave introduced this year will address some of that but they will not address the fundamental fact, which I also raised yesterday, that it is not just about childcare.  It is about the fact that we want to spend time with our children.  Women, who I am looking for to run for election, want to spend time with their children.  They do not want a service to be able to send their child to.  The job of a Deputy or a Senator would be much easier if Members did not have to leave their home county and stay in Dublin for the week.  It should be framed in terms of it not being about the people who are elected.  It is about the people we want to be elected.  It is about better participation of the general public in politics.  It is not that we are looking for something for those of us who are elected.  I am here and I have made those decisions and that is fine.  It would be better to frame a referendum in those terms so that our Parliament can be better reflective of society in general.</p> <p>  I refer to the other issue of minimum wage.  I believe Dr. Redmond worked with Professor Russell on the impact of increasing the minimum wage on the overall participation within the workforce.  We now have an increase to the minimum wage which is the equivalent to &euro;35 per week.  If people feel the hours they work allow them to spend more time doing what they want at home so that they can reduce their hours, that is not a bad thing.  The point we are trying to get to is not necessarily to have full participation for full hours in the workforce.  We are trying to get to a point where people are paid well enough for the work they do so that they can make decisions for their family.  One of those decisions may be that they want to spend more time at home or work part time.  This relates to a point Professor Russell made in that if we have more flexibility, but that flexibility is taken up by women and not men, we will continue the pay-gap problem.  More women taking up flexible work should not be a problem if they are paid well enough for their leave.  If women want to spend more time at home, I think that is fine.  Should we look at a shorter working week so that everybody could spend more time at home?  We have not addressed the issue of a shorter working week as opposed to just the pay.  I will stop so that the witnesses can speak.</p></speech>

The Senator raised many interesting questions.  The long-hours culture she referred to in regard to politicians is something that also applies in other roles in the workplace.  Having a long-hours culture signals that one is not valuing care.  That must be addressed by employers and unions.  Having reduced hours is a positive in terms of reconciling the different commitments people have.  The problem is that it can be punished.  As I mentioned, there is a pay penalty for shorter hours with people earning less per hour.  There is also the perception that if people take up those flexible options, they are not as committed to employment and progression.  The key thing is having those options across organisations so that it does not stop.  We looked at this in the Civil Service.  People could have flexibility up to a certain point, but when they became a principal officer, that flexibility disappeared and they were expected to work very long hours.  Therefore, that needs to be addressed.  In other countries there is not necessarily the same penalty in working part-time hours.  It is not universal, and it does not have to be that way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#H00500"><p>I will respond to the Senator's question on minimum wage in a moment, but I will first add to what my colleague said.  The ESRI did work recently on how men and women select jobs and what characteristics they prefer.  I use the word "preference", but preferences can be shaped by discrimination and other factors and so on.  We found that men are far more likely to say that they chose a job because of pay, whereas women are far more likely to say they chose a job because it was close to home or it was flexible.  What one finds is that there is a trade-off, which we call a compensating differential.  Women who are highly educated and could command a high wage seem to trade off a higher salary for increased flexibility.  That is a major factor in terms of the remaining gender wage gap, and addressing that is a key issue.  It has been described by some as the final chapter in achieving gender wage equality.  How does one address this?  There is scope for policy to do that.  When compared with other EU countries, it is particularly strong in Ireland.  Women seem to make this trade-off in terms of flexibility and pay.</p> <p>  The question on hours and the minimum wage is very interesting and it is something about which we think a lot.  The ESRI has done a large body of work on the effect of minimum wage increases on employment.  We found that while one does not really see jobs losses, one tends to see a reduction in hours.  A key question is why that is.  Where is that coming from?  There are two possibilities.  It could be that employers are cutting the hours of employees in response to higher wages.  It could also be the case, as Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, that if someone is earning higher wages, he or she may decide to work less so as to spend time with his or her family and so on.  It is hard to disentangle these effects and it is likely a combination of the two.</p><p>There has been research in the UK which would suggest that it generally might come from employers cutting wages.  Conversely, we also found some evidence in Ireland to say there is an increase in voluntary part-time work, which would suggest that it is at least partly coming in response to workers themselves.  If that is the case then it is not really a concern because we are not generating adverse employment effects in that regard.</p></speech>

I see Dr. Tuda would like to come in on this.  I am conscious of time and other people wanting to contribute.  Perhaps Dr. Tuda could come in on this and Professor Galligan might come in after the next questioner and respond to Senator O'Reilly.</p></speech>

I will add to the statements of Dr. Redmond and Dr. Russell.  From international literature, especially in the UK, we know that if women choose part-time work after they have children, they never fully catch up with men over their lifetimes in the context of their earnings.  That means they miss out on both on-the-job learning and promotion opportunities.  The sole fact is that if they do choose flexible or part-time work once they have children they will never fully catch up with men.  That is what drives the gender wage gap, even at the top of the earnings distribution.</p></speech>

I want to go back to parental leave, which we know is for fathers.  The reason most fathers do not take it is that they cannot survive on &euro;250 because, given that we are talking about the gender pay gap, they are possibly earning more than their wives or partners anyway.  Are there any countries where it is obligatory for companies to make up the difference?  Where is the gender pay gap in those countries?  Is it as stark as it is in Ireland?  That is one question.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree with the National Women's Council that positive laws rather than soft recommendations could make a difference?  Gender quotas can be controversial, in particular when women who are put forward in politics might get on the ticket before men in their group.  It is controversial because women want to feel that they got there on merit.  At the same time, it is important that women get through the door so that they can make the difference and be seen in politics.  Sometimes this generation of women just have to shoulder that burden for future generations.  Do the witnesses have any comments on that?</p> <p>  Professor Galligan mentioned previously that she felt parties were not reaching the quotas.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports increasing the quota to 40%, and for local elections as well.  It is very important to put the onus on parties in that regard because when they look around their groups, they will find women who are well capable of working.  Politics is about people and policies, and women are quite good at working out new things like that.  Does Professor Galligan have any comments on that matter?  Deputy Carroll MacNeill stated that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is having her second baby. I was so delighted when I heard that.  This might sound controversial, but by having a second baby in one term, she is putting it up to the people who might say "There she is having another baby".  Deputy McDonald got a lot of stick in the media when she was having her children while she was an MEP.  Congratulations to the Minister for doing it and for being brave enough to say she wants to have a second baby.  The witnesses can share their comments.  I will probably come in on the next round as well.</p></speech>

What we are tackling in that area is cultural perceptions of women's and men's roles.  When we implement gender quotas, we are going against the grain of our culture, which subconsciously has said that women have to take a back place.  Gender quotas are designed to break the cultural norm that we have buried very deeply in our subconscious.  Deputy Cronin is quite right that this offers an entry.  It offers the first rung on the ladder.  Then it is up to a female candidate to prove that she can get elected.  That is the test: if one gets elected.  Often then when the individual is elected, there is never a question of whether they were a candidate that came through a quota mechanism or any other mechanism.  It is an interventionist measure.  Because politics has got to do with power, it is always going to be a fraught question.  My argument is that parties are right to stick to their guns and reassure women who are elected through processes of this kind that it is not something that is special for them, that it is helping them to redress the historical and institutional biases against women over a long period and that this is only a way of trying to level the playing field.</p> <p>  The other point about the Minister for Justice and others is that they are very important role models for all women and men in society as a whole because they are normalising the fact that being a mother or a parent is a normal part of life and goes on irrespective of one's occupation or activity in life.  That is a very important message to send out.  In speaking of my own experience in the workplace and dealing with this issue, which relates to another recommendation, there is often a hesitancy still among women in the workplace to come forward to their line managers or workplace colleagues to say that they are pregnant and they are going to need time off work.  That is a great pity in this day and age when at any time we should be celebrating motherhood and parenthood more generally.  They are very important role models in that regard.</p></speech>

The Chairman is absolutely right about the Seanad nominees.</p><p>The discretion the Taoiseach has in that respect was important for gender balance in the Seanad.  We need to think about how we handle gender representation at local election level in particular.  I was struck by the comment by my colleague beside me who talked about how women choose jobs because of their flexibility and closeness to home, and that this is the main reason for doing so.  The main reason that always has been given for women taking part in local elections is because of the flexibility and closeness to home of that particular representative role and yet in Ireland, we still only have 25% female councillors.  We really need to look at local government in a targeted way to see what can be done to improve gender balance at local level now.  Some measures include the Maltese measure, which is an interesting one that is mirrored in the Seanad process, as well as the issue around penalties for parties or some sanction or strong incentive to improve.  Local government is the pipeline to national government, be it in the Seanad or as a Deputy.  I will just make those points.</p><p> I will make a very brief point on representation in public life.  While we spoke about women's participation on boards, we did not speak about the chairing of those boards.  While there is relatively healthy representation of women in boards, more can be done.  The issue is there, however.  Representation at the level of chair is still a difficult issue.  That, again, is a leadership position that needs to be tackled in terms of public representation in general.</p></speech>

They also have that system, which is what we have done as well, that a person uses it or loses it.  It is not transferable between partners because that tends to also lead to lower take-up by men.  The UK, interestingly, has just gone down that route to say people can share the leave, which is likely to lead to even lower take-up.  The Nordic countries also have a lower pay gap.</p></speech>

I cannot remember off the top of my head but we are talking about close to one year or whatever in terms of what a person can take.  They also have many other benefits and arrangements in their welfare system.  Although they have a narrower pay gap, it is hard to then pin that on the parent's leave.  There is also a much different system of childcare provision.  As I mentioned, they also have the collective bargaining systems.  They have much narrower wage differentials across the board.  It is kind of that whole package of measures that leads to a narrow gap.  They are not nirvana, however, in that there is still a pay gap even in these countries.  That is partly to do with occupational segregation in respect of what jobs men and women are doing in the economy.  There are still those patterns, even in the Nordic countries.  They have not completely nailed it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#K01200"><p>I have a couple of quick questions for Professor Galligan and then more of my questions will focus towards the ESRI.</p> <p>  I thank Professor Galligan for her work.  I will make a comment on the gender quota piece that I have made previously and which others have heard.  The research shows that gender quotas are not a matter for women; they are a matter for society and for better decision-making.  The research shows that when we have more diversity and representation in a room, everybody works harder and everybody performs harder.  In fact, it has a way of stripping out mediocrity or groupthink.  Professor Galligan might comment on the research.  It is not a leg-up for women; it is a matter of fixing systems that are dysfunctional.</p> <p>  In that regard, building on a couple of the specific points raised by Professor Galligan, I note the 40% quota in terms of corporate boards.  Professor Galligan mentioned the EU directive and that eight countries have taken legislative measures.  It seems to have been the approach that legislative measures are needed when it comes to the private sector, which is why eight countries have done that and why that EU directive is in place.  Professor Galligan might comment on that.</p> <p>  The State boards issue is interesting.  We saw, for example, that higher education has one of the highest balances of women.  Professor Galligan could perhaps comment on initiatives like the Athena SWAN programme, which has demanded that attention be paid the whole way up the ladder and how that may have contributed to how we are seeing that level of shift there.</p> <p>  Professor Galligan carried out analysis in terms of women not only being on boards, but on what boards.  Similarly, the media analysis was not just about women being in media but what they are being asked to discuss.  Previous research found that often, women were being asked to talk about their experiences while men were being asked to give their analysis, for example.  It highlighted the importance of the types of opportunities being given within media.</p> <p>  My main questions are for the ESRI.  Again, it comes back to that same question.  What we are looking at here are not just some things for women and how we move them along.  We are looking at how we deal with a society that is deeply unjust and badly designed, and similarly in terms of the workplace.  I was a little concerned about the idea of the trade-off and the choices women make.  The other way one can phrase it is the penalisation that is attached to care or the preference to have invisible care support because all those men are not simply making a different choice; they are relying on an invisible care support in many cases, and on a society that is framed that way.  It is about how we frame it, not as being an issue for women but as being an issue for society and how we design it.  Why is it acceptable that if a person moves to a part-time role, he or she is somehow not on the same progression ladder or that if a person takes two years out, he or she does not continue up that ladder and that is penalised?  Why do we accept that being penalised?  It is not simply around why women make different choices or about getting them to make the same choices as men, or that hopefully, if they are this top economic cohort, which is where much of the focus seems to be in the analysis, maybe they can get paid childcare.  We need systemic change.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that.</p> <p>  I was really disappointed, to be frank, that one of the old tropes we hear about minimum wage and job losses was replicated in the ESRI's statement, even though the same paragraph goes on to point out that the research does not show it.  It states "Given that women are more likely to be minimum wage workers than men, such job losses could disproportionately affect women."  However, the research shows that it does not actually stand up that there are necessarily job losses.  The fact is that the ESRI acknowledges later that Ireland has the highest income inequality; we are 32nd out of 34 in the OECD for income and equality.  Perhaps that has a knock-on, in that we are not analysing if top pay differentials have an impact in companies.  SMEs are being pushed out when we know, for example, that the big lobbyists, and we should be honest and frank on things like trying to keep the minimum wage down, are very wealthy companies such as major retail companies, the fast-food sector and all of those companies that make vast profits.  It may seem like it is just a line to put in when we do this, but what we are doing is fuelling what will be a very real debate affecting women, predominantly, around things like the minimum wage.  We are putting out a kind of scarecrow that was out there before that is not proven.  The minimum wage is a massive issue.  We have measures such as ability to pay to deal with the companies in trouble.  However, and this is again in the analysis, why the unexplained gender gap in our wages?  We are not simply looking for what cannot be explained by conditions of the market or the fact that people are in lesser-paid work.</p><p>The issue is that there are certain sectors, predominantly those where women are, where the wages are lower.  That is not about women choosing higher or lower-paid jobs; it is about work, where women do it, being valued less.</p><p> I am not just critiquing the point that has been made in recommendation 35 on the right to collective bargaining; I want to welcome it also.  I would like it if the witnesses from the ESRI could elaborate on the importance of that and on what we need to be doing to address the wage inequality issue in Ireland, which is exacerbated by the fact that women tend to be pooled.  I ask the witnesses to also comment on the knock-on effects on pension inequality, where the gap tends to be even wider.  I am concerned about the leadership positions, the top positions and the senior executive who gets a bonus and the senior executive who does not get a bonus.  At the same time, at a crucial level, if we are to address injustices in society we need to look, not just to the unexplained but to the explanations that are given, whether they are acceptable and whether they need to be systemically changed.  I ask the witnesses from the ESRI to comment on some of the explanations given around the wage gap and the measures we should be taking to address and redress them, as well as individuals' choices.</p></speech>

I will invite Professor Galligan to comment first.  The first questions Senator Higgins had were on the gender quotas in the boards.  I will go to the ESRI for a response after that and I see that Dr. Tuda wants to come in on that as well.</p></speech>

On the 40% on corporate boards, the agenda in Ireland has moved on a little bit since my submission, which was in February.  Since that point in time Senator Higgins tabled a Private Members' Bill in 2021 and subsequently the EU came to an agreement and there is now a political directive on 40% gender quotas.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, accepted the Private Members' Bill that was put forward by Senator Higgins and that will progress.  That is the way forward and I agree with the Senator wholeheartedly.</p> <p>  That measure can be accompanied in another way by measures that then require all bodies that look for public funding or that are required to achieve certain legislative measures to have gender equality plans and publish them.  That is the model and strength of the Athena SWAN programme, which is in operation across the higher education sector.  That programme has not been long in existence; it is only since about 2014 or 2015 that it has been in Irish higher education but it has had a transformative effect on same and has enabled a spotlight to be put on the positives and the needs and challenges for change around gender equality and higher education.  The key to it, apart from a close audit, is the publication of plans to advance gender equality in the organisation.  I note that is a recommendation that is made by the assembly under recommendation 22 and State boards could be doing the same thing, as could corporate boards.</p> <p>  There are measures that can be taken in that regard.  The more diverse a decision-making body and the more diverse viewpoints that are part of the decision-making process then research shows that the more robust those decisions are the better for that organisation and that society.  That is clearly indicated in research.  Both diversity and quality are partners in this, rather than sacrificing quality for diversity.  The old argument is that one cannot have more women or people of other backgrounds because they will dilute quality, which is not the case.  In fact diversity enhances the quality of the performance and outcomes of an organisation.</p></speech>

If we are trying to categorise the evidence on minimum wage increases it is safe to say there are many studies that show that moderate or small minimum wage increases are associated with little to no job loss.  There are many credible studies that indicate adverse employment effects and we found adverse employment effects in hours reductions.</p> <p>  The evidence is not cut and dry; there are studies that show negative employment effects but importantly, in Ireland we are talking about targeting a living wage as the minimum wage.  The reality is that the evidence on minimum wage increases tends to look at relatively small minimum wages and the truth is we just do not know enough about large minimum wage increases to the extent where the minimum wage is going to 60% of median income, for example.  We need to continuously monitor this and investigate whether there are negative employment effects.  This is important, especially in light of recent evidence on the UK living wage, which is trying to evaluate the consequences of same.</p> <p>  A recent UK study shows that in general and overall there are little to no job loss effects when a living wage is introduced but when they drill down deeper into the data they show that when one looks at women there were some job loss effects.  We have to pay attention to potential adverse consequences therefore and this is something the Low Pay Commission referenced.  Usually when one is thinking about a living wage, that differs from a minimum wage as the focus is on what rate it should be and other factors such as the state of the economy are considered less and less.  The Low Pay Commission has stressed in its report that even while moving towards a living wage it is crucial to pay attention to other factors and to try to quantify what is happening with employment effects.  I take the point that in general we tend to see relatively limited job loss or negative employment effects to a living wage being introduced but the truth is that we still need to monitor this.</p></speech>

That is not where we are coming from or where the evidence is.  We are talking about all these different processes that are underlying it.  When we talk about unexplained gaps we are talking about when differences between men and women when it comes to education, job experience or age are stripped out and when we look at that we see that the gap is wider.  We are saying that if one just looks at the raw gap in the average pay for men and women there is a certain gap but if one controls all these other things and compare like with like then women should be earning more.  The adjusted gap is even higher therefore.  It is not so much about individual characteristics; it is about employment policies and how we structure opportunities in the labour market.</p><p>We mentioned occupational segregation and the devaluation of highly feminised jobs.  That is something we discussed extensively in the assembly.  Certain occupations that are highly feminised such as the care occupations, including childcare, are low paid.  We need to address that more structurally.  There is some work going on with the employment regulation orders so that there would be an upward shift in pay for that group.  I do not know if that will be enough.  There is certainly an issue with work being devalued and it is partly devalued because it is done by women.  The lower status of women seems to rub off onto the status of the occupation.  There is interesting research into how as jobs become more feminised, historically the pay levels come down.  I do not think it relates to individual preferences and there are many structural issues we need to address.</p></speech>

Senator Higgins nailed it there.  If men are not really allowed to make a choice of working flexibly or working part time because they are not compensated as women would be when taking parental leave, it is very difficult to expect more equal outcomes after the fact.  If replacement rates are made equal for men and women once they are making decisions about parental leave, that would yield more equal choices in the long run over the lifetime.  The literature points to this.</p> <p>  When we talk about the unexplained gap, because of the data constraints there, we were not able to include sector or occupation in the analysis.  It is true to say that women are normally not compensated as much as men because they work in sectors that are lower paid.  That goes into that unexplained gap because of the data constraints when we were doing this analysis.  In future I hope to get better data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and be able to say something more about sectors and occupational wage gaps.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on gender equality and representation at political level.  It is much easier to achieve gender balance in the Seanad than people let on.  The Taoiseach has been commended on nominating nine women out of 11.  Gender equality is entirely linked to Seanad reform.  The Seanad reform implementation group has discussed at length how we would achieve gender balance in the Seanad.  While we are constrained by the Constitution, the Taoiseach should use the 11 nominees to address any lack of diversity that exists, including gender.  It would be possible to introduce legislation stating that the Taoiseach would have regard to having diversity and gender balance.</p> <p>  Of the 43 Members elected from the vocational panels, some are nominated by nominating bodies, many of which have up to 11 nominations.  Nominating bodies that can make more than one nomination should be required to achieve a gender balance of at least 40% or 50% to ensure we have a gender balance of candidates in future.  On the Agricultural Panel, I think there are nominating bodies that have 11 nominees.  Many nominating bodies, including on my own panel, have one nomination.  We have proposed a Seanad electoral amendment that where a nominating body has just one nomination, it would be given a second nomination if that achieved a gender balance.</p> <p>  The whole structure and complexity of the Seanad electoral system - the inside and outside subpanels - could be used for gender balance.  God, it is so complex.  Oireachtas Members nominate and a limited number of those would be elected.  A limited number of those from the nominating bodies would be elected.  Those inside and outside subpanels could be used for male and female.  Therefore, the whole structure of the place could be based on achieving gender balance.  That is probably more radical, but the complexities of the Seanad could enable much greater gender balance in representation.</p> <p>  We discussed quotas at a local level when officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage appeared before the committee.  They said that political funding is tied to D&aacute;il seats and it all revolves around the D&aacute;il election.  Therefore, there is no solution yet other than basically imposing penalties on parties.  I welcome Professor Galligan's contribution on incentives to reach balance.  If those incentives are good enough, we can surely achieve the required change at local level.</p></speech>

I had not gone into detail on that in my submission.  I appreciate his additional comments, especially the potential to require nominating bodies to present gender-balanced candidate slates wherever they can.  Obviously if they only nominate one, another provision could kick in.  However, we are talking about ones that can nominate two or more.  That is a very significant number of them.  That is very much in line with the existing legislation that applies to political parties.  If we also introduce legislation on gender balance on State boards, there is no reason that nominating bodies could not also be part of this framework, with the expectation that there would be gender balance at all decision-making levels and at the points at which decisions on who the decision-makers are can be made.  What the Senator said about the complexity of the Seanad electoral system is very helpful.</p> <p>  Regarding carrots and sticks, it is often worthwhile exploring the carrot approach.  It is very easy to reach for the stick approach.  Properly constructed incentives can go a long way to achieving the outcomes that are for the good of society more generally.</p></speech>

As Chair, I wish to ask a few short questions before we move to the second round.  I thank colleagues for their forbearance.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses for their excellent and thought-provoking presentations.  In a previous D&aacute;il term, Professor Galligan appeared before the justice committee when we conducted our hearings on women's representation in politics.  Our report on that in 2009 encapsulated her research in the five Cs, the obstacles women face on progress in politics.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite the introduction of quotas, we still see those obstacles - cash, childcare, confidence, culture and candidate selection - obstructing women's career progression.  Still only 23% of our Deputies are women, so obviously we have a lot more to do.  That has been recognised in the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.</p><p> My first question, which is to Professor Galligan, follows from what Senator Warfield said about a carrot-and-stick approach or incentive and sanction.  On that interesting model that Senator Warfield proposes, what is the sanction or incentive for nominating bodies for the Seanad or private boards that do not reach quotas?  I can see that with public boards there is an easier way of addressing that.  Professor Galligan&rsquo;s figures on public boards are interesting.  She made the point that if all 165 vacancies were filled with women, we would achieve parity.  That would be an important recommendation for the committee to consider.  Professor Galligan also pointed out that there are a number of State boards - I think there were five - where there are no women, including the Pensions Authority.  That too requires to be highlighted.</p><p> Professor Galligan made one very useful recommendation about sanctions, namely, that at local government level, the amount of incentive funding given to parties to promote women candidates could be reduced if quotas for local election candidates were not reached.  That is good because when we tried to get local election quotas in previously, in 2011 and 2012 when the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, was introducing the quota legislation, he made the point that there was no clear way of sanctioning parties because funding is tied to D&aacute;il representation.  Will Professor Galligan comment on that?  </p><p> It is interesting in relation to recommendation 22 in the fuller submission that the sports governing bodies appear to be moving ahead of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly timeframe on representation, whereas arts bodies have made less progress.  Later in the term, the committee will hear from Waking the Feminists and we will ask its representatives about their ideas on that but I ask Professor Galligan to say a little on it.</p><p> I thank Dr. Russell from the ESRI for the detailed data she provided.  I will home in on the gender pay gap work she has done.  I have done a good bit of work on this and I introduced a Private Members' Bill on it before the Government initiative.  I am interested in the data showing that the gender pay gap in Ireland has reduced to 11.3%.  Will Dr. Russell comment on the reason for that?  She pointed out that in Britain, where the legislation has been in place for longer, there has been a reduction in the pay gap.  However, the reduction is not due to a movement of women into larger firms or towards higher pay, as we would have hoped, but, rather, is due to a shift in male wages, primarily a decline.  She stated that in Denmark a reduction in the gender wage gap was also driven by lower male wages.  Clearly, that is not a positive development.  In other words, it is an equalising downwards.  Will Dr. Russell comment on that?  Are the two linked, or was that just a broader factor that was taking place in any event?  What are the implications for the gender pay gap?</p><p> I want to clarify an issue related to shared leave versus use-it-or-lose-it leave, which we have discussed already, because it has been a long-standing issue in the discussion on parental leave provision.  What is the best way to achieve gender equality?  Is it to require that it be fixed so that each parent has a fixed entitlement?  I have seen some arguments that suggest shared leave can be beneficial but generally the view is that is not so beneficial in driving equality.  I ask Dr. Russell to comment.  Perhaps Professor Galligan will respond first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Yvonne Galligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#N00200"><p>The question of incentives and sanctions is an interesting one.  The calibration of incentives and sanctions is key to affecting the outcome that one requires.  It struck me that while incentives can be framed in terms of financial support or financial incentives, sanctions can also be framed in that regard, for example, by local authorities reducing the incentive funding they have received.  In the case of other areas such as nominating bodies, I wonder if an electoral commission could actually refuse the list submitted by such a body if its nomination was not a balanced one.  Perhaps something could be done around that.  This happens quite frequently in other countries.  For example, in Belgium lists are refused from parties if they are not gender balanced.  I know we operate in a different electoral system and all the rest but it struck me, arising from Senator Warfield&rsquo;s comments on nominating bodies, that this is an area that could be explored.</p> <p>  I would like to link the idea of the requirement to publish gender equality plans with the context of the arts bodies and other bodies.  In the publication of those plans it is possible to make those bodies accountable for their lack of progress.  This allows for a transparent measure over a period of time - two, three or five years, or whatever - to be able to judge whether arts bodies, sports bodies or any other organisation or body have actually progressed in achieving their gender equality targets and plans.  That is a strong incentive mechanism to implement gender equality.  It is part of the institutional framework rather than part of the financial context in relation to it.</p> <p>  Private boards probably need to be treated a little differently because they are private entities.  Nonetheless, there will be examples and cases in other countries where measures are in place that require private boards that fail to reach gender balance on their boards to address the matter.  This may be in the form of a note to them that states they have three months or six months to address the problem such that there can be an increasing level of attention paid to that issue for private boards.</p></speech>

On the issue of change over time, on which Dr. Tuda may also wish to respond, one of the issues we face is that we do not have good recent data.  We have been working in a bit of a vacuum.

There are also EUROSTAT figures out there but they do not feature Ireland, which is a bit embarrassing.  However, new data have just become available.  It is important that we look at how those data track over time.  We have looked at the issue from 2012 to 2018.</p></speech>

To update the committee, 20 minutes before we came in this morning, I was looking at data from 2021 to see what the gender wage gap was from then.  The figure was approximately 10%.  It is a similar figure but it may have decreased slightly.  The new data available to us now should be invaluable to us in getting more current estimates.</p></speech>

There were two forces that went in a similar direction in decreasing the gender wage gap.  The first is that male wages have decreased.  This was especially the case during the great recession and, as the Chair mentioned, this decrease has cut the gender wage gap for the wrong reasons.</p><p>There was also an increase in female participation on the labour market and an increase in their wages, especially with regard to tertiary education.  This decreased the gender wage gap in a positive way.</p></speech>

When we look at Ireland, particularly when we compare it with other EU countries, the level of highly educated women is very interesting.  When we look at the percentage of women in Ireland educated to a tertiary level not only is it far higher than the average but it is far higher than every other EU country.  This is a very important factor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-15a.407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Helen Russell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022091500002#O00400"><p>On equalising downwards, which is not where we want to be, if pay transparency moderates very high wages at the top perhaps it is not such a bad thing.  If we are speaking about executive level pay it is not necessarily something that would be too negative.  If it is lower down the scale then that is an issue.  We do not want to equalise downwards.  Pay transparency will mean organisations will have to justify and explain the differences.  If it is because some executives have excessively high levels of pay it is something that will be open to scrutiny.  It may be the less problematic side of it.</p> <p>  When the citizens' assembly looked at shared leave the evidence was that having non-transferable leave was important.  Where there is shared leave it tends to be transferred to women.  Having to use it or lose it seems to be more associated with higher take-up of the leave by men.  This is an area where we need better data.  We do not have good data on who takes parental leave and whether there are top-ups by employers.  There is a real gap that we need to fill.</p></speech>

I was not commending the Taoiseach; I was suggesting that future Taoisigh could be forced to introduce gender equality measures through some form of legislation, as has been mentioned.  The Taoiseach did do us a service in the Seanad by having nine of the 11 nominees as women but it should not be up to him.  He took on board within the 11 the nomination of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, of Senator Eileen Flynn.  This was also a good thing.  We could have it whereby the Taoiseach is required to do this.</p> <p>  On the other points raised with regard to the Seanad, our party had an internal selection process that gave preference to women because of the number of men in the D&aacute;il and to balance it out.  We cannot look at the Seanad in isolation from the rest of the political system.  It is an opportunity to have a greater voice for women than there would be in the D&aacute;il on the basis that not many women are getting elected.</p> <p>  A point that has not been touched on is that many parties put men in winnable seats and women in unwinnable seats when it comes to selecting candidates.  They hit their gender quotas but the women are the third candidates in a constituency and unlikely to get elected.  This is a core reason we have very little movement in the number of women getting elected.  I would love to know how the witnesses would look at addressing this point.</p> <p>  I want to go back to a point raised by Senator Higgins, which I very much agree with, which is why I raised the point on the minimum wage.  Too often reports focus on employment rates as a positive or negative for women as opposed to looking in the round at well-being.  Reports should include the fact that more women do leave the workforce but we should address it in the way I referred to earlier, which is by stating it is okay if women want to stay at home.  We do not need to give a value to it but we should include other measures so that if it is the choice of women advice can be given and they can be supported.  They should still have a living wage even if they are doing more caring.  We have to recognise that perhaps it is not such a bad thing that our culture has women staying at home.  It is not a negative and is something we need our policy instruments to recognise and then address through how these women are supported in this caring role.  The citizens' assembly has found that caring is not a negative but a positive.  It is often framed as a negative with regard to employment and that women have to do the caring.  They want to do the caring and they are looking to the State to support them in this care.</p></speech>

It is extremely important.  One of the issues we did not mention was supports for re-entering the workforce.  People do take a break for caring and there should be systems in place so they can re-enter.  We have been having a debate for 20 years about training supports not being geared towards re-entrance to the labour market.</p></speech>

My point is that too often it is separated into another report.  It needs to be reframed when we are speaking about employment.  It does not mean that fewer women being employed is a bad thing.  It just means we have to recognise where things are and support them in a different way.  This is my point.  The point on re-entry is valuable and we have not discussed it.</p></speech>

Seeing a more gender-balanced D&aacute;il and representative body as a whole comes down to the will of party leaders, and I make this a plural in every sense.  One could say that perhaps for open seats, such as where a party is contesting a seat where the incumbent has retired, preference should be given to women candidates in these circumstances.  Over a cycle of two or three elections this could change the face of the representative body.</p> <p>  A measure I would like to tease out a little further is putting measures in place that would determine an outcome and state our Parliament must be 50:50 male and female.  Of course we want this to happen but we would need to think through and consider very carefully putting in place a measure that states it has to be 50:50.</p><p>There might be more room to do it in the Seanad because of the different lists and because of the opportunity to give preference to female candidates over male candidates on a panel if that panel is not coming out equally representative.  It needs more teasing out rather than rushing into it.  If the route of encouragement and exhortation is not working, then we have to look at what else can be brought into play.</p></speech>

If the culture is not there, we have to make sure we legislate.  My colleague has a Bill around the right to collective bargaining.  Women are less inclined to ask for a pay rise and employers do not generally tap you on the shoulder to offer one.  That is important.</p> <p>  The national minimum wage was only introduced in Ireland in 2000.    There were warnings that it would result in many job losses and it did not, as Dr. Redmond said.  It protected employers selling a service or product from being undercut by other employers giving bad wages.  That shows how the State can provide that basis.  The State has to move in and put things in place, such as school buses and childcare, to make it easier for women to remain in the workplace.  Women have told me they might have to give up work because their child has not got a place on the school bus and they have to be in work for 8.30, and all this kind of stuff.  </p> <p>  I am glad I am not the only one in the room saying equalising downwards around high pay is not necessarily a bad thing.  I am not a feminist because I am a woman, but because I am an egalitarian republican.  There is no need for some men to be earning as much money as these high-end executives earn.   Where that pay has come down, is it because they have a better quality of life now and are not working huge long hours?  Has there been a change in the last couple of years around that?  When you improve things for women, you improve things for everyone.  There might be something there.  </p></speech>

I think we are middle of the table.  There has been a decline in union membership but other indices look at the amount of power unions have in wage bargaining and there seems to be less change in that in Ireland.  People may not be in a union but are still covered by collective bargaining, so those partnership agreements we had gave wider coverage.</p> <p>  The other complication is that the level of unionisation is much higher in the public sector.  There is much less inequality between men and women in terms of pay, promotion and things like that.  That is partly to do with the fact those workplaces are unionised.  That has played a role.</p></speech>

Is there any more qualitative data about the nature of the male wages being reduced?  I think the witnesses said it was to do with the broader economic context and there was no direct causative link with the gender pay gap legislation.</p></speech>

There could be a movement once this information becomes available and people who see it say they do not want to work for company X because it has a massive pay gap.  That is another layer to it.  People can then make choices.  Companies are very conscious of such reputational issues so that is an important lever.</p></speech>

Is there supplementary information?  Dr. Russell mentioned that collective bargaining systems are a feature of most societies where wage inequality is low.  It would be useful to get more data on that.</p> <p>  I ask about recommendations, bearing in mind we have to follow through, around how to embed the right to collective bargaining. </p> <p>  Employment orders and JLCs have had lots of legal battles.  JLCs were a good step forward that was challenged.  How do we support or embed those, potentially?  How have other countries embedded them as solid tools that can be used?</p><p>This is not about the individual asking for a wage rise in many cases but about the collective voice on this issue.  It is about income inequality coming into this as an issue again.</p><p> To elaborate on my earlier comment that Ireland has some of the highest income equality in the world, we are 32nd of 34 countries based on the 2018 OECD figures, before taxes and transfers are considered.  What is happening therefore is that Ireland is doing a great deal of work through our tax and transfer systems to address what is high income inequality.  In this section, the question is whether enough is being done to tackle this income inequality.  If families are having to rely on family income supplement, FIS, to be able to live on a minimum wage, the State is effectively providing an indirect subsidy to the employer.  We are also subsiding companies that are very capable of addressing that.  </p><p> Therefore, in respect of this analysis, and diving down into the information, this is what I mean by moving past a kind of anecdotal or example version of this topic and, instead, looking at the detail to try to determine, for example, if fewer hours were involved but the workers were coming out with the same wages.  That could perhaps be a positive thing.  If there are issues or concerns, it could be a case of seeing what steps could be taken to ensure we do not have a blanket suppression of the minimum wage to deal with a handful of situations when we have mechanisms, such as ability to pay, which could be addressed in this regard.  This is what I mean when I refer to the need to have detailed scrutiny.  There was a flaw when the minimum wage legislation was initially enacted.  It is why we are still talking about this issue.  I was with the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, at the time and I remember that we pushed hard for the word "adequacy" to be included in the terms of reference, but it was not.  This is why we must now address adequacy and the reason the gap continues to have to be addressed through social transfers.  </p><p> I ask for more of a breakdown and analysis in this area because we need a greater depth and richness of analysis of the minimum wage.  Within that context, there is also the income inequality, referred to by Deputy Cronin, regarding wages at the top and at the bottom.  Alongside that - because it addresses the same structural issues - do the witnesses have breakdowns of the proportion of company profits and incomes being spent on wages versus, for example, returns to shareholders and how that proportion has shifted?</p><p> This is relevant in respect of Deputy Bacik's - Senator Bacik as she was then - excellent legislation concerning company pay transparency.  What I thought was really good about that, if I am correct, is that it addressed the other parts of the remuneration packages, including whether it is men who are predominantly getting share packages and dividends.  The witnesses might comment on what research exists on who gets shares because this information is not always captured on the wage packets, and on the level of shareholder returns versus wages and if this ratio has shifted.  We must find ways to address that if it has changed.</p><p> I also ask the witnesses to comment on pension inequality and the question I already referred to of the knock-on impact of this element of the system, especially for the two categories of those in part-time or low-paid work.  Then there is the question of the disproportionate level, as highlighted by the witnesses, of our spending on pensions that goes to pay for the marginal rate tax relief for those on the very highest incomes.  Research by the witnesses has shown that the beneficiaries in this regard are disproportionately likely to be men.  I ask the witnesses to comment on all those points.</p></speech>

It is obviously a big issue and mirrors those inequalities across people's careers because they will not be accumulating that wealth in later life either.  The Senator is right about the subsidies as well.  The analysis in that regard shows that the tax reliefs are regressive and the level of spending on them has been extensive.  That has come down a good deal but it is not my area of expertise.  Perhaps one of my other colleagues would like to come in on this point.</p></speech>

To answer a specific question, the Senator asked how reductions in working hours relate to the minimum wage and if workers are coming out with the same wages.  We looked at this subject recently.  We examined three minimum wage increases from 2016 to 2018 and we found that industry and hospitality and accommodation were the two main sectors where workers had experienced a reduction in hours.  We then asked that question of whether the increase in the minimum wage was enough to offset, or more than offset, the reduction in hours.  The short answer is that it was enough.  Even when we looked at this in real terms, it was enough for those working in industry, while accommodation and food workers broke even.  Therefore, the minimum wage increases were large enough to offset the reductions in hours.</p></speech>

Partly because those types of payment are not transparent, people do not know what the person next to them is getting.  This makes the situation even more open to this type of discrepancy.  The evidence I looked at is old, so we will have a dig around to see if there is some more recent material.</p></speech>

There is again a literature on this area and how the labour share has changed.  I will check that with some of my colleagues.</p></speech>

We are examining how best to recommend the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly and I am conscious that Dr. Russell, particularly in her role on the expert advisory group, has already engaged in this respect.  Significant work went into the production of these recommendations.  We are looking at their practical implementation rather than their merit or otherwise.  We think they are really positive recommendations and a blueprint for gender equality, as I said, and we are exploring how to implement them.</p> <p>  I will draw our meeting to a conclusion on that positive note.  I express sincere appreciation and thanks to all our witnesses for engaging with us today in such a constructive and thoughtful manner on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  I refer to recommendations 32 to 36 on pay and workplace conditions and 20 to 25 on leadership and politics, public life and the workplace.  I thank those engaging with us online as well, because many members of the Citizens' Assembly do that and we are delighted to have their engagement as we proceed to our final set of hearings and the production of our report on 1 December 2022.  Their expertise, submissions, contributions and exchanges with members will be helpful to us as we draw up our final report.  We thank them all again.</p></speech>
