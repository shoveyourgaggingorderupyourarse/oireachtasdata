    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#J00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to appear.  I am head of public policy for Facebook Ireland and I am joined by Ms Claire Rush, our lead counsel on content and regulatory matters.  We are based at Facebook's international headquarters in Dublin.</p> <p>  We recognise the real concerns of citizens and Oireachtas Members regarding the fast-moving and evolving nature of harmful content on the Internet, including on our platform.  We take our role in keeping harmful content off our services very seriously.  We recognise that if society were designing the Internet as it exists today from scratch, it would not ask companies to make the judgments that Facebook must make in regard to harmful content alone.   We, therefore, welcome the fact that governments and policy makers around the world are taking an active role in addressing harmful online content.  It is with their help, including that of the committee, that the rules which govern the Internet can be updated in a way that allows people the freedom to express themselves and allows entrepreneurs to build things, while also protecting society from broader harms.</p> <p>  Our community standards are the rules which govern what is allowed on our platform.  We draft and update these rules in consultation with a wide range of experts, including NGOs and academics from around the world, including Ireland.  They cover a wide range of content issues including hate speech, bullying, harassment, graphic violence and nudity.  In many cases, our community standards go further than national laws, such as, for example, in the area of non-consensual intimate images, NCII.  We have zero tolerance for the sharing of NCII on our platforms.  Once we are made aware of these images, we remove them and use media-matching technology to prevent further sharing or re-uploading of the images.  However, decisions about content can be complex and we do not always get it right.  That is why we are establishing an external oversight board which will adjudicate at a global level on decisions we make on content.  The decision of the oversight board will be binding on the company.</p> <p>  We submitted a detailed response to the consultation convened by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, earlier this year.  In the interest of informing this discussion, I will summarise two of its points.  We outlined how, in our view, an effective and efficient system of oversight by a regulator might operate.  On the subject of notice and take-down, we recognised there can be a role for a regulator to review certain incidents where content is first reported to a service provider but not removed.  We look forward to the publication of the related Bill and to engaging in future consultation opportunities.</p> <p>  Every piece of content on Facebook, including photos, text posts, comments, profiles and pages can be reported to us for violating our content policies.  In each case, one can report the content by clicking on the link in the top right hand corner or, in the case of a comment, by  pressing one's thumb on the comment for a few seconds if using a mobile phone.</p><p>If the content is found to be against our community standards, it is removed.  We are also investing heavily in artificial intelligence, AI, so that we can more rapidly detect harmful and illegal content on our platforms, and it has been very successful in certain areas.  However there are types of content which are more challenging for Al, such as bullying and harassment where context can be important.  This is why we depend on reports from our community of users.<br/><br/>Our most recent community standards enforcement report, in which we publish quarterly breakdowns of the content that we have removed, demonstrates the efforts we are making to tackle a range of illegal and legal but harmful forms of content.  For example, in the first quarter of this year we removed 5.4 million pieces of child sexual abuse material globally, 99.2% of which we removed before it was reported to us.  The report also demonstrates the improvements we are making in developing Al tools to deal with challenging areas of harmful content such as hate speech, where our proactive detection rates have increased from 38% in the first quarter of 2018 to 65.4% a year later.<br/><br/>Our community standards recognise that bullying and harassment take place in many different places and can have many different forms.  We do not tolerate this type of behaviour as it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook.  In addition to removing content, we give users tools to help them protect themselves against bullying, such as blocking other users and controlling who sees your posts, and we operate a bullying prevention hub which gives young people, parents and teachers the tools and resources to address the complex issues which bullying presents.<br/><br/>In Ireland, we work with experts to inform our safety policies and deliver online safety programmes.  In the past 12 months we have invested &euro;1 million in a partnership with the national anti-bullying research and resource centre in DCU and <i>SpunOut.ie</i>.  The main goal of this partnership is to help raise awareness of online safety and tackle the issue of online bullying among young people by offering online safety and anti-bullying training to every secondary school in Ireland.  The programme is under way with more than 100 teachers from schools across Ireland attending the first set of training sessions in September.  In addition, the research carried out through the school's training programme will inform <i>SpunOut.ie</i>'s online safety resources for teenagers.<br/><br/>I hope that this gives committee members a brief overview of the steps we are taking to address harmful content on our platform.  We have put these measures and more in place because we want users to feel safe and secure when they are using our services.  Claire and I look forward to your questions and we would be happy to follow up in writing on any point which is of interest to the committee members.</p></speech>

My name is Karen White and I am director of public policy for Twitter in Europe.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ronan Costello, public policy manager for Twitter in Europe.</p> <p>  Twitter is an open, public service.  Our singular mission is to serve the public conversation.  We serve our global audience by focusing on the needs of the people who use our service, and we put them first in every step we take.  Twitter is committed to improving the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation on our platform.  Our success is built and measured by how we help encourage more healthy debate, conversations and critical thinking.  Conversely, abuse, malicious automation and manipulation detract from our purpose.  We provide people on Twitter with a range of tools so that they can control and manage the type of content and accounts they see, ranging from being able to keep an account private to blocking, muting or reporting other individuals on the service.  We also give people control over what they see in search results, through safe search mode, which is enabled by default.  This excludes potentially sensitive content from the search results such as spam, adult content and the accounts an individual has muted or blocked.  We strive to provide an environment where people can feel free to express themselves and we recognise that if people experience abuse on Twitter it can jeopardise their ability to do this.</p> <p>  An individual using the service is not permitted to promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people in a range of protected categories.  A person may not engage in abusive behaviour, which is an attempt to harass, intimidate or silence someone else's voice.  We do not allow individuals to use hateful images or symbols in their profile image or header and individuals using the platform are not allowed to use their username, display name or profile bio to engage in abusive behaviour such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group or other protected category.  Under this policy we take action against behaviour that targets individuals or an entire protected category with hateful conduct.</p><p>With regard to self-harm and suicide, after Twitter receives a report of such behaviour, it will contact the reported user and let him or her know that someone who cares about him or her identified that he or she might be at risk.  We will provide the reported user with available online and offline resources and encourage him or her to seek help.  In response to certain keyword searches relating to these issues, using Twitter's search function, we direct individuals to online prevention resources.  This service is available in Ireland, where we have partnered with the Samaritans, to whose website and support services we direct individuals.</p><p> Twitter does not allow individuals on the service to post or share intimate photos or videos of someone which were produced or distributed without their consent.  Such material is sometimes referred to as "revenge porn".  This content poses serious safety and security risks.  We inform our users that sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the Twitter rules.  </p><p> People who do not feel safe on Twitter should not be burdened to report abuse to us.  Earlier this year we made it a priority to take a proactive approach to abuse.  Today, through the use of technology, 38% of abusive content that is enforced is surfaced proactively for human review.  We have made meaningful progress towards creating a healthier service.  Since we announced our focus on improving the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, we have seen a 16% year-on-year decrease in reports from people about other users allegedly abusing them on Twitter.  We have seen a 45% increase in the number of account suspensions for those who attempt to create new accounts following the suspension of their original accounts.  Over the first quarter of 2019, this amounted to more than 100,000 account suspensions for these reoffenders.  We are suspending three times more abusive accounts within 24 hours of a report and are taking two and a half times more private information down, with a new, easier reporting process.  </p><p> We have always provided an appeals mechanism for individuals who have had enforcement action taken against their accounts but earlier this year we launched a new feature that allows people to appeal within the Twitter app itself.  This change has meant that we have been able to respond to people 60% more quickly than we had previously.</p><p> We have well-established relationships with law enforcement agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have continuous global coverage to address reports from law enforcement around the world and have a dedicated online portal to swiftly handle requests from law enforcement.  We provide regular training on our policies and procedures and have publicly available guidelines for law enforcement on our website.  </p><p> The committee has asked for our recommendations on the proposed legislative changes.  It is important that legislation is as consistent as possible with existing legal frameworks to avoid uncertainties and discrepancies.  The effectiveness of any legislative solution relies on it being proportionate, technically feasible, and flexible, particularly given the diversity of companies within the digital ecosystem.  In this context, the committee will need to consider and assess how different legal and illegal harms manifest themselves across different platforms and varied jurisdictions.</p><p> We all share the objective of protecting our systems of due process and our commitment to freedom of expression.  Preserving these tenets in regulatory proposals can be achieved by collectively ensuring there is clarity on the obligations of all stakeholders, thereby avoiding an outcome whereby companies could overreach or erroneously remove content that should otherwise be kept online.  A clearly defined scope in that regard will assist Twitter and, I imagine, others.</p><p> In order to ensure people can continue to express themselves freely and safely on Twitter, we must continue investing further in our proactive technology and safety tools, as well as developing policies which keep pace with the changing contours of the public conversation we see on our service.  We stand ready to work with this committee as we continue to explore options to ensure that all people are protected from online harassment and harmful communications.  I thank members for their time.  We look forward to taking their questions.</p></speech>

I work with Google in Ireland as government affairs and public policy manager and am based in our EU headquarters here in Dublin.  Google supports all efforts by legislators and governments to engage with stakeholders in considering appropriate protections, remedies, and forms of redress for individuals who are the victims of online harm.  A range of governments, technology platforms and civil society groups are currently focused on how best to deal with illegal and problematic online content.</p><p>There is broad agreement on letting people create, communicate and find information online while preventing people from misusing content-sharing platforms like social networks and video sharing sites.  We recognise that there can be a troubling side of open platforms and that bad actors have exploited this openness.  We take the safety of our users very seriously, and we are committed to ensuring that inappropriate content that appears on our platforms is dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p> Now 21 years old, Google has grown from a small start-up to a global company with legal obligations in each of the countries in which it operates.  We work hard to protect our platforms from abuse and have been working on this challenge for years, using both computer-science tools and human reviewers to identify and stop a range of online abuse, from get-rich-quick schemes to disinformation, to the utterly abhorrent, including child sexual abuse material online.  We respond promptly to valid notices of specific illegal content, and we prohibit other types of content on various different services.  A mix of people and technology helps us to identify inappropriate content and enforce our policies, and we continue to develop and invest in smart technology to detect problematic content hosted on our platforms.</p><p> As well as making significant investment in technology and human resources, we have engaged with policymakers in Ireland and around the world on the question of the appropriate oversight for online content-sharing platforms.  Google is supportive of carefully crafted and appropriately tailored regulation that continues to address the challenges of problematic content online.  We are keen to work constructively with legislators to build on the existing legal framework and to build trust and confidence in the systems and procedures that ensure online safety.</p><p> Having considered the committee's issues paper, our comments today are directed towards those aspects that concern the role of Internet service providers in preventing online harassment and certain harmful communications.  We have submitted a longer written statement which outlines all of these points in greater detail.  In this statement, we have also provide some comments on the approaches taken on this issue in other jurisdictions where Google operates and which were mentioned in the committee's issue paper.</p><p> In the statement, we suggest a number of central principles that should be considered for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms and problematic content online.  These include clarity, suitability, transparency, flexibility, overall quality and co-operation.  I have set them out in more detail in the longer statement and can refer to them later if the committee wishes.</p><p> In framing any measures in this area, it is important for legislators to have regard to and build on the existing legal framework.  We operate in an environment where extensive regulation of online content and actions already exists and is being enforced.  Many laws, covering everything from consumer protection to defamation to privacy, already govern online content.  From consumer rights legislation to the new EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive, online behaviours come under the scope of a diverse and evolving set of legislation, multi-stakeholder initiatives and regulators.</p><p> Specifically relating to regulation of Internet service providers as a means of combating online abuse, the distinctive role played by Internet service providers is reflected in the EU legislation that underpins the regulation of electronic commerce in Europe.  The eCommerce directive provides strong incentives for service providers to establish and operate efficient notice and take-down procedures.  A service provider that does not operate such procedures will be exposed to potential legal liability for unlawful content hosted on its platform.  Many service providers, including Google, have developed extensive infrastructures which provide efficient tools for the reporting and removal of illegal content.</p><p> The eCommerce directive has the advantage of setting out different requirements for different types of Internet intermediaries, rather than being aimed at a particular business activity.  It has led to the growth of a wide variety of services and business models, and is flexible enough to cover the multiplicity of activities and content types online.  For example, an online news site can contain content authored by the news organisation, along with material licensed from third parties and also user-generated comments - the news site will be directly responsible for the editorial content it publishes but will have different legal responsibilities with respect to user comments that the website is hosting as an intermediary.  This online intermediary liability regime has fostered the huge economic and cultural benefits of the Internet while ensuring platforms are taking appropriate and speedy actions in removing unlawful content online.</p><p> In addition to legal regulations, Google has over the years developed extensive community guidelines and content policies that offer clear rules on what it does not allow on its platforms.  These often go above and beyond the law and we employ thousands of staff around the world, working 24 hours a day, to ensure violations are acted upon.  Companies have also worked together to address these challenges, for example, with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a coalition sharing information on curbing online terrorism.</p><p> We continue to improve on our processes and our technology to enforce these rules.  We continually review and update our policies based on new trends and invest in new machine learning, ML, technology to scale the efforts of our human moderators.</p><p> ML is helping us detect potentially violative content and surface it for human review.  For example, YouTube removed 9 million videos during the second quarter of 2019, 7.9 million of which were first flagged through our automated flagging system.</p><p>For example, YouTube removed 9 million videos during the second quarter of 2019, 7.9 million of which were first flagged through our automated flagging system.  Of those videos, 81.5% had no views at the time they were taken down.</p><p> We thank the committee for providing us with an opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications and related offences.  Addressing problematic content is a shared responsibility across society, in which companies, Governments, civil society, and users all have a role to play, and it is appropriate that this committee is hearing from a variety of voices on this topic.  We hope the committee will give our suggestions for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms due consideration and look forward to further discussion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ana Niculescu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#N00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  ISPAI is a not-for-profit organisation and the legal entity delivering the <i>hotline.ie</i>service, which is the national reporting mechanism where the public can anonymously, securely and confidentially report suspected illegal content online.  <i>hotline.ie'</i>s remit is distinct and limited to combating online material which is simultaneously harmful and illegal, namely child pornography, also known as child sexual abuse material, CSAM.  The<i>hotline.ie</i>service has been effective in having CSAM swiftly removed from the Internet because it operates within a clearly defined legislative framework where the harm is clearly illegal.  Additionally, it is a transnational crime which allows for decisive international action when CSAM is hosted outside Ireland.  There is no burden of proof in respect of consent as engaging a child in sexual activities is prohibited under all circumstances and any presumed consent would be null and void.  When talking about CSAM, it is important to note that we are talking about materials showing the extreme abuse of children, the majority of them infants to 12 year olds.  For example, 84% of the material classified as child pornography from January 2017 to June 2019 showed children estimated to be four to 12, with 7% aged three and younger.<br/><br/><i>hotline.ie</i>has been working in an environment predominantly governed under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, amended by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  It is clear national legislation that comprehensively defines what would constitute child pornography and corresponding offences.<br/><br/>The broader context commonly referred to as industry self-regulation consists of, as a non-exhaustive list, the EU directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which provides for an international framework.  The e-commerce directive is also transposed into Irish law and sets out the requirements and exemptions for intermediaries' liability for illegal content.  There is a national co-ordinated multi-stakeholder approach, where <i>hotline.ie</i>operations and procedures are agreed and overseen by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Since inception, we have been working in conjunction with national law enforcement and in co-operation with Internet companies operating in Ireland for the removal of CSAM from the Internet.  Our <i>hotline.ie</i>analysts are internationally trained by INHOPE and Interpol in content and age assessment.  There are national reporting mechanisms such as <i>hotline.ie</i>in more than 40 countries worldwide, coming together as the International Network of Internet Hotlines, INHOPE, allowing for international co-operation and co-ordination.  When child pornography is hosted in Ireland, we will issue a notice for takedown to the Internet service or content provider and will notify the paedophile investigation unit of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  In most cases, the notified material is removed from the Internet within 24 hours.  When CSAM is hosted outside Ireland, <i>hotline.ie</i>will still notify the paedophile investigation unit and thereafter the INHOPE member hotline in the relevant jurisdiction, so that CSAM may be swiftly removed at source.<br/><br/>INHOPE figures show that 64% of CSAM reported across different international jurisdictions in 2018 was removed within 72 hours.  As previously outlined, in Ireland, it is removed within 24 hours.  However, slower international removal times may be due to CSAM hosted in countries without a hotline presence, a lack of designated points of contact and streamlined notice for takedown process with Internet companies, or countries with inadequate or deficient legislation.</p><p>The self-regulatory model is effective in the circumstances in which<i>hotline.ie</i>operates and may be useful to look at as a reference point for other types of content but it would warrant further scoping.<br/><br/>For those who may not be aware, the <i>hotline.ie</i>service will be 50% co-funded by the European Union through the Connecting Europe Facility's safer Internet programme until June 2021.  The other 50% is co-funded by ISPAI member Internet companies, comprising Internet service providers, hosting providers, search engines and mobile and telecommunications operators.  <i>Hotline.ie</i>was established as one of the key recommendation of the Government's working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet in 1998.  It provides a free, secure and anonymous online reporting mechanism, content assessment expertise to ensure reported material is subject to objective evaluation in accordance with rigorous standards by reference to Irish law, a triage function through assessing public reports and notifying only content that is most likely illegal under Irish law, thereby reducing the burden that would otherwise be placed on law enforcement by, for example, assessing complaints that may not prove to reside in Ireland and operating the notice and takedown service, which is recognised worldwide as a vital and efficient tool in the removal of child sexual abuse material at source and which, in turn, reduces its availability on the Internet, disrupts the cycle of sexual exploitation and prevents further victimisation of children.  In my written statement I have provided statistics that are worth looking at.<br/><br/>I stress that we welcome the committee's engagement with a variety of experts and stakeholders and we are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to these discussions.  We are also supportive of the Government's attempts to address the spectrum of harms and that different harms may require different legislative and regulatory responses, with due account of the fact that the Internet is an ever-evolving, technically challenging and complex environment.  Superimposed on that is a continuum between offline and online behaviour that contributes to the complexity of developing effective responses and remedies.  I am happy to provide further information in writing as required.  I thank committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

So the witnesses are aware of the function of the committee, we are all Members of the Oireachtas considering whether there needs to be greater regulation.  When we talk about regulation what we mean is the extent to which social media companies should be liable under law for harmful information they store and which they and others publish.  Do the witnesses accept that regulation in Ireland should increase beyond what is provided for in the e-commerce directive?  I will begin with Mr. &Oacute; Broin on behalf of Facebook.</p></speech>

As outlined, including in Mr. Meade's statement, the e-commerce directive already provides for a liability regime for the removal of unlawful content.  What we are here to discuss is a broader level of harm, some of which may be illegal and some which may be lawful or permissible under the terms of the law.  We are here to engage on how these can be appropriately defined, how an appropriate notice and takedown regime can be defined and how there could be a role for a regulator in developing standards or guidelines to which Internet service providers or online intermediaries should have to adhere.  Naturally as part of this there would need to be a reasonable sanctions approach.  We appreciate this and we understand it entirely.  The nitty-gritty detail would be a matter for the Legislature.<br/><br/>Our position is that there would be a phased proportionate approach that would look at systematic adherence to the standards or guidelines a regulator might lay out as opposed to focusing on individual instances of content <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

We have certainly appreciated the collaborative approach of the committee, other committees and various Departments on this issue.  I joined Twitter more than five years ago and remember one of the first consultations I undertook was with the Law Reform Commission.  There has been a very collaborative approach.  As our CEO has outlined, and as we have said on the record many times, we view regulation as a net positive.  It can have very good outcomes.  In this sense, we certainly view our role as educators and we work with Governments on trying to educate on the technologies available and how our services operate.  Ultimately, it is for law makers to decide the breadth of that-----</p></speech>

A number of the self-regulatory measures already in existence, including the EU code of conduct on illegal hate speech of which Twitter was a founding member, the code of conduct on disinformation and others, are certainly bearing fruit.  There are a lot of models in existence, particularly in Europe, that can be leveraged.  When moving to a place of reviewing any existing legislation or introducing new legislative measures we must ensure we are not fragmenting the legislative frameworks in place in Europe.</p></speech>

In this sense we are in favour of regulation and looking at what is in the existing legal framework and what scope there is for improving it where new regulations are introduced.  In the document we submitted we make suggestions on principles that could apply to this additional oversight.  Specifically, I referred to the e-commerce directive to emphasise that it provides an opportunity for legislators to oversee notice and takedown procedures.  In a sense, this is what is happening not just in Ireland but elsewhere.  People are looking at how we can use the regulation.</p> <p>  With regard to the principles I mentioned, a number of people referred to clarity.  Platforms as much as users would benefit from clarity on what the definitions are, what is actually expected of platforms and how we can operate them.</p> <p>  Another key point is suitability and that the form of regulation that applies is suitable to the specific service.  We are sitting here together today but we all have quite different products and services that operate in different ways and present different issues and challenges.  We suggest legislators should definitely take this into account.</p></speech>

Its businesses operate in various countries irrespective of boundaries.  This can create difficulties for the company when it comes to the application of laws.  Is it in agreement with the president-elect of the European Commission, who has indicated she wants to introduce a digital services Bill that would apply throughout the European Union and would have an impact in this regard?</p></speech>

As other witnesses have said, that regime has been in place for approximately 20 years.  Society and technology have moved on and it seems quite appropriate that legislators continue to look at it.  We do not have an issue with legislators doing this.  As I said in my opening statement, we should be cognisant of the benefits the intermediary liability regime has provided for the flourishing of online services.</p><p>I will ask Ms Niculescu the question that I asked the others, although she is in a slightly different position.  Should there be increased regulation beyond what exists?</p></speech>

We could use examples from other jurisdictions, such as the German Network Enforcement Act, which provides for a tiered system.  It is important to look at the model in New Zealand where there is user education and empowerment, with a culture of reporting.  Self-regulation is tier two.  There is also oversight from a statutory body.</p></speech>

It is a very vague term.  As I said last week, people should be allowed to be critical of politicians.  That could be categorised as harmful and is not what we are talking about here.  An example which we will all agree is harmful, illegal and should not be facilitated is child pornography, an issue raised by Ms Niculescu.  I am sorry to be blunt about this but do the witnesses agree that their businesses have increased the incidence of child pornography significantly throughout the world?</p></speech>

I am probably not qualified to give an answer on whether any company has-----</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Broin gave a figure in his opening statement, that in the first three months of this year, Facebook removed 5.4 million items of child sexual abuse.

We collaborate with law enforcement around the world and report every incident to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, in the USA.  We have made our AI and machine learning technology available to others so that they can use the technology that Google has developed to identify and remove any such material on other platforms.</p></speech>

We have a zero tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation, CSE, material.  If we find it, accounts are suspended immediately and the content is reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  We work with a range of organisations from the Internet Watch Foundation to INHOPE, which runs 46 hotlines across 40 different countries.  We work closely with law enforcement on these matters.  The chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation stated in a previous report that 1% of the content the foundation had removed for violating CSE policies was found on social media services in 2017.  It is a very low percentage in that respect but is nonetheless a grave issue.  In our most recent reporting period, for which we provided figures of our enforcement actions in the Twitter transparency report which is published biannually, we took action on 29,824 pieces of content for violating our CSE policies.  We are certainly open to further collaboration in this area but we take the issue of child safety on our service very seriously.</p></speech>

We had a witness here last week, Mr. Joe McCarthy from UCD.  He suggested that before a person is able to open an account with Facebook, Google or Twitter, he or she would have to provide details about his or her identity.</p><p>If such a rule were in place, would that not have a significant deterrent effect on people putting child pornography on the Internet, because they could be identified?</p></speech>

If somebody makes a comment about a politician and the politician feels that the account is not a real person, he or she can flag that to us and we can then put that account into a cross-check where the account has to be authorised.  The account holder then has to provide proof of identity to us.  While I understand the conversation about verification of accounts and the reasons for it, it raises a wider question about the operation of the Internet.  We would essentially be required to verify all users globally before they could use our systems.  There are a number of considerations, including whether the system of identification is available in each country.  Are people ruled out from using our services because they do not have access to an ID?  In Ireland, for example, there is a cost to obtain ID.  That is not to say that we do not take the issue of child sexual abuse extremely seriously.  We take proactive steps.  As others have said, we have zero tolerance for this type of behaviour.  There are genuine concerns about how proof of identity would operate and whether us holding all of that information about more than 2.7 billion people globally would respect the data minimisation principles within the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  That is not to say that we are not looking at this as something that we have to do better.  We are looking at artificial intelligence to determine whether it can assist us in verifying accounts.  We talk about fake accounts and removing them.  In the first quarter of this year, we removed 2.2 billion fake accounts from our platform, 99% of them before they were reported to us.  We take the issues of authenticity and child sexual abuse extremely seriously.</p></speech>

If it were the case that there was criminal liability or penal sanction such as a fine for social media companies that happened to facilitate, unwittingly or otherwise, the publication of child sexual abuse material, would that not have a deterrent effect in reducing it and changing the companies' actions?</p></speech>

The Deputy is getting close to a monitoring obligation on all content on the platform.

While they may not be that visible or well-known to everybody who walks down the street who may not know that we have reporting, notice and takedown and that we remove content when we have notice of it, it is something that we have been doing for a long time.  We have always taken that seriously and are always responsive to these reports.  That system of notice and takedown and liability upon notice has allowed Internet companies to develop and flourish.  That is not to say that there is not room for new conversations about broader responsibilities for other types of harmful content, but we need to be careful about adjustments or alterations to the fundamental nature of the intermediary liability regime, as has been operating across Europe since the e-commerce directive in 2001.</p></speech>

First, to put my cards on the table and be very clear, I believe the principle under which the companies operate is wrong.  I do not accept this made-up term of "intermediary".  To me, the companies are publishers and should have the liabilities of publishers.  As an industry, it has pulled off an amazing trick over many decades, which has enriched the companies and their shareholders to a vast level, and the cost is too great.  I want to be absolutely clear and our witnesses can respond to it.  I am aware of the response about intermediaries and publishers and the difference the companies always seek to strike on this.</p> <p>  All of the companies' representatives have collectively outlined the takedown process.  Will each of them give me a figure that is spent globally by their company on that process?  Let us start with Google, which I understand, roughly, give or take the small change, is a &euro;100 billion plus revenue company.  Is that roughly correct, give or take?  Let us take the parent company, Alphabet.</p></speech>

Absolutely not.  I believe businesses should make a profit.  I am a business person.  I do not ever advocate the idea of wholescale censorship or that we should live in a restrictive world.  The Internet does good things.  My problem with Internet companies is that the harm cannot just be discarded.</p> <p>  Each of our witnesses made their way into work somehow this morning, whether it was by private car, bus or whatever.  None of them would one expect the company who made the motor car to make it to the minimum standard, to recall it if there is a problem with it, but not to do all the necessary things to keep our witnesses safe on their journey.  The problem with what the Internet companies do is that, if we are honest, they are really publishers who have more impact on the world today than probably all broadcast and print media combined together, which is a terrific compliment to the way the companies have been built up.  Yet, for the purposes of making profits, they want to have no obligations to what those impacts are, apart from saying that they will take material down when the damage has been done.</p> <p>  I go back to my central question to our witnesses again.  Do the companies believe that at any point that they should accept the principle of being a publisher of material?  I ask each of the witnesses to reply in whatever order they like.</p></speech>

It is open to legislators to decide to apply the same rules that publishers work under to the various online services.  This would need to be taken through to its conclusion.  What would it mean and what impact would that have on the operation of the open Internet?  We have developed our services on the basis that they are open and for everyone.  One of the great features of our services is that the same Gmail, drive or whatever service we offer is available anywhere in the world on the same basis.  That brings with it a huge volume of material.  On YouTube, for example, there are hundreds of hours of video material uploaded to our services every minute.  If we were to be considered publishers, each item would have to be reviewed before appearing on the platform.  It would be open to legislators to make that a requirement but it would fundamentally alter the availability of that service.  It is up to legislators to decide what the rules should be.  The point I would make, in common with the other members of the panel, is that legislators should also take account of what benefits the liability regime has provided.</p> <p>  Just because we do not consider it appropriate that the regulation should be the same for publishers as for the platforms, that does not mean the platforms cannot be regulated.  As I said in my opening statement, there are regulations that apply to platforms and it is obviously open to legislators to decide if they are appropriate, if they can be strengthened, changed and made more clear and whether we can get better outcomes for users.</p> <p>  I do not know if the Deputy and I will agree on the question of publishers versus platforms.  Perhaps we can agree, however, that just because we are not regulated in the same way as publishers and are not subject to exactly the same regime, that does not mean there is no ability for legislators to regulate.</p></speech>

By being deemed an intermediary, it escapes this consequence.  This is why, in my opinion, this is like the wild west of the 21st century.  There is a very interesting historical analogy.  In the United States at the start of the previous century, European copyright was not accepted.  This meant, in effect, that authors could not be paid.  The American Government and the publishers, some of which are now the biggest names in publishing in the entire world, did not accept European copyright.  The publishers made their money in that way.  When they got to a certain size, they of course turned around and said that they wanted copyright enforced and regulation.  It suits Internet companies to grow to a certain size and then look for a bit of regulation to prevent entry into the market.</p> <p>  There is one main stumbling block, if one takes an honest look at it.  This is the bit I can never quite get.  It reminds me of the chief executive of a cigarette company sitting before the US Senate and saying that smoking is not harmful.  The witnesses answered one of Deputy O'Callaghan's questions about whether their companies increased the proliferation of child pornography.  The honest answer to that is "Yes".  Whether the companies accept that they are individually responsible for that or that they should be legally responsible for it, the Internet did increase that proliferation.  There is no getting around that.  My point is that, by not being declared publishers, the companies avoid the liabilities with which almost everybody else has to deal.  I do not believe a decision in this regard should be made in Ireland alone.  It should be broader and decided at least at the level of the EU.  The traditional western countries need to operate together and to look at this issue.  There is a role for the Internet and for what the companies do, but there is also a role for regulation.</p> <p>  I will conclude with this because I am conscious of time.  There are two things that really changed my mind.  It is not so much about the area of pornography or anything like that.  There was one horrendous incident in Ireland involving Facebook, and I do not want to go into too much detail about it out of respect for the family involved, in which the public shared multiple images of an horrific incident.  There is no comeback for that family.  They cannot unsee it.  It does not matter that it was taken down in 24 hours, which in fairness it was.  People should not profit off that level of absolute horror being inflicted on someone.  The other issue, unfortunately, also involves Facebook.  Somebody went on a murder spree and, using the live-streaming facility Facebook developed to make further profits, live-streamed himself murdering people.  I cannot understand, from a moral perspective, how people are comfortable with defending themselves against liability for that.  That is my issue.  That is why I believe there should be a change.  Any of the witnesses are more than welcome to reply to me on those points, but that is where I will leave it for now.</p></speech>

We are subject to rules and regulations as it stands.  We are here today and, in all of our opening statements, we have said that we are open to further regulation.

We will play that role in working with legislators around the world to deal with this issue.</p> <p>  I know the Deputy does not want to go into detail on the particular case involving the car accident.

For example, one of the weaknesses in our systems was that the artificial intelligence, AI, system did not recognise a video being made because the shooter framed it in a first-person view, that is, he had a camera on him.</p><p>We are working with the Metropolitan Police in the UK and with the American armed forces.  We are inputting their weapons training footage into our AI, which will ensure that type of incident can never happen again.  This is a rapidly evolving area and we have rapidly evolving harms on the Internet.  We are committed to doing absolutely everything we can to make our platform safe.  I do not accept the premise that we profit from these types of incidents being on our platform.  It is the opposite.  We hear from both our advertisers and our users all the time that they do not want this type of material on our platform.  The advertisers do not want their advertising anywhere near this type of content.  We are extremely serious about removing it.  I will ask Ms Rush to come in on the legal points the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy and note and appreciate his concerns in this regard.  One of the points he made is that the heightened layer of responsibility arising from being a publisher would result in people queueing up at the door to take claims and so on.  As Mr. Meade mentioned earlier in respect of an obligation to preview, pre-screen or pre-moderate every single piece of content against all the laws in force anywhere in the world the content might be available or might be shared, regardless of the operational burden and cost, such an obligation would have a significant chilling effect.  Companies would be incentivised to take down anything that is remotely dubious or questionable from a legal perspective.  They would have to err on the side of removing everything, which could have a very detrimental effect on the availability of content.  It is just one perspective.  I absolutely appreciate all the other points the Deputy has raised, to which Mr. &Oacute; Broin has responded.  We are here because we accept and know that this is an opportunity to find a better way forward with regard to a future regulatory model which would learn from and build on other models and which would be conscious of EU developments and developments that have worked in other countries.  I hope that we can constructively engage in such a discussion with the committee.</p></speech>

In our case, these policies are our community guidelines for YouTube, our advertising policies and so on.  That is provided for under the existing legal framework.  It allows the companies to exercise a degree of moderation and to impose their own standards with regard to what they will or will not allow on their platforms.  From our point of view, that has served the purpose of allowing us to keep our users safe on our platforms and to provide them with a more positive experience.  The Deputy's point is that is a form of editorial control which would lead to us being defined as publishers.  What we do, and I believe all the platforms have similar systems of enforcing guidelines, is allowed for under the existing legal framework.  If it was not allowed for, we would be in a much worse situation in respect of platforms' ability to take proactive measures to keep users safe.</p></speech>

Tweets are the lifeblood of the platform.  Users' comfort in expressing themselves on the platform is dependent on them feeling safe and their feeling safe on the platform is dependent on them having confidence that Twitter will be responsive to issues they report to us and that we will be proactive, where necessary, in leveraging machine learning and so on to surface content for review proactively.  If people stop tweeting because they do not feel comfortable expressing themselves on the platform, the lifeblood of the platform is extinguished.  There is therefore no reason for people to be on it or for advertisers to use it.</p><p>The very model of the platform is dependent on them having the trust and confidence in us to invest in safety.</p></speech>

Many of them should be here on the politicians side of the table because I am hearing a lot of political speak, waffle and diversion from the questions, which is interesting.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  The stuff about publishers or facilitators is very interesting.  As far as I can see, it is a movEable feast from the witnesses' point of view.  Facebook was involved in a case with a company called Six4Three that came to court in 2018 where it said that it was a publisher, that it had to make decisions on what not to publish and that it should be protected because it is a publisher.  However, it is not a publisher when it comes to abusive posts and so on.  That is an interesting aside.  </p> <p>  All the witnesses said there were different aspects of the regulation, that sometimes they have to make one decision and another decision on other occasions.  It seems that the entire regulatory framework is unclear.  From our point of view, and the point of view of the public, we could do with that being clarified.  That would be important.</p> <p>  I ask all the witnesses, starting with Facebook, if they have the technology to track the sharing of illegal identical and equivalent posts?  If I post something that is illegal and it is shared widely, can that be tracked the whole way to the end of the process?</p></speech>

We have media matching technology.  I refer to a piece of content that is an image or a video.  If we get that piece of content or image, and this is the way we would deal with child sexual abuse material, images that promote terrorism or images of violence, we can put it into this system.  The term we use is that we bank the image.  That prevents the re-upload of the image across our services.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a previous case where we would have used this technology.  Once we became aware of the image, we banked it and made sure that image could not be re-uploaded.  If there is another image taken from a slightly different perspective, that will not be caught by that.  We would need to identify that image and start the process again of removing it and ensuring that it cannot be re-uploaded to the system.  </p> <p>  Across industry we talk about the database of hashes.  These are images which have been banked and a specific fingerprint or hash has been added to the image.  Across industry that ensures that images cannot be re-uploaded.  We use that in child exploitation.</p></speech>

One is that across industry there is a shared database of hashes so if Google or Twitter were to input, say, 100 images into that database, once that content is in the database, if someone tried to share that image on Facebook it would be caught and immediately removed.  The second way it would work is through the way Mr. &Oacute; Broin just described it.  If new images were uploaded, our classifiers in AI would look for certain thresholds or signals to see if that image would meet a certain threshold of violation.  If that ticks the box, so to speak, of being violating material, it would also be caught, hashed and banked.</p><p>There are two mechanisms, one of which is the shared process while the other is for new images we discover.</p></speech>

Our technology is very similar.  In the case of child sexual exploitation, we use photo DNA, creating digital fingerprints of the material, and any related material can be removed automatically and immediately from our systems.  In the case of terrorist related content, for example, when certain content is identified, as Ms Rush and Mr. &Oacute; Broin noted, it is hashed and given a taxonomy of the type of content before it is shared within our hash-sharing database.</p> <p>  We deploy other measures at Twitter when we identify rule-violating content, such as that which promotes terrorism, in our URL-sharing project.  If we identify URLs on our service that direct to another service, whether it be YouTube or others, we will share the URLs with the companies in question to let them know we have removed the content from our service because it violates our rules and promotes terrorism, and to suggest they might wish to review the content to which the links connect on the companies' own service.  It is a multi-pronged approach.</p></speech>

Like the other companies, we develop artificial intelligence, AI, classifiers that are able to identify content likely to be violative of our policies.  The classifiers are getting more efficient and better all the time, although one note of caution is that AI is better at identifying certain types of content.  Some types of content are readily identifiable by machines, whereas others will require a human review to detect.  Nevertheless, the technology is constantly developing.</p> <p>  On the timeframe, like in the case of the other companies, pieces of content may take different lengths of time to action.  Given there may be questions over context or issues that need to be escalated and further reviewed, timeframes can differ.  As I stated earlier, of the videos we removed from YouTube in the second quarter of this year, a total of 80% were removed before they gained one view.  That gives an idea of how quickly the majority of violative content is removed.</p></speech>

In all their submissions, our guests note the high percentage of material that is identified as violative and removed.  There is no mention, however, of how much content the companies monitor.  For example, while a total of 38% of abusive content on Twitter is removed, that could be 38% of ten, 10 million or 100 million posts.  To what total figure do the percentages relate?</p></speech>

In the latter six months of the 2018, we received more than 11 million reports.</p><p>What leveraging technology has allowed us to do in one instance is to dedupe reports.  For example, a few years ago, if we received 1,000 reports about the same piece of content, it would be a cumbersome process of review and we would review all 1,000 reports.  We have become much smarter with our technology and we will now review only the one tweet that has been reported 1,000 times.  Accordingly, we process reports much more quickly.  As I noted in my opening statement, we take three times the amount of action within 24 hours on reports we receive.</p><p> Nevertheless, our objective is to reduce the burden on people in order that they will not have to report such content to Twitter because we find it ourselves and take action.  We will never take any sort of action on certain types of content automatically or suspend accounts automatically.  It is about finding potentially rule-violating content and surfacing it for human review.  The results are very positive in that regard, given that we process reports and potentially rule-violating content much more quickly than we did previously.  Much of that is due to leveraging the technology we use.</p></speech>

There are a number of additional areas, such as terrorist related content, the figure for which stands at more than 250,000 enforcement actions taken against accounts in the latter six months of 2018.  There were approximately 30,000 for sensitive content and something similar for child sexual exploitation.  Significant action is taken against reported content.</p></speech>

It is in the scope of the AI to which Ms White referred.  AI is good in instances where the violation is clear cut and the line is not blurry, but it is not as good in areas such as bullying and harassment.  While our proactive rate on terrorism or child sexual abuse material is 99%, for bullying and harassment the rate of effective AI drops to 20% or 14% but we are committed to developing the technology.  As Ms White noted, we try to ensure that people will not have to view the content and that it is removed from the platform before anyone does.</p></speech>

I have been working in this area for many years.  The role of content reviewers has really changed because of the evolving lead-in and the technological advances we have been able to make.  Some eight or nine years ago all the content reviewed by content reviewers would come from human reports, that is, people clicking on a piece of content and indicating that they did not like it because they thought it was hate speech or violence.  That would be reviewed manually.  The volume of content has increased.  Some forms of harm are particularly egregious and abhorrent.  All types of harmful content hold their own in some ways, but it is easier to develop the technology for areas like terrorism and child sexual exploitation imagery, CSEI, because they are very visual and clearcut.  Context does not really come into it.  That is different from a piece of hate speech, for example.  It is much harder to train classifiers or machine learning to tell if a hateful slur is being used in a derogatory way or in a comedic, satirical or self-referential way.  That is why the rates of AI detection are lower for bullying and those types of content.</p> <p>  To return to the previous point, it is increasingly the case that content reviewers are not just reviewing reports from human users.  The AI is always trying to learn and become more precise.  Where it cannot take automatic action to remove content once it matches it, it will sometimes send content to humans for review as a double-check.  </p></speech>

I have a final question.  I will start with Facebook.  Does Facebook value the type of content it removes depending on the amount of followers the associated user has?  Is that a factor in the decision?  There was a Channel 4 documentary called "Inside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network" in 2018 which said that pages posted by an English Nazi were left in place because the user had a lot of followers.  As such, there was a lot of revenue to be generated.  Is that a factor in Facebook's decision on whether to review and remove posts?  Would different rules apply to my posts because I have a lot fewer followers?</p></speech>

One of the reasons they are so difficult to frame in the first place is that they have to be applied equally to all users.  It can be tricky to develop a policy that is enforceable in all cases so that one reviewer looking at a piece of content in light of the policy will make more or less the same decision as another.  We do a lot of work on testing our policies before we introduce them.  For example we updated our policy on hate speech earlier this year.  As others have said, these are areas where context is important.  Before we launched that policy we carried out extensive testing with reviewers in different parts of the world to ensure to the greatest degree possible that it was enforceable, in the sense that when a rule-violating piece of content was identified, a decision could be made on it that would not be arbitrary.  In other words, a similar decision would be made regardless of who the reviewer was or the identity of the user posting the content.</p></speech>

Whether it is someone who has 50,000 friends or 5,000 friends makes a big difference in how far the post goes.  Does someone with a large number of followers go through the process more slowly?</p></speech>

There is one wrinkle, which is that our policies sometimes allow for public figures.  The allowable speech about public figures can be different from what is allowed concerning a private citizen.  Extra nuance can be required when a reviewer is deciding whether content violates our policy, depending on who the speech is aimed at.</p></speech>

It is the other way around.  We do not tolerate hate speech under any circumstances, but the decision about whether it violates our policies may be slightly different if the speech is about a public figure.  If so, it may be considered to be legitimate political comment.  If the same thing was said about someone who is not a political figure it might be considered in violation of policy.</p></speech>

Those actions have changed over the years.  Previously, Twitter had a binary sort of a system whereby a user was in or out.  If a user broke the rules, his or her account was suspended.  That led to people trying to create new accounts or that behaviour being taken to other services and the offender trying to find new platforms.  We now have a range of enforcement actions that we can take and the changes that we have made have been partly based on feedback we have received from safety organisations, including the European Network against Racism and the European Commission, working as part of the EU code of conduct on illegal hate speech.  It was identified that not talking about content or individuals who are operating at the extremes was not the way to go.  Instead, we had an opportunity to try to educate people, to try to bring them back into compliance with our rules.</p> <p>  We now do a number of things.  We can lock an account.  We can tell a user that he or she has violated our rules and what specific rule has been violated.  We can ask a user to delete the content in question, or to verify an email, telephone number, or many other things.  Such a user's account would be locked for a period of time.  The objective of these enforcement actions is to try to educate people and bring them back into compliance.  We have found that 65% of people who are placed in a limited state of functionality are in that state only once.  That enforcement action is having a real world impact.</p></speech>

Not to reference any particular case, but when someone tweets something that the majority of Twitter users, be it in Ireland or in other countries, find distasteful or offensive, a number of tweets will reject the premise and content of that original tweet and thereby create a majority which outnumbers those who agreed with the original tweet.</p></speech>

This notion of counter-speech has been established for several years now.  As Ms White referenced earlier, we have been part of the EU code of conduct around illegal hate speech.  Indeed, in January this year, we held a workshop in the office which was participated in by the council, the Commission and a range of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, from across Europe.  The purpose of that was to create a counter-speech campaign that would be rolled out across Europe and would reject hate speech and encourage people to take an alternative view.  At the early part of that workshop, we had attendees who were a part of successful referendum campaigns in Ireland in the past few years.  They talked about how they had promoted a positive and inclusive narrative in Irish society by creating counter-narratives around conversations that could have taken an altogether negative turn.</p></speech>

The net response is to broaden the fudge, with respect, and that seems to be Twitter's public policy.  The response to many of these issues is that they are complicated, multinational and difficult.  Twitter maintains that it is a platform, not a publisher.  When the argument is brought down to the family who was affected on the platform, the response from Twitter was to delete the tweet and that was it.  Surely Twitter's enforcement mechanisms can be improved.  Would our guests agree that the e-commerce directive and current legislative framework does not go far enough to mandate companies to protect citizens who are subject to that content?</p></speech>

There are enforcement actions on one hand, which include removing content that is violative of Twitter rules, or illegal in a particular jurisdiction.  It is also a matter of challenging viewpoints, ideologies and prejudices online.  As Mr. Costello pointed out, counter-speech does have a valuable impact within that.  Counter-speech and organising EU-wide anti-hate speech campaigns, whether through the European Network against Racism or the Council of Europe's No Hate Speech campaign, are fundamental components of the commitment Twitter made to the EU code of conduct on illegal hate speech many years ago.</p> <p>  My point is that a multi-pronged approach is needed.</p><p>One measure is not going to stop racism and intolerance within society. </p></speech>

Was the counter-speech online and in the media worth it?  There has been a lot of solidarity in the media and among the public, but should they have had to go through that experience and rely on the kind of counter-speech Ms White refers to?  I would argue that Twitter should have stopped it before we had to have this conversation about counter-speech.  I accept that in other, broader debates counter-speech may be important, but not when a family is at the centre of the issue.  In the context of the issue this family faced, Ms White's approach of resorting to counter-speech misses the point.  They were in the middle of this.  They would be pretty concerned that Ms White is advocating counter-speech as a way to deflect from their experience.  As far as I am concerned, Twitter should not have allowed them to become the epicentre of this very difficult experience.</p></speech>

Counter-speech, as I said, is one measure in what should be a wider multi-pronged approach to what are wider societal problems in many cases.  We need to challenge the hateful discourse that we are seeing.  Counter-speech is one measure within that approach.  I was not laying everything at the feet of counter-speech, or implying that it has the potential to remedy all of the problems we see online.  It is simply one measure that can be taken.  As academic studies have shown and as the European Commission has attested to, we see positive results when those who engage in abusive behaviour such as racist activity online are challenged or called out.  There is some benefit to being able to have these conversations in the public domain and challenge these ideologies, intolerances and abuses.  This is just one measure that can be taken.</p></speech>

I would like to broaden the discussion.  Last week witnesses mentioned account verification as a key issue for all of the platforms represented here.  Of course freedom of expression is extremely important, but does anonymity on these platforms allow for a lot of the hateful issues we are talking about?  Have the witnesses' companies looked at moving their account structures to a verified model?  A lot of other platforms, such as membership clubs, have proper verification systems that are relatively simple and accurate.  I accept that some people will circumvent those, but the majority will not because the barriers would not be as soft as the current ones.  The view of law enforcement and the NGOs that testified here was that account verification could play a huge role in creating a better online space.  Do the witnesses agree with that?  I know they do not agree with the publisher concept, which I have issues with.  These are currently community platforms.  How would the witnesses feel about a legal obligation to verify all accounts and a responsibility to provide information relating to them?  I will ask each witness to respond.</p></speech>

Facebook has a real-name policy, although that is not the same as authenticating every person on the platform.  We require people to use the name by which they are known in real life.  If an account is suspected to be false, we will act on that and ensure either that the person verifies it or, if he or she is not who he or she claims, that it will be removed.  We also take strong measures against fake accounts that people try to establish on our platform.  In the first quarter of this year, we removed 2.2 billion accounts from our platform.  That figure does not include the accounts we stopped or prevented from being set up in the first instance.  They are accounts that managed to be set up but were caught within minutes.</p> <p>  I mentioned a couple of the issues relating to what such a system would look like.  At the global level at which we operate, what would the system of authentication or verification look like and what sort of requirements or burden would it put on the user to be able to access our services?  We are not dismissing such issues out of hand but rather they are the types of questions that arise.  We are working hard on the issue of age verification for children's accounts, which is just a small subset of the wider question of authenticating accounts.  The types of steps we are taking in that regard include enabling AI to detect where somebody has submitted an age of, say, 20 but where it is clear the pattern of their behaviour does not match that of a 20 year old.  While we do not have the answer just yet, we are examining and exploring the area.  As some of the other guests and I noted, it is for legislators to make a decision on what is required.  We can offer our opinions on what such a system might look like and we are happy to have more in-depth conversations on the matter.</p></speech>

As of now, it is a general judgment and is being referred back to the national court in Austria for further guidance and information.  It remains to be seen how its specifics and details will pan out.  It does, at the outset, raise significant questions around exactly what we are talking about here today, namely, the responsibility and role of online services for moderating content, their role or responsibility over illegal content and obligations of monitoring and so forth.  There are also very real freedom of expression concerns with how it could be applied in practice.</p> <p>  Another element that has been discussed widely, including in the media in the aftermath of the decision, and a concern we share, is that the judgment tends to cut against the widely accepted principle that a court in one jurisdiction should not have the ability to determine what is available, or should be seen or accessible in other jurisdictions.  There are some concerning notes in the judgment and we are still considering them.</p></speech>

Do our guests accept that, in all the documents from each of the companies before us today, there is a combined fudge?  The documents refer back to the e-commerce directive, which it seems as if it is placed above everything else.  The companies seem to allow an element of harmful content by using the e-commerce directive as a net defence, even though it has more to do with a regulatory impact on the companies' profitability rather than the freedom of expression aspect.  Why will these companies not suggest something?  For example, we all accept that the e-commerce directive was outdated before all of these companies arrived here.  Should there be another legislative move in that space?</p></speech>

Our community standards are an exercise in rights balancing.  There are rights to be considered on the one hand, but if a user engages in certain types of behaviour, other things will also be taken into consideration in coming to an outcome.  Freedom of expression is important, but we are demonstrating Facebook's experience of rights balancing over the past 14 years.</p> <p>  We are also saying that Facebook would welcome governments, legislators and policymakers critically reviewing where we have drawn the lines in our community standards.  We are open to being told where we are and where we should be going further.  There may be places where we are doing more than legislators and policymakers would have been satisfied with.  The goal is to come to an acceptance of how, as a whole, we are going to deal with the issue of harmful online content.  As I said, that is not putting the onus back on society.  We have a significant role in this and intend to play it, but we need input and guidance.  People such as those on the committee will ultimately decide what will and will not be allowed.</p></speech>

Anonymity is ingrained in the DNA of the company.  Some of the earliest users availing of our policy on anonymity have been human rights activists, journalists, whistleblowers and people operating in countries where they need anonymity to do their work safely.  We have also seen how it serves a positive purpose for young people, for example, who may feel isolated and do not want to speak out on Twitter without being able to do it anonymously.  We have seen many positive use cases.  It is important to note that anonymity does not by any stretch of the imagination serve as a shield against the Twitter rules.  We have introduced robust policies over the last year relating to fake accounts, so one cannot set up accounts with the purpose of misleading or engaging in deceptive behaviours or disrupting the service.  We have rules relating to impersonation accounts so one cannot impersonate a brand, an organisation or others on the service.</p> <p>  Anonymity is incredibly important to the company.  As I said, it is ingrained in our DNA but it does not mean that one-----</p></speech>

I am referring to personal data.  It is sensitive personal data such as the data that would be contained in a government ID, for example.  We would have to examine that against the data minimisation principles of the general data protection regulation.  We have always sought to collect as little personal, sensitive data about our users as possible.  It could open us to a variety of challenges, not least the cybersecurity challenges we would be open to by holding that type of personal data.

We carry out account verification in certain circumstances where we feel it is proportionate, for example, when we introduced new policies for election advertising for the European Parliament elections.  That involved a process of account verification so that anyone who wanted to advertise had to provide documents and so on.  The degree of data that was required to be collected in that process was quite significant. Our view is that it was proportionate to apply that in that case but perhaps not proportionate in every case.</p> <p>  In terms of a universal obligation, there are certainly countries in which we operate that require people to verify their account with us, using a government ID or some other form, in order to use our services.  There are certainly countries where that would exclude large numbers of people.  In particular, it would exclude people who were perhaps not as well got with the government as other parts, shall we say.  That is just the nature of them.  That may not necessarily apply here in Ireland but in many countries in which we operate.  That is a consideration we have to take into account. </p> <p>  I will not repeat the issues concerning data minimisation.  That point would have to be considered against the GDPR.  </p> <p>  Speaking for Google, we do see a role for private or anonymous use of the Internet.  There are use cases for various reasons.  We offer, for example, in our browser incognito mode where people can switch into a mode to use the Internet without their identity being known.  Overall it is useful to hear from the companies on this but, primarily, one would have to put that question to the people who would be affected by it, which would be our users.  I know that next week the committee will hear from civil liberty groups and so on and that is a really important question to tease out.  At present, our view broadly is that there are circumstances that are proportionate to require account verification but I am not sure we would go as far as to say it is appropriate in all circumstances.  </p></speech>

Many of the self-regulatory models we have in place are bearing fruit.</p><p>I will speak about one very briefly, as I am conscious of the Deputy's time.  The EU code of conduct on illegal hate speech has been in existence for a number of years.  Initially, the main signatories were the companies represented here, but the flexibility it has allowed has meant that many additional companies have signed up to the code of conduct over the years.  The European Commission and Commissioner Jourov&aacute; have spoken about the effectiveness of the code.  More than 70% of illegal hate speech is being removed by the signatories and more than 80% is being removed within 24 hours.  It is just one example of an effective self-regulatory-----</p></speech>

I am acutely conscious of what governments can get up to stop that.  Within that we must look at people being harmed online, and that is where I am coming from.

I preface what I say by saying that freedom of expression is vital.  We interfere with freedom of expression at our peril.  Within that framework we need transparency; we do not need jargon.  We need honest communication of information.  I am not hearing that.  I would not go away reassured that the self-regulation by any of the companies represented here is working.  I have listened to the submissions - I will stay on to listen to the others -  and they seem to be reactive.  I am hearing that in the past year things have been set up.  Twitter has referred to robust policies in the last year.  It is reactive depending on some outrage on our part over somebody suffering.  I will not go into any of the personal details.  That is what I am hearing.  In addition, our guests all referred to the e-commerce directive, which is greatly outdated.  None of them mentioned that it is greatly outdated.  They have all used it as a shield.  I understand that new legislation is about to be introduced.  How will that affect the companies represented here?  Have they looked at it?</p> <p>  I interrupted Ms White.  What is the nature of the harm?  Does it appal her on a personal level?

I appreciate why there may be the impression of reactivity when we say that we have introduced measures in the past year.</p><p>Sometimes we are reacting to the changing behaviours we see online.  Twitter is a window to the world.  I have worked with Twitter for more than five years and nobody could have anticipated how online services and the Internet in general would be used by terrorist organisations.</p></speech>

I appreciate the fact that Twitter is before us and I hope its representatives will come back again because we need to work together.  However, I would have been more impressed if they had stated that the e-commerce directive was greatly outdated.  It is the law at the moment and we are complying with it but, within that law, we are passive and there is no obligation on us to be proactive.  None of our guests stated this.  They seem to be saying they only have to act when it is brought to their attention.  Few of them were even born at the time the directive was introduced.</p> <p>  Facebook has a proactive approach to teachers.  It has a programme involving over 100 teachers and the first set of training sessions started in September.  We are commencing something in response to the outrage.

Google is looking at ways to provide extra transparency and we undertook a transparency report a number of years ago, to which we have added material over time.</p> <p>  I agree that we need to work together.  Some 20 years ago, the e-commerce directive involved a complex balancing of rights and freedom of expression.  It is appropriate that we continue to look at that balance and that legislators, companies and other stakeholders get involved in it.</p><p>As service providers in this area, we are hoping to get across our experience of the benefits of the legislation for the open Internet in general.</p></speech>

I do not know what they are called now but I refer to the people who have to look at the terrible images to which we referred.  Can we drop the phrase "revenge porn"?  It is not acceptable to me.  It is used in one of the documents we have seen today.  It is not I but other organisations which have drawn attention to it, and asked for it not to be used.  They are sexually explicit images of abuse, not porn revenge.  I would not like to be the person who had to look at these images.  Can Facebook, Google and Twitter tell me if the people in question are part of their entities?  Are they outsourced?  What do the companies learn from them?  Have they listened to them?  What is the mechanism for them to report back on terrible images they have seen?  I ask our guests to be precise because the Chairman will stop me in two minutes.</p></speech>

I read in detail all the written contributions.  I will start with a few questions on the issue of explicit images, which, according to the submission, is the main focus of <i>hotline.ie</i>.</p><p>While child sexual abuse material seems to be its focus, I imagine <i>hotline.ie</i>also receives reports of more general sexual abuse material.  The witnesses emphasised that child sexual abuse material is clearly illegal and therefore the issue of consent does not apply.  I would like to tease out the issues of consent and freedom of expression and where the platforms stand in that respect and also how they deal with those issues.  We all regularly come across content online which is not considered appropriate or normal.  We do not know from looking at this content whether the people depicted in the images gave their consent.  A couple of decades ago, page 3 of many daily newspapers featured a picture of somebody wearing very little or no clothing.  That was considered normal at the time but it is no longer considered normal and these pictures no longer feature.  One of the reasons for this is that much of this material has moved onto the Internet.  The reality is that society has deemed it not to be appropriate.  If it is not appropriate in a newspaper, surely it is not appropriate in formats like the various Internet platforms.  I understand completely that what makes these platforms unique and what makes them work is freedom of expression and the ability to put something online immediately.  At the same time, there is an element of responsibility around this, including as regards consent.  I would like to get Ms Niculescu's views because we have not heard from her in regard to checking out that consent or whether consent is checked out regularly in respect of images other than child sexual material.</p></speech>

The mandate of <i>hotline.ie</i>is to handle reports of suspected illegal content.  In assessing those reports, we have to apply the provisions of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act.  If content does not meet the threshold which is clearly detailed in the Act, it will not be classified as child pornography.  We prefer to use the term &quot;child sexual abuse material&quot; because of the serious nature of the content.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, we are talking about infants to 12 year olds.  We also get reports in respect of self-generated content but in terms of the age group, that would involve those aged over 14 years and it is not as severe as the sexual abuse of a two year old infant.  I am not sure that-----</p></speech>

If it does not meet the threshold, it is not illegal.  The hotline would not be in a position to act against that image.</p></speech>

We all agree and know what type of content is illegal.  We have experiences, however, of seeing different types of content being shared and uploaded on our services and platforms, some of which is equally harmful and has no place on our platforms.  I am referring, for example, to an area such as the non-consensual sharing of intimate imagery.  Even if that an image was initially taken with consent, that is not allowed to be shared or posted on our platform subsequently without the consent of the person originally involved.  That is not allowed on our platforms.  We would take such an image down and also bank it to prevent it from being uploaded again.  Some of the content referred to earlier, such as implied sexual, or sexually suggestive content, involving minors, would also breach our policies and we would also take that down.</p></speech>

Some people, however, do it unintentionally, such as minors uploading something and not realising what they have done.  We would not necessarily apply a penalty on their accounts.  We might just send educational messages to let those people know that sharing that type of content is not appropriate, they should be more careful in future and refrain from that type of behaviour.</p></speech>

She could take a civil case against me, even though that content appeared on the Facebook platform.  Deputy Connolly, in that hypothetical scenario, however, could not take a case against Facebook.  Equally, it seems that Facebook would also not take a case against me for abusing the platform.</p></speech>

In most cases, the context is lacking, so we need to judge the image on its own.  Sometimes we only get one image reported, with no comments or further description from the person making that report.  In assessing that one image, we need to ensure that the image itself is manifestly illegal and meets the threshold set out in legislation.  When there is more context, then we can make judgments regarding inappropriateness.  When we are talking about harmful content, the language we use is very important as it helps us to conceptualise the problem and also to forge responses.  We must ensure we are referring to the same thing.  To avoid any confusion, <i>hotline.ie</i>only deals with illegal content online.  We think more can be done regarding self-generated content and content which may be age inappropriate, but that does not fall within our current mandate.</p></speech>

We are in here and have a certain legal privilege because we are in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would seem the Internet almost has a similar legal privilege in that people seem to be almost able to do whatever they like and nobody can touch them.  That seems to be the case, and the companies responsible for putting up and hosting this material are not prepared to take legal action.</p></speech>

There is no question about that.  Similarly, we often get requests to provide information if a legal investigation is launched by law enforcement agencies.  We will co-operate with those law enforcement agencies based on the appropriate judicial process.  Some cases involve online as well as offline behaviour reach successful conclusions in the courts.  Our view is that what is unacceptable offline should be unacceptable online as well and the law should reflect that.  One of the reasons we are here today is because the committee is considering if the current laws which apply to offline behaviour are sufficient against similar behaviour online.  That is a worthy endeavour.</p></speech>

We have all seen live feeds of people going around towns in Ireland, making comments such as "look at all of the black people in this town, isn't this terrible?", and using that in a way to enable the promotion of a certain type of racism.  It is almost like the modern version of the Ku Klux Klan has found a new place to operate on the Internet and they seem to be free to do so.  Many complaints have been made about several individuals and organisations that engage in that type of behaviour.  Very little seems to be happening to address this issue because it is ongoing.</p> <p>  We can look it up right now on the computer.  I am sure we will find those people are there livestreaming some commentary which is very racist, abusive and dangerous.  I do not understand how the organisations represented here today cannot take responsibility.  If they are responsible, they have to extend that responsibility beyond just stating that they will take down such material.  It then happens the next day and is taken down, and then the next day and so on.</p><p>At what stage does a company reach a point when it accepts that it must go further than simply continually removing the content, and that it needs to be proactive rather than reactive?  There seems to be no limit where that line is crossed. </p></speech>

When something meets the threshold of hate speech, it is one category of this type of content which would violate our community standards and would be removed.  There are several different nuances within the type of content being shared on the platform.  There is material that obviously violates the terms but we must also respect that there may be political views within that criticising asylum seekers or the migration of people.  It is not a clearcut process where one can run through each and every one and say that they are all hate speech and they must all be taken down.  We do take it very seriously.  That is why we take review of each of these cases extremely seriously.  Having said that, we have said what our line is.  We are open to hearing whether our line should go further.  I will ask Ms Rush to speak on the legal situation in Ireland on hate speech.  Facebook has set out its policy and we enforce against that.  If there is a view that we are not doing that or that we should take down more, we are open to hearing what that would look like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Rush" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#UU00500"><p>As Mr. &Oacute; Broin mentioned at the outset, hate speech, as a large bucket of harmful content, is one area where our policies arguably go further than current legislation in Ireland.  That is an area that might be ripe for future consideration.  It can be difficult when reviewing a piece of content without the surrounding circumstances to know whether, in theory, it would rise to the level of incitement.  It is very hard to know that when there is a vitriolic or malicious attack on a person.  Our position is that making derogatory threats or statements or dehumanising speech is not allowed, even if the content is perfectly lawful within a jurisdiction, and we will still take it down if it violates our policies.</p> <p>  One example of a fairly successful self-regulatory regime is the EU code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech.  That tests us on our responsiveness in taking down illegal hate speech as swiftly as possible.  We go through rounds of testing, most recently at the end of 2018.  After that test, the EU Commission observed that the most serious types of hate speech, that is credible threats, had the highest rate of removal at 82% whereas in more nuanced speech, where it was difficult to make a determination whether or not it constituted incitement or if it was insulting language, that a greater balance had to be struck, and it seemed as though the signatory companies were trying to take that balancing exercise very seriously when assessing the content. </p></speech>

If the same content is coming from the same organisation or individual, is there precedent for the company to say that this organisation or individual will no longer have access to the platform?  That would be a start.</p></speech>

If criminal, dangerous or hate organisations start to have a presence on Facebook we will remove them immediately.</p><p>I do not mean this flippantly, but Deputy Martin Kenny referred to the KKK earlier.  If it wanted to set up a benign page which had nothing whatever to do with hate speech, we would take that down as its ideology is contrary to our principles and policies.  We would not allow the organisation itself to have a presence on the platform, nor would we allow any other user to engage in praise, support or representation of that organisation.   </p></speech>

Twitter has a hateful conduct policy.  It outlines that it is against our rules to promote violence against, threaten or attack others on the basis of a range of protected categories such as gender and race.  Twitter's focus is on behaviour over content in particular.  It is much easier to identify certain types of abusive behaviours and scale that than solely looking at hate speech which is highly subjective and often context dependent.  Twitter is somewhat unique in that it is a public communications platform.  We are looking at behaviours of different types of accounts.  Our systems can proactively detect if, for instance, one account is @-mentioning another account repeatedly and that account does not follow them.  That might signal to us that someone is engaging in some level of abusive behaviour or if there is some sort of dog-piling with an attack on another account.  Sometimes we take a variety of these signals in combination to give us some indication that we need to review an account for hateful conduct or abusive behaviour.  I can assure the Deputy that our policies are applied consistently across the board.  When violations are found actions are taken.  There are various actions, which I outlined, that we can take beginning with the outright suspension of an account.  We have vastly improved the stopping of repeat offenders coming back to Twitter by setting up another account and leveraging our own technology; we are finding new ways to do that and to stop them coming back to Twitter to engage in the same behaviours.  There are those on our service who set up what we classify as sole purpose accounts where they engage in nothing more than abusing others.  That type of behaviour is reviewed against our policies and we take appropriate action.  There is a range of actions we can take.  We also introduced a change to our hateful conduct policy on dehumanisation.  Research shows that dehumanising language leads to offline violence.  We have made a change to our hateful conduct policy in regard to religious groups.  We will continue to iterate on those.</p> <p>    Mr. Costello might talk to some of our efforts with NGOs with whom we work.   </p></speech>

Earlier, in reply to Deputy Connolly, she spoke of the idea of counter speech, that Twitter allowed a conversation to happen so that others from a counter view could get in and put their piece in.  That might be all right at one level but at another I wonder if it is part of a big picture which Twitter is trying to create.</p><p>From the point of view of the platform gaining traction and popularity, be it Twitter, Google or something else, if there is controversy, a heightened conversation or a major debate, it means people are interested, watching and keying into it.  As such, creating these two counterviews and giving them amplification helps the platforms gain traction.  Many people have the view that, although the platforms claim they are watching over something, they are really just letting it run.  To date, there has been at least some evidence of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen White" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#WW00200"><p>It is unfortunate that that perception exists.  We take on board that it is our responsibility to try to change it and educate people on the work that has been undertaken by the company over the past couple of years to improve the health of public conversation on Twitter and put various mechanisms in place to help empower our users so that they feel that they have a safer experience online.  There is still work that we need to do as regards perceptions.</p> <p>  There is no business incentive to leave rule-violating content on our service.  Counter-speech works.  There are different categories of content that we address.  There is content that is illegal and content that is not illegal but is in violation of the Twitter rules.  In certain jurisdictions, our terms of service and rules go far beyond the laws.  Then there is content that is neither illegal nor a violation of the Twitter rules.  We find that counterspeech in particular can have a positive impact on that type of speech, as it is a space where people offer diverse views that challenge prejudices, intolerance and racism online.  They are calling others out, saying that certain types of speech are wrong and showing a more tolerant and respectful viewpoint.  It is within the context of the type of speech that is neither illegal nor a violation of the Twitter rules that counterspeech can have a positive impact.</p></speech>

It is short.  One cannot get into the detail of an argument on Twitter.  One just puts out a paragraph at most.  From that point of view, it is difficult to see how counterspeech can work, given that all one ends up with is a whole lot of people shouting at one another.  Ms White called it a "perception", but for most people it is the actual experience.</p> <p>  I understand the Chair wishes to get through this, but the other issue is-----</p></speech>

Young people in particular use many of the platforms.  We hear of young people who are self-harming, sometimes to the extent of suicide.  Much of that comes from pressure they have been put under online.  We often discover in the aftermath that various complaints were made but material was not removed from online in spite of people's requests.</p> <p>  The committee is undertaking work on the issue of spent convictions.  The people in question have moved on with their lives.  Someone in my area had mental health issues when young and got into trouble.  However, if one were to Google that person's name today, a media report would come up.  There was a request to have that search result taken down, but the response was that it was in the public interest to leave it even though it was hurtful and damaging to the individual in question.  Anyone looking at this logically would not see a public interest in the matter at all.</p> <p>  A large amount of work is to be done by all of the organisations before us if they are to gain people's confidence in these matters.  How and where are the organisations moving as regards the right of a person to move on with his or her life and the issue of young and vulnerable people being victimised online?</p></speech>

We will take Mr. Meade first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.491" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ryan Meade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#XX00200"><p>I might also answer the Deputy's previous question.  He was right to mention livestreaming as a category of content that needed special caution.  At YouTube, we have preliminary hurdles that people need to jump through before they get the ability to livestream.  For example, they need to have a certain number of followers and cannot be brand new.  They cannot just create an account and suddenly start livestreaming.  If there is a violation of our policies, their ability to livestream can be taken away.  We have taken the approach that livestreaming is something that needs special attention.</p> <p>  Regarding the types of livestreaming the Deputy mentioned, he may or may not be aware that we updated out policy on hate speech this year, which has resulted in violations by people who were livestreaming.  In one fairly high-profile case, we terminated that account.  The Deputy may have seen that there has been quite a reaction to that.  This shows that there has been progress in the development and implementation of our policy.  There is no question but that we will suspend accounts and remove people's opportunity to use these tools if they violate the policies.</p> <p>  The question on spent convictions is an interesting one, in that it cuts across privacy law.  The right to be forgotten was been established in European privacy law.  The practical implication of this is that platforms, including Google Search, must assess requests from users to delist information.  The information may still be out there on the Internet, but we must assess the request to delist it from our search engine.  The law also requires us to apply a balancing test.  As such, there has to be a consideration of whether other issues need to be taken into account.  Naturally, any decision we make on this basis is subject to dispute, in that people may say that we made the right or wrong decision.  In such cases, there is recourse to the Data Protection Commission, DPC, as the matter is handled under privacy law.  The individual in question can make a complaint to the DPC if he or she is not happy with our decision.  The law requires us to have a balancing test.  As Mr. &Oacute; Broin stated, private companies like us may not always be the right arena in which to make such decisions, but that is what is required of us under the law.  We need to consider requests as they come in, apply the test and make a determination on whether information should be delisted.</p></speech>

She was present for quite a part of the meeting and is well entitled to that.</p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge that, while the focus of our engagement over a number of hours today has been on what we all accept are the worst excesses of human usage of each of the platforms' sites, the services they provide are very valuable, appreciated and utilised responsibly by the overwhelming majority of their respective customers.</p><p>That needs to be said because, otherwise, we are giving a very skewed image and perception of the respective sites with which our guests are involved.  I am of the view that this acknowledgment is important, but the focus of our address is harmful online activity.  Although we are some steps away from producing our report and recommendations, I get the sense that there is a general unified opinion coming from all the members that the platform companies are facilitating significantly harmful postings, including criminal acts, that have given rise to serious injury and worse.  I hope our guests are equally committed to addressing and, where possible at all, eradicating that activity.</p><p> I wish to reflect on the contributions of those who appears before us last week.  They were very strong in their recommendations.  The committee is very mindful of the importance of working together.  The respective component parts of the industry must work with legislators to try to reach a better situation where safety is critical and most especially in respect of children, but where there is safety for all users if at all possible.</p><p> Some of our guests keep referring to rules.  There has been talk of Twitter rules and Facebook rules.  When the rules have been broken, the companies respond.  It is almost a competition from our perspective.  In terms of breaking the rules, in many of those instances and most certainly in the most serious of the cases that have been reported to us, we would like to see that people have broken the law.  It is not enough just to look at some as being inappropriate.  We would like to see some of the cases that have been reflected to us as involving illegality.</p><p> I am minded of the contribution last week of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  I am very grateful to Mr. John Church, its chief executive.  I will just instance one of the cases that was brought to its attention.  A 16 year old girl told Childline that she had sent images to a former boyfriend, who then shared them with others without her permission.  With the images circulating widely, the girl told Childline she could not face going back to school and was contemplating suicide.  I do not expect a response on that today but, in the context of the exercise we have embarked on, we are very mindful of the harm, hurt and serious consequences involved and we want to try to find a means of address.  We have only the power of recommendation to the Minister and the Government, but we will not shirk in our responsibilities in outlining the strongest recommendations if we believe they are the most appropriate.</p><p> Professor Joe Carthy was mentioned.  He is the founding director of the UCD centre for cybersecurity.  He made an analogy with automobile legislation.  Every car has a number plate.  Every car is registered to someone.  He said while it is perfectly acceptable to use the Internet in any anonymous fashion, it is not acceptable to abuse, bully or libel others anonymously.  He said it is akin to allowing people to drive cars without number plates.</p><p>This is a key area in respect of which legislation could make a huge difference.  Professor Carthy believes that we should require social media platforms and online providers to register their users and that users should provide appropriate evidence of identity, and not just after the event or in following through when something outrageous has happened.  He stated that users who can show that they have been bullied, harassed or abused on a social media platform should be legally entitled to find out the identity of the user carrying out the inappropriate behaviour.  I would welcome a brief response to that.  I know that if Professor Carthy was here he would like to ask our guests about this matter.  I invite a response from Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  Our guests have probably all looked at a recording of last week's meeting so they know what I am talking about.</p></speech>

We have already had much debate with other members of this committee about the introduction of verification and some form of digital ID.  The European Commission is looking at the issue.  It must weigh up the benefits of introducing a harmonised system of digital ID across Europe.  We are very much looking at how something like that could be applied globally, because that is what we would need to do.</p> <p>  I have mentioned some of the challenges in respect of collecting additional data, for example, government ID, but introducing that kind of verification mechanism where we might have to register individuals who use our service could also have severe implications for human rights activists, dissidents and in countries like Russia where similar requests have been made to us.  There is a balance to be struck and much more consultation and debate are needed on the benefits.  I understand many of the arguments made by Professor Carthy.  I looked at last week's session.  We take the points the Chairman has made onboard.  Unfortunately, there is no simple solution but we can commit to continuing discussion and collaboration to find a solution in this very important area.</p></speech>

The question of proportionality is really the big issue when it comes to verification of accounts.  There are cases in which it is a proportionate response to require verification of accounts, but I am not sure we would go so far as to say that universal verification of accounts for anyone engaging in activity online is a proportionate response.  On the other hand, in many ways, that is for legislators to decide.  Professor Carthy may have a different view and he may feel that is proportionate.  That is a matter for debate.</p><p>The only thing I would say is a variety of voices would need to be heard on that issue.  As the Chairman rightly pointed out earlier, we are focusing on the activity of a minority and the worst activity of that minority.  There is a vast corpus of Internet users out there who are benefitting from these services daily and their interests must be taken into account as well.  Apologies for the fudge, but I encourage legislators to look at the proportionality of that as a measure.</p></speech>

I hear what Mr. Meade is saying.  I wish to make one other point.  Senator Higgins need not worry; she will get her bite at the cherry.</p><p><b></b>The representatives from Facebook cited, in their opening statement and in their contribution since, the extent of their response to material that is inappropriate and that is brought to their attention internally or reported to them.  I am going to refer to a particular case of which I am aware, and to at least two Facebook pages that existed for a number of years.  I refer to the recent outrageous and dreadful attack on Kevin Lunney, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings.  At least one of the Facebook pages in question referenced, by name, the senior executives of the company and allegations were made against them.  Other posts included mock-ups of posters calling individuals traitors and warning of consequences.  The intention in this regard was to misrepresent and label those executives.  Some of them were referenced on the page.  When I sat with these people, including Kevin Lunney, earlier this year, I was mindful that we were embarking on this particular exercise.  My question would have been put to our guests in any event, regardless of what happened to Kevin recently, which was an absolute disgrace.  My question is the same as it would have been if the attack had not taken place.  The executives in question made repeated requests of Facebook to remove the offensive material.  I understand that Facebook removed it he day after Kevin Lunney was kidnapped and attacked.  Facebook described is as a violation of authenticity guidelines.  I wonder how our guests will explain the meaning of the latter.  In any event, it was action after the event.  It was much too late.  The material was hugely offensive.  It was intended to harm the good name and reputation of the people involved and, as a Deputy representing the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, I believe it fed into a view that in some way those people, the named parties, and the businesses they were involved in, were a legitimate target for the worst excesses of what I can only describe as the most ill-informed people on this island.  How does Facebook respond to the example I have cited?  I would have raised it with Facebook even if the attack had not taken place because the pages should have been removed.  The vile content and its intent and purpose is an affront to any and every one of us.  I invite Mr. &Oacute; Broin and Ms Rush to respond.</p></speech>

We were all shocked by the events in Cavan and we extend our sympathies to Mr. Lunney.  We have been working with the Quinn Industrial Holdings team for a number of years and it has made a number of reports to us about content.  We have removed a significant number of posts from a number of pages.</p><p>There is a focus on a particular post.  I will not go into the details.  When it was reported to us initially, it was reviewed and found not to be violating our community standards.  It was then brought back to our attention through the media on 20 September.  At that point, it was put into an authenticity check.  It was then reviewed and found to be violating our community standards.  The post and the page on which it appeared have been removed from the platform.</p></speech>

The series of attacks and outrageous actions that have taken place, clearly targeted at the executives in Quinn Industrial Holdings, not only put their safety at risk but also put at risk the jobs of the approximately 850 people who depend on their expert oversight of the respective companies.  As another member stated, it would be to return these fields to fields of rushes.  The community is so dependent on the organisations that it would be an absolute tragedy if any or all of these companies were to fold.  Even to have them put at risk is an outrage and an affront to the community that depends on them.  If the post met the community standards, Facebook needs to examine those standards.</p></speech>

We are constantly being informed by experts about where they should be.  That is just a general point, not one on the specific question.  Having looked back at the post, we believe we should have taken the wider context into account when it was initially reviewed.  That did not happen.  It was found not to be violating our community standards.  We should have taken the wider context into account.</p></speech>

I am sure the Chairman will appreciate why I cannot get into a conversation about it but that is not to say it would have been the only account regarding which reports would have been received by Twitter or content would have been surfaced proactively by us in respect of which action would have been taken.

The issue of targeted harassment is one I hope to return to in a moment, specifically in conversation with the representatives from Twitter.  It is notable that in its testimony today, Facebook has told us it is not confident there is any lawful weight to its guidelines.  Twitter, with regard to the Ryan case specifically, said that if there had been any legal action, it would have co-operated in the case.  Even in the representatives' own words, they are strongly making the case not only regarding legislation on hate speech but also regarding legislation on online regulation.  Representatives from both Facebook and Twitter pointed out that they would have moved further if required to by law.  This underscores the need for legislation in this area and the fact that self-regulation clearly has its limits.  Community standards have little concrete weight when it comes to persons' lives and persons who may be the subject of online abuse, regardless of whether they choose to be part of the online community.  That is important because the duty of protection is not simply to users but to all citizens.  That is a wider concern.  The duty of protection also extends to those who may not be citizens but who are resident in our country.</p> <p>  Let me point to an issue raised by Deputy Brophy.  Follow-up information and granular detail may be required.  Deputy Brophy asked about the resources and number of staff allocated for taking down offensive or harmful content.  I would like a breakdown also on the resources devoted to brand protection.  All the organisations represented today have a large number of staff working on brand protection, for example, to ensure their advertisers' branding is not being misused.  I am aware there are those whose work is dedicated specifically to targeting and watching out for issues that may be of concern to advertisers.  I do not know the extent to which those issues, in terms of brand protection removals, are subject to notification requirements.  Are there staff permanently allocated to deal with these issues?  In providing us with the information on staffing and resources allocated for taking down content that violates standards, the representatives might give a specific breakdown on the proportion of resources allocated to deal with harmful content and the proportion triggered by notifications, by comparison with the resources allocated to deal with issues such as brand protection.</p></speech>

It has been pointed out time and again that the e-commerce directive is wildly out of date.  In many cases, individuals are not in a position to notify because they may not be aware of the offensive or harmful content related to them.  I want to focus a little on the facilities associated with the targeting of information.  If I do not see abusive content about me, I am not in a position to notify the relevant organisation about it.  This leads to the question of the targeting of information.</p><p> Twitter has a policy whereby it can block content but it tries to support a person's experience on the site.  I may not be simply concerned about my experience on the site but about abusive content about me.  As I understand it, Twitter changed its rules, and perhaps there has been a further change, whereby if I block somebody and assume that person no longer has access to my information, that person can still see me and speak about me but I do not see what he or she is saying.  That change in the blocking provision is a very serious concern and relates to stalking, harassment and so forth.  It is not just my experience but misinformation.</p><p> Ms White indicated that Twitter never automatically suspends accounts.  I have spoken to people who have been the subject of very targeted campaigns of harassment and a person who has been suspended as a consequence immediately created a new account and resumed the harassment.  This is a real concern.  When the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, spoke to this committee it emphasised that this should not apply only to repeated activity but a single incident should be enough.  Stalking is one of the concerns that may be included in this Bill.  Someone can repeatedly re-register on new accounts but Twitter will wait until that person does something offensive or dangerous.  That approach creates a very chilling fear for a person.  I will not bring the people involved into committee testimony but I know there are people who have been repeatedly targeted by accounts which effectively threatened them and when those accounts were suspended a new one immediately appeared.  How can Twitter improve its blocking mechanisms to address those concerns? </p></speech>

She mentioned a strong emphasis on notification.  I have tried to communicate to the committee this morning that we are trying to reduce the burden on victims having to report to Twitter.  People absolutely need a mechanism to get in touch with Twitter to tell us if they have been subjected to certain types of behaviour.  In response to the Senator's point that if someone cannot see something, that person cannot notify us, we made a change some years ago to allow bystander reporting.  If a person sees something online, it goes back to the "see something, say something" principle.  If people see someone being bullied in the playground, they should say something to the teacher.  The same principles apply online.  We allow bystander reporting. </p> <p>  In addition, I have highlighted that 30% of the action that we take on content deemed to be abusive behaviour is taken proactively.  That is without any reports; it is content that Twitter has surfaced for human review.  We hope that figure will increase so that we can further reduce the burden on victims having to report content to us.</p> <p>  We had a problem with repeat offenders at Twitter.  It was a bit like playing whack-a-mole in that we would suspend an account and another account would be opened.  We did significant work with our trust and safety council which advised us of the need to remedy this situation.  We have stopped repeat offending by more than 100,000 accounts over the past year.</p><p>Our actions are having real results.  I do not mean to imply that we have fixed the problem in its totality but we are slowing it down.  Our actions are stopping repeat offenders opening new accounts or engaging in multiple account abuse, where one individual has multiple accounts with the sole intention of abusing others on the service.  We rely on behaviour base signals.  There are several signals that may not be visible to individuals who use our service or to the public at large but they are behind the scenes, such as whether an email address has been verified or whether an account is mentioning other accounts in large volumes.  That would give the impression to us that an account is potentially violating rules on behaviour.</p></speech>

If we believe an account holder has opened another account, there are several ways we can do that.  He or she may use the same email address, IP address or telephone number.  We automatically suspend those accounts once we have made a determination that somebody who has been suspended is trying to circumvent the Twitter rules to open another account.  That person will be suspended from the service.</p></speech>

Previously, I understood blocking meant that person would not see my content if I did not wish to engage with that person on Twitter and did not want him or her to see my content.</p></speech>

If the person happens to be in a group direct message conversation, the person who has been blocked is ejected from the group conversation.  Blocking on Twitter is a definitive way to cut ties with someone on the platform.</p> <p>  Muting is the low-friction way of controlling interaction with someone else on the platform.  That may be what the Senator is referring to.  If the Senator mutes someone, she will not see that person's content and timeline but if she navigates to the person's profile, she will see what he or she says about anything.</p></speech>

The appendix to Facebook's presentation was optimistic when it suggested an amendment to the Bill which provided that communication does not include provision of information society services.  I hope and expect that would be roundly rejected because it is a very ambitious attempt by Facebook to remove itself from its responsibilities.  There are questions about what a platform and publication are, which need to be teased out but there is a communication function and communication is taking place.  That was acknowledged elsewhere.  This is not a neutral platform for freedom of expression.  It is a commercial platform in which certain particular messages can be promoted, highlighted and amplified.  It is not a neutral <i>tabula rasa</i>where people place their tuppence worth.  What steps does Twitter believe need to be taken to change its financial model?  I accept that there are serious concerns about freedom of expression.  I do not know that we should automatically move towards identification of persons online.  We need to consider what happened in China and avoid government ideas being used in that sense.</p><p>If I am paying to have my message amplified then there is a different responsibility and in terms of the facilitation of the anonymous targeting of information.  On the question of harmful communications, which I know is a wider issue here, Senator Lynn Ruane and I previously put forward a measure that has not been commenced but is in legislation on the use of information to target vulnerable persons such as an 18 year old with, for example, an eating disorder.  There is a wider issue around the targeting of messaging. </p></speech>

Particularly in Google search, the ads are clearly labelled on the top and on YouTube the ads are clearly labelled as ads.  That is a very important principle for us.  We do not take payment for boosting content.  We have the ability for users to click in and see why the ad was displayed to them.</p> <p>  I welcome the Senator's question because she addressed an important matter.  I think the question is what standards should apply to platforms, as platforms, rather than identify whether we can just apply the standards that exist for publishers and apply them to platforms.  That is an encouraging line of thought.  </p></speech>

The Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment will work in collaboration with this committee on this very critical issue.</p></speech>

I thank each company for their opening statements and participation.  I shall seize on the word "collaboration" and say that I hope that this will not be the last time that we will engage or that the companies will engage, more importantly, with the representatives of these Houses and Government.  We have already outlined the objectives of this committee, in setting out on this course of hearings, to the companies.</p><p>I believe this is a journey on which we can travel together.  That is the most important message that we can deliver publicly.  I thank Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin and Ms Claire Rush from Facebook Ireland; Ms Karen White and Mr. Ronan Costello, Twitter Ireland; Mr. Ryan Meade, Google Ireland; and Ms Ana Niculescu, the Internet Service Providers Association.  We will invite them to the launch of our report sometime between now and Christmas.</p></speech>
