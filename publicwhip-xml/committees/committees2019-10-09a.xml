I am sorry I cannot be there in person.  I am an earth systems scientist with a PhD awarded jointly by MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  I am the David R. Atkinson Professor of Ecology and Environmental Biology at Cornell University in New York State.  I have been a tenured professor at Cornell since 1985 and I have conducted research and taught on climate change since 1980.<br/><br/>I am an expert on the global methane cycle, on the role of methane as a driver of global climate change and on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.  I am the lead author of the first ever peer-reviewed analysis of methane emissions from shale-gas development from fracking and I have published ten additional papers on this topic in the past eight years since my original paper was published in 2011.  My research on methane and shale gas is cited more in the peer-reviewed literature than that of any other research scientist, with more than 2,700 citations.  I have given hundreds of presentations on shale gas and climate change, including a briefing to senior staff in the White House.<br/><br/>Shale gas is a form of natural gas obtained from shale rock using high-volume hydraulic fracturing and high-precision directional drilling.  These technologies have only been used by industry in the past 15 years.  Virtually all of the shale gas ever produced has been produced in this century, largely in the past decade and almost entirely in North America.  Two thirds of the increase in production of all natural gas over the past decade globally has been shale gas development in the United States.  Natural gas production in the United States is now dominated by shale gas.  If Ireland were to import liquefied natural gas from the United States, it would largely be shale gas.<br/><br/>Methane is the major component of natural gas, including shale gas.  Methane is an incredibly powerful greenhouse gas, more than 100 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.  Of the current global warming we have experienced in the past decade or two, methane contributes approximately 1 watt per square metre compared to 1.7 watts per square metre for carbon dioxide.  It is important to note that the Earth's climate system responds more quickly to methane than to carbon dioxide and, therefore, reducing emissions of methane is critical to reaching the United Nations COP21 target of keeping the planet well below 2&deg;C compared to the pre-industrial baseline.  We simply cannot do that with CO<sub>2</sub>emissions alone.  If we do not reduce methane emissions, the Earth will shoot through the 2&deg;C mark within the next 20 to 30 years, with devastating consequences.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, society has not so far acted to reduce methane emissions.  Rather, methane in the atmosphere has been increasing rapidly over the past decade.  My latest research, published in the journal <i>Biogeosciences</i>this summer, demonstrates that shale gas development in North America is the single largest driver of this increase in global methane.  Shale gas in the US accounts for one third of the increase in all global emissions from all sources.<br/><br/>In the US, approximately 3.5% of the shale gas that is developed is emitted to the atmosphere as unburned methane due to leaks all along the chain from wells to the final consumer and purposeful emissions as the gas is processed, stored and transported.  On account of these methane emissions, the use of shale gas in the United States has an even greater negative impact on the climate than coal, when we consider methane on the timescale of 20 years after it is emitted.<br/><br/>LNG imported to Ireland from the United States would have an even greater greenhouse gas footprint.  To liquefy and transport the gas requires a substantial volume of energy.  To import 1 cu. m of gas as LNG requires the production of 1.2 cu. m of gas with 0.2 cu. m of that gas burned to provide the energy for liquefication, etc.  With that we increase the CO<sub>2</sub>emissions as well as methane emissions and, therefore, I estimate the use of shale gas imported as LNG to Ireland would create greenhouse gas emissions of 156g of CO<sub>2</sub>equivalents per megajoule, or a footprint that is 40% greater than that of coal.  My written testimony provides a figure that demonstrates this.  This is a minimum estimate, since it does not include the additional methane emissions associated with storing and transporting the LNG.  Few if any data are available on methane emissions during transport but they could be substantial.<br/><br/>From the standpoint of climate change, LNG is a poor fuel choice, worse than using shale gas in the US.  I urge Ireland to prohibit the importation of fracked shale gas from the US.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute remotely today.</p></speech>

I started Frack Action in 2010 because of the direct threat that fracking posed to my community.  For five years, we worked with other grassroots organisations and NGOs to educate the public and our elected officials about the harm that fracking was inflicting on our neighbours in Pennsylvania.  From New York, we were witnessing in real time a dramatic increase of pollution and sickness for people and the environment in the areas where fracking was taking place.  Our campaigners worked with health professionals, who were studying the impacts that fracking was having throughout the US.  Now the vast majority of more than 1,500 peer-reviewed scientific studies demonstrate that drilling and fracking cause serious risks and harm to public health and the environment.  In 2015, our governor, Andrew Cuomo, listened to the science and banned fracking based on the risks to public health and the environment.  Shortly thereafter, my organisation was invited to come here by local campaigners to share the reports on the impacts of fracking by the New York State Departments of Public Health and Environmental Conservation with the public, press and elected officials.</p><p>As a third generation Irish-American, I was relieved when my ancestral homeland banned fracking in 2017, thus protecting the people, water, air, land, animals and climate.  That courageous action made Ireland an international leader on this issue, although that is still under threat, with potential fracking licences being granted in the North.  I have been invited back by local campaigners to address the potential use of US fracked gas in Ireland and specifically the proposed Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, import terminal.<br/><br/>New York has had its own experience with LNG terminals.  In 2015 the Governor, Andrew Cuomo, rejected the permit for the Port Ambrose LNG terminal and instead granted licences for offshore wind energy projects in that area.  He said: &ldquo;My administration carefully reviewed this project from all angles, and we have determined that the security and economic risks far outweigh any potential benefits.&rdquo;  The state of New York has also denied permission for several massive fracked gas pipelines from Pennsylvania to run through New York because of the dangers they pose to water, rivers, streams and wetlands, as well as the climate.  This is important because New York&rsquo;s decision to deny permits for fracking pipelines is a factor in the decision the committee faces today.  Quite simply, there is a glut of fracked gas in Pennsylvania that cannot be brought to market.  In financial terms, this gas is referred to as a &quot;stranded asset&quot;.<br/><br/>The Taoiseach stated on 2 October during Taoiseach&rsquo;s Questions that the gas for the Shannon LNG terminal was not necessarily fracked gas.  Given what we know, this is a misleading statement.  According to New Fortress Energy&rsquo;s filing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission on 9 November 2018, two thirds of marketed gas production in the United States is from fracking.  It also states the gas intended for the Shannon LNG terminal is fracked gas from Pennsylvania.  On page 9 it states: &ldquo;We are an integrated gas-to-power company that seeks to use &ldquo;stranded&rdquo; natural gas to satisfy the world&rsquo;s large and growing power needs&rdquo;.  It details, on pages 9 and 14, how it is planning to build two plants to liquefy 3 million to 4 million gallons of fracked gas per day for export from Pennsylvania, with the potential to build more liquefier plants, with a 15-year contract to buy the fracked gas.  One liquefier plant that New Fortress Energy is building is in Bradford County, one of the most heavily fracked counties in Pennsylvania where many residents are suffering from health ailments as a result.  The liquefied natural gas will be transported by truck from Bradford County to a proposed LNG export terminal in Gibbstown, Pennsylvania, where there is enormous local opposition.  It is quite clear that it will be fracked gas.<br/><br/>As many people and Deputies have stated, getting fracked gas from the United States when there is law banning fracking in Ireland reeks of hypocrisy.  If Ireland imports fracked gas at the Shannon LNG terminal, it will be locking itself into more than a decade of complicity in harming the people and children of Pennsylvania.  In recent months the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>has investigated and found at least 67 diagnoses of cancers, some of which are extremely rare, in children in just four rural, heavily fracked counties of the state.  Health professionals are alarmed by this.  As I previously stated, there are now more 1,500 scientific studies and reports in the United States which overwhelmingly show the harm caused by fracking.  It includes disastrous impacts on the climate caused by the release of methane.  As Professor Howarth stated, combined with the processes of fracking and the transport and distribution of LNG, methane leakages make fracked gas considerably worse for the climate than coal. <br/><br/>As we, in the United States, work to protect public health and the safety of Americans by having fracking banned nationally, I ask the committee, Members of the D&aacute;il and the public to, please, continue speaking out and working together to stop this project from gaining the final permits and to pass a law banning the use of all US fracked gas in Ireland.  Our health and well-being are at stake.  That is why I am here.</p></speech>

MaREI is a Science Foundation Ireland centre for energy, climate and the marine, based in UCC.  Analysis we undertook a number of years ago using our detailed European gas and electricity model examined the European energy system from a security of supply perspective.  We examined the effect a major supply interruption from Russia would have on Europe.  We found that Ireland could sustain an interruption period of up to ten months without the need for LNG infrastructure.  Ireland's gas system is strongly linked with the UK gas network.  To date in 2019 LNG imports, primarily from Qatar, Russia and Algeria which supply gas from conventional sources rather than fracking, have met approximately one fifth of the United Kingdom's full gas demand.  LNG imports of fracked gas from the United States have met approximately 1% of full UK gas demand to date in 2019.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine how many fracked gas molecules come into Ireland via the United Kingdom, just as it is impossible to determine how many electrons entering Ireland's power system from the United Kingdom derive from nuclear power generation.</p> <p>  Natural gas is used for electricity generation and heating in Ireland and meets one third of our energy needs.  Analysis undertaken with colleagues in Europe has found that the introduction of the Celtic interconnector from Ireland to France will further reduce Ireland's need for natural gas, cutting the volume of natural gas used by approximately 7%.  Analysis undertaken with colleagues in Europe examined 150 future visions of the full European electricity system.  We have found that, while demand for natural gas will reduce slightly in Europe, it provides an important backbone for the reliable and secure delivery of electricity, both in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.</p> <p>  Indigenous natural gas production contributes to our energy security, but we do not know what the full implications will be of using indigenous gas, rather than imported gas or oil, from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective.  Using global average figures, we estimate the indirect greenhouse gas emissions from Ireland's gas imports, those associated with extraction and transportation, at approximately 1 million tonnes for 2017.  The comparable figure for oil is 2.7 million tonnes.  </p> <p>  Ireland has the potential to increase security of supply and produce clean renewable gas.  This will enhance our energy security and reduce emissions.  Colleagues in MaREI have demonstrated that this can meet strict new EU sustainability criteria when used for renewable transport.  The SEAI has also demonstrated that gas from animal manure, food waste and grass could provide up to one quarter of Ireland's gas needs, cutting emissions by 2 million tonnes and creating 3,000 permanent jobs.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, energy poverty is a significant issue in Ireland and across Europe.  Measures to address it will also address issues of security of supply and reduce Ireland's reliance on imported fossil fuels.  The gas demand of a typical Irish home, built in 2005 with a gas boiler, will reduce by one half if thermally insulated and upgraded to today's A-rated standard.  </p> <p>  MaREI's analysis of Ireland's energy security shows that, while its energy security was decreasing prior to 2017, it was primarily due to a decrease in the security of supply of imported fuels.  Most imported fuels come from the United Kingdom, but it is increasingly importing more oil and gas and the security of our primary energy supply has been declining.  Ireland's infrastructural and demand security is increasing, but this has not been sufficient to offset the decrease in fuel supply and security.  Looking ahead, diversification of fuel types and fuel suppliers and increasing the production of renewable energy will increase Ireland's energy security.  MaREI's analysis of future low carbon scenarios shows an increasing trend in energy security as energy efficiency and indigenous renewable energy production grows over time, thereby reducing our dependency on imported energy.</p> <p>  MaREI produced Ireland's first low carbon energy roadmap in 2013.  It initially focused on the challenges in meeting an 80% reduction and then a 95% reduction in CO2 relative to levels in 1990.  This analysis informed decisions as climate action legislation passed through its different stages.  MaREI also recently looked at emissions reductions scenarios that go well beyond the current national ambition of an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions.  The paper is attached as an appendix to our official submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Barry McMullin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#C00300"><p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on this important topic.  As I have made a written submission, I will just try to pick out its key highlights.  I also express my personal appreciation for Professor Howarth's authoritative presentation.  I cannot compete with his expertise, on methane in particular.  I will briefly discuss the overall context of climate action, the general role of natural gas in the energy system and the specific question of the importation of liquefied natural gas.</p><p>The first questions are how urgent climate action is and what pathways are required to deal with it.  The best scientific understanding is that to hold the long-term global temperature rise to a specified level, the total cumulative release of carbon dioxide, in particular, must be capped.  Beyond that, we need to be at net-zero carbon dioxide emissions to stabilise the carbon dioxide concentration.  This means that there is a finite global CO<sub>2</sub>budget for further emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>.  The question then arises of who gets to emit it?  <br/><br/>In recent work at DCU, in collaboration with Trinity College Dublin, we have attempted to assess the equitable share of the remaining global carbon dioxide budget that is available to Ireland, aligned with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.  This yields a so-called national carbon dioxide quota.  We arrived at a prudent, minimally equitable, Paris Agreement-aligned national quota of just under 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide from 2015.  Given that we emit approximately 40 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per year, this gives us a period of about ten years.  In other words, our quota will be exhausted around the middle of the next decade, in 2024 or so.  Climate action consistent with this quota will require the achievement of cumulative net-zero carbon dioxide emissions from 2025 onwards.  This should be contrasted with even the most ambitious mitigation action envisaged in the 2019 climate action plan which targets net-zero carbon dioxide emissions no earlier than 2050 and possibly significantly later.  The large discrepancy between these measures of the urgency of climate action may be accounted for by a variety of factors which I mention in my written submission.  While there is scope for some debate over exactly how severe the challenge is, it is clear that for relatively wealthy nations with high <i>per capita</i>CO<sub>2</sub>emissions such as Ireland, net-zero annual CO<sub>2</sub>emissions must be achieved much earlier than 2050 if the temperature and equity objectives of the Paris Agreement are to be respected.  Therefore, the talk of 2050 as being the timescale we have available is not compatible with the objectives to which we have signed up in the Paris Agreement if we are to be equitable in delivering climate actions.<br/><br/>Natural gas plays a central role in the energy system.  It is frequently asserted that natural gas has significantly lower CO<sub>2</sub>emissions intensity than other fossil fuels and that it can, therefore, usefully function as a &quot;bridge&quot; or &quot;transitional&quot; fuel in overall energy system decarbonisation.  In the case of Ireland, it has been argued on this basis that, even under plans for deep decarbonisation, natural gas can and should continue to be used at significant scale, at least until 2050 and perhaps beyond, and that, even with the most rapid possible roll-out of wind and solar electricity generation capacity, natural gas will still be &quot;essential&quot; as a &quot;fuel of last resort&quot; to cover periods when these intermittent sources of energy are not available.  However, there are two key difficulties with this approach.  First, it assumes a relatively late net-zero CO<sub>2</sub>emmissions date of 2050 or beyond which, as I have just mentioned, is not compatible with our collective goals.  Second, the assessment of lower CO<sub>2</sub>emissions intensity is strictly correct only at the point of combustion.  When the natural gas is burned, one gets more energy for a given amount of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions at that point.  If &quot;upstream&quot; emissions in extraction, processing and transport are accounted for, the value of a switch to natural gas is much more complex to assess.  As Professor Howarth has discussed, particularly in the case of fracking but also for natural gas generally, any release of methane contributes disproportionately to the climate impact over and above the carbon dioxide on combustion.  Given that such releases of methane are a specific attribute of natural gas use, in particular, a &quot;substitution&quot; of other fossil fuels by natural gas does not necessarily yield nearly the degree of climate mitigation that is claimed on the narrow basis of combustion emissions only.  Furthermore, carbon capture and storage, typically cited as a mechanism that would allow much longer term combustion of natural gas, only happen at the point of combustion.  They do nothing whatsoever to mitigate upstream emissions of methane or carbon dioxide.  As to whether the use of natural gas is &quot;essential&quot; to reliable electricity generation, even under conditions of large-scale deployment of wind and solar energy generation, there are, in fact, multiple technologically feasible alternatives, but it would require another full session to unpack them in detail.<br/><br/>Regarding LNG, the general case for natural gas as a transitional lower intensity fossil fuel is relatively weak, but in the specific case of liquefied natural gas, it is undermined by two further critical factors.  First, as Professor Howarth has mentioned, liquefaction and liquefied transport are in themselves energy intensive processes which require continuous refrigeration at minus162&deg;C, which reduces the net energy yield and thus generally increases the emissions intensity compared with conventional, purely gaseous supply chains.  This is true of conventional natural gas, as well as of fracked natural gas.  Second, it is widely understood, as we have heard, that the primary source of LNG for importation to Ireland is likely to be gas extracted by way of fracking.  There are very strong indications that such extraction is significantly more vulnerable to methane release than even conventional extraction.  Again, it must be emphasised that such upstream emissions cannot be mitigated in any way by downstream interventions such as carbon capture and storage.<br/><br/>Like all industrialised countries, Ireland faces an acute challenge in rapidly decarbonising its energy system.  Their scale and urgency are not widely appreciated and there are no simple or easy solutions.  It appears clear, however, that deployment and the potential lock-in of additional fossil fuel infrastructure of any sort will not help and will most likely hinder an effective response.  <br/><br/>I commend the joint committee on its careful and reflective deliberations.  I will be happy to elaborate further on any of the points raised.</p></speech>

We are very aware in County Leitrim that we live in a gas basin.  Our neighbours in County Fermanagh are again being subject to a licence application that may lead to fracking.</p> <p>  Prior to 2011, silent policy on fracking allowed the Government to avoid high level assessments of the cumulative impacts of exploiting shale gas.  Unfortunately, this is happening again with fracked gas imports.  The health of people who warned us about the harms of fracking in North America is at risk if we create a demand for fracked gas here.  From 2017 on, we knew that the United States planned to export its gas and take a 15% stake in the global LNG market.  It was talking about lending Europe its gas until we got over our fear of fracking.  Knowing this and seeing renewed interest in the Shannon LNG proposal, we became concerned and began engaging with people in counties Kerry and Clare.  President Juncker and President Trump announced a deal to bring what the latter called "freedom gas" to Europe in July 2018.</p> <p>  The public is becoming aware of this plan to import fracked gas into Ireland through the Shannon Estuary and Cork Harbour, mostly because of awareness-raising by environmental groups.  Anytime we alerted the Department to our concerns about fracked gas imports, we were told that the origin of the gas was a matter for the operators involved.  The Government would not acknowledge that the proposals to bring LNG into Ireland would introduce fracked gas into the energy mix here.  The planned Shannon LNG terminal alone has the capacity to satisfy half the current Irish demand for gas.</p> <p>  People are entitled to have a say in whether fracked gas is introduced into the energy mix.  This is acknowledged in the Lisbon treaty, in which we retained our right to determine choices between different energy sources.  No project can remain on the LNG list without the permission of the member state in which it is being constructed.  Last Friday we believe the Minister, Deputy Bruton, approved Shannon LNG's inclusion in the draft projects of common interest, PCI, list.  This decision sets the framework for developing consent.  The decision was taken without discussion of public policy on fracked gas in the Irish energy mix.  Major energy infrastructure needs public support.  To be successful, a project needs a social licence.  Prioritising trade over the climate through silent policy is not prudent and needs to be stopped.</p></speech>

In our eyes, having fracked gas in the energy mix is not acceptable owing to the climate and health issues associated with fracking.  LNG terminals are needed in order to import fracked gas into Europe from the USA on a massive scale.  We think the PCI approval process is really only motivated by the trade agreement between the United States and the European Union to flood Europe with US fracked gas over any climate consideration.</p><p>Project of common interest, PCI, status is effectively a declaration that it is in the national interest to plan, fund and permit the project.  Through our years of campaigning, we have maintained that we need proof that the project is genuinely in the national interest but that is still not forthcoming.  PCI status also means that the hands of the committee are tied and that we are locked into the fracked gas option before the committee can assess and choose from the best reasonable energy alternatives for the country.  This is neither legal nor right.  We have discovered that the European Commission only assesses gas projects under the three obligatory criteria of market integration, competition and security of supply.  However, by law it must also assess each gas project under a fourth criteria, namely, sustainability.  It is illegal not to so do.  The PCI regulation defines sustainability as &quot;the contribution of a project to reduce emissions ... taking into account expected changes in climatic conditions&quot;.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, seemed to accept he had knowledge of this in the D&aacute;il last Thursday evening when he stated: </p><blockquote>I have instructed my officials to ask the European Commission whether the implications of importing LNG, both conventionally and unconventionally extracted, into the European Union have been examined as to the sustainable, secure and competitive energy policy.  If not, we have asked that such an examination should be undertaken.</blockquote><p>Knowing this, how could he risk approving the project and it going on the PCI list, if that is what he did?  We still do not know exactly what was decided in Brussels last Friday because the decision-making is going on in secret, behind closed doors and with no public consultation or oversight.  The Agency for the Cooperation of European Regulators, ACER, the opinion of which the Commission must take on board, declared a few weeks ago that the European Commission was not properly considering the merits of the projects in terms of potential contribution to sustainability.<br/><br/>We are in a rules-based process.  It would be unacceptable to any right-minded person for the Government to endorse a contravention of EU laws to import US fracked gas into Europe.</p></speech>

There is a pattern of behaviour.  The Department did not give us the report we needed to do our work on the previous issue we discussed.  There was much discussion of members of the climate action committee being able to hold Departments to account, but if Departments are not making themselves available, we cannot do so.  In spite of the short notice for the meeting and the fact that, according to the Department, the officials with experience in this area are out of the country, there are many others in the Department who could have appeared to deal with this issue.  I do not accept that only a limited number of people in the Department, all of whom happen to be out of the country,  have a level of competency on the issue such that they could appear before the committee.  If the committee is to work, we need Departments to work with us.  There has been a pattern of that not happening recently.</p></speech>

I agree with colleagues that we need to get a departmental overview.  Insofar as we can, we must take the heat out of this debate and discuss it on the science of the matter.  It would be useful for the Minister to appear in light of these discussions to talk through the matter with the committee.</p> <p>  For me, there are two issues.  First, there is the issue of energy security.  It is well accepted, based on our decisions to date, that we do not like fracked gas.  We have banned it and there is almost unanimous support for that.  We recognise there is a problem with fracked gas.  From a climate change perspective, we recognise that emissions from fossil fuels are problematic and are causing a very significant change in our climate and that we need to address that.  There are targets in place in that regard.  I am taken by what Professor McMullin's comment that he would like us to go further than we have agreed or, in meeting the targets to which we have signed up, he would like us to go further than the Government has.  We will have to consider that.  As we head in that direction, however, we will still need gas.  Everybody recognises that.  The issue comes down to energy security.  We must be satisfied that we will have an appropriate energy mix, involving other sources as well as gas.  Even if we stick to our current trajectory and aim to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we must consider how the overall importation of gas from the existing interconnectors fits into the overall mix of energy we use.  Do we really need an LNG terminal on the west coast, whether it be fracked gas or other gas?  Consideration must be given to these issues.  The Department could advise us in that regard.  I suggest that any analysis be carried out independently.</p> <p>  I attended a briefing of the community in County Kerry.  Ms Walsh and several others who are present were also at the meeting.  Members are politicians who represent their communities and try to do right by them.  We have responsibilities in terms of climate change but we also have responsibilities in respect of the economic security of communities.  There is an historic dimension, which must be addressed.  I am sure Deputy Brassil will develop that point.  People bought into a particular project and, after 15 years of offering it very significant support and investment, they find that there is a very considerable lobby against it.  We must try to mollify that situation.  I am trying to do so by listening to the various experts.</p> <p>  It is clear that if one were starting today, one would not put an LNG terminal in that location or consider importing fracked gas at all.  It is the old story: we are not starting from today.  A company is in place, has invested a significant amount of money and has certain permissions and we must address that.  We must look at whether it makes sense to continue with that from an energy security point of view.  It all ultimately comes down to energy security.  I was interested by Dr. Deane's reference to potential insecurity based on a reduction in gas exploration in the North Sea, while recognising there are other interconnectors there.  I ask him to comment on that issue with regard to energy security.  He seems to have done a considerable amount of work on the matter.  I note the Celtic interconnector has received support to take electricity from France and there is potential for more gas to be harvested from the Corrib field without additional infrastructure.</p><p>Will Dr. Deane comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Deane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#F00200"><p>In essence, the question is whether we need LNG.  From the detailed modelling we have undertaken in UCC, it is not entirely obvious that LNG infrastructure will be required in Ireland.  We have modelled in detail supply interruptions coming from Russia and independently coming from Norway and north Africa.  The lights have remained on in Ireland in all our simulations, which points to the fact that LNG infrastructure may not be required within Ireland.</p> <p>  The Irish gas system is relatively secure and resilient.  It is worth bearing in mind that in the past four or five years, there has never been a supply interruption of gas coming into Ireland but there have been two supply interruptions on the electricity interconnectors - both Moyne and east-west.  We are very lucky to have a resilient gas infrastructure and the recent twinning of the gas pipes coming from Scotland to Ireland has increased that resilience even further.</p> <p>  What helps the lights to remain on in the event of a severe supply interruption from importing states are factors such as the existing LNG infrastructure in Europe.  There is abundant capacity for LNG in Europe, in Portugal, Spain and parts of France.  Traditionally, Europe has been good at moving gas from the east to the west but in recent years it has improved at moving it from the west to the east, accessing more liquid LNG markets.</p> <p>  Energy storage in the UK also plays an important role in providing resilience in Ireland.  Ireland has a long history of collaboration and gas-sharing with the UK that predates any of the impending Brexit issues.  In general, the Irish gas system appears to be very resilient in respect of a number of points of supply interruption.  As Professor McMullin mentioned, much of our gas is used to provide electricity, while the addition of the electricity interconnector between Ireland and France, which the Deputy mentioned, will further reduce Ireland's need for imported gas.</p></speech>

Is that supply of LNG also from the US or is it from the same sources?  I do not mean we should accept it by the back door, given there is an issue if something is built for the sake of it and there will be implications if we are left with it.  There is an adequate supply of gas available to meet Ireland's needs, although it comes through a different route.</p></speech>

It is stranded in Pennsylvania, which is why the company has gone to great lengths in its statements to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, to highlight exactly where the gas comes from.  In light of developments in Pennsylvania, where my organisation is involved with other organisations, grassroots groups and community members, and of the filing with the SEC, we know exactly where some of the gas comes from, such as Bradford County in Pennsylvania, because the company builds liquefaction plants on that end to export it.</p></speech>

The companies and the industry have not had a plan since the beginning, when the industry and practice were exempted from some of our most important public health and environmental laws.  We have fought that at a state and community level for the past 15 years.  There is a great deal of financial analysis of the industry and of how fracked gas is not a financially viable fuel.  Due to how the industry has been allowed to operate in the United States, it has fracked so much that it does not have enough vehicles to get that gas out, in Pennsylvania in particular, and consequently, this company in particular wants to build this terminal.  I am just speaking to the specifics of what is at hand, rather than to the entire fracked gas and energy industry, which would fill another meeting of the committee.  There are much better experts than me.</p></speech>

I suggest that when the committee invites representatives from the Department, it might also invite Gas Networks Ireland, EirGrid and possibly Professor John FitzGerald, who sat on the Irish Energy Research Council and is an independent assessor of our energy needs.  The majority of our guests are not in favour of the LNG facility.  For balance, I must point to some statements made by what I consider relevant bodies.  The Irish Academy of Engineering's report on the security of Ireland's gas supply of July 2018 stated:</p><blockquote>Relying on imported gas from Britain for all of Ireland&rsquo;s gas supply beyond 2030 is not advisable.  Alternative sources of supply and supply routes need to be developed.  Developing a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) import terminal in Ireland would enhance Ireland&rsquo;s security of gas supply and provide access to the increasingly competitive global LNG market. </blockquote> <p>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in its long-term resilience study conducted by Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid in 2018, stated:</p><blockquote>A sustainable, secure gas supply is crucial for the long-term competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s economy, and is integral to Government energy policy ... Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has the potential to offer a significant security of supply benefit as well as access to a diversified worldwide LNG market.</blockquote> <p>Finally, the Economic and Social Research Institute, in its liquefied natural gas storage valuation of March 2019, stated:</p><blockquote>The research shows that an Irish LNG facility would allow Irish consumers to benefit from highly competitive global LNG markets, thus bringing a reduction in their annual energy bill.  Ireland is currently partially dependent on the UK to meet its gas supplies.  However, this research shows that an Irish LNG facility can reduce this dependence. </blockquote> <p>Significant scientific evidence supports the provision of an LNG facility in this country.  I would like the committee to be offered such opinions in good time.  </p><p>Dr. Deane stated it is impossible to tell how many fracked gas molecules are imported from the UK, although there is an LNG facility there.  Whether that facility imports from Qatar, Australia or America, in time some fracked gas will be imported into the country.  He also stated energy will come from France through the development of a 700 MW interconnector, which will be predominantly produced by nuclear power.  There has been a ban on nuclear energy development in this country since 1999.  If the argument is that we should not accept fracked gas, should we also refuse to accept energy produced by nuclear power?</p><p>I am interested in that opinion.</p></speech>

It is hypocrisy but it is hypocrisy with which we have become comfortable in Europe and Ireland.  It is illegal to generate electricity by nuclear means in Ireland and yet we import it.

It is hypocritical but it is not anything new.</p></speech>

At an individual level, this might sound great for an individual project, but the issue is if there is no overriding policy to be implemented.  There are different actors and interest groups with different takes on matters but this must be assessed in a strategic manner.  That is why I return to the idea of the projects of common interest accreditation.  In this case, the planning permission has expired and when a new application is made for a floating storage regasification unit, FSRU, it would already be predetermined that it would be in the national interest if it is on the PCI list.</p></speech>

A planning application for the FSRU will be made as a project of common interest with all its consequences.  It will need a pipeline and must be put on the ten-year network development plan.  It must have access to infrastructure funds and may even have public funding in the end, and not just community funding, although that is yet to be determined.  It is setting the framework for future development consent.</p></speech>

I welcome all our witnesses.  As a starting point we must reduce our emissions and reach our targets under the international agreements we have.  We must keep the lights on, as somebody mentioned, but this must be done in a fair and just way.  As the debate evolves, we will have clashes such as this involving a project that local people might see as important to the economic sustainability of an area versus national policy on climate action.  We had a very good discussion earlier in the audiovisual room that was attended by some members of the local community and local Members.</p> <p>  When we look at projects like this we must consider their viability and whether they are viable to begin with in the context of how policy has evolved and is still evolving.  The views of people in local communities are clearly important as well.  I found the presentation and written submission from Professor McMullin very helpful.  He spoke about the general case for natural gas as a transitional lower intensity fossil fuel, which has already been shown as very weak.  He states that the specific case of LNG is undermined by two further critical factors.  The first is that liquefied transport is itself an energy intensive process, which reduces the net energy yield.  The second factor is that it is widely understood that the primary source of LNG for importation into Ireland is likely to be gas extracted by way of hydraulic fracturing, and there are strong indications that such extraction is significantly more vulnerable to methane release as opposed to conventional extraction.</p> <p>  This project first appeared on the scene in 2006 as a concept and planning was sought in 2008.  We have banned fracking in this State since that time for very obvious and justified reasons.  Given what Professor McMullin indicated in his written statement and what was said in the presentation, is the project viable?</p></speech>

Professor Howarth is the expert on the role of methane, particularly methane from natural gas extraction through fracking.  Since the project was mooted, the science and understanding of the role of methane in general has advanced considerably, which is a significant change.  The specific understanding of the emissions for fracking, as compared with conventional natural gas extraction, has advanced considerably over that period.  We have a much better understanding now than we had when the project was first mooted that the damage would be much more significant.</p> <p>  We have also seen the International Panel on Climate Change special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5&deg;C, which demonstrates that the risks of climate change and temperature rise are substantially greater than had previously been understood.  In particular, there is a risk of triggering tipping points in this complex global system.  I raise this because methane and carbon dioxide do not have exactly the same effects in the dynamics of climate change and global warming.  Carbon dioxide primarily dictates the long-term warming and methane in the next couple of decades will strongly affect peak warming, or the peak temperature we get to before we finally manage to stabilise temperatures.  That peak temperature is critical in terms of the risks of triggering these potentially irreversible feedback processes that will get out of human control entirely.  The methane issue will be brought very starkly into focus over the next two or three decades, so action on methane that is separate from carbon dioxide is critical.</p> <p>  In a meaningful and rational engagement with the urgency of our climate predicament, any project premised primarily on natural gas, but especially fracked natural gas, is definitely not viable from that perspective.  Could it be financially viable?  As long as these products-----</p></speech>

Anything could be financially viable but this is a private commercial project, first and foremost.  My question is, as a commercial private project, is it fighting against science and an evolving policy?  The policy here has changed since the project started in that we have banned fracking.  Is it possible there will be further policy changes?  As the witnesses implied, there is an urgent need to become less dependent on fossil fuels so we can reach emission reduction targets.  As a project that could span 30 years or even longer, is the viability of the project fighting science and an evolving policy?</p></speech>

There is financial competition and Irish consumers could access some of that liquidity, and not just by accessing the liquidity through the interconnector to the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  There is also the question of where it sits in the climate science debate.</p><p>The role of gas is still an open question.  As Professor McMullin stated, it is predicated on different technologies becoming commercially available and coming to market.  It is interesting to note that the UK, which is starting to legislate for a net zero society by 2050, foresees the role of natural gas reducing by only 33% in the period to 2050.  Natural gas will still play a primary role in energy supply but that is because of these technologies.</p></speech>

The consequences of climate change are coming into much sharper focus.  We are seeing more consequences of stronger storms, more fires, larger droughts and bigger floods.</p> <p>  Also, there was the COP 21 agreement in Paris in 2005 when the nations of the world finally agreed that we need to try to keep the increase in temperature on the planet well below 1.5&deg;C because of the possibility of climate thresholds and tipping points, and certainly well below 2&deg;C.  That is a new understanding by nations.  We are on a trajectory to break through that 1.5&deg;C ceiling in the timeframe of 15 to 20 years from now, in part driven by methane emissions from oil and gas development.</p> <p>  Regarding the shale gas side of it, as of 2006 there has been virtually no shale gas development anywhere in the world.  Half of the shale gas that has ever been produced has been produced in the past five or six years and our scientific understanding has also changed markedly over time.  In 2011, we published the first ever analysis of what methane emissions from shale gas might look like.  The analysis had to be a little speculative because there were few data on what was then a brand new technology.  There are now hundreds of papers on this area and we know those methane emissions are substantial.  The science is now dramatically different from when this project was first considered.</p></speech>

I will put my cards on the table.  I think this project is of a different time.  Unfortunately, I do not see it as viable.  I note there is a strong lobby and an understandably strong view within the local community and among those who live close to the Shannon Estuary who want to see this development.  What would the guests say to those communities which are obviously concerned about jobs and the economic importance of the landbank on the Shannon Estuary and the opportunities it provides?  People have waited a long time for development.  This, in their view, is the only show in town.  What advice would our guests give the local community and the local authority on the alternatives and what we would consider to be a just transition?</p></speech>

The general public did now know this was fracked gas but plenty of people did.  This should have been more transparent.  People should have understood that it was fracked gas.  An alternative project could have been found for that site by now, something that could have contributed to the community, which needs jobs.  People have been wasting that community's time.  When one sees the science, Professor Robert Howarth has not been talking about this.  We have been looking to Professor Howarth since 2011 when we started looking at fracking.  While this information may be new to us in Ireland, officials in the Department and those working in our universities should have been aware of it.</p></speech>

I am very sympathetic towards communities everywhere which are disrupted in this way.  However, one simply cannot underestimate the scale of new activity that will be necessary to reconstruct an energy system that does not depend on fossil fuels.  That is where the opportunities arise.  In the case of Ireland, the biggest single opportunity is sourcing offshore wind energy, but also making that wind energy available on a firm dispatchable basis, which means energy storage systems.  Long-term energy storage systems will critically revolve around the use of hydrogen, hydrogen storage, supply chains and processing around that.  Much work has been done on that area, on which Ireland can lead the world.  There is a great opportunity for communities all over Ireland to avail of it.</p></speech>

Professor Howarth mentioned that only have ten years of research and we are only learning about the impacts of methane.  It seems that everything we have learned about the impacts of methane is alarming, particularly that it has a far greater impact than carbon dioxide on global warming.  Professor Howarth stated that methane can be 100 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.  It makes up more than one third of the increase in watts per square meter in terms of global warming and the climate system responds more quickly to methane than carbon dioxide.  I ask Professor Howarth to address that.</p> <p>  Given that we have this new form of seemingly more dangerous energy being supplied into the market, is Professor Howarth concerned that it is acting as a accelerant in respect of climate change and global warming?  The requirement for ten year access to the network as part of planning permission for a project of common interest was mentioned.  Is it the understanding of our guests that if this project were to go ahead, we would be tied for a decade into continuing to use methane, a fuel whose impacts we have only known for a short period?  How could we exit from that requirement if the research and policy continue to evolve?  I have asked a scientific question and a related legal question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.68" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Robert Howarth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#H01400"><p>On the science question, I understand methane continues to evolve day by day.  From the first decade of this century, methane emissions were steady globally.  Methane concentrations in the atmosphere were steady.  However, over the past decade, methane emissions have been rising very rapidly.  Of course, we have had the warmest years ever in the history of human civilisation over this past decade and methane emissions are a definite contributor to that.  As for what is driving those methane increases over the past decade, as I stated, my research suggests that shale gas from the United States is responsible for one third of those global increases.  There are other things going on as well but as we in the United States understand that more, there will be a lot of pressure to decrease our reliance on shale gas.</p> <p>  The economics of shale gas have never worked.  It is a new industry and a new approach, which is built on huge debt.  No one in the United States has made any profit from selling this commodity over the past four or five years.  They are hoping to hold on in the hope that the price will eventually go up.  People, including people in Ireland, should think about what that means if they want to tie their fate to a source of gas in this country.</p> <p>  Here in New York State, our governor signed a law this summer committing us to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 40% within the next ten years.  We are committed to doing that and we believe we can do it with renewable energy.  If we in New York State can do it, I am sure the people of Ireland can do it.</p> <p>  I agree totally with my colleague that Ireland has potential to develop offshore wind and support that and the related energy storage which will be required to make renewables really work.  That is the way I would go.</p> <p>  I might also add that the United States has a limited history of exporting natural gas as liquefied natural gas.  This is new for us.  In fact, until a few years ago, it was illegal for the oil and gas industry in the United States to export gas because we were worried about our own energy security.  That has changed over the past four or five years.  We have a glut of gas on the market in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.  That is part of the reason that policy has changed.  As the shale gas revolution continues to fizzle out, we can expect the oversupply to diminish and I can imagine that the United States will again look out for its own energy security.</p><p>It is dangerous to assume that our country will continue to export LNG ten or 20 years into the future.  I would be very surprised if that were the case.</p></speech>

Based on what Ms Walsh said, I understand that our potential purchase of this LNG is a driver in the development of liquefication plants and a terminal in the United States.  It is different from the importation of mixed-source gas.  As I understand it, LNG terminals can only be used for LNG, so we are specifically prioritising and investing in the global liquefied national gas infrastructure.  That weakens anti-fracking campaigns both locally and globally.  I ask Professor McMullin to comment on this as well.

The state of Pennsylvania has been bought off by the oil and gas industry and, at this point, its politicians no longer answer to the pleas of their constituents but rather to this massive industry.  I am here to plead on behalf of those people and all others who are impacted by this.</p></speech>

We are using up all his time, which is precious but very useful.  I direct my first question to Dr. Deane from MaREI.  He claims that we do not know how much fracked gas we import, particularly from the UK.  However, on 1 October it was reported that fracking has now ended in the UK as the company that engaged in it ceased all activity after triggering a 2.9 magnitude earthquake near Blackpool.  We are, therefore, not currently importing fracked gas, unless it is lying in storage somewhere.  It will hopefully no longer come into Ireland in the future, which is good news.</p> <p>  There have been major campaigns across Britain to prevent shale gas being used, much like those in County Leitrim and the Shannon Estuary in Clare and Kerry.  If we were to import fracked gas from the US, despite the potential contradictions that may exist regarding the importation of nuclear power from France, all we would be doing is compounding one wrong with another.  We as a nation now have it within our power to stop this happening.  There is no need for it.  Does Dr. Deane agree?</p> <p>  I am interested in how his organisation has examined the carbon budget the Paris Agreement has imposed on us.  Has MaREI measured how that budget would be impacted if we were to import this liquefied natural fracked gas from North America?  Has MaREI calculated how much fracking itself would damage our emissions?</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Deane to also comment on the scientific facts Professors McMullin, Anderson, and Howarth have given us about gas not being a safe or acceptable transition fuel.  This is something we have not looked at.  Leaving fracking aside, gas as a transitional fuel has not been properly examined by this committee and we need to drill down into that - pardon the pun.  Dr. Deane also noted in his presentation that if we were to energetically, enthusiastically and correctly move to renewable fuels, approximately 28% of our electricity needs could be met by implementing the waste reduction referred to by the SEAI.  If we were to combine that with a massive investment in offshore wind energy, solar panels, and bog rehydration, in ten or 15 years, both our reliance on gas and the debate about energy security would look completely different.  If we were to do what we say we are going to do, the question of gas a transitional fuel to maintain energy security would have a completely different complexion.</p></speech>

I refer to UK fracked gas coming into Ireland.  The UK has imported a number of LNG shipments from the US in the past number of months, which get diluted in the general gas mix.  We import significant volumes of gas from the UK.  That is the point I was making.  I was not necessarily referring to indigenous UK fracked gas, but gas that comes into the UK via LNG.  It is worth noting that LNG imports from the US into the UK are small in comparison with imports from Qatar, Russia, and other countries.</p></speech>

Professor McMullin mentioned a carbon budget of approximately 400 million megatonnes of carbon dioxide.  We suggest about 440 megatonnes.  We have looked at a wide range of potential carbon budgets, ranging from 120 million megatonnes to 700 million megatonnes, which would mean reducing our emissions to zero within the next three to 15 years, depending on our level of ambition and transition speed.  However, some of those strict scenarios are infeasible and our current level of economic activity could not be maintained while achieving those emission reductions.</p> <p>  We do not examine emissions outside of our territorial emissions.  According to the UNFCCC, Ireland is only responsible for the emissions that occur within its territory.  Within our science, we do not assess emissions that come from outside Ireland.</p> <p>  I refer to gas as a transitional fuel.  Our research shows a number of clear pathways for the future, including those of low regret and least regret.  These would require massive energy efficiency, behavioural change and significant deployment of renewable and variable renewable resources.  It must be borne in mind that we are starting from a point where 5% of all our energy comes from wind, which is double the global average.  However, going from 5% to 80% or 90% in such a short a period would result in logistical issues and turnover challenges.  Ireland needs to massively increase the role of variable renewables, but doing that before 2050 will be very difficult.  That is where the role of gas as a transitional fuel comes in.  The gas itself must be linked to a technology such as hydrogen production, as Professor McMullin mentioned, which is what the UK is looking at for its 2050 strategy.  It seems unusual but it will use natural gas to produce hydrogen, break apart the natural gas molecules, use the hydrogen, and store the gas back in the ground.  This technology has not yet been commercially tested on a large scale, but neither has 100% deployment of widescale variable renewables.</p><p>In Ireland, a low-regrets or no-regrets policy will mean massive deployment of energy efficiency and variable renewables and greater interconnection.  That will get us so far.  It will probably get us to approximately 70%.  If we are to go beyond that, we have to examine some trickier choices.  For example, we will have to look at where we get the hydrogen from and how we provide back-up to ensure the electricity system is resilient and reliable on days when there is not enough weather over Norway.</p></speech>

I am not convinced when I hear it is not possible to implement these measures because of economic constraints.

Will they describe the climate mitigation impact of reducing methane emissions?  They have increased, but what would be the effect of bringing them right back down?  If all countries were to refuse to take fracked gas from the US, how much good would it do in terms of climate mitigation?  How quickly could this be done?</p></speech>

He will agree that both of those positions are contentious.  It would be good for the committee to try to explore the value judgments in respect of prudence and intergenerational justice, etc., that come into decision-making in this context.  The Deputy also asked about the potential impact of reducing methane emissions rapidly.  The big win from such a reduction would be that it would buy us more time.  Methane is faster acting, which means that an effective reduction in methane emissions in the short term would buy us some desperately needed time to do this complete reconstruction of our energy system.</p></speech>

Reduced methane emissions can slow the rate of global warming more quickly than reduced emissions of carbon dioxide, where there is a lag of several decades due to uptake and release by the oceans.  If we are serious about trying to minimise the risk of major thresholds in the climate system and irreversible runaway global warming, we need to try to keep increase well below 2&deg;C.  We do not have until 2050 to do that.  We need to start moving that way now.  It absolutely requires reducing methane emissions.  I do not buy the idea of natural gas as a bridge or transitional fuel at all.</p> <p>  On the question of whether we can move quickly enough on renewables, I think we must try to do so.  There are places on the earth where the grid is based more on renewables than non-renewables.  Scotland and Denmark are examples of places where this has been achieved.  I am sure Ireland can do likewise.  There are challenges, but as people of the world we must take those challenges on if the very devastating effects of climate change are to be avoided.</p></speech>

I would like to look at the amendment included in Dr. Deane's paper.  I refer to point 12 on the need to be more ambitious.  I think we all agree that rather than aiming for an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050, we need to be more ambitious.  Complete decarbonisation will be needed sooner than 2050.  There is political consensus from the Taoiseach down that if we are to adhere to the Paris Agreement, targets like the 80% target are now out of date.  Am I correct that Dr. Deane's paper assumes that if we are to be more ambitious to comply with the Paris Agreement, there will be no use of gas - certainly not in power generation - within two or three decades?  If gas is to be used, it will have to be accompanied by carbon capture and storage, CCS, capabilities.  The carbon dioxide that comes from the use of gas would be stored.  Is that a fair summary?</p></speech>

The role of natural gas as a fuel within our analysis to 2050 is predicated on technologies for capturing the carbon dioxide from the fuel and putting it back in the ground, either for the production of hydrogen or for the production of electricity.  I agree with what the Deputy said about the net zero target.  The European Commission is proposing a net zero target for 2050.  The UK is legislating for a net zero target for 2050.  I certainly think Ireland needs to head in that direction of travel.</p></speech>

I mention that as an example of how people are upping the ante in this regard.  I have referred to the application of CCS.  I understand a floating LNG terminal is now being considered.  The idea might be to attach it to a combined cycle gas plant.  I assume it would be argued that this would be CCS-compatible.  Is that a fair assumption?</p></speech>

According to our analysis, the need for LNG infrastructure in Ireland, from a security of supply perspective, is not entirely clear.  That could be coupled to multiple technologies.  For example, the UK will be looking to pipeline imports for the production of hydrogen in 2050.</p></speech>

In the absence of certain people, including officials from the Department, he is the closest thing I can get to someone against whom I might be able to argue.  I say that on the basis of some of the analysis he has done.  I agree with his analysis that this infrastructure is not needed.  I would like to debunk the alternative argument, which is that CCS can be used to mitigate some of the climate impacts of this infrastructure.  I understand that if such an approach is taken, an appropriate CCS facility will be near the landing point for the gas, or certainly near the power station.</p></speech>

Explorations are taking place.  For example, research that is taking place in Europe at the moment is looking at the piping and shipping of carbon dioxide to places like Norway, where it would be put into geological storage.  That option is being considered.</p></speech>

The grid cost associated with the terminal made it uneconomic.  I do not know whether this has been analysed.  Perhaps Professor Howarth might have an analysis he can present in this respect.  My understanding is that consideration is being given to the application of a new floating terminal, rather than a fixed LNG terminal.  I read in the newspapers that it is possible that the grid cost may not now apply.  I do not know how that could be the case.  I do not know whether the economics of the project depend on the Moffat interconnector being revised to operate as a reverse-flow terminal.  The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators said that the reverse-flow proposal shows no economic sense.</p><p>A cost-benefit analysis has not been presented to support that reverse-flow facility.  I am sorry if I am getting very technical but we should be careful in that regard.  People on all sides may believe that this is a sure-fire economic project but all my analysis over the years would indicate that it is dead in the water and does not make sense economically unless the grid cost is removed or the Moffat interconnector is changed in some way to make it viable.  Has the MaREI Centre carried out an analysis on that in its modelling of the interconnectors?</p></speech>

It is just more expensive.  It is not a great location for CCS but they could do it.  Second, as long as the price in the emissions trading system, ETS, remains low, which, relatively speaking, is still the case, the penalty for not following the ETS route, which is the only way of enforcing that penalty to make CCS happen in the current policy framework, it will not impact on them excessively.</p></speech>

I have four quick questions.  The first is to Ms Walsh.  She may know the answer from the situation in the US, but approximately how many full-time jobs would result from an LNG terminal being built?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julia Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#L01100"><p>I cannot answer off the top of my head.</p></speech>

It is more a political than a scientific question.  I read today that in the 1960s the United States - and the President of the United States - knew about climate change.  That is from reports that came through from the US.  The question is about the effect of lobbying, and money, and how that delays change and responses to issues.  What is the effect of that lobbying in the US in the context of LNG?  Is that lobbying transferable here, and in a European sense, in terms of the proposed terminal and how that can corrupt the entire system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Robert Howarth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#L01300"><p>Yes.  We have known that kind of change is real for a very long time.  There has been a massive effort on the part of the oil and gas industry lobbying and advertising in the United States to confuse the issue for the public and for policymakers.  That is a travesty.  The idea that natural gas is a bridge fuel is borne out of that disinformation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#L01400"><p>My next question is to Professor McMullin and Dr. Deane.  Can they justify how energy security squares with the Paris Agreement in terms of LNG and the way energy security works?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Barry McMullin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#L01500"><p>I would encourage the committee to consider having a session exclusively on energy security, which is a big topic.  We have shorter-term energy security - the sudden interruptions Dr. Deane spoke about earlier - but then there is the longer-term chronic insecurity, which, as a result of import dependence, this State has suffered since virtually its foundation.</p> <p>  By diversifying our supply routes, particularly for natural gas, which currently is a critical component in our energy system, LNG superficially offers a way of easing what is a worsening security of supply situation for us, particularly as the Corrib field becomes depleted.  That said, there is no long-term story in that regard.  The long-term story is all bad.  We must address our energy security situation.  Ireland is incredibly rich in non-carbon energy supply because of our access to the western seaboard, especially in the context of wind energy, but we have to crack the nut of very large-scale storage.  In terms of strategic research interest for Ireland, we have an overwhelming interest from both an economic and energy security point of view.  It is overwhelming that we would want to do that.</p></speech>

He has covered the supply side issue but what we talk about to a lesser extent is the demand side elements.  The cheapest form of energy is that which we do not use.  We need to refocus on energy efficiency and take a closer look at behaviour.  Using less energy can greatly enhance our energy security in times of crisis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Barry McMullin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#L01700"><p>Something that has not been mentioned here but I feel I have to mention is that any increase in our energy utilisation in our current situation will adversely affect our energy security exposure.  As a matter of current policy, we will significantly increase our energy use in the next ten years by the rapid expansion of the data centre industry in Ireland.  There are many good aspects to that sort of development but there has not been nearly enough discussion on the interaction of that with our worsening energy security situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#L01800"><p>My final question is to Mr. McElligott.  On PCI status, he mentioned that he had got what he thought was a positive response from the Minister last week; he should emphasise the word "thought".  Mr. McElligott is saying the Minister is willing to ask the people who did not do something about this if the project complies with the PCI regulation?  The question is about sustainability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McElligott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#L01900"><p>It is critical.  In my introduction I asked how the members intend to make decisions at a high level.  If we are stopping assessment of policies at a very high level, their hands are tied.  The different political parties are very close in terms of their interpretation.  They seem to accept that they have not assessed the sustainability issue.  There seems to be acceptance that at a European level they have not assessed the project.  I spoke to various people in the Directorate-General for Energy and they said they would assess it for the next PCI list.  The precautionary principle is very strong in the EU.  The members know there was a problem.  The Minister knows there was a problem, as do his officials.  Everybody knows we have not assessed emissions, which is critical.  When Mr. Mitchell and I were in Brussels in May, we spent about an hour discussing the methodology that would be used and the criteria for discussing these projects.  We deliberately asked the people we met if they intended to assess sustainability and they said, "Oh, but gas is good; it is the same for everybody".  We told them there was a difference between fracked gas and conventional gas.  They were very uncomfortable with that.  That is the reason ACER came out afterwards and said we did not engage in a proper assessment.</p> <p>  The European Commission is breaking the law.  The Irish know it is breaking the law but, at the moment, it is an Irish decision.  The decision for Ireland was to put it on to the PCI list then wash its hands.  It did a Pontius Pilate with it and said their hands were tied in Ireland.  The members have a duty to ask the Minister what gave him the authority to make a political decision on energy policy, which is really regulation.  He made a political decision.  As politicians, and a committee, the members must get him to answer that question.  They will ask us to pay big carbon taxes and encourage us to drive electric cars.  On a personal level, in north Kerry, where I am from, near where all those other people are from, we will be asked to do that and they will tell us they might power them with fracked shale gas from America.  What is the point?</p></speech>

The Minister or the European Commission will not solve it.  Only the European Court of Justice will solve it.</p></speech>

There is also a threat from Friends of the Irish Environment that if the Minister approves the strategic assessment without public consultation, they will go to court within three months.</p> <p>  The energy charter refers to stranded assets.  If a company puts a floating storage re-gasification unit on the estuary it has an expectation of making money for the next 50 years.  If we walk away leaving the asset stranded, the company will come after us for a loss of money.  Should there not be a money message on the whole plan?</p></speech>

If we have to wait on research, how do we continue to function as a society without electricity?  We have to reduce what we use and industry is working with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to reduce that, with some degree of success.  What do we do?  How do we back up what we require, even if we take all the actions that have been mentioned?  We will still need to generate a certain amount of energy.  How will we do that without fracked gas?</p> <p>  A battery storage facility is planned for Offaly, run by a local company which will be experimenting with flywheel technology.  How much capacity does that have to provide security for us in terms of storage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Deane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#M00300"><p>Ireland needs to pursue increased energy efficiency, massive deployment of renewal resources such as wind, solar and bioenergy.  Doing this will get us going on the direction of travel but reducing emissions in line with the Paris Aagreement will require looking at new technologies, such as with a breakthrough in energy storage to store massive amounts of energy or by replacing energy carriers with new fuel such as hydrogen.  Hydrogen can be generated from variable renewable electricity such as wind or solar as well as natural gas, by breaking the gas molecule.  Battery storage will play an important role in the future but the scale of the issue is often underestimated.  Storing enough energy for five days would require about half the world's global battery capacity in Ireland right now.  The scale is daunting but it should not deter us from pursuing renewable energy, indigenous resources and energy efficiency</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Barry McMullin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019100900002#M00400"><p>Battery storage has a role but it is for the short term - maybe for less than one day.  To eliminate the need for natural gas as a backup to electricity generation we need to be able to shift from weeks to months.  There are three orders of magnitude and the scale required is a factor of 1,000.  The role for batteries is not the same as the role for long-term storage.  The only plausible routes are synthesising chemical fuels from electricity.  This means we generate renewable electricity from wind and solar when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining and we overbuild the capacity relative to instantaneous demand so that we can put the surplus into storage for when the wind does not blow etc.</p> <p>  I do not know if I am optimistic or aggressive but given the challenge and the urgency, we have to press ahead.  The natural gas route, including fracked gas, is too short so we have to proceed with all possible speed.  The basic technologies for producing hydrogen from electricity are well proven, well known and well established but the technologies for storing hydrogen at progressively larger scales, while the basic research is well developed, require pilot deployments before full-scale deployments.  Medium-scale to large-scale hydrogen synthesis facilities are already being built in northern Germany.  This could be rolled out in the next decade but it requires a policy imperative and we need to say it is a national priority.  It will involve projects of common interest and critical national importance and we should look in particular at chemical storage, particularly if we continue to say "No" to nuclear deployment.  Carbon capture and storage, CCS, makes sense if we are willing to blinker ourselves to the upstream emissions on the basis that they are the responsibility of some other country, although it is expensive.  We are all living on the same planet, however, so there is no such thing as somewhere else - the upstream emissions go into our atmosphere.  CCS for fossil fuel mitigation is not a good story, in my view, though we will need it, largely because we are going so fast in the wrong direction and we will end up having to suck carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere.  CCS is a key enabling technology for that purpose although for continuing to burn fossil fuels it is not so positive.</p></speech>

What are the witnesses' views on that?  The Minister said the Government would not support a grant for Shannon LNG to connect to the European facility until a security of supplier review is conducted.  Do the witnesses have a view on that issue?</p></speech>

The argument is whether it can be turned around in five years, 15 years or 30 years.  We have to get down to that level of detail.  The urgency of climate action means we do not have 30 years.  Gas will continue to be used for a finite period of time as backup but we need to make it as short as possible.  The way to do that is to aggressively build out the alternative which in our case, excluding nuclear, is synthesis of chemical fuels.</p></speech>

However, Deputy Eamon Ryan said our current mitigation targets have lagged behind the science and need to be much more ambitious.  If the review is carried out against the current targets it will give the wrong answers.  The review will guide policy for ten, 15 or 20 years so that would be a very bad thing.  One has to put the horse in front of the cart.  We have to look at the level of ambition, then look at what the science is telling us and review energy security against that background.</p></speech>

If it is in the national interest, he must put funding into it.  That is why I go back to the idea that he made a decision without having all the evidence before him, which is very serious.</p></speech>

We are going to close Moneypoint, which burns coal to produce energy and is just up the road from the location at which the proposed LNG facility is to float.  I ask all the scientists here whether it makes sense to close a coal-burning depot and import LNG.  While Ms Walsh has made a good submission, she has not gone into detail on some of the human impact on communities.  I refer to the levels of cancer among children, etc.  That would be well worth hearing.  Before Mr. McElligott goes, was he ever offered money to pull back from his campaign against the LNG facility?</p></speech>

While it is a planning issue, that means An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the office of first instance.  Normally, an administrative decision is appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but a decision from the board can only be appealed through the courts, which is very difficult.  The last man standing in court at this time was Mr. Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment, which was offered &euro;1 million to pull the case from the High Court and stop that objection.  That was very serious.  Under European law and the Aarhus Convention, one is supposed to be able to appeal a decision in an administrative manner in a timely and reasonable way.  However, in Ireland, we have the concept of last man standing where one has to go to court.  In this case, he was offered the money from my knowledge.  It is out there in the media that &euro;1 million was offered to pull the case.</p></speech>

What was unusual in this circumstance was that it became public.  That is the serious point.  It is not the first time with these large energy projects.  We all suffered in Corrib.

For the record, I will submit to all members the compendium of scientific, medical and media findings prepared by Concerned Health Professionals of New York to demonstrate the risks and harms of fracking.  While Dr. Kathy Nolan was unable to attend, she would be happy to answer questions and set out the positions for social responsibility.  Right now, the compendium contains more than 1,500 reports and studies outlining the different risks and issues, including the health impacts we are seeing in Pennsylvania in heavily fracked areas where there are cancer clusters.  This includes 67 children in rural areas of Pennsylvania who developed cancer.  The area did not have anything like those numbers before.  Examples include Ewing sarcoma, which is a very rare form of bone cancer.  While there are only a couple of hundred cases of that cancer across the USA, there are quite a few in the counties where those children live.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, we are likely to see more and more of this.  One of the things we are grappling with in the USA is trying to get a sense of the number of people who have had to settle with these multibillion dollar companies in signing non-disclosure agreements under which they are not allowed to speak out publicly about the health and other impacts on their families.  This industry is shrouded in secrecy because what they are doing is egregious and violates human rights and the environment.  We are struggling to overcome that in the USA.  I will put the committee in touch with people and put some information on the committee.</p></speech>

The whole world must move away from all fossil fuels as quickly as possible.  Natural gas is simply not the good fuel the industry seeks to convince the world it is.  While carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas are lower than from coal, that is less true for LNG than it is for piped natural gas due to the huge energy needs of the gas liquefication process.  In addition to the CO2, however, we have significant methane emissions for which there is no reduction pathway.  It is a climate travesty to allow natural gas to be viewed as any part of an energy future beyond the next decade.  If one was allowing an LNG plant with the idea that one was going to completely phase it out within ten years, it might be logical.  However, one cannot consider having a time horizon longer than that.  I appreciate the chance to speak to the committee.  I wish I could be there in person and thank the committee for accommodating my needs.</p></speech>

I am also the head of the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention.  I am joined by Professor Philip Dodd, consultant psychiatrist, clinical professor and clinical adviser to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.</p> <p>  On behalf of Professor Dodd and myself, I thank the committee for the invitation to speak about the topic of youth mental health and suicide.  We have submitted a briefing paper in advance of the meeting that gives greater detail on my remarks in my opening statement.</p> <p>  I will outline the strategic context for suicide prevention.</p><p>Connecting for Life, Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide was launched in 2015 to run until 2020.  The strategy was developed in line with the best national and international evidence available for effective suicide and self-harm prevention strategies.  The strategy contains seven overarching goals and 69 targeted actions, each of which has a specific lead responsibility assigned to it.  Along with the HSE, 22 Government Departments or agencies have made commitments to deliver on actions assigned to them under the strategy and over 28 charities or NGOs are receiving funding to deliver on work that supports these actions.  While the NOSP carries lead responsibility for 16 of the 69 Connecting for Life actions, the role of the office also extends to driving the strategy, defining its milestones, monitoring its implementation and reporting progress across the multiple sectors and stakeholders.<br/><br/>The implementation of any strategy is a complex process.  As such, one of the roles of the NOSP is to provide real-time visibility of how lead agencies are advancing their work and initiatives, across all Connecting for Life actions.  In 2017, we developed a new monitoring system to track the implementation of Connecting for Life.  The system was informed by the best implementation literature available.  Monitoring dashboards are provided every quarter to the cross-sectoral steering group chaired by the Department of Health and are publically available online at<i></i>.  We also initiated in 2017 an independent interim strategy review in respect of Connecting for Life.  The review was published this year and has provided a rigorous top-down assessment of progress across each Connecting for Life goal.  The review has also made clear recommendations for the remainder of 2019, 2020, and beyond.  The interim strategy review is also available at Connecting for Life, Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide, was launched in 2015 to run until 2020.  The strategy was developed in line with the best national and international evidence available for effective suicide and self-harm prevention strategies.  The strategy contains seven overarching goals and 69 targeted actions, each of which has a specific lead responsibility assigned to it.  Along with the HSE, 22 Departments or agencies have made commitments to deliver on actions assigned to them under the strategy, and more than 28 charities or NGOs are receiving funding to deliver on work that supports these actions.  While the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, carries lead responsibility for 16 of the 69 Connecting for Life actions, the role of the office extends also to driving the strategy, defining its milestones, monitoring its implementation, and reporting progress across the multiple sectors and stakeholders.<br/><br/>The implementation of any strategy is a complex process.

The review has also made clear recommendations for the remainder of 2019, 2020, and beyond.  The interim strategy review is also available at .<br/><br/>Apart from the national strategy, 17 localised versions of Connecting for Life have been established nationally through the work of the NOSP team in collaboration with our operational colleagues in the HSE, the community healthcare organisation, CHO, chief officers and their teams, and the wider stakeholder group.  Oversight is provided by local implementation teams working to national frameworks supported by the national office of NOSP.  While each local version was developed over a different time period from 2015 to 2018, all are now in full implementation mode.<br/><br/>I turn to young people.  While Connecting for Life adopted a whole-population approach, special consideration was given to priority groups at the development stage.  These are groups that always require specialised or targeted initiatives because they are known to be particularly vulnerable to suicide or where evidence shows a potential greater risk of suicide.  The priority groups identified in our strategy include stated demographic cohorts such as young people.  In the context of today's meeting, I draw attention in particular to strategic goal 3 of Connecting for Life and the related objectives and actions under that goal.  The overarching aim here is to target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups, including young people.  The highlights of the initiatives related to young people and Connecting for Life actions are outlined in our submission document from page 8.<br/><br/>It is important to speak to our understanding of suicide and self-harm statistics among young people in Ireland as there are often mixed messages on this issue.  Suicide data in Ireland are provided by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and it is important to note that the only official decision as to whether someone has died by suicide is a legal decision made by a coroner, not a medical decision made by doctors or the HSE.  There are many caveats attached to the information provided by the CSO and a significant time delay in receiving information on, for example, late registered deaths.  Currently, we have full sets of data, which include late registered deaths, only up to 2014.  Nevertheless, looking at provisional data for the most recent year available, which is 2018, we know that the highest rate of suicide in Ireland per 100,000 of population was among 45 to 64 year olds.  Among males, the highest rate was among 55 to 64 year olds.  Among females, the highest rate tends to be within younger groups, currently among 15 to 24 year olds.<br/><br/>Given that our European counterparts use varying systems to collect and report suicide data, it is not always advisable to compare countries on a like-for-like basis.  That said, our best understanding of how we compare with other countries comes from EUROSTAT.  The most recent comparisons from EUROSTAT show that in 2016, Ireland had the 11th lowest rate of suicide across 34 European countries among all age cohorts.  In 2015, Ireland had the ninth highest rate of suicide across 33 European countries for young people age 15 to 19.  This ranking has fluctuated widely in preceding years, from 12th lowest in 2014 to second highest in 2011.</p><p>Members can read further details of these statistics on page 14 of our submission but I would like to add that regardless of what the figures seem to indicate, we continue to be of the firm belief that co-ordinated, concerted, multi-sectoral approaches to suicide prevention must be in place across all sectors of society if a difference is to be made.</p><p> Data on self-harm presentations to emergency departments in Ireland is provided separately by the National Self-Harm Registry and the full data are in that.  My office provides funding to the NSRF.</p><p> It is important to note that recent studies show similar increases in England.  This coincided with the release of season two of the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" and the high profile death of a DJ.  They all had implications.  We respond to self-harm through our emergency departments and we have clinical programmes related to young people which are set out on page 8 of our submission.</p><p> In regard to investment in suicide prevention, there also remains noticeable financial-----</p></speech>

The ISPCC is delighted to be in a position to present to the committee on the topic of youth mental health.  As the national child protection charity, I would like to present the ISPCC&rsquo;s insight which arises from listening to, and working directly with, children and young people.  The ISPCC&rsquo;s Childline service operates 24 hours a day and answers more than 1,000 contacts every day from children and young people up to the age of 18.  A high proportion of these engagements come at night, often when other services are unavailable.  In 2019 to date, 19% of Childline engagements with girls have focused on mental health and anxiety compared to 10% of engagements with boys.  Children and young people who contact Childline discuss issues, including depression and sadness, self-harm, suicidal thoughts and bullying.  Our childhood support services have received 341 new referrals to date in 2019.  Of these referrals, 42% have related to children experiencing mental health difficulties.  Typically, these young people present with anxiety, difficulty coping, school refusal, being socially isolated and having very low self-esteem.</p> <p>  The ISPCC&rsquo;s childhood support service received a referral for a young boy who was experiencing anxiety and was at the point where he felt he could not leave the house, even to go to school.  The boy and his family had refused previous supports.  The ISPCC support worker worked with the boy and his family, giving them the chance to talk about their concerns as well as what steps they could take.  The family appreciated that they could complete sessions in their own house as they had felt overwhelmed at the thought of meeting professionals at their offices.  Over the course of the ISPCC&rsquo;s engagement with the family, they agreed to work with CAMHS also.  The boy is now making positive progress in that he will leave the house for short periods of time and is talking to his parents about his worries and feelings of anxiety.</p> <p>  Of the families who have completed work with the ISPCC childhood support service this year to date, 96% have reported improved knowledge and understanding of the issue and 77% have reported a change in behaviour.  The ISPCC is aware from evaluating these service outcomes that community-based, strengths-focused therapeutic work can have lasting positive impacts on young people.</p> <p>  Through our work with children and young people, we know mental health is a key concern for that cohort.  Children and young people have been hugely impacted by delays in access and lack of resources in mental health services in Ireland, at a time when waiting lists for mental health services in this country are at an all-time high.  Families are left with very few service options available to them.  In the first quarter of this year, 365 young people were waiting for more than 12 months for their first appointment with CAMHS.  As my colleague mentioned, the suicide rate among young people aged 15 to 19 in Ireland is the seventh highest among 33 European countries.</p> <p>  Ireland has a population of 4.75 million people, of which over a quarter is aged under 18 years.  Despite this, the voice of the child is often forgotten in the process of developing and evaluating services.</p><p>While the implementation of the Pathfinder project ought to help ensure children&rsquo;s voices are heard, progress has been slow in this regard.</p><p> There is an acute need for 24-7 child and adolescent mental health services across Ireland.  In its absence, children often feel they have nowhere to turn.  In serious cases involving attempted suicide or self-harm, parents are forced to bring children to accident and emergency departments, which is a wholly inappropriate setting for any child in distress.  It is essential that no child is admitted to an adult unit in future, even in the short term.  Timely and appropriate early intervention support should be available to all children and young people, regardless of where they live in the country, when mental health issues arise.  They should not have to wait to experience a crisis before they can access support.  It is imperative that waiting lists are reduced and recommended resources and staffing for CAMHS are ensured.</p></speech>

Mental Health Reform is Ireland&rsquo;s leading national coalition on mental health.  With over 75 member organisations, we work together to drive progressive reform of mental health services and supports in Ireland.  In partnership with our membership, many of which work in the area of child and youth mental health, including Jigsaw, SpunOut, the ISPCC, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, and Barnardos, we have consistently advocated for improvements in mental health services and supports for children and young people living in Ireland.</p> <p>  In recent years, Mental Health Reform sat on the national task force on youth mental health, developed evidence-based research and guidance on meeting the mental health support needs of children and young people in Ireland, actively campaigned on the need for investment in child and youth mental health services and supports, including with regard to budget 2020, and has delivered a dedicated campaign on the need for out-of-hours crisis services for children and young people in all communities across Ireland.</p> <p>  From the outset, it is important to acknowledge the progress that has been made in the provision of child and youth mental health services and supports.  This includes the expansion of Jigsaw youth mental health sites; the publication of CAMHS standard operating procedures, including a revised version; the development of digital technology mental health supports for children and young people; and the establishment of a mental health crisis text line.</p> <p>  Despite recent Government efforts, the reality is that significant challenges continue to exist for numerous families, children and young people who require mental health services and supports.  To start, there is no doubt that Ireland's child and adolescent mental health services are at breaking point.  Just over half of the required CAMHS staff are in post, which ultimately has a significant impact on access to and quality of services.  As of June 2019, there were almost 2,500 children on the waiting list for CAMHS, of which 10% were waiting more than a year to be seen.  There are ongoing practices of admitting children to acute adult services, with a total of 20% of all child admissions to adult inpatient units in 2018.  There continues to be a lack of out-of-hours crisis mental health services for children and young people, with many being unable to avail of such supports in their communities.  There are ongoing difficulties with the implementation of the CAMHS standard operating procedures, which seek to promote consistency and standardisation in services across the country, difficulties with transitions from child to adult mental health services, and continued gaps in mental health legislation, which fails to protect adequately the rights of children and young people when they go into hospital for mental health care and treatment.</p> <p>  This is further compounded by the continued absence of a national advocacy service for children and families engaged in mental health services, who may require support in having their voices heard.  Unmet mental health need is also evident in the lack of specialist mental health services to meet the needs of particular groups of individuals.  These include children with a mental health and intellectual disability, children with autism, children and young people from the deaf community, children with a dual diagnosis of addiction and a mental health difficulty, and children and young people in the care system.</p> <p>  There are significant shortfalls in supports outside of the specialist mental health services, including in primary care.  For example, there are more than 8,500 people on the waiting list for primary care psychology nationally, of which almost 25% are waiting more than a year to be seen.  It is important to recognise that the majority of individuals on this waiting list are under the age of 18 years.  In addition, there has been a lack of investment in enhancing the capacity and resources afforded to other primary care professionals to meet the mental health needs of children and young people adequately.</p> <p>  No doubt, there are myriad additional gaps in mental health service provision, including in perinatal and early years mental health supports, a lack of investment in community and voluntary organisations that provide essential mental health services to children and young people in communities throughout the country, a lack of focus in investment in prevention and early intervention, and of particular note, inadequate inter-agency collaboration.</p><p> Overall, there remain significant challenges to bring about the type of mental health supports for children and young people that fulfil national policy and international human rights obligations.  There are various measures that must be taken.  These include, to name a few, increased investment in child and youth mental health services; a national roll out of crisis out-of-hours services for children and young people; investment in primary care psychology; the implementation of the CAMHS standard operating procedures; the reform of Ireland&rsquo;s Mental Health Act 2001 to promote compliance with international human rights treaties, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; the establishment of a national independent advocacy service for children, young people and families engaged in mental health services; the implementation of a nationwide schools programme on mental health promotion and well-being; the establishment of a universal approach to responding to perinatal and infant mental health needs; and a greater focus and investment on the prevention of mental health difficulties.</p><p> The prevalence of mental health difficulties among children and young people in Ireland is significant.  Almost 20% of young people aged 19 to 24 years of age and 15% of children aged 11 to 13 years have had a mental health disorder.  In July 2019, a report published by Eurofound showed that young Irish women are suffering the highest levels of moderate to severe symptoms of depression among their EU counterparts.  Demand for services is increasing substantially with a 40% increase in referrals to CAMHS from 2011 to 2019.  The cost of mental health difficulties is enormous.  The figures suggest that this may amount to as much as 4% or more of GDP in some countries equating to approximately &euro;12.4 billion each year based on Irish figures.</p><p> To enhance mental health services and supports for children and young people effectively, a cross-departmental agency approach is essential.  This must be complemented by the required investment and resourcing from prevention and early intervention to specialist mental health services.  This includes the full implementation of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, including its recommendations pertaining to child and youth mental health.  Mental Health Reform's specific appeal to the committee today is that it takes on the fundamental need to improve the mental health outcomes of children and young people living in Ireland as an immediate priority in terms of parliamentary oversight.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karla Charles" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019100900002#H00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today and to be involved in what we hope will be the start of a fruitful dialogue where the voices of children in care will become a more prominent part of the ongoing discussion on youth mental health.  I am the policy manager in Empowering People in Care, EPIC.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Terry Dignan, CEO of EPIC.  We are delighted to see colleagues from across the sector here and would like to place on record our support for their work in this area.  For members who may not be familiar with our work, EPIC is the only independent voluntary organisation in Ireland that advocates with and on behalf of children and young people who are or have been in care.</p> <p>  EPIC acknowledges the progress that has been made since A Vision for Change, the recommendations of the national youth mental health task force report of 2017, and the excellent report entitled Someone to Care; the mental health needs of children and young people with experience of the care and youth justice systems.  It is widely accepted that significant challenges still exist in youth mental health, and one of the key priorities for mental health generally is the provision of additional appropriate supports for children and young people.  EPIC requests that recognition be given to children in care, and those with care experience, as a particularly vulnerable group in the sphere of youth mental health and that specific recommendations and a strategy be developed for children and young people in care and aftercare and with care experience within the youth mental health sector.</p> <p>  While there is a general absence of statistics on mental health outcomes for children in care and young people with care experience in Ireland, numerous studies carried out in the UK show that the outcomes for children in care, compared with their non-care counterparts, are stark.  Currently, half of all children in care in the UK meet the criteria for a possible mental health disorder compared with one in ten children in the general population.  The net result is as devastating as it is unsurprising.  Children in care, or who have been in care, are four times more likely to have a mental disorder than children in the general population.</p> <p>  An Irish study entitled Looked after children in Dublin and their mental health needs found that despite a higher prevalence of mental health difficulties among children in care, under 30% were attending CAMHS.  The low attendance rate at mental health services has been attributed to narrow CAMHS referral criteria; poor recognition by social workers; reluctance to pathologise children&rsquo;s behaviour, mobility and engagement difficulties; and general pessimism among social workers in accessing mental health services.</p><p>This is less surprising when we consider that children and young people who enter care do so because they have generally experienced trauma, often severe trauma, through neglect or abuse.  Being taken away from their family, regardless of the reasons for this, compounds this trauma for most children and, quite understandably, places them at greater risk of behaviour and mental health challenges and difficulties from early in their lives.  It must be acknowledged that there is an urgent need for every child entering the care system to have a mental health assessment and to be able to avail of support and intervention as and when they need it throughout their time in care and aftercare.<br/><br/>It is perhaps illustrative of why the mental health of children in care has been referred to as the silent crisis when we consider that children in care do not appear in the national youth mental health task force report of 2017.<b></b>We, therefore, call for a specific mental health strategy for children in care.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged by EPIC that over the past number of years, Tusla has made, and is continuing to make, improvements in the collation of data on children in care in Ireland.  However, we lag far behind the UK and other jurisdictions in this regard.  Ten years after the Ryan report recommended that a longitudinal study should be undertaken to follow young people who leave care and map their transition into adulthood, this work has still not been started.<br/><br/>Without such a study, benchmarked against the general population, we will continue to fall short in our understanding and, through this understanding, developing ways to optimise outcomes for children in care. <br/><br/>EPIC welcomes the committee's focus on youth mental health and would like to emphasise how often we see, through our work, the devastating social exclusion, discrimination, with both short and long-term consequences that the failure to address childhood mental illness brings.  The longer term economic and social costs of not addressing mental health issues among our children and young people, and particularly in our care population and care experienced young people, is a considerable drain on our system and our social capital.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  Vulnerable children and young people must be protected and given every opportunity to reach their full potential.<br/><br/>We have a number of recommendations to make to the committee.  More research is needed to collate data and on outcomes for children and young people in the care system generally, and mental health has to be a key focus within this.  Data on waiting times for children in care to first avail of mental health services, the regularity and variety of supports received and the overdue longitudinal study on children in care and leaving care must be collected.</p></speech>

More services need to be developed.  We need to take an holistic and multidisciplinary approach.  We must look at trauma support earlier, as soon as children are able to involve themselves in this.<br/><br/>The provision of both universal and targeted measures to promote positive mental health among children and young people in the care system must take place.<br/><br/>Children in care should receive a level of priority for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and adolescent community treatment schemes, ACTS.  There should be an opportunity for all children in care to have a dedicated service such as the Tusla national psychology service in special care, which should be open to all children in care.<br/><br/>We need more focus on behavioural issues because CAMHS will only work with a child if there is a diagnosed mental health issue.  We need to look at transfers from CAMHS to adult services, as has been mentioned.<br/><br/>We need to focus on advanced trauma informed training.  We wish to point out that no child in care should have to be placed out of state.  <br/><br/>Schools must be used more as a gateway to accessing and supporting children in care. We also stress the need for an independent advocacy that currently exists for adults admitted under the Mental Health Act.  The same provision should exist for children accessing mental health services.<br/><br/>Positive mental health is the cornerstone to positive lived experiences for children and youth.  Early intervention and prevention must be a priority in attaining this goal.  A root-and-branch review of CAMHS is now a priority.  Children in the care of the State are a particularly vulnerable group who need much more attention.<br/><br/>If time permits, I would like to read a quote from a young person in care who had direct experience of mental health services.  I acknowledge and thank the young person in question for sharing her experience with us.  She said:</p><blockquote>I did not have a good experience of CAMHS and anyone I talked to who had gone to CAMHS felt the same.  They just don&rsquo;t understand and the tactics they use just don&rsquo;t work.  They need to change how they work with children and young people, especially as it is the first interaction you have with therapeutic services, it would turn you off counselling in the future.  It is not child friendly - writing in their notebooks, all very daunting.<br /><br />The only way to get seen by the CAMHS service is to be a danger to yourself and even at that you have to wait three weeks before you get an appointment.  You have to be literally in intensive care to get an appointment with CAMHS. <br /><br />In relation to CAMHS and the care system, I felt they had no understanding of the care system, the terms, how the system works.  No understanding that a huge amount of young people in care experience attachment issues, they don&rsquo;t understand this and just see you as acting out and work on trying to fix you.<br /><br />The effect being in care has on children needs to be explained to children at a young age as they don&rsquo;t understand what they are going through and they compare themselves to their friends who have come from a stable home.  They need to be helped to understand at a young age why they are feeling the way they are feeling.  It is not a mental health illness, they just can&rsquo;t regulate their emotions because of attachment issues.</blockquote> <p>I thank the committee very much.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachael Treanor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019100900002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators on behalf of the NYCI and the national youth health programme for the invitation to speak about youth mental health.<br/><br/>The council is the representative body for 51 national voluntary youth work organisations working with young people in every community in the country.  We represent and support the interests of our member organisations and use our collective experience to act on issues that impact on young people.<br/><br/>The national youth health programme is a partnership between the council, the HSE and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with a vision for Ireland to be a country where all young people can experience positive health and well-being.<br/><br/>As outlined in our submission, youth mental health is a specialist area of work for the health programme, working in partnership with the HSE, the youth sector, education and training boards, ETB, youth officers and numerous children and young people&rsquo;s services committees, CYPSC, co-ordinators to facilitate training and aid in meeting the identified needs of young people.<br/><br/>The training programmes rolled out by national youth health programme include applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, MindOut 2.0, and the implementation of the health quality mark, HQM.  <br/><br/>I do not want to quote pages of statistics because, in our submission, we have outlined many of them.  However, I want to highlight some that illustrate what is affecting young people&rsquo;s mental health.  In 2015, the health programme conducted a rapid mental health needs assessment among youth work organisations to investigate the mental health needs of young people.  The main issues identified were anxiety, stress and body image.  <br/><br/>We have continued to work with the youth work sector to collect information on the mental health needs of young people.  It is evident that many of the issues identified in 2015 are still relevant.  However, additional issues and themes are emerging, which include the influence of social media; the influence and misuse of alcohol and drugs; societal expectations and pressures, including peer pressure; bullying; lack of skills, to include communication, resilience and self-awareness; and isolation and lack of support.<br/><br/>Young people are responding to these issues in a variety of ways.  One coping mechanism is<b></b>self-harm.  Self-harming is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue among young people, especially young girls.  Statistics are illustrating the increasing rates with one in every 132 young women aged 15 to 19 years presenting in hospitals with self-harming injuries.  Youth workers working with these young people who are self-harming are also working, or have worked, with those who are attempting, have contemplated, or have died by suicide.  <br/><br/>There is also evidence to suggest that media and entertainment industries are having an impact on young people in respect of self-harm.  Recently, numerous studies have been published examining the impact and trends of the Netflix series, &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;, on the incidence of self-harm.  These studies have found a correlation between an increase in the number of Google searches around suicide and also a 13% increase in suicides among 10 to 19 year olds.  This has helped influence the World Health Organization, WHO, in updating its media guidelines on suicide in 2017.  <br/><br/>Youth workers have stated that young people are presenting in youth organisations with extremely challenging behaviours.  They indicated that some young people, and some young men in particular, find it difficult to express their emotions.  The resulting frustration experienced by these young people can sometimes be expressed as anger and sometimes results in violent behaviour.  In some instances, workers believed that this anger is connected to drug use.<br/><br/>Within the youth work sector, the needs and issues which have been identified above are addressed through the delivery and implementation of the programmes that the health programme currently delivers.  Within our submission, we have outlined the different programmes that we run and they are all aligned to national policy and strategies.  However, continuous awareness and support are needed.</p><p>The youth council has a number of recommendations, which I will set out.  We recommend an increase in funding and resources for the youth work sector.  The 2016 census indicates that the number of young people aged between ten to 24 will have increased by 13.2% between 2015 and 2025 to just over 1 million.  This will make Ireland the only European country with a growing population.  With our growing youth population, investment in universal youth services is more important than ever.  However, this has not been recognised by the Government, with current investment still at 17% below the level of investment in 2008.  While overall Government expenditure has increased by 12% since 2011, youth work services funding has only increased by 0.3%.<br/><br/>The council recommends more accessible, youth friendly counselling services.  Youth workers have highlighted the challenges for young people trying to access services, including long waiting lists, lack of public transport and the appropriateness of the service for that young person, if that young person is even deemed suitable for a successful referral.  These issues are hugely challenging for young people, especially for those in crisis.  Some youth services have accessed funding to provide youth friendly counselling.  This funding should be increased to enable more youth services to provide counselling and therapy and to expand current service provision.<br/><br/>The council recommends support for young people to build their skill sets and confidence to cope, not only with their own mental health concerns, but also to support their peers, where appropriate.  For example, while ASIST training is available to youth workers and others working with young people and provides a framework to support someone with suicidal ideation, there is a gap in supporting the young person in building their own capacity to support their peers.  This support system could be developed either an online tool, or as a training programme, which could be accessed directly by them.<br/><br/>It is important also to investigate initiatives in other countries such as those New Zealand and Australia have in place.  One example is #ChatSafe, which is a young person's guide for communicating safely online about suicide.  This initiative would complement <i>SpunOut.ie</i>'s crisis line and texting services.  The initiative has been developed in partnership with young people to provide support for those who might be responding to suicide-related content posted by others or for those who require support in respect of their own experiences about suicidal thoughts, feeling or behaviours.  More training and information is needed to support those working with young people especially in dealing with challenging behaviours, self-harm, trauma informed practice and adverse childhood experiences.<br/><br/>I will conclude by reading a quote from a youth worker that illustrates the importance to young people of youth work, youth workers and the relationships involved:</p><blockquote>Youth Workers are often the first port of call when a young person is in crises, especially because of the relationship they have with the worker.  Youth Workers should not have to wing it when they find themselves in this situation.  Mental wellbeing with young people can be complex, but clear training as to how to respond, whether the issue is mild, moderate or very serious.  This will support the young person.</blockquote><p>I thank the committee.</p></speech>

As Ireland's youth information digital platform, run by young people for young people,<i>SpunOut.ie</i>meets the information needs of more than 150,000 young people each month.  <i>SpunOut.ie</i>is run by Community Creations CLG, which also operates the new Crisis Text Line digital active listening service.  Crisis Text Line is Ireland's first free 24-7 text service for anyone in crisis at any time.  It is a place to go if one is struggling to cope and in need of immediate help.  The Crisis Text Line platform connects texters with a volunteer who is most likely at home and who has been trained to listen, reassure and guide people from a hot moment to a cool calm.  Both services receive the majority of their funding from the HSE on an annual basis.<br/><br/>It is welcome that the committee has chosen to hold meetings on the important issue of youth mental health.  I hope our contribution can support this committee in its endeavours.  Given that time is limited and a number of colleagues from different organisations are present, I will focus on two of the 13 areas highlighted in our submission to the committee.  The first is Pathfinder, the youth mental health project, which is an initiative of the Civil Service management board.  Pathfinder aims to enhance the cross-departmental collaboration between the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs in the co-ordination of youth mental health policy, funding and accountability.  The Pathfinder report was finalised two years ago and approved by the Secretaries General of all three Departments for implementation.  The report recommends a number of transformative actions for youth mental health in Ireland, including the establishment of a team of dedicated officials from the three Departments on a time limited basis.<br/><br/>The creation of the Pathfinder team and the implementation of the report's recommendations was viewed by the members of the national task force on youth mental health as potentially transformative in addressing the crisis in youth mental health in Ireland.  The Ombudsman for Children is also enthusiastically supportive of the proposal.</p><p>While the Pathfinder proposal has the support of all three sponsoring Departments, it has yet to receive sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General to proceed almost two years after it was first proposed.  Every day the Pathfinder report gathers dust, we delay the opportunity to radically reform how we approach youth mental health in Ireland.  Pathfinder has the potential to demonstrate an effective model for cross-departmental co-operation and working, which could be replicated in other policy areas.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should resolve promptly the administrative issues holding the sponsoring Departments back from establishing the Pathfinder team.  This must happen without delay and, as lead Department for the project, the Department of Health must continue to drive this initiative forward with urgency.</p><p> The second issue we wish to highlight is primary care.  Prevention and early intervention should be at the heart of everything the State does when it comes to mental health care.  Almost three quarters of all serious mental health difficulties first emerge between the ages of 15 and 25.  It is, therefore, vital that properly-funded mental health interventions are available to young people in this age range to prevent problems from becoming acute, sometimes irreversibly so, and to promote recovery and long-term mental wellness.  There is significant demand for accessible early intervention services for young people that charities, NGOs and acute services simply cannot satisfy on current levels of investment.  We need to build a consensus on funding services that work and make the early, effective interventions that can have significant positive impacts on individuals and communities.  There is a wide acceptance, informed by the work of the WHO and others, that the overwhelming majority of mental health interventions should take place in primary care settings.  Any plan to improve mental health services must, therefore, have quicker, easier access to psychology in primary care at its core.  While the decision last year to appoint more than 100 new assistant psychologists posts is a welcome start, we encourage the Department and the HSE to engage with the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, to establish an evidence-based training programme for those recruited to ensure they make the contribution we want and need to primary care.</p><p> The apparent global shortage of mental health clinicians makes it more challenging than ever to attract the skilled professionals we need, especially for services in rural areas.  I point to our submission and the need to continue to expand the number of places in psychiatry, mental health nursing, clinical, counselling and education psychology to begin to address the skills shortage.  In addition, we encourage the committee to examine the need for mental health teams to regain autonomy over whom they hire into their teams.  While headcount can be managed or controlled centrally by the relevant business unit corporately in the HSE, HSE mental health services at local level must have a say in who joins their teams for a proper people strategy to take effect and to build effective teams.</p><p> I emphasise the excellent on-the-ground work carried out by the 13 current Jigsaw services, soon to be 15 with the expansion to Wicklow and Tipperary.  Extending the reach of Jigsaw to more parts of the country would be an extremely positive step for the future of Ireland's mental health.  The service meets an essential need for brief interventions and has a notable 98% satisfaction rating among those who have been able to access its services.  As the committee continues its work, I hope the need for more of these services is front and centre, especially given Jigsaw's unstated role in supporting the case management of young people with mental health difficulties in many areas of the country.  This role is pivotal to ensure there is a joined-up, responsive national service.  In fact, a no-wrong door approach is exactly what is needed to ensure young people get access to the help they need early, instead of having to undergo what can often be a very frustrating search for the right help at the right time.</p><p> As a former member of the task force on youth mental health, I encourage the full and speedy implementation of the Pathfinder report's recommendations, including an independent advocacy service for children and young people, legislative change to allow 16 and 17 year olds to consent to their own mental health treatment, and a ring-fenced fund with the HEA to provide resources to higher education institutions to help satisfy the ever-growing need for counselling support services in third level education.  Each of these recommendations, if fully implemented, would remove barriers to proper treatment and strongly enhance youth mental health provision in key areas.  I thank the Chair and committee and welcome questions from members.</p></speech>

I can read through the submissions in my own time.  My first question is for the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  I read in the office's 2018 report, which was provided to the committee three or four weeks ago, the suicide statistics from 2008 to 2018.  The highest figure was 579 in 2011 whereas the figure for 2018 was 352.  I am looking for information to educate myself.  Are there any studies showing why the number has reduced?  I spoke to the HSE last week and was told there are myriad reasons affecting suicide rates.</p><p>I was asked to direct my questions to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, as it is more expert in the area.  I would welcome some background information on where that is, why it fluctuates, what kind of data exist, what kind of research is there and what kind of intelligence is around that.<br/><br/>When I spoke to the HSE two weeks ago, I also spoke about my experience of shadowing the bridge patrol in Limerick, operated by the Limerick Suicide Watch, which was a learning experience for me.  Is there any co-ordinated communication between the office and the groups on the ground?  There was one intervention during the four hours I was there.  A couple of people the group spoke to were also feeling quite low within that period.  My intention is not to sensationalise that, it is just to say how it was on that evening.  There are evenings where there will be no interventions and then there may be a peak in activity.  Is there a formal communication process between the office and such groups to get feedback and to provide data?  I refer to what they are finding on the ground, what may help and any other parameters that might be included that would be helpful.<br/><br/>Reference was made to <i>SpunOut.ie</i>and the Pathfinder project.  That is something I am working on myself behind the scenes.  The last update I got is that there was a meeting on 19 July.  I think I sent the information to the NOSP.  I was advised that what has been suggested has never been done before.  We are trying to push it.  I want to see it done and I will seek an update.<br/><br/>I am not sure which of the witnesses to direct my next question to.  Where are we at in terms of stigma?  There was no mention of it in the contributions today.  That is no disrespect to the contributions: I am aware that the witnesses have only five minutes to get their points across.  I do not intend any disrespect to anyone, but it is incumbent on us to ensure that stigma does not go off the radar.  We should not stop talking about stigma.  What are the initiatives in that regard?<br/><br/>Ms Treanor spoke about the increase in self-harm among 15 to 19 year olds.  Is there research to indicate what is the major factor behind that increase in recent years?  Is it being driven solely by social media or is it a more complex issue?</p></speech>

That is very much reflective of international trends in suicide rates, which are directly related to periods of recession.  A direct impact is seen on restrictions in public services and personal income that significantly impacts on people's ability to maintain positive well-being.  That is very much reflective of research across the world.  In the UK, for example, suicide rates have just been published for 2018, which shows a small increase.  Many commentators, both within the research and clinical setting, feel they are directly related to fears around the impact of Brexit on the economy in the UK.</p> <p>  There was also a point about elevated levels of self-harm among young people between the ages of 15 to 19 years.  The NOSP funds the national suicide research foundation that is based in Cork.  We are lucky in Ireland to have a very important data source, which is the national self-harm register.  It is the only national register monitoring self-harm in the world.  In fact, its annual report is about to be published tomorrow.  It shows a 6% rise in self-harm rates in 2018.  There is a rise in self-harm rates across all of the age groups, but repeatedly in recent years there are elevated rates of self-harm in young people.  I think that possibly reflects the fact that we are seeing a rise in self-harm rates across many western European countries.  We are not necessarily different in Ireland to other countries.</p><p>We are probably seeing a change in prevalence rates of mental illness across western European countries.  A recent European survey comparing various European countries in rates of depressive illness showed that Ireland, unfortunately, was presenting with a particularly high level of depressive symptoms.  The reason is multifactorial; there are lots of different reasons.  When one looks at the detail of the self-harm rates, unfortunately, the involvement of street drugs in the 2018 rates is showing a significant increase, including cannabis and cocaine among young men.  They are taking overdoses of those street drugs that seem to be associated with a rise in self-harm in recent years.  Any discussion associated with the liberalisation of cannabis needs to take into account that in other countries where that has happened, there has been a significant impact on increasing the levels of self-harm rates.  In recent years in Ireland we are seeing an increased rate of self-harm associated with cannabis and cocaine use.</p></speech>

There are two riverside patrols in Limerick.  There is the Limerick Suicide Watch group and the Limerick Treaty Suicide Prevention group.  In our supporting documents I see we have 22 resource officers for suicide prevention.  Although we do not provide funding specifically to either of the groups in Limerick, there is a standing agreement that the voluntary patrols in Limerick city and county have reserved spaces for training on the applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, and safeTALK programmes.  We support them in training and also in identifying with them local contact numbers in the event of needing assistance.  Deputy Neville provided an example.  There was a reaction to that and there was a follow-up, which we support.</p> <p>  We have 17 local actions plans for our resource officers around the country.  The HSE has always been accused of having national strategies and launching and leaving them.  Connecting for Life is the only strategy in Europe that has an action plan and local area plans.  The demographics and needs in Limerick are a bit different from my own county in Donegal and different again to those in Dublin.  The groups link in locally.  We do not provide direct funding.  However, we provide training and support to the volunteers.  A third community crisis response team is based in west Limerick and it has plans to go national as well.</p></speech>

My question is whether there is a two-way feedback on what the groups see and the data they collect.  I do not mean to be so black and white about it because behind every statistic is a person.  Are the data the groups collect fed back to the NOSP?  Is there any formal communication process between the NOSP and the groups nationally in terms of the intelligence they are gathering on the ground every night?</p></speech>

The local resource officers in Limerick liaise with the groups and data and feedback is provided to us.  There is a local area implementation group as part of the Connecting for Life strategy.

We hope that we can perhaps send some signals out from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or elsewhere to the people who are expecting this proposal to happen in order to give them confidence that it will happen.  That is what I would like from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  With regard to stigma, there are two issues.  First, we have definitely seen an improvement in stigma reduction over the past five or six years thanks to all of the different campaigns that have happened.  In regard to young people in particular, we see a kind of confusion in terms of mental health literacy, for example, the difference between being anxious and suffering from anxiety and the ease with which people use those different terms.  Campaigns to improve mental health literacy would be hugely welcome to reduce stigma generally.  There is also the question of listening.  One of the other things many organisations have done to great effect is educate people on how to actually listen to others in an effective way.  We are a great country for asking "How are you?" but not necessarily always wanting to hear the answer.  Understanding how to listen effectively to friends and understanding that it is not necessary to fix a friend's problem if they open up with an issue is another aspect. </p> <p>  The first meeting took place last week of the group in the HSE to create a mental health promotion plan, which is a very welcome step.  It is the first time the health and well-being division on that side of the house, as distinct from any of the mental health divisions, is taking the lead on a mental health promotion plan specifically for the area of mental health, which I hope will also work to reduce stigma. </p></speech>

SeeChange would acknowledge that while we have seen progress in terms of public attitudes, the attitudes towards more severe and less common mental health difficulties, such as schizophrenia, psychosis and bipolar are still very much lagging behind.  We can see also from the National Disability Authority research on public attitudes to people with mental health difficulties that people are least comfortable working with someone with a mental health difficulty, living beside somebody with a mental health difficulty or sending their children to school with other children with mental health difficulties in comparison to any other disability group.  It is very important that we keep the spotlight on stigma reduction and ensuring we are adequately investing in that issue and not just talking about more common mental health difficulties.</p></speech>

They will talk about mental health with other people and will work with other people but will find a stigma within themselves in speaking about their own experience.</p></speech>

In that context, it is very important that people are supported through that process in employment, and that people with mental health difficulties are supported in acknowledging the experience they bring and their own experience brings, and supported in terms of issues around disclosure with their employers and colleagues.  Those supports need to be put in place for individuals, not just in the area of employment but in terms of housing and engaging with local authorities, schools and a whole range of sectors.</p><p>Until those supports are adequately in place, we will continue to have those issues.</p></speech>

This has come to the fore in many cases where advocates have worked with young people.  It obviously impacts on their mental health to reveal this fact they are trying to hold something that has such a significant impact on their lives and is close to themselves.  This plays out in their behaviour, in particular given the fact that half of all children in care in the UK meet the criteria for possible mental health disorders.  That shows the significance of where we are coming from with regard to this issue.</p> <p>  One of the things we and many people acknowledge is that the schools are a great gateway to reduce stigma.  There is a wide, captive audience, including those suffering from mental health issues, either themselves personally or within their families, and, therefore, we can really work through the school systems in supporting children and accessing those who may themselves be suffering from mental health difficulties or know somebody in their family who is. </p></speech>

I would also like to mention to Deputy Neville the Little Things campaign, which has been on national and local print media and national television.  We are now reviewing that because it has been going on for several years and we are looking to provide a more updated approach.</p> <p>  Stigma is such an important nut to crack in all of this and the fact we are discussing it here is important.  It is about working with organisations, working with the workforce and working with trauma-informed workforces to break down that stigma.  It is important to note the work of the Green Ribbon campaign but it needs to be reviewed in the context of identifying its positive outcomes and looking at other ways of dealing with these issues, in particular for those with long-term and enduring mental health problems.</p></speech>

Therefore, it is having an impact on them but they have no capacity and they have not developed those core competencies to have the resilience to make good decisions because everything is online.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention spoke about the death of the high profile DJ and the "13 Reasons Why" series.  This has an impact on young people because that is what they are living through.  If it is reported through the media with a sensational headline but without the facts underneath, that plays a role in influencing young people.  It is brilliant that the World Health Organization, WHO,  has developed guidelines in and around suicide, the media and development programmes but there is still a case to be made around media reporting.</p></speech>

We had positive news in July when the Department of Health sent draft legislation in that regard to the Mental Health Commission.  The hope is the commission will review it by Christmas and that it can then proceed.  The issue raised by the Senator is among those that will be addressed in full reform of the legislation.  We 100% support the need to reform it to ensure 16 and 17 year olds are presumed to have the capacity to consent and refuse admission and treatment in mental health inpatient units.  An array of other issues pertaining to young people attending hospital need to be addressed also.  Full reform of the legislation is an immediate priority if we are to ensure the rights of people, including the young, are adequately protected.</p></speech>

Recently, we heard about mental health issues affecting that community, with suicide rates six times higher than in wider society.  One of the delegates invited the committee to ask a meeting of Travellers anywhere in Ireland whether they had been affected by suicide.  He said nearly every Traveller would raise a hand.  Where there is an added layer of marginalisation, how best can the State support such a group and the most vulnerable?</p></speech>

The social determinants of health are important when discussing young people in the Traveller community.  The young people to whom we speak refer to the ability to live in stable accommodation that is serviced properly.  The No. 1 recommendation we would make - it is called for by young people in the Traveller community - is for local authorities to spend the budget available to them for Traveller accommodation.  There is little point in trying to address psychological issues with young people if the basic needs they require to live happy lives are not being met.</p> <p>  The new Crisis Text Line will be funded by the HSE.  We are working with Pavee Point as one of our first partner organisations.  We are piloting the service with young people from the Traveller community.  An important element was developing a training module for the people working in the service that showed them how to engage with young people from the Traveller community on their terms and in the ways in which they wanted to be engaged.</p><p>That has taken a significant amount of time, but it is important.  State and voluntary services should be trying to engage and understand how to provide services for young people, no matter from what priority group they come, and to design them in such a way as to make them engaging and welcoming for them.</p></speech>

Many years ago I worked for the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism and was involved a great deal with Travellers.  Many points similar to those that arose in dealing with a marginalised population like the Traveller community are appearing in my long-standing work with children in care.  It is when we hear directly from children in care that we learn how best to support them, how best they want to be supported and, therefore, how they will engage with services and supports appropriately.</p></speech>

Travellers are seen as a priority group, just like young people.  It reflects international statistics which show high rates of suicide within that community.  It is also important to note that we fund Traveller movements within the country.  However, I will reflect what my colleague stated, that it is an amalgamation of housing and health.</p> <p>  Having members of the Traveller community training themselves is also a target.  International research from Australia, Canada and the USA has shown that training indigenous peoples to provide assistance in cases of self-harm within their own communities has better outcomes than training provided by statutory organisations.  We hope to have a full report.  I will be able to provide the committee with the details after next week's committee meeting.</p></speech>

Obviously, it would involve working directly with the Traveller community.  Such a plan is long overdue.</p></speech>

The Cental Statistics Office does not gather specific data for any particular group, including the Traveller community, including levels of suicide.  On the other hand, we know through our network of HSE research officers in suicide prevention that if there is a cluster of suspected suicides in the Traveller community, for example, the local resource officer for suicide prevention, ROSP, will be in a position to link with local Traveller organisations and statutory agencies to ensure postvention services are put in place as soon as possible, including by fast-tracking affected individuals to mental health services.  This is taking place across the country in discreet but important, ways.  In addition, the ROSP is cautious in monitoring any local media exposure of suspected clusters of suicide.  We know of the concerns associated with inappropriate and sometimes inaccurate reporting of clusters.  Unfortunately, it can impact on vulnerable persons and lead to an increased rate of self-harm and suicide.</p></speech>

It is important that we intervene with the most appropriate service.  In the ISPCC we work with individuals and their families.  It is important to reach out to the extended family.  In many instances, we have a child and family support service in the home.  Since it is daunting for children to go to some of our locations throughout the country, we travel to their homes instead.  Immediately, they are in their own environment and feel supported and a little more confident.  Be it for good or, in some cases, bad, they have their family with them.</p><p>It will not just look at the provision of the most appropriate service because where it is delivered is also important.</p></speech>

We also need to acknowledge that there might be an unconscious bias.  It was embarrassing to sit at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community with no Traveller voice on our side of the room.  There is a job for all political parties to do in that regard.  Seeing oneself in public office and as a role model is important.  The racism we saw so publicly during the presidential election is felt every day by the Traveller community.  We need to acknowledge that there is outright racism.</p> <p>  Will the delegates expand briefly on the National Youth Council of Ireland's project and recommendations on chatsafe which is a guide for young people on communicating safely online about suicide?</p></speech>

It is an online tool for those who believe they need support because of suicidal ideation.  The National Youth Council of Ireland made a recommendation that something similar be developed for young people in Ireland to complement the text line.  The ISPCC phone service is great, but, as I said, young people are all online.  If there was an app on which they could receive credible and informed evidence-based information in order that it would not just come from a Google search, it would close a gap.</p></speech>

There is a fundamental need to develop and implement culturally sensitive mental health services.  It is the area that has received the least amount of attention in mental health service development and implementation, particularly in implementation of A Vision for Change.  Mental Health Reform, in collaboration with the Mental Health Commission, has produced guidelines on delivering culturally competent and aware mental health services.  They look at issues such as identifying communication and language needs, cultural bias and the needs of ethnic minority groups, including the Traveller community, in terms of family involvement and advocacy.  I urge committee members to look at the guidelines.  There is a fundamental need to implement them, as well as to invest in and resource them.</p> <p>  The Traveller community is one priority group, but there are a number of other particular groups of individuals, including children with autism, people with a dual diagnosis of addiction and mental health difficulties and children in the care system, who have received very little attention in mental health service development.  They require significant attention.  We will shortly see the publication of the revised mental health policy, in which I hope there will be a greater focus on particular groups of individuals.</p></speech>

We have approximately 100 chats a day on Childline online.  We also operate Childline text.  Traditionally, ours has been known as a telephone listening service.  We still listen to 1,000 children every day, but in recognition of the fact that children now operate online, we are also up and running online.  It is not a 24/7 service, but we hope to get there within the next 12 months.</p></speech>

I agree that we must be culturally sensitive and bring it into mainstream mental health services in order that it is not a parallel process.  The HSE has invested in nine posts to look at the issue of co-ordination.  The process is multifaceted and must be culturally sensitive and understand the needs of priority groups.  There is training associated with this and we hope to develop it further based on needs in local areas.</p></speech>

I am not sure what experience the delegates have of CAMHS, but I have experience of filling in a referral form and it was like doing a thesis in college.  I am torn when it comes to discussions about CAMHS because we need far more resources and bodies on the ground, but there is also a need for complete reform of how CAMHS deals with people.  Generally, it is the parent who fills in the form.  This means that we do not get the child's opinion in the first instance but the parent's opinion of him or her.  The vast majority of parents want the very best for their children, but they do not know their opinions.  The thing about mental health is we do not know what another person is going through.  It is extremely daunting.  For many, it is even difficult to consider in the first instance t hat their child may be struggling or having difficulty and then they are faced with a huge number of forms.  After filling them in, they might be invited to a drop-in clinic, which is totally unsuitable.</p> <p>  Perhaps it is different in various parts of the country, but this is not the right way to go about it.  People need to be able to speak to a human being to explain what they believe their children are going through.  Depending on the age of the child and whether there are additional needs, the children could speak.  I understand people will not enter a service immediately, but at least they should receive assistance in trying to access it.  I believe it was Ms Charles who made the point about having to have a diagnosis on paper before someone was seen in the first instance.  People do not ring CAMHS for information for the good of their health but because it is an important service at that time in their lives, but the way it has been designed is not user friendly.  My cynical view is that it was designed in order that people would give up.  It puts far more pressure on voluntary systems.  In Kilkenny, when people ask us for advice or recommendations, we tend to look towards the voluntary organisations in the area because we know that they will listen, that they are available and that people will not have to ring a number for the following two weeks wondering whether anyone will get back to them.  I would like to hear the opinions of the delegates on CAMHS.  When we speak about it, we generally talk about waiting lists and needing more resources, which are important.  I would like to hear the opinions of the delegates on reforming CAMHS, how their organisations are structured and run and how people access them in the first place.</p> <p>  My next question is about prevention.  We could do far more at a school-----</p></speech>

She touched on a number of pressure points in CAMHS.  It is important to contextualise with CAMHS with reference to the entire mental health service offering that should be available to young people.  As I said, the level of mental health difficulties among young people is rising.  Therefore, the numbers of referrals to our services at primary care and specialist levels have increased significantly.  If we review any of the statistics that capture our waiting lists, we will see that the numbers of referrals have shot up throughout the primary care and specialist areas.  As a result, young people are not accessing in a timely way the services available at primary care level.</p><p>CAMHS is designed based on the provision of the multidisciplinary team and the types of specialties available.  It is more appropriate for people presenting with more severe mental health problems.  The Deputy is correct that a significant amount of information is sought on the referral form and it can prove to be very daunting to fill it out, which is usually done with the GP.  That is because given the number of referrals being made, the triage process with every one of the 70 teams in the country is important, where they try to work out, based on the information provided, whether it is an urgent and emerging issue or a less urgent issue.  In some way, therefore, they are able to manage the referrals despite the daunting number of referrals.</p><p> The second version of the CAMHS standard operating procedure seeks to streamline the referral process and the referral form will be redesigned based on the new guidance document.  Until we deal with the myriad problems in CAMHS, however, including the adequate provision of services at primary care level, and until we confront the recruitment challenges in CAMHS throughout the country, there will, unfortunately, continue to be frustrations, difficulties and poor outcomes for children and young people throughout the country.  It will not happen until we try as a nation to challenge the problems.</p></speech>

The Deputy made a fair point about it.  Dr. Dodd mentioned streamlining the process, but forms nonetheless have to be filled out and copious information provided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Philip Dodd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019100900002#V00300"><p>In many parts of the country, waiting list initiatives take place in a reactive way.  The waiting lists are actively managed and I am familiar with a number of initiatives in various parts of the country whereby when waiting lists get significantly long, members of the CAMHS team will enhance the triage role and contact the GP or the family who filled out the form to get more information and determine whether the individual still presents in the way described.  Nothing in the system precludes CAMHS teams from contacting the referrer or the family to seek additional information, as takes place throughout the country, specifically in the context of waiting list initiatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019100900002#V00400"><p>There needs to be far more consistency in that regard.  As Dr. Dodd must be aware, the south east has severe difficulty with CAMHS and staff resigning due to not being able to cope with being unable to help the people waiting, and I would be shocked if what Dr. Dodd outlined happens there.  Even getting on the waiting list can be very difficult and a cohort of people will slip through the cracks.  If someone has a mental health difficulty, he or she may need someone else as a voice to get onto the waiting list.  It is not a matter of filling in all the forms and providing all the information.  It is more likely that a person in such a position would decide to leave it, not to bother doing it, and wonder whether anyone will even remember that he or she sought a referral.  In any event, often the reply will indicate that the person is considered more suited to psychological therapy, which is fine, but the service offered is a drop-in clinic.  While that differs throughout the country, a drop-in clinic, especially a group one, will not be suitable.  It relates to why people are struggling in the first instance.  It is rare that someone enters a drop-in clinic and starts talking about his or her difficulties.  Such a person is more likely to say, "I knew it.  No one is there to help me."</p></speech>

CAPA has been used in many CAMHS services in the UK.  It sets at its centre the booking visit, which uses a much less detailed referral form and to which there is rapid access.</p><p>The issues that are significant for the young person are discussed quickly and a waiting list to access various types of therapy from the team may well develop.  We are trying to establish three demonstration sites for the process in various parts of the country in order that we can demonstrate the effectiveness of the model within an Irish setting.  Unfortunately, for the demonstration sites that were selected in 2018, there were recruitment difficulties with backfilling staff to take on the work.  Nevertheless, we remain committed to improving the whole experience of the referral and the CAMHS intake.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke about the adult filling in the form, but where possible, it is better to speak to the young person and hear directly from him or her.  In the meantime, while we wait for an assessment and referral to take place, other interventions could be considered.  We could examine providing creative therapies that may even just help to bridge the time gap that exists.  I acknowledge there is a shortage of staff across the board and the issue is with trying to secure more funding and bodies in posts.  We need to consider the matter creatively and always bear in mind we need to keep the young person at the centre.</p></speech>

People have a range of difficulties, some which are severe.  So much could be done in respect of prevention, not least at school level.  A major issue I always raise is that the school system is far too academic and pressurised.  When kids join junior and senior infants, they tend to love school, but by the time they have finished, they cannot wait to leave.  While the work becomes more difficult, there is less and less free time.  Perhaps there could be a greater focus on mindfulness, meditation and the listening skills that were mentioned.</p> <p>  Fifteen years ago, I did voluntary work with the Samaritans, which provided an excellent course in listening.  It was the first training that volunteers had to do and it took approximately four weeks.  It is beneficial to one's entire life.  We were taught to listen without judging, which was difficult because one's first instinct is to say the problem can be solved.  Learning to sit and listen without judgment was invaluable.  I do not suggest that that level of training should be provided to children.  It would have to be age appropriate but we could do far more at primary level from the moment the child enters the school system.  It is not all about academics.  Being kind and being a good listener are important skills, but it is as though they do not matter because pupils have to get As or be top of the sports team.</p> <p>  I even have a difficulty with the idea of awarding a student of the week, although I understand why schools do it.  While schools will argue it means every child will get a chance, the child who is awarded it every May or June, for example, will realise he or she is awarded it every May or June, not September or October.  It bothers me.  We cannot get away from it because it is so widely discussed.  We are all guilty as parents of being proud of our kids, but it is expressed in so many ways, whether through the student of the week award, junior certificate results or parent-teacher meetings.  Years ago, people did not really talk about such matters and one would not have known the details, whereas now it is everywhere, including online, and one can access everything.  We are all aware of the pressure it puts on kids, and our guests are the experts and deal with it every day, but far more could be done in school in respect of prevention and early intervention.  We say all the time it is okay not to be okay, but do we mean that?  If a young person is struggling in school, it is not okay.  There needs to be a greater emphasis on the matter.</p> <p>  I do not know whether our guests have much interaction with the school completion programme and I accept that its activity throughout the country is hit and miss.  In my experience, it is fantastic.  Schools that are in the programme in my region have access to play therapy and counselling, and there is no waiting list.  It is based entirely on the needs of the child rather than requiring the parents to take a means test.  The parents' means are irrelevant.  It is about what the child needs at the time.  A number of other services are also provided.  If there was more play therapy and counselling, depending on what is age appropriate at primary and second level, there would be a far better outcome for many of the less complex difficulties, such as those relating to anxiety, coping mechanisms and building resistance.</p><p>The schools that participate in the school completion programme tend to have that early intervention, which stops it from becoming a major issue or at least gives children an idea of how to cope going forward.  A lot of it is about coping mechanisms and building resilience.</p></speech>

One of the interesting things to emerge from it was that young people involved in Youthreach ended up leaving school early because of difficulty with mental health issues and also difficulties with the curriculum and it not suiting their learning style.  It is a two-track thing.  The Deputy describes it really well.  The reforms to the junior cycle curriculum and those planned for the leaving certificate curriculum are really welcome in respect of trying to approach people's different learning styles in different ways.  However, as we have also seen in the youth justice system in particular, students leave school early because of the lack of vocational learning opportunities in our second level system.  They have to leave school and become an apprentice to access those types of opportunities.  Having those earlier and in the formal school setting would be really appropriate.</p> <p>  In addition to the new well-being curriculum, which is very exciting and a great opportunity to increase the type of learning the Deputy is talking about and introduce it earlier, we would endorse the recommendation of the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, IACP, for a pilot for a schools-based counselling programme.  One of the things young people tell us is that if they really needed help, they would seek it, which suggests that they are waiting until they get to a crisis before looking for support.  Having lower level brief interventions or basic psychology type services within school settings could help us to prevent young people from ever needing to access services such as primary care psychology or at the more acute end in terms of CAMHS.  We firmly believe we need to look at the education system.  I welcome the committee's examination of this topic because it is multifactorial.  As we heard when we discussed the issue of suicide, it is complex and it needs multiple initiatives to be able to address it.</p> <p>  We ran a campaign a couple of years ago called Listening is Helping.  It was based on the active listening tips of the Samaritans and aimed to educate children and young people on how to listen to others without trying to fix their problems.  Some of the resources we provided in schools were videos of pairs of friends, one of whom was the listener, showing how the listener demonstrated good listening skills.  It is about trying to educate our young people to be there for each other.  Peer support is a massive help where it is appropriate.</p></speech>

I wholeheartedly agree with her that there is a requirement for a greater focus on prevention and early intervention.  That needs to happen at the earliest stages possible, including at the perinatal stage.  The HSE has developed a model of care on perinatal mental health service provision.  It is important that we see that progress.  It should be a holistic approach so that we see things like public health nurses being trained to identify where there is a mental health need and able to refer appropriately.  Maternity staff should also be trained and able to refer into more specialist services where required.  Primary care psychology should be built up for families and young children.<br/><br/>On our early years programme, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs over the years has invested in area based childhood, ABC, programmes which support families, parents and young children.  Some of those programmes are highly effective in addressing mental health but the approach is <i>ad hoc</i>.  In some communities there is no focus on mental health or it is a small part of the programme.  We need to see a national focus on mental health in these programmes and appropriate investment and resourcing.<br/><br/>On education, I would echo Mr. Power's comments.  We  welcome the reforms to the curriculum and the introduction of components on well-being.  It is important that we ensure a strong focus on mental health within that.  It is necessary not just at post-primary level but also within primary schools.  We must ensure that we are not just presenting schools with guidelines or introducing a framework but that we are supporting our schools, teachers and administrative staff to be able to support children and young people.</p><p>There are initiatives in other jurisdictions.  For example, in London mental health advisers who are specifically dedicated to mental health are appointed through local authorities.  Their sole job is to support schools in identifying where the mental health needs lie and how to address them, and to frequently review them and respond to those needs.  They are the types of initiatives that we need to look at.</p></speech>

Prevention and early intervention have been mentioned so many times.  As my son tells me, "Dad, you need to take things upstream."  I welcome the statement of the Minister for Education and Skills that well-being will be part of the curriculum, just like history.  Under Connecting for Life, the Department of Health with the Department of Education and Skills has focused on implementing the well-being policy which aims to foster and promote well-being of children and younger people in all schools.  There is also the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  The HSE is supporting the ongoing implementation of the national anti-bullying action plan, which is so important if we look at an upstream level.  The junior cycle well-being programme has been implemented for three years of junior cycle as of 2019.  SafeTALK suicide prevention training has been rolled out in education centres as part of a pilot project providing SafeTALK to teachers.  Teachers tell us that sometimes they do not feel equipped with the knowledge and skills to provide that.  My colleagues in the HSE health and well-being section continue to train teachers in health promotion programmes such as Zippy's Friends and MindOut.  It is very important to bring that upstream and, as a parent and former psychiatric nurse working in CAMHS, I would welcome well-being as part of the curriculum.  I also highlight a need for a global well-being to take in both physical and mental health, social aspects, gender - all of those together.  We look forward to that.</p></speech>

As we are talking about early intervention, which is a must, we want to look at a requirement to focus on training.  I refer to training across the board, particularly in respect of children in care.  We are looking at supporting foster carers who do tremendous work but might be going through a difficult time and need extra support.  Social workers should have adequate training in terms of giving mental health support.  I would add to that the difficulty we currently have of a decreasing number of social workers.  The young people do not even have that key consistent figure in their lives to whom they can turn in difficult times.  As mentioned by others, there should be key designated people within schools who are trained and informed and to whom young people can go.  They should not be guidance counsellors and should not stand out as somebody the students are going to because they have a problem with their mental health.  We need to look at transition periods.  For children in care, they include leaving care and going into after-care, and becoming a parent.  Statistics show that the number of care leavers who become parents early in life is significant and this often creates trauma for them.  The death of a parent is another transition period.  All these factors contribute.  Significant resourcing and training are needed, as is investment in data and research, which needs to be encouraged.  We need to look creatively at big sister and big brother type programmes within the mental health context, for example, reaching out to people who have suffered from mental health problems in the past and may now be able to support a younger person.  We should look creatively at doing this within communities.  We would say the same for children in care.  We should try to get people who have been in care to speak to them, encourage them and act as role models.  As the Senator said, we need role models to speak out throughout society.</p></speech>

From the perspective of the ISPCC, I do not think anybody would disagree that education is very important.  Recently the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, spoke of having well-being as part of the junior cycle.</p><p>All these buzzwords like "well-being" and "resilience" are becoming part of our language.  In our experience, it is best to intervene or to tick the prevention box and get in early in primary school.  We run a small number of group resilience training activities.  We do not have enough funding to do more.  I was at one in Cork recently.  It was fantastic to see young children talking about these issues in a group situation.  It is vital to reach eight to 12 year olds.  I am unsure how many members of the committee remember the old health promotion videos in schools but they stopped me taking up smoking.  They ran back in 1975 and 1976.  When I saw those videos, I did not want to smoke.  We need to get into schools and start doing the equivalent with resilience.  That is what we are all about with Childline.  We listen to children but we do not direct them.  We help them to build resources around themselves.  Children nowadays are not as resilient as many were years ago.  We need to intervene early and help to teach them.</p></speech>

There is a MindOut programme in schools and another MindOut programme for outside schools.  The programme is about building the core competencies of young people so that when they transition from school into college or whatever field they follow, they have the skills that will support them.  Everyone is talking about schools but the youth work sector is also a major area where young people are involved.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has the remit of rolling out the MindOut programme in the youth sector.  The programme is slightly different in the youth sector because it is very much tailored to each young person's specific needs.  The young person will fill out a needs assessment and will be able to indicate what area needs work, whether it is behaviour that develops confidence or decision-making skills.  The programme is tailored to support each young person.  Youth work organisations are trained up on this.  From November onwards, schools completion officers will also be trained up and each programme will be tailored to the young person.</p> <p>  Another programme, FRIENDS, was introduced by Carlow Regional Youth Services.  It is the only programme that is cited by the World Health Organization as evidence-based for anxiety in children.  It is effective at all levels.  However, there is a capacity issue in rolling it out.  The service simply does not have sufficient capacity to roll out the programme.  Such programmes provide great support to young people from a young age.  The well-being guidelines will be great.  It is similar to the health quality mark whereas the school will have to take a holistic approach.  Those involved will not only do work on mental health.  They will look at the whole organisation to identify how they will create a more health-promoting environment.  That is what the youth work sector does.  Everything we do is about embedding health promotion.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs did a review of youth work funded projects to find out what was working and what was not working.  One finding of that process was that there are seven potent mechanisms.  The title may have changed since the review was done.  If a programme is seen to be developing a young person's communications skills, relationship skills or decision-making skills, it is considered to be highly effective.  That is what is needed in prevention.  If a young person can develop these core competencies, he or she will be quicker to deal with whatever comes his or her way.  There are programmes which address that but there are funding and capacity issues.</p></speech>

I also concur with Mr. Church on primary schools.  Do children start first year of secondary school at 11 or 12 years of age?  In any event, by the time children reach the teenage years, many of their core skills are very much developed.  Although they are still developing, the groundwork has been done.  Prevention and early intervention work should be done at primary level.</p><p> I wish to make two specific points on social media abuse and negative or difficult material online.  Have the organisations had interactions with social media firms?  Are they doing enough to help, for want of a better word, contribute or provide funding in the area to support mental health?  I have read several studies that came out in the UK.  God knows, we all know that Twitter is a negative space.  We question it to protect our own mental health sometimes in the positions we are in.  This is something that was touched on by one of our guests.  Does a teenager have the objectivity to recognise reality as it relates to Instagram?  It may seem that the world is perfect but people filter things.  It must be recognised that someone might have just had the biggest row in the world.  Yet, he or she looks in his or her element and it appears that life is perfect.  Teenagers do not have the objectivity or skills to know that the person may actually have had a bad day yesterday and will probably have a really crap day tomorrow.  Life is not as perfect as these people's clothes look or as their smiles or filters makes them look.  What can social media firms do?  What can we do policy-wise to counter that?  It is ever increasing.  We have to accept that being online is life for many young people now.  Do our guests have any thoughts in that regard which could be helpful for our report in terms of direction and policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Power" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019100900002#AA00200"><p>It is a timely question in light of all that is happening for young people online.  The interesting thing is that there is a limited evidence base.  There is emerging evidence but every new study with a questionable sample size makes headlines.  It is difficult to distil what is evidence and what is subjective commentary.  What we know from the good solid evidence base that what is emerging is that it is not necessarily social media but how we interact with it that is making the issue greater for children and young people.  There are two tracks to it.  The first is the way a person is engaging with social media.  If people are passively consuming content and not engaging with friends and individuals they know or having meaningful interactions, then it negatively impacts on their mental health.  Screen time is not necessarily a major indicator of poor well-being.  However, it is if a person is using a device from midnight to 3 a.m. and not getting a good night's sleep, which we know is crucial for mental health.</p> <p>  The emerging literature suggests that a certain young people are predisposed to being more vulnerable to things like, for example, being on certain platforms and lacking the perspective that not everyone's life is perfect.  Those young people would be more vulnerable eating disorders and things of that nature.  It is a question of understanding that as a factor for a certain cohort and trying to build the resilience for that cohort.</p></speech>

That is because it is like resilience.  Resilience is such a global concept in itself and it is not something we can give to children.  It is, rather, the result of multiple things, including interactions, programmes and interventions over the course of life.  I agree fully with Senator Noone that we need to start at a far younger age to build resilience at the pre-teen stage so that when young people get to that stage they are able to cope with it more readily.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about social media companies.  Generally, there are numerous initiatives and we are partnered with them on a couple of them.  We are a member of the global suicide and self-injury advisory committee for Facebook.  It is quite difficult because on Instagram, for example, young people will post content relating to self-harm.  We know that content could be triggering for others.  It could prompt others to engage in that behaviour if they are vulnerable to it themselves.  Where do we draw the line?  Someone may post something but may be in recovery and may be proud of his or her recovery, while another person might be posting something that is encouraging or promoting the activity.  It is quite difficult.  The policy line is quite severe in that area.  We are all grappling with it.  However, to speak to the larger point we cannot get the digital safety commissioner soon enough.  From our perspective these are policy decisions the platforms do not want to make.  They want to be told what it is, because from their perspective that is far more efficient.</p></speech>

From our perspective, an emerging issue with children and young people that is severely impacting their mental health as well is the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.  The definition of "harmful communications" must be expanded to include that, so the Garda is more readily equipped to respond in those circumstances.  It is particularly affecting younger men.  For whatever reason, images are being shared and then, essentially, they are being blackmailed.  It is causing huge anxiety for them.  We had two cases in the past week alone that we had to refer to the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.</p> <p>  In our opinion, the legislation is the silver bullet.  It means having a body we could go to that can both co-ordinate the education campaigns and also enforce take-down, which is a big thing for children and young people as well.</p></speech>

I would say we are all responsible for our behaviour and we develop culturally in ways whereby we act and interact with things differently.  However, social media firms are responsible, in a way, for how we interact with them, if Mr. Power knows what I mean.</p></speech>

I will intervene in the conversation at this point given that Mr. Power has raised this.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties yesterday called for amendments to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 specifically relating to what he mentioned, which is very timely this week.  When Mr. Power referred to images being shared, it sparked the memory of Dara Quigley, a lady who sadly took her own life - I believe it was last year - after images of her got into the public domain.  It highlights a very unfortunate inertia in the Department of Justice and Equality in such an important space.  The Department is responsible for this and it is not as if it is a bolt from the blue.  People have been talking about it for years and it has been debated in the Houses on several occasions, yet nothing is being done.  I want to put that forward because it would be inappropriate not to mention it.</p></speech>

First, this is an important issue to raise in the context of a mental health discussion, be it in respect of young people, children, adults or the general population.  The association of the use of cannabis with the subsequent development of mental health problems is well established.  I will not go into the technical aspects of the literature but a recent comprehensive publication aligned the use of cannabis with the subsequent development of psychosis, depression, self-harm and suicide.  That link is very strong so any discussion on the liberalisation of cannabis must be very much aware of the experience in other countries of the impact it has had on presentations.  In Ireland, after psychoactive substances that were available in head shops were restricted, a number of Irish research studies, including research from our national self-harm database, showed that the level of psychiatric admissions reduced.</p><p>The prevalence of relevant associated self-harm also dropped.  Society must always be aware of the unintended or intended consequences of the liberalisation of what are psychoactive substances.  In the same way, we know alcohol is associated with up to one third of self-harm presentations across our emergency departments.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I had lined up have been asked.  I will pose them in any event and our guests can shorten their replies or indicate that they have already answered.  First, I acknowledge the presence of Ms Kate Mitchell.  She was in Roscommon at a seminar I ran and she was excellent.  She was extremely impressive and had a good grasp of the situation.  Everybody who attended the seminar was highly impressed by her commitment and knowledge.  It was great to have her with us and I thank her.</p> <p>  I will turn briefly to the issue of care.  It is amazing that this country has very poor statistics in the context of young people who have been taken into care, which is very sad and traumatic.  We all know people who have been taken into care.  Statistics in England show that over 45%, perhaps up to 50%, of children taken into care go on to develop mental health issues.  There are approximately 6,500 children in care in this country at present.  There is one thing that greatly upsets me.  Obviously, many children are taken into care for good reasons, such as their safety or welfare.  It is not a criminality situation, yet young people who have been in care are over-represented in our criminal justice system.  Does any witness wish to comment on that?  I find it quite disturbing.</p> <p>  I do not doubt the goodwill of everybody in this room to make things better and to help people in extraordinary situations.  It is good that we are all talking about this more.  However, I often get the sense that we appear to always be lagging behind other countries.  We have so many reports and so much conversation.  I have been a Member of the House since 2016 and I have heard plenty of talk about mental health and what we can do but, with no disrespect to anybody here, there is a lack of real action.  One thing that is emerging from this meeting is the need to get back into schools, particularly in the context of dealing with schoolchildren at primary level.  We always say that we must move away from the past.  We have quite a shameful history in caring for children, but in the past, and it was not today or yesterday that I was in primary school, there were always road safety programmes, civics programmes, etc.  It is good for young people to discuss climate change - and we have to listen to what they are saying - but surely there should be a huge focus for young people on the damage caused by alcohol and drugs, which are in every corner of society.  They are as prevalent in the rural areas of Roscommon as they are in any part of the cities of Dublin, Cork or Galway.</p><p>Why can we not move<b></b>things on and make progress?  It may be said back to me that I am a legislator now and that I need to do it but I need to put that question out there.  We seem to be always talking about the issue, having reports prepared, and we are still very slow to move on.<br/><br/>I come from a county where on mental health, in three years, 2012, 2013 and 2014, &euro;17.5 million was returned by the HSE, unused, where we had people in desperate situations.  We have had situations where people have died in our hospitals because of incidents.  This is a fact, yet this money was returned.  Whose fault was that?  Why did it happen?  When one considers what families and communities have gone through in losing loved ones, whether they were young, parents or old, this does not matter.  The family effect is the same. To think that the money was granted and not used.  Why is that happening and why can things not be moved on?<br/><br/>I have a quotation from the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who said recently on mental health and about those who left care homes: &quot;We will make changes as we go along rather than simply wait until the review makes its recommendations.&quot;  That is what we need to adopt in this country.  Can I have a quick comment from the panel on this and I accept that some of this may have been answered before?</p></speech>

I do not know if the committee is aware but the Irish Penal Reform Trust completed a report on the correlations between care and justice.  There are a number of findings and suggestions within that report which I draw the committee's attention to and which I highly recommend.</p> <p>  One of the things we have all mentioned here today are early interventions and supports.  We need more data on children in care and have that longitudinal study done that has been long promised.  We need to have a mental health strategy specifically for children in care as part of the bigger mental health strategy or specifically for children in care.  We need training on mental health as regards children in care, including the trauma-informed training that many have mentioned.</p> <p>  Ms Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland, who was mentioned, is an impressive woman and speaks from the heart.  The point about making changes as we go along is valid, as any change in little steps is better than none.  While we are waiting for posts to be filled, strategies to be developed and Acts to be reformed, we should be taking those smaller steps and thinking creatively about how we can do that.</p></speech>

I am always very happy to take a visit to Roscommon.</p> <p>  On his first point on children in care, that is EPIC's expertise, and to draw attention more widely to the issue of mental health and the criminal justice system where we are seeing many people with mental health difficulties ending up in the criminal justice system, and more specifically in the prison system because they are not getting the appropriate mental health supports that they require.  There is certainly a complete lack of resources in the prison system in providing a range of mental health services and supports and in particular psychological services and supports.  One of our asks in our budget campaign for 2020 is that there would be adequate investment in mental health supports among the prison population and also towards developing our specialist forensic mental health services.  There are plans to develop a new forensic service, which is due to open in Portrane next year.  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact, however, that the European Committee on the Prevention of Torture has previously reported that even with that new facility, it will still not meet the demand.  We need to continue to look at that issue.</p> <p>  I will also address the Deputy's point about lagging behind or not fulfilling our own national standards and international obligations.</p><p>There are a range of issues related to that as to a lack of implementation of policy.  A prime example is our existing national mental health policy: A Vision for Change.  There were a number of reasons for that.  The group that was tasked with monitoring implementation was disbanded and there was not a costed implementation plan.  Going forward, we need to do much better.  With the revised policy, it is so important that we have an independent monitoring group, that the plan is costed, time-lined, and there is effective oversight of that.  </p><p> Another issue is a lack of coherence between our policy and legislation.  If one takes our current policy, which promotes the implementation of the recovery ethos in mental health services, on the other side, people do not even have a statutory right to a recovery plan in mental health legislation.  That clearly shows that lack of coherence.  If we are to be truly effective in improving our services and ensuring that we have a modern recovery-focused mental health system, that coherence must be there between policy and legislation.  In that context I would raise the urgent need for reform of the legislation.</p></speech>

In response to his frustration as to there being a lot of talk but where are we going, in our discussion today we should not lose focus on the root causes of mental health issues, especially in how they affect certain vulnerable communities.  The core of it is that mental health is a social justice issue.  The single most impactful factor in a person's holistic health is how much societal oppression and discrimination that person or group experiences.  This might be as regards young people in care, as the Deputy has described, or people who are experiencing socio-economic discrimination, racism, as already discussed, people who are LGBTI+, gender-based discrimination, or emotional, sexual or physical violence and neglect.  These are all social factors and root causes that we need to understand.  These lead to the traumatic brain-body responses that can cause significant mental health difficulties.  We should not forget about those root causes when we are talking about many of the symptoms and different issues we have discussed this morning.</p> <p>  As to the general point about action, I cannot overstress the point about the Pathfinder mental health initiative, for instance.  As we have discussed and based on that point that I have just made, mental health is cross-cutting.  It is not just the purview of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, or the Department of Health, it has as much to do with housing as with health.  We should establish this unit to be able to co-ordinate Government policy effectively across all Departments as suggested by the Pathfinder initiative and its proposed unit.  It has the support all of the Secretaries General from each of those three main sponsor Departments and the Ministers have signed off on it.  It is still, however, being looked into.  We need the urgency to establish that type of model of policy-making to be able to drive some of the changes that the Deputy would like to see in the question that he asked.</p></speech>

There is nobody on the witnesses side of the table who would disagree with anything he has said.  We all share frustration.  We constantly ask questions of Deputies, Ministers and committees like this one.  If they cannot answer the questions we are in real difficulty.</p> <p>  I am a year in this job now and one thing I am growing to learn - there is a Joint Committee on Justice and Equality next door talking about new legislation that is going through - is that as a country we are very slow to enact legislation that to the public's eye is absolutely obvious.  For the ISPCC there is nothing more obvious than passing the legislation that is being debated next door.  If we are looking for small things that can make a big difference, there does not appear to be any political wrangling around this.  All the political parties, in my observation, seem to agree that it is a motherhood and apple pie situation going on here.  The Digital Safety Commissioner, right now - probably within its own commission or within the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and giving it real teeth - would make a significant difference.</p><p>There is legislation in place, which is well worded.  Rather than engaging in too much wordsmithing, we should get the legislation through very quickly and get it out there.  Online safety is the child protection issue of our day.  The quicker we get this through, the better.</p></speech>

As he has rightly pointed out, we are all in agreement.  We just have to get it done.</p></speech>

The fundamental lesson from Connecting for Life was that there was a need for a robust implementation plan and a governance structure.  My office is responsible for driving it through.  It is very difficult when we have to deal with other Departments that may not see this is a priority.  The governance structure, through the cross-sectoral group chaired by the Department of Health, has informed decisions and enabled progress to be made with the implementation process.  I would advocate for that.<br/><br/>I refer to social media, which was mentioned by Senator Noone, as an example of the other actions that have been taken.  We have intervened with Facebook to ensure certain uploads are taken down, for example in the case of an individual who has posted his or her intention to make a suicide attempt.  Facebook has been very forthcoming in such cases.  Our information is that Facebook now has a mental health specialist with whom we can liaise directly.  Our research shows that the contagion effect has a negative effect on vulnerable members of the community, particularly vulnerable younger people.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of the committee to our Mind Monsters initiative, which we launched in 2018.  It was developed by experts and young people.  Young people are a fundamental part of it.  As part of the digital forum, we include little animated programmes about minding one's own mental health.  We are getting in on the digital conversation in a positive and preventative way.  We are engaged in a collective effort with our colleagues in ISPCC and <i>SpunOut.ie</i>.<br/><br/>I am not sure where the figure of &euro;17 million came from.  Is that just from County Roscommon?  Deputy Murphy must remember that the county is part of CHO 2, which includes counties Galway and Mayo.</p></speech>

Being the final speaker has given me a great opportunity to listen.  I want to pick up on a few points that kept coming up, before throwing a few other points into the conversation.  I will try to be as fast as I can.</p> <p>  We have heard about coping skills, funding and joined-up thinking, the many programmes and the 47 reports that have been produced.  I was lucky to be a member of the progressive Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, which was shut down.  Consensus was agreed and signed off by all parties.  There is agreement on the issues.  It gets difficult when it comes to trying to get legislation passed.</p> <p>  The television programme, "13 Reasons Why", has been mentioned.  When it was aired, people came to me because they were panicking.  I advised them to see what it was about first.  I listened to people afterwards.</p><p>We have to be more outspoken.  Some people thought it was very offensive, but my view was that it was very educational.  I have been saying this for years, since I first educated myself about these issues.  I have been a mental health advocate for many years.  We need to get this issue into primary schools.  We need to get back to civics.  I was told at a conference that this could not be done because talking about mental health and suicide would put thoughts into people's heads.  I said in the politest way possible that this was like saying that giving someone &euro;20 to put petrol or diesel into a car means that the person is going to crash the car.</p><p> We have to get out of the bubble we are in.  We are dealing with very different people nowadays.  It is very different and complex stuff.  Every time a person anywhere in the world buys a cup, a pen or a set of headphones, it comes with a set of instructions and a warning on the packaging.  The Internet does not come with instructions or a warning.  The younger generation has advanced very quickly.  Young people have moved on.  The Internet has made them slightly detached from reality.  This is where I go back to education again.  We are not giving our children the skills and the ability to cope with life's pressures as they come along.  It has to start at an early age.</p><p> We expect that our parents will die at some stage.  We are not going to like it, but we expect it to happen.  This means we need the skills to deal with it.  In the same way, people need the skills to deal with their sexuality or whatever the issue is.  People need the skills to deal with relationship challenges.  It goes on and on.  It is probable that the most recent one or two generations do not have those skills.  They have been lost.  We have to go back to the education system to restore them.  We have to resource it fully.  Education in the area of mental health is not being resourced.  It is being pushed along.  Pilot projects have been spoken about.  It has been suggested that the Samaritans will take this over, but they are not capable of doing so.</p><p> I am trying to build a picture here.  While everything is moving in the right direction, it is not joined up.  My biggest fear is that it is going to get lost.  If we are talking about looking at demographics, as Deputy Eugene Murphy suggested earlier, we will all have problems.  I recall that 69 young people took their lives in my local area between 2000 and 2002.  When I spoke about it, I was criticised on the basis that I was bringing the tone of the area down.  I found that disgusting.  It is a question of education.  How do all of the families affected feel?</p><p> Everyone who has come to me in the past two years, young and old, has said that even though they were being told that services were available and hearing the messages about minding their mental health that were being broadcast on television, they could not access the services they need.  A person who has a disability in addition to a mental health requirement certainly will not access any service in the country.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, about this.  We need to start picking demographic areas in the country or in the CHOs to be targeted with fully resourced pilot projects.</p><p> The most frustrating thing I hear within CAMHS is that there is a premier league of 74 teams.  One cannot have a premier league with 13 people on one team, nine people on another team, five people on next team and 22 people on yet another team.  It does not work.  Something has to be done in this regard.  If we do not get to the crux of this from the start, and if we cannot provide the best ingredients to make the proper cake, it will not work.</p><p> It is ironic that we are speaking about this issue the day before World Mental Health Day.  I will finish by asking two questions.  I thank the Chair for her patience.  In the honest opinion of the witnesses, are things going forward?  What is the one thing they would change today to get things done right?  We have had issues here.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2019 has been sitting in the Chamber for almost three years.  I am black and blue from trying to get it through the Chamber.  I cannot do so.</p><p> Reference has been made to preventative measures.  In July 2016, just after I was elected to this House, the first legislation I proposed was a simple Bill on the issue of suicide training and prevention.  It provides that everyone who takes up a public sector job must do the SafeTALK programme.  This would give people coping skills and spotting skills straight away.  The political will does not exist to progress this legislation.  These preventative measures are simple.  I hope the witnesses understand where I am coming from when I talk about being bounced back into it.  Are they happy with where we are now?  If they could change something today, what would it be?</p></speech>

Things have changed in a number of respects.  For example, there has been a substantial decrease in child admissions to adult units and investment in initiatives and services like Jigsaw, which provides valuable support to young people in the community.  However, it seems that we take one step forward but two steps back and I shall give a good example.  A national director for mental health was appointed and a national mental health division was established but the service was dissolved early last year and resulted in a gap in services.  There is a requirement for a director who has distinct leadership and oversight when it comes to the national mental health budget, planning, reporting and implementation.  The Mental Health Reform organisation has, since the dissolution of the office and post, consistently advocated for re-instatement.</p> <p>   I am sure that Members are well aware that there have been issues with releasing mental health development funding this year.  The fund amounts to &euro;55 million but only &euro;30 million has been released to date and this is October.  We need investment to sustain the existing levels of services.  We also need investment in new mental health services to develop the sorely needed supports, not just in specialist mental health services but in primary care, community and voluntary supports.  We also need a clear commitment.  To echo the comments made by Mr. Power, it is not just the business of the Department of Health to address these issues.  There needs to be a whole-of-government approach if we are to effectively improve the mental health outcomes of children and young people who live in Ireland.</p> <p>  Data and research are required.  At present there is no national mental health information system.  The child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, used to report and provide comprehensive details on who accessed its services and what happened in the services.  Unfortunately, the data is no longer provided.  If we are to effectively plan, deliver and implement services that meet the needs of children and young people then we need data and research.</p></speech>

I shall specifically answer the question on the broadcast of "13 Reasons Why" and the tension between the balance of freedom of expression and freedom of the press versus social responsibility.  It can be very difficult for us to understand the impact a careless description of an episode of self-harm can have on vulnerable individuals in creating a triggering experience.  The one benefit that we have in Ireland, and I have said three times so I have probably over-emphasised the fact, is that we do have good self-harm data.  As one will see from that data that will be published tomorrow, in May 2018 there was a surge in self-harm presentations at emergency departments across the country that coincided with the broadcasting of the Netflix series called "13 Reasons Why".</p></speech>

I believe that where there is an action there is always an instant reaction and I do not want to specifically dwell on the series.  Is it possible that children did not have the skills before watching the series to realise what was wrong with them but afterwards saw it as an outlet and an opportunity to cry for help?  Does Dr. Dodd understand my point?</p></speech>

Everybody knows what to do if they break a leg.</p><p>When a person feels confused, his or her heart and mind are not in the right place.  It takes a lot to hurt oneself.  A person may think he or she is abnormal and wonder why he or she is doing it.  Nobody else knows because he or she believes he or she is the only person in the world doing it.  Thankfully, that attitude is changing.  Yes, it is hard to strike a balance, but sometimes we must be brutally honest, which is why I have raised this matter.  I can see the clinical side, but education is key.  When Deputy Eugene Murphy and I were first elected, we were given a big box, as was the Chairman.  I went through everything that was in it and read all of the instructions, but there was no mention of common sense.  Therefore, we must strike a balance.</p></speech>

The counter argument to sensationalist or negative messages on suicide and self-harm is as follows.  We know that positive stories in literature about recovery have an impact in reducing levels of self-harm.  Therefore, it is not good to consider narrowly the prevalence of self-harm on a dashboard that indicates the impact of a message.  There is the so-called Papageno effect, by which means a prominent message of recovery has a positive impact on levels of presentation at hospitals.  One can argue that is a very blunt indicator.  However, when one argues for public messages and education programmes, personally, I argue more for a positive message of recovery, rather than sensationalising and giving detailed accounts of episodes of self-harm.  I get that there is tension between freedom of speech or freedom of the press and the importance of social responsibility.</p></speech>

I will restrict my answer to children in care.  </p> <p>  Deputy Eugene Murphy asked whether we were happy where we were.  From our perspective, as an organisation that works with children in care, we recognise that progress has been made, but the honest answer is "No".  As long as children in care are over-represented in the criminal justice system and homelessness and addiction services and as long as children in care become parents and have children who end up in care, we cannot say we are where we want to be.</p> <p>  Reference was made to Nicola Sturgeon.  She has ordered a review of the entire Scottish care system which we view as being further ahead than ours in terms of initiatives.  Ms Sturgeon sees herself as the corporate Mammy.  For children in care, all of whom do not have parents or a family to fall back on, we need a system that is child focused and centred.  Under the current system, for children who leave care to receive support or an aftercare service, they have to engage in continuing training or education.  Where children have had a fractured second level education, with multiple placements, it is very difficult for them to make a decision to move straight into third level education and training because there is no provision for them to take time out when they would be fully supported in considering what they want to do in their lives.  They are forced to make quick decisions when often they do not have the information required to choose what it is they want to do.  As long as these structures stay in place, we will end up continuing the cycle of having children in care being over-represented in all of the areas about which we have talked and they will potentially become the parents of children who will be placed in care because of their inability to look after them because of the ineffective support they will have received.  We are making incremental improvements, but until we review the system and make it focus on the child, rather than the structure that suits the State more than the child in care, we will continually face these problems.  If we could take the money that has been spent on inquiries into issues affecting children in care and put it into a review of the care system, it would be money very well spent.</p></speech>

Two weeks ago, we had an international congress on suicide prevention in Derry attended by 800 people from all over the world.  I am happy going forward that we are the only country that has a strategy and an implementation plan, which we reviewed mid-term, warts and all, from the top down.  We have to be honest about that and how we are progressing.  The way forward is the cross-sectoral aspect.  As I say at every public appearance I make, suicide prevention is not only a HSE responsibility.  It is a responsibility for all of us and we must work collectively.</p> <p>  I was very happy with presentations made by colleagues in my office on evaluation and monitoring.  We evaluate and monitor to see how we are getting on.  We have an active as opposed to passive strategy and an implementation plan.  Notwithstanding the negative view of the mental health services that is sometimes taken, the National Office of Suicide Prevention is viewed as an exemplar internationally.  It is important to recognise that.</p></speech>

This crosses every sector, including banking, housing and the general health service no more than mental health services.  It is difficult for us to cross all the sectors.  Deputies encounter barriers too.  When we raise an issue with a certain section, we may be told that responsibility lies with the Department of Justice and Equality and that Department, in turn, may tell us that responsibility lies with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In that sense, I can understand the frustration.</p> <p>  Mr. Meehan is correct that when things work, people should be praised and given credit for it.  We are not generally a society which likes to knock things.  Basically, it is about telling the truth.  When things are going well we should put our hands up and say they are going well but when things are going badly, we should put our hands up and say they are going badly.</p></speech>

Funding is a big issue, which was raised by a number of Deputies and Senators.  Like Deputy Buckley, I look forward to this afternoon and hearing the Minister give his overall view, particularly on mental health services.  The increase in the budget of the National Office of Suicide Prevention from &euro;5 million in 2012 to &euro;13 million in 2019 is positive for the future.  It will be reflected in the outcomes as we move forward with the implementation plan.  I must acknowledge the role of colleagues around this table and NGO partners, as well as public representatives because their voice reaches us.</p></speech>

As for whether we are on the right track, I think we are.  Listening to everybody on this side of the table speak of the recommendations for the future and the cross-party recognition that this is an issue, I believe we have to be on the right track and we must learn from that.</p> <p>  On the "13 Reasons Why" television programme, I agree with the point that education is very important.  Rather than educating children around reasons others may take this step, we need to educate children on how to cope, inform them of who to go to if they have a worry and point out to them who the one good adult in their life is.  If they cannot go to their mum, dad or youth worker, who can they go to?  It is a matter of showing children the way.  We can do that in primary schools but the biggest educator of children are parents in the home.</p><p>The unconditional love that that child feels is one of the key components of having a resilient child.  The second key area of being resilient is that the child knows that he or she can go to his or her parents or grandparents and talk to them if he or she has an issue.  The final key area is the fact that children will learn that they can cope, deal with adversities and can come out the other side.  That is where one has resilient children.  The language has changed in this country.  We are talking about coping capacity and about resilience.  We are on the right path but we have such a crisis now and that can be clearly seen in terms of the CAMHS waiting lists.  That has to change. We need a review of all the resources within CAMHS to see what disciplines are the worst hit so that we can get those children seen to.</p><p> Prevention is always better than cure.  Listening to children is the very first step and that is why Childline is there 24 hours and the crisis text line is there 24 hours.  We have to let our children know about these services and we will do our part to make sure children look at what support systems they have.</p></speech>

Looking at it from our perspective, we are frustrated with waiting lists and waiting times.  We have to represent our people.  People very close to me had to use these services.  The people they have dealt with have been outstanding - in fact, they have been their saviours.  I wanted to put that on the record.  However, we really need to sort out CAMHS.</p></speech>

It is not mandatory but if the witnesses would like to respond, they should feel free to jump in.  There are a few things on my mind, having listened to the witnesses this morning.  I am very conscious of the time.  We started at 10.15 a.m. and it is now almost 1 p.m. but we will finish very promptly.  Mr. Meehan mentioned the HSE is not solely responsible - of course, it is not.  We are all responsible.  In terms of promoting mental health awareness, there are so many things we have done and so many things we must do, including resilience and all the things that are patently obvious at this stage.  There is no doubt in my mind that children with anxiety need all the supports available to them at a young age because it is critical to support young children in primary school who suffer from anxiety, and it is an ever-growing trend.  I have read publications from most of the bodies represented today and it is a common theme throughout.  I refer to the peer pressure and bullying young children in primary and secondary schools face and the role social media firms play in not just policing what is on social media or doing it properly, which they do not, or being given directions, which they are not.</p> <p>  I will give an example.  I was not going to mention this, but I will do so.  I was away last weekend and I made a comment on Twitter which I do a lot.  Somebody inferred that I should be beheaded.  It was not because I was in an Islamic state but I presume that is why the idea popped into their head.  I very rarely do so, but I reported the tweet but it did not break the Twitter rules.  I did not mention that to make a headline or whatever but show the sheer stupidity of that.  The computer said "No".  Some eejit somewhere in the world decided that it was not appropriate to take something like that down.  It really got under my skin.  I was so annoyed and I asked myself: what if I was a teenager and it was sent by the guy who lives down the street from me?  Those pressures and that form of bullying are so prevalent in our society.  Nameless, faceless people believe it is okay to do this, but it is not.  That is why giving the Digital Safety Commissioner teeth and putting it into the BAI, or at least the code, would be an important step for us to take.</p> <p>  I am also aware of the work teachers, resource teachers and SNAs are doing in relation to young children.</p><p>I am also aware of the work that teachers, resource teachers, and SNAs are doing with regard to very young children.  I am not sure if the public is aware of them but things likes Braincalm are being used.  This is a very minor programme but it is really beneficial to children.  It calms them and allows one to work with them to get to them to a point at which they can talk about things and understand the impacts of the world around them.  When I took the Chair earlier, I heard Mr. Church says that 1,000 calls come into Childline every day.  That is just one NGO, I am sure there are thousands more.  In a country with a population of almost 5 million, it is very disturbing that 1,000 children are making such calls every day, and we only know about the ones who picked up the phone.  What percentage of the children who need help feel strong enough to pick up the phone?  Is it 5%, 10% or 50%?  I do not know.</p><p> To tie back into what the witnesses have said in response to Deputy Buckley's very relevant question, are we in the right place?  Are we going in the right direction?  The witnesses are the experts.  They are the people working in the field.  If they say we are heading in the right direction, I accept that.  I know there are problems.  Representatives of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, were here at the end of September.  Deputy Buckley and I were here for that meeting.  I know how important what they do is, but I also fully understand the need for us to understand why there are gaps, where they are, and what we can do to fill them.  The committee has three reports outstanding.  We will probably be publishing them before the Christmas break.  One of them is on the recruitment and retention of social workers and one will be on youth mental health.  The common theme is that we cannot get people into the positions to deliver the service.  The budget does not matter, as Deputy Catherine Murphy quite rightly pointed out.  One cannot spend the money because one cannot get the people to deliver the service.  Something has to give.  We have to figure out what it is.  We know what it is.  The question is whether we can afford it.</p><p> We have been here for the guts of three hours.  I thank the witnesses very much for their engagement with us on this subject.  The meeting is adjourned until 15 October, when the committee will meet in private session to finalise the report on child homelessness.</p></speech>

Nos. 902 and 904 relate to CervicalCheck and those who had smears carried out in private clinics being excluded from public colposcopy clinics.</p></speech>

When I became aware of this problem three or four months ago, I went to the Minister seeking the reversal of the CervicalCheck decision not to deal with patients who had sought private smear tests.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck sent letters to the public clinics stating that they should not deal with individuals who had been sent by their general practitioner to a private clinic, because the doctor was not getting the results of smear tests already and required to have the results fastracked, when the outcome was the need for the patient to go to a colposcopy clinic.  When the person went to the colposcopy clinic in Cork, they were given a letter stating that because they had got the results from a private clinic they would not fall under the remit of the colposcopy clinic.  They would have to have their smear done in a public clinic. </p> <p>  As a result of the constituent coming to me, I arranged for her GP to refer them to another clinic under the HSE.  That clinic did provide care for the individual but within two weeks of providing care for them, it appears that clinic also got a letter from CervicalCheck advising them not to take people who had had their smear in a private clinic and had been issued with the results.  The letters were circulated.</p></speech>

Ms Healy has provided us with all the correspondence.</p><p>I have spoken to Claire Healy a number of times.  She got this letter, on 22 July, stating that she was not entitled to be referred to a colposcopist because she went through CervicalCheck but she decided to get her smear done privately.  As a result, a letter was issued on 11 June by Dr. Lorraine Doherty, which stated that anyone who went and had smears done privately could not be dealt with.  In fairness to Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell of University Hospital Kerry, whom I compliment, she outlined to Claire in a response letter that the letter of 11 June from Dr. Doherty had made this decision - we have a copy of that here as well.  Subsequently, after a number of us raised issues with this, it was pointed out that there was a email from Mr. Liam Woods on 16 August changing this.  As the Senator stated beforehand, there were emails issued to more than just Kerry hospital.  This was across the board, as we know now.</p><p> What is deeply worrying is that we have a new director of CervicalCheck who was in here not so long ago and gave information here with which I need to join up the dots.  Ms Healy is saying in her letter to us that what was said in here is contrary to her experience.  Ms Healy is saying that there was a direction given by the witness, who was here at the time, on 1 June 2019 that she could not be part of CervicalCheck.  There was a bit of flurrying around the edges about the fact that screening is not diagnostics.  We all know screening is not diagnostic etc.  This is not about that.  This is about colposcopists and referral.  Ms Healy's slides showed that there was an issue that needed to be investigated.  Subsequently, after going to the colposcopist and eventually getting it done, it showed that she had a high-grade change which was just below cancerous and it was something to be very concerned about.  I have a serious concern here - Ms Healy had high-grade changes - given everything that has gone on in relation to CervicalCheck, that somebody could unilaterally send out a directive such as this.  There have obviously been more people affected than the two women we know about and have referred to.  Anyone who was in a similar situation would have got the same treatment based on the letter sent in June by Dr. Doherty.  I am also concerned, having read the transcript of her evidence to this committee, about the reasoning Dr. Doherty gave for this happening.  In fact, at this stage, I think we need to go back and ask again.  As a consequence of this episode, which raises deep concerns as regards how this happened and how unilaterally it could happen without the HSE at a higher level doing anything about it, and while I respect the fact that the issue has been subsequently dealt with, unless a couple of people - there could have been more - put this in a certain forum, it could have continued for a considerably longer period.</p><p> My concern relates to a number of matters.  The first is the evidence given by Dr. Lorraine Doherty and I think we must have her back in.  The second is how management in the HSE over CervicalCheck allowed this to happen.  Third, if one looks at what they stated in committee, what they publish on their website and what is actually happening, this is an example of that trail not being accurate.  We need to instill public confidence in all the screening programmes.  We need to instill public confidence in CervicalCheck.  How can we as a committee make sure that happens?  I believe we must ask Dr. Doherty to come back in here to explain this.  While it has corrected it now, I also believe we need to ask HSE CervicalCheck management to explain in detail the process by which this happened.</p></speech>

I have spoke to Ms Claire Healy as well.  She should not have been obliged to talk to politicians.  It should have been dealt with.</p> <p>  We need to get Dr. Lorraine Doherty back in because there are questions to be asked.  For example, one of the excuses offered as to why there may have been an issue with tracking the results is that if one goes from the private system to the public system, somehow one's identification, ID, changes.  Clearly, it does not because the CervicalCheck ID was used by the GP and used by all of the tests at that time.  That is not an excuse for what happened.</p> <p>  We need to get the bottom of how somebody can come in and intimate to this committee that she did not know how the decision happened when clearly she was central to it, and how many women are involved in this.  I am aware, from within my own social circle, of at least one.  I would imagine, if we scratch the surface, there are many women who would have been impacted like this on the basis that the waits were so long and any woman who was worried would either do it herself or, as in the case of my friend, be pressured into doing it by her husband on the basis of the need to get it done.  The CervicalCheck programme should know how many women are involved in this.  We need to get to the bottom of it.</p> <p>  It is essential that women have their smear tests but it is also essential that they have confidence in the system for handling those.  We would be doing Claire and all of the other women impacted by this a grave disservice if we did not follow up on it.  I believe we have a duty to so do.</p></speech>

It is worth noting the HSE's response last week.  I put its clarifying statement to it and stated that while it was regretting that there was confusion caused, it clearly instructed hospitals not to treat particular people, there is no confusion about that and it made a mistake, and asked would its representatives admit that they have made a mistake and let us move on.  I am open to being corrected but I am fairly sure they did not say, "Yes, we made a mistake."  They danced around it being an awful situation that such confusion was caused.  I reflected on it afterwards and concluded it is more serious than the usual hedging one gets, because this is about CervicalCheck, which came to light because of non-disclosure and because of people not putting their hands up and saying that they got something wrong.  We are all fallible and people get things wrong.  Within a functioning healthcare system, our officials and clinicians must be able to put their hands up and say that they made a call, be it a management call or a clinical call, and it was the wrong call.  That must be acceptable within the system.</p> <p>  If those running the system - last week we had the Minister, the Secretary General and the head of the HSE before us - refuse to say that they got that wrong, it should not have happened and it will not happen again, that sends a message to every healthcare professional, official and manager working within the system that says it is business as usual; hedge, fudge, obfuscate and never accept that one has done anything wrong.  It is regrettable.</p> <p>  I will ask a question for consideration at the committee.</p><p>I agree that we should find out the scale of this issue regarding CervicalCheck.  However, it opens up the broader question of where else in the system this is happening.  Women were waiting up to nine months for smear test results from CervicalCheck but people are also waiting between three months and two years for access to an MRI, a CAT scan, or various other diagnostics.  Inevitably, people are being advised by their GPs that, as they will be waiting years for diagnostics on the public system, they should get them done privately.  The GP can then look at the results and refer them to a consultant in the public system if there is something there.  Patients feel compelled to get such tests done privately because of the huge waiting lists for public diagnostics.  Is it HSE policy that such patients will not be seen across the public system?  If a person has a diagnostic result that shows he or she needs specialist medical care, will the HSE do what it did to Ms Claire Healy?  The HSE knew her results indicated that she needed specialist care, but it would not allow her access to the public system.  She was told to get back in the queue and that she would be put on a list once she had gotten the same results in a year and a half from a public MRI machine.  The committee should ask the HSE where else this practice is going on.  The waiting times for diagnostics across the system are not normal.</p></speech>

That would be a very common statement to make to patients.  Consultants are encouraging people to get private scans and people are happy to do so if it speeds up the process.  It does not preclude them from getting back into the public system, in my experience.</p></speech>

If a consultant feels that someone needs a smear test, he or she has to refer them back to their GP.  CervicalCheck will not take any referrals or test results from a consultant dealing with women's health.  No consultants are included in the GP programme, which is causing its own problems.  I know of a case where a GP who was dealing with a patient for a number of months became concerned and referred them to a consultant.  The consultant saw the patient within two days because the GP had contacted the consultant themselves and expressed concern.  Within three days, the consultant had that person on an operating table because of the issues that had been identified.  If that person had gone through the public system, they would have been waiting at least two or three months for what was deemed an urgent operation.  There is something wrong in consultants with specialisation in certain areas not being included in the CervicalCheck programme.</p></speech>

I am making the point that senior people in the system must give a full and clear acknowledgement, because that sends out the right message to everybody else.  The HSE's response felt hedged.

I spoke to a woman who had her smear test done privately and it showed that she needed an urgent intervention.  However, because she had a test done on the public system in the previous year which was clear, she could not get back into the system as an urgent case, though her GP tried very hard to do so.  They would not acknowledge the private result, only the public one.  That woman then went into the private system and underwent an urgent procedure very quickly after seeing a consultant.  This issue is not isolated to one or two cases and we therefore need to have a broader discussion on it.  I appreciate the points made by Mr. Reid.  He said that the instruction went out but I do not believe it was heeded by everyone in the system.  The responses we received were not good enough and we have a role to investigate that further.</p></speech>

I also have concerns about other issues which I will not yet speak about here.  There is a direct contradiction in the evidence and documentation that Ms Claire Healy has given us.  In fairness to Ms Healy, she sent us documentation from people in the HSE, which verifies what happened and others in the HSE have also noted the contradiction.  The issue is between the letters from Dr. Lorraine Doherty and Mr. Liam Woods.  What happened in between those two letters being sent out?  How were they distributed across the various different areas in the HSE?  How many people were subsequently affected?  The second letter from Mr. Woods clarified the issue and totally changed what Dr. Doherty had said.  Did the issue continue after the date of that letter?</p><p>I agree with Deputy Donnelly that the HSE should just admit that it made an error and got it wrong.  However, I do not believe a letter from the HSE is going to sufficiently deal with that.  We need to tease this out, perhaps in a limited period of an hour or so within this committee.  We must do so because of the concerns raised.  This is not any other screening programme; this is CervicalCheck and so we need to be absolutely clear that this should not have happened and is unacceptable.  The HSE's attitude has been <i>laissez-faire</i>and given the screening programme in question, that needs to be looked into.</p></speech>

The first is the profile of the 221 patient group laboratory audit results.  I pressed the HSE for this report and it was subsequently sent to patient representatives, to the 221+ patient support group, and to this committee.  It breaks down the figures by laboratory and shows where the 221 breakdown is.  In May 2018, the then director general of the HSE, Tony O'Brien told us that the HSE would be able to break this down for us.</p></speech>

He stated that it would take two weeks or a similarly short period.  I need to check the record in that regard.  The big issue is that we still do not know the dates in question.  If the HSE is incapable of giving a full matrix of the breakdown of these slides, it must be dysfunctional.  This work should barely take a couple of hours, never mind a couple of years.  There is a reason the information is being held back.  The patient representatives on the CervicalCheck steering group have asked for it <i>ad nauseam</i>.  It has been asked for in many ways and on many occasions.  The most recent occasion on which they asked for it was in writing last December.  What has been provided is tokenistic.  It is trying to get us off the information trail.  There is a reason that the full information is not being provided.  It is totally unacceptable.  My concern with regard to what is happening is being strengthened.  There is no reason CervicalCheck cannot provide this information.  It is quite basic information which the organisation has held for years.  Why is it not providing it?  If it cannot give us the information, there must be a reason for that which we are not being told, or else the organisation is completely and utterly dysfunctional.  All it needs to do is include another couple of table lines in order to provide the information required.  It has the information.  All it needs to do is provide different bundles of the various labs and dates and what happened.  It is quite simple, but CervicalCheck either cannot or is refusing to do it.  The deeper question is why it is refusing to give patient representatives and the committee this information.</p></speech>

The issue has been raised countless times.  Each time we raise it, including directly with the Minister, we are told that everything is grand and that the information will be provided very quickly.  It still has not been provided.  It has been sought for years.  The HSE is well aware that the information we are seeking is not contained in that documentation.  In fact, that documentation adds nothing to our understanding of the issue.  A representative of the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine appeared before the committee and was clear that the potential for clusters existing needs to be investigated.  That is what we were told we would be getting, but we did not get it or any version of it.  The committee may have written to the Minister to request this information.  It has definitely been requested by me and other Oireachtas Members on numerous occasions, as well as by the patient representatives.  It would be in order for us to seek further information in that regard.  We are not seeking a massive amount of information.  It would be shocking if the HSE did not have the information.  Of course, it has it.  The question is why is it not sharing it with us when we have requested it umpteen times.</p></speech>

The big issue relates to the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB.  I have gone through all of the documentation provided.  I do not know whether any other member has done so.  I spent last night going through it.  I have raised issues regarding INAB at the committee many times.  Its representatives appeared before us.  I refer to the issues regarding quality assurance at the Manchester laboratory.  In fairness, I asked the representatives of INAB when it found out that the Manchester laboratory was not accredited.  What is really scary is that for a long time I have been chasing up what happened in regard to the second Scally report.  I have outlined the full chronology in this regard in the D&aacute;il, at this committee and at another committee on numerous occasions.  The report was due in February.  Something happened to ensure that it was not delivered.  I asked Dr. Scally and the Minister on numerous occasions and in various ways why the report was not delivered on the date it was due.  I asked the Secretary General at a meeting of the committee on 13 February and he truthfully told me it was imminent.  Dr. Scally was due to appear before us the following day.  In reply to a parliamentary question asked on 12 February, the day before, I was told the publication was imminent.</p> <p>  I sought information from INAB in other ways and, to its credit, it provided it.  I had to go through the committee and ask it to get all of this documentation.  In a letter to INAB on 1 February regarding MedLab Manchester, Dr. Scally outlines that he is in the course of completing the supplementary report, the publication of which is imminent and indicates that he would be grateful if his questions could be answered as soon as possible.  On 6 February, he again wrote to INAB and stated that he was in the process of completing the report and would appreciate a response sooner rather than later.  On 13 February, the same day I asked questions at this committee and was told the report was imminent, Dr. Scally wrote to Adrienne Duff regarding the lab.  He stated that he would operate on the basis that the Manchester screening facility was covered by the accreditation INAB had given MedLab, as he had been told by Ms Duff the previous day.  We all now know the truth in that regard.  In the letter, Dr. Scally goes on to inform Ms Duff that the relevant section of his report was being finalised that morning and seeks written confirmation of what she told him on the telephone.</p> <p>  In fairness to the Secretary General of the Department, he told me at the committee meeting on 13 February that all quality assurance issues were being dealt with, that the terms of reference which were published - I am not sure whether they were fully engaged with - would be dealt with and that the report was imminent.  The reality is very different.  As a consequence of what happened regarding the non-analysis of the contracts, the lack of information on the labs, the discovery of this issue relating to Manchester and the quality assurance concerns I raised at the committee following requests from patient advocates, the report was not published for many months.  Given that the Manchester laboratory was not accredited by INAB - it did not even know it existed - the consequences for the report were immensely serious.</p><p>Everything changed around that time.  This is a jigsaw on which I have been working for the guts of six to eight months.  This is the final piece in the jigsaw.  If the meeting of this committee on 13 February had not happened, would this report have been published - it was about to be published - and would we ever have known about the quality assurance that was needed, the lack of quality assurance, the issues that had not been covered by the first report, the details of what happened regarding the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, and the Manchester laboratory, the process by which what happened with the Manchester laboratory came about and the fact that it can never be guaranteed that no other laboratories were used by screening providers with outsourcing because some of them no longer exist?  Would we have known about any of this without that meeting of this committee?  The trajectory of this report - when and how it was going to be published - changed dramatically over those days.  I am glad it did because we subsequently obtained all the information but I am concerned about how a report that was originally 16 or 17 pages long increased to the size it was in the end.  Much of this information and analysis will have been missed.  I am not convinced that-----</p></speech>

The council works to ensure that medical education, training and lifelong learning is benchmarked against the highest international standards.  Standards for undergraduate and postgraduate training are set by the council while we also require doctors to maintain their professional competency through updating and maintaining their professional skills on an ongoing basis.  The council provides guidance to doctors on matters relating to conduct and ethics through its guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners.  </p> <p>  The Medical Council is also where the public may make a complaint against a doctor.  Fitness to practise inquiries and complaints are dealt with in accordance with rules, fair procedures and direction from the courts.  In summary, the key objective of the council is to protect the interests of the general public in its interactions with registered medical practitioners while also supporting these doctors.</p> <p>  As the council&rsquo;s register is a valid and complete list of doctors who are legally permitted to practise medicine in the State, it is a comprehensive source of medical workforce intelligence.  Following the 2016-17 workforce intelligence report, which was launched in April this year, we published the medical workforce report for 2018 last week.  This included a deep dive into the data describing demographics of those retaining and withdrawing from the register of medical practitioners in 2018 to inform workforce planning and, ultimately, improve patient care and safety in Ireland.</p> <p>  There is a continued overreliance on foreign-trained doctors, as evidenced by the continued increase in the general division of the register.  The practical and cultural challenges within the health system need to be addressed in tandem with an increase of appropriate health practitioner supply, otherwise, these problems will escalate.  </p> <p>  A year-on-year decrease in applicants to the register was observed between 2016 and 2018.  Simultaneously, the number of those who voluntarily withdrew their registration between 2014 and 2018 increased year on year with a net flattening impact on the register.  Comprehensive and co-ordinated workforce planning is necessary to determine requirements to put the right doctors in the right place with the right qualifications.  </p> <p>  The research findings establish that while we train a significant number of doctors, this needs to increase to ensure we have a sustainable medical workforce into the future.  Ireland has been replacing the doctors in the system rather than changing the system itself, which is notable through the feedback received from doctors leaving the register.  We need more attractive working conditions and increased opportunities to enter medical training programmes to guarantee substantial, high-quality workforce recruitment and retention, both short-term and long-term.</p> <p>  Our recruitment and retention challenges have now filtered right through from service posts to retention of consultants in the Irish context.  We know that we are experiencing doctor shortages.</p><p>This is being managed through high-cost interventions, for example, the use of locum services, and this impacts on the continuity and quality of patient care.  Examining retention is crucial to producing a sustainable self-sufficient workforce into the future.</p><p> In 2018, there were 2,190 doctors who enrolled on the Medical Council register for the first time.  That is the figure for new entrants to the register.  The primary growth reported was in the general division of the register.  Most new entrants to the register were in the general division and educated outside of Ireland.  Doctors from countries outside of the EU cumulatively contributed more new entrants to the Irish register of medical practitioners than Ireland.  Non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, were the most prevalent group of doctors registered with 7,800 on average in the system, an increase of 6.6% since 2017.  Some 46.1% of NCHDs were in training while the remaining 53.9% occupied non-training posts.</p><p> A total of 20,109 doctors with an average age of 44.5 years chose to retain their registration.  Some 86.9% of these doctors were on the general and specialist divisions of the register.  The majority of those retaining their registration were male and were Irish graduates.  It was also self-reported that for every two hospital consultants there were three NCHDs on the register.  Approximately 70% of non-retaining doctors were aged 44 or under.  Some three quarters of non-retainers were on the general division and 24% were on the specialist division.</p><p> In 2018, there were 1,453 voluntary withdrawals recorded, representing a 37.9% increase since 2017.  One third of doctors who left the register of medical practitioners in 2018 were graduates of Irish medical schools.  This group comprised slightly more female, some 52%, than male doctors.  Most of these doctors reported leaving the general division of the register while 29% left the specialist division.  Interns represented 11.9% of this group leaving the register.  The majority of these doctors planned to practise medicine in another country while 66 doctors planned to stop practising altogether.  For those who left due to workplace issues, resourcing and lack thereof was cited.  However, the lack of appreciation and value placed on the work and perseverance of doctors in such circumstances was a contributing factor.  The consequent personal impact of excessive hours and lack of support also raised significant challenges not only to morale but to patient safety as well.  Most registrants who reported leaving due to limited career progression planned to pursue available opportunities in the United Kingdom.  In particular, the UK was cited as a jurisdiction that welcomed doctors and was willing to support and train them.  Respondents reported accessing a training scheme as a significant barrier to career progression.  The standards set for admission to schemes was perceived as variable, compared to the international context.</p><p> For those educated internationally or possessing international experience, gaining employment at consultant level in the specialist division in Ireland was reported as a significant challenge as well.  This reflected recruitment and retention challenges at the most experienced level of the medical career trajectory.  In total, 320 doctors reported leaving the register for family or personal reasons.  International graduates from a medical school outside the EU and Ireland made up half of this group, while medical practitioners who graduated from a medical school in the EU and were EU nationals comprised an additional quarter of this group.  The majority of respondents leaving due to family or personal reasons were leaving the general division of the register.  However, a little over one in five doctors leaving the register for these reasons were specialist registrants.  Some of those leaving explicitly cited the incompatibility of long working hours with the demands of family life.  Family members and their care across the lifespan was a strong theme that emerged from the qualitative data reported, as would be expected in this category.  In particular, maternity leave was cited ten times in the data.  The demands of balancing both home and medical professional practice was made explicit by one respondent, who noted the challenges that the long working hours present.  Supporting spouses in their careers was also cited as a reason for leaving the register by respondents.</p><p> Through evidence-based data-driven reporting, we can provide this continuing national picture of the medical workforce in Ireland.  We can identify trends, highlight areas of concern and make suggestions on how to address issues.  Findings from this report and other research conducted by the council highlight continued trends and concerning insights that need to be addressed collaboratively by policymakers, educators, planners and employers to effect meaningful change to support doctors and, most importantly, to protect patients.</p></speech>

The obvious question this raises is whether this was a statistical blip.  Is it because of some structural issue?  Is there a perfectly reasonable explanation for such a vast increase in those leaving or is this a signal of something more serious such as a tipping point in the system with more doctors leaving at an exponential rate?</p></speech>

I am also a nerd.  With these numbers, we can see some of the changes.  There were introductions of professional indemnity and increasing demand relating to continuing professional development, CPD.  That is cited in the voluntary withdrawals in the qualitative data on a small scale, but not on a scale that would reflect that change or explain it.  The rates have increased over time fairly solidly.  If we look back to 2014, we can see the rate of withdrawals was 546.  Over time, the figure has gone up and up.  We do not have a final figure this year because we look at it from 1 January to 31 December, but certainly the trends this year are reflective of what was reported last year.  We are seeing broad trends again this year.</p></speech>

That tells me these doctors have a story they want to tell.  It is the combination of the increase of voluntary withdrawals, which is highly significant, with the qualitative data that our research manager can take committee members through.  Together they tell a consistent story to the effect that there is deep dissatisfaction with the practice of medicine for many of our most highly trained graduates.  This is replicated in other surveys done by other institutions.</p></speech>

There is the resource issue.  The fact that entrants to the consultants' register are being paid one third less than their colleagues is an issue but it is not the main issue.  It is the culture in which medicine is practised in this country that is the main issue.</p></speech>

They are made to work far longer hours.  We would not let a pilot fly forever but there is no limit to the number of hours consultants can work.  Doctors report bullying in the workplace; certainly among the younger doctors between 40% and 50% report bullying in the workplace.  I listen to the young doctors.  The interns in particular worry me terribly because they do not even have a job description.  Their current job description is that they do what nobody else will do.  These are the cream of our graduates.  These are the people with high intellects and they are thrown into this system and are absolutely exhausted.  They talk about bullying, lack of respect and the absence of any good work-life balance.</p></speech>

It is deeply stupid as well in terms of trying to run a world-class public healthcare system.  That toxic culture that Dr. Doyle has just described - who would want to work in that or come up through it?  Is that a facet of medicine internationally or is it a facet of medicine in Ireland?</p></speech>

Many of our graduates go to the UK but a lot of the younger graduates are going to Australia and New Zealand.  They are reporting back to us that they have a much better work-life balance and that they are respected.  There is a deep lack of respect for doctors, for some reason, in this country.</p></speech>

We do not have specific data on people who are in private or public practice.  I suppose medicine was always a hierarchical career.  The consultants are under huge pressure.  I am not blaming them because they are not doing all the bullying but I think that the circumstances in which they work, the lack of respect from HR - as long as I am around, young doctors have been in training that changed every six months or every year, yet at least 20% of them are put on emergency tax twice a year.  It is just stupid.  These are young people who have to pay their rent and feed their kids but they get very little support from HR.  That is part of it.</p></speech>

Other countries appear to have been able to modernise their HR and other systems.  Why have we not been able to do that in Ireland?</p></speech>

I am not involved in HR but I hear the stories from the doctors of how badly they are treated.  Somebody said to me last week that when a doctor in Ireland gets a phone call from HR, he or she shakes.  This doctor's daughter was doing her general practice in Australia.  The daughter said that when she got a phone call from HR she was absolutely shaking but they just rang to know how she was getting on and had she made the change all right.  It is a different culture.</p></speech>

The reason I was asking her as opposed to the HSE was that I am not entirely sure we would get a full and frank answer from the HSE.  Around particular pinch points, the Medical Council's data does some very useful gender analysis as to men and women leaving the system.  It is interesting to note that there are quite significantly more female trainees.  There are more women going into the doctor training pipeline yet at the top there are significantly fewer.  That could be for historic reasons, meaning that as the younger cohort grows older it will balance out.  However, it could be for structural reasons, namely that we have a system that is structurally even less friendly to women.  What is Dr. Doyle's view on that?</p></speech>

We never made any planning for the feminisation of medicine.  When I went through training I was in a class of 120 and there were only 18 women, so it was not feminised.  Now it is nigh on equal with about 48% women and 52% men.  I do not think that any plans were made for the fact that women have children.  The stage at which they are just finishing their higher specialist training or their general practice training is often the time when they have children.  No allowance is made for that.  No extra allowance is made for people who are going to take maternity leave.  The workload falls on the people who are there.  Mothers have to pick up their children from <font color="#111111">cr&egrave;che</font>s.  I hear senior consultants saying, &quot;where is that one gone, she is gone to pick up her children?&quot;  Of course she is gone to pick up her children, she is a mother, what else would she do?  There are no allowances for the feminisation of general practice.  That needs to be looked at.  There should be supernumerary interns, senior house officers, SHOs, and registrars at every level so that when somebody goes on maternity leave or her child gets sick or whatever, there is somebody to step in and the workload is not doubled on her co-intern or her co-SHO.</p></speech>

Something like 43% or 46% of those leaving were from Dublin.  I do not imagine 46% of the doctors in the country are registered in Dublin.</p></speech>

I am delighted to see Wicklow did not show up.  Who would want to de-register in Wicklow?  It did not show up in the data, the numbers were so small.  Are there particular geographies?  Why is Dublin being hit so badly along with maybe Galway, Cork and others?  I do not think it is in the data but has the Medical Council of Ireland gone down to hospital-by-hospital level?  Are there hospitals which we can identify as being particularly bad for the retention of doctors?</p></speech>

That is the nature of data collection for the register.  It is not necessarily verifiable employment data so we do not look at that.  The HSE would have better figures on that and has done some analysis of it, I understand.  There is a lot of movement in Dublin, as we can see.  I think through the voluntary withdrawals qualitative data we can get a sense of some of that.  On the Deputy's previous question about the reasons for moving, the first is family and personal reasons.  Dr. Doyle talked about that.  Limited progression opportunities are another reason.  We have a lot of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, based in Dublin, those in training and not training.  Proportionately the number of those in training has decreased in relation to the number who are not in training.  The numbers who are not in training have increased over the past three years by about 800.  There are real challenges in that group in progressing on to training and career progression.  About four in five or 80% of them are international medical graduates and have a real challenge getting onto a programme that will further their career.  In a situation like that, a doctor is going to make a sensible choice to want to progress his or her career and will look elsewhere to do that, so many of them do leave.  They are in service provision posts and unfortunately currently, under the legislation, there are real challenges in that.  The proposed amendments to the Act that are proposed would provide for more equity of access for those doctors, which could address the matter.  That is something we would really like to see progressed.</p></speech>

It will be fairer to the non-Irish NCHDs who are not in training but it will produce competition.</p><p>Unless the numbers of places for training are increased, therefore, it will not be of any value.</p></speech>

I refer briefly to a case that was highlighted over the weekend and another case highlighted recently in newspapers in Donegal.  I refer specifically to the case of Jim Kenny and his now deceased wife, Eileen, and I have Mr. Kenny's permission to do so.  I do not propose to dwell on the case.

I am conscious that there is a very young GP in the room with us, although I am not referring in any way to the Chairman.  I had a friend who used to say averages tell us nothing because if one puts one foot in a bucket of ice and the other in a bucket of boiling water, on average, one's temperature will be fine.  However, in this instance, the averages or trends tell us a good deal.  I am curious to know if there are specific specialties or areas where a problem may arise that is caused not just by the failure to recruit but also by the ageing population of the relevant cohort.</p></speech>

That is not to say that 50 is old but it is above the average of the full cohort of doctors.  Our plan for the next report is to dig into these age profiles further but if the committee wants more specific information on age, it will not be a problem providing it.</p></speech>

Clearly, if the average age among a particular cohort is increasing, it would indicate a problem in a particular area.</p> <p>  Dr. Doyle indicated that doctors believe they are not adequately appreciated and valued.  As I said, I am not a nerd but I know something about work.  Nothing says I value and appreciate someone more than cold, hard cash.  Are there other mechanisms that can be employed at this time?  It is clear that there is an issue.  We can point to money, which is a very serious issue and one doctors are raising, but there are other issues also.  Are there measures that can be taken in the short, medium and long term?  If there is an immediate crisis, we should be in a position to be able to address it.  What short, medium and long-term measures, in addition to providing money, can be taken to address this issue in some way?</p></speech>

We like to respond to complaints and the biggest complaint is around communication.  We have been talking to the HSE and the continuing professional development, CPD, people about delivering communications courses.  The HSE runs a very good, structured communications course.  It is led by Peter Gillen, a retired surgeon from Drogheda, and Winnie Ryan, a staff member of the HSE, and is now on module 5.  It was agreed that this course should be part of the training programme for interns.  The course takes three hours but no hospital will allow interns to take three hours off work.</p></speech>

Graduates, particularly doctors and nurses who have a qualification that makes them highly mobile, like to go abroad for a year or two and see the world before returning.  My information, which probably tallies with that of Dr. Doyle, is that doctors and nurses are leaving and getting a glimpse of what it is like to work abroad.  They are also shown some of the appreciation and value they are not shown here and are then choosing to stay abroad.  Dr. Doyle referred to doctors on the register who are practising abroad.  She will not necessarily know the figures but does she have any sense, even as a percentage, of the numbers involved?</p></speech>

Dr. Doyle is right, however, that it is not an environment for patients or workers.  The issue here is the failure to recruit.  We will be talking to doctors' representatives after this session and again next week.  I contend there is an issue around money.  In the short term, nothing other than recruitment will make anything possible.</p><p>If I hear Dr. Doyle correctly, it almost does not matter what is done.  We can lay on as many courses as we like but if staff cannot attend them if they do not get protected time.  We can have all the well-being initiatives we like but if staff cannot get ten minutes off to eat a sandwich, they will not get an hour off to do mindfulness.  That is no disrespect to mindfulness, which is probably great if one has the time.  The study backs the view that without recruitment the resolution of these issues will not be possible.</p></speech>

One of the issues I will raise is exhaustion among consultants and working hours that are not acceptable.  Errors happen because of this.  I must be honest in saying that.  Consultants are human beings.  They have worries and concerns about malpractice as a result of it.  That is a real issue.  I think the issues are related, and while I do not agree with it, I accept the Chairman's ruling.  It does not look great to the public following these proceedings.</p></speech>

I know many people in the medical profession.  There is a concern among doctors that their workload and the number of hours they work result in malpractice, accidental or otherwise.

We know that from the training council and, conversely, we know that if there is an adverse event, there is also an increased risk of bullying.</p></speech>

I was not as conscious of the second point, which relates to bullying, but as Dr. Doyle has repeated it I am aware that it as a concern.  On that basis, is it fair to say that the Medical Council will have to deal with issues that are referred to it due workload and exhaustion?</p></speech>

I will address that point to the Minister.  A <i>volte-face </i>will be needed after what has been revealed.  I am concerned.  There are two ways of looking at this, either as a deep concern or as a good thing.  We do not have enough consultants and they are overworked and overstretched.  The hours they are working are insane, as are the conditions in which they work and the way many of them are treated, yet the number of complaints referred to the Medical Council is static.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that when one has such a small number of complaints, I do not think one can draw many conclusions between complaints to the Medical Council and adverse events.  Let us remember that a complaint to the Medical Council focuses on the fitness to practise of a doctor.  There is no compensatory scheme.  It is not a scheme of redress, so it does not give the same insight into total adverse events that other types of complaints regime would have.  That is all I am saying.</p></speech>

The figures have been flatlining for a number of years.  That says an awful lot for the consultants.  It is a good thing and a good statistic.  I am not sure if people are aware of that because to be honest, I was not aware of it.</p> <p>  I will ask a few questions based on the statistics provided.  I do not know if the witnesses will be able to answer all of them.  Is there a breakdown for the consultants that are leaving, by discipline and area?

It does not look at geography or specialty.  What it looks at are the division of registration and the reasons for leaving, which are explored and people have space to report to us what that looks like.  We can go back through the registration numbers and see where people have previously reported that they have worked.  It is possible to do that.  It is a little messy but it can be done.  We can do that if Deputy Kelly wishes.</p></speech>

That information is incredibly important to us; we are talking about it all the time.</p><p> The Medical Council does not distinguish between public and private.  The geographical spread of access to private practice in Ireland is interesting.  For example, in the mid west, the area in which myself and Dr. Harty live, essentially, there is no private hospital.  We have the former Barringtons Hospital in Limerick but there is no fully private hospital.  The level of private practice in certain disciplines in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is among the highest in the country.  There are options in other areas such as Galway, Cork and Dublin.  Is there any correlation between doctors and consultants leaving practice and their access and attitude towards private versus public practice?</p></speech>

The number of doctors per head of population in Beaumont versus UHL is a national scandal.  Doctors in UHL are working in insane conditions.</p> <p>  We obviously need an influx of consultants.  We also need to change their conditions, remuneration packages and numerous other things.  I have always been of the belief that hospitals need to turn into seven-day working institutions.

I wish to ask a question arising from Dr. Doyle's presentation and relating to an article on <i>thejournal.ie</i>.  Dr. Doyle stated that a &quot;year-on-year decrease in applicants&quot; registering was observed between 2016 and 2018.  Articles were written in a number of newspapers that gave the impression that the number of doctors registering in Ireland has gone down, whereas the figures between 2014 and 2018 show an increase from approximately 19,000 to in the region of 22,000.  That was an increase of 20.72%.  Nowhere did Dr. Doyle make reference to that and, as a result, newspapers have got the impression that there has been a reduction in the number of doctors working in Ireland.  Is there not an obligation on the Medical Council to ensure true and accurate figures are given out?  That is not what was given or what was picked up by the media.</p></speech>

I am simply referring to a situation where two people dropped out of obstetrics and gynaecology.  One of them had nine years training and the other six.  They dropped out because of the stress levels and also because of the amount of litigation.  What has been done in other jurisdictions that we could do here in order to give more reassurance to the people working here that they have the support of the system?  One of the problems here is that people are dropping out of the system and leaving Ireland because they feel they do not have sufficient support.  What could we do here to give more support to the people on the front line that has been done in other jurisdictions?</p></speech>

When we look at the Your Training Counts survey, our rate of bullying was 41% in our most recent report.  Across the HSE, the rate is 42% so it is reflective of a broader health culture and there are real challenges across the services.  I know they are trying to address that and the Department was looking at trying to address it across the organisation, as vast as it is.  Certainly, it is reflective of the broader health services culture.  It is not just doctors.</p></speech>

That survey is carried out across the board in respect of trainees - those on training schemes at the postgraduate level.  It is a slightly different group.</p><p>When we look at that group, four or five of them are Irish graduates.  It is primarily an Irish graduate group.  It is difficult to dig down into it because they are over-represented within that group, as compared to the picture across the full register, which is different.</p><p> We had one person and one situation where information was given to us about an instance of bullying that drove the person to leave the workplace and where this was the primary reason for leaving.  That was an international graduate.  At trainee level we are not necessarily seeing those differences but the number of international medical graduates within that survey is very small.</p></speech>

There is not much sense in producing a report of that nature, which is deemed to be integral to the running of the health service in future and taking into account all of the issues that we have dealt with and having received complaints about and going to all that trouble if, within the system, those directly involved in the front line say they do not know about it, as the Government or somebody else has produced it and it is not ours.  It is, in fact, and is something that is there for health delivery services to take on board and deliver upon.</p> <p>  The reason I am labouring this point - I have stated that this was my last question - is that we cannot continue forever in this country spending more and more money.  Dr. Doyle has said that the money is spent in the wrong places.  I am quite certain that if I went in to examine the health services in the morning, I would find 50 people, at least, who would say that the money is being spent in the wrong place and there would be 50 different places.</p> <p>  I would like to see a greater interest in the practitioners becoming involved and having a pride in the delivery of the public health services.  We have lacked that for quite a long time in this country and it is in everybody's interest that we take it up.  Otherwise, we would be better off outsourcing it entirely and allowing somebody else to provide the services elsewhere because we cannot do it ourselves.  There is no good in saying that we cannot do anything.  We are highly priced and supposed to be efficient, effective and highly qualified.  We need to be delivering.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.650" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Prasifka" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100900002#O00500"><p>One of the reasons this matter has come to public attention is confirmation hearings in the High Court arising from complaints.  For a sanction to be effective, it must be confirmed by the High Court so there is a confirmation hearing.  Complaints arose about particular doctors who were consultants.  In one case, the President of the High Court noted a particular consultant was not on the specialty register and raised a great deal of concern about it.  The simple fact is we are concerned about it.  We are concerned about any diminution of standard.  It would not be fair for us to say there was a spike in complaints but the reason we are speaking about this is complaints were made and it was brought to the attention of the President of the High Court and, therefore, it has become a subject of public focus.  We have been working with the HSE through its national doctors training and planning unit.  It has been looking at the problem and trying to identify it.  It has been trying to put in place mechanisms so that doctors receive the correct training and are eligible to be put on the specialty register.  We are anxious to work with the HSE in a way that does not diminish standards.</p></speech>

If there were 108, are there 106 now?  Is it going in the right direction?  Is the training group having any impact on the level of quality?</p></speech>

I would say a lot of effort has been put into it.  When the effort was initially begun we looked at the problem more intensely and it uncovered more consultants who were not on the specialty register.  This does not mean the problem is getting worse; it means we are uncovering the scope of the problem.  There has been progress in getting some of those doctors registered on the specialty register because it is determined by the Medical Council that they now meet the standards.  Progress is being made but it is slow.</p></speech>

The graph shows a 20% increase in doctors registered but there is a reduced number of new entrants.  Does this mean people who qualify are leaving without ever going on the register?  Is that the point?  What is the mix?  Where are they coming from?  If they do not come from new entrants are they just people landing in from somewhere else?</p></speech>

We have increasing voluntary withdrawals.  The rate of interest of those who have come on the register has been declining since 2016.  The rate of change has slowed significantly.  It has not been steadily 20% over the years.  They are often restorals to the register, where somebody has voluntarily withdrawn-----</p></speech>

Our colleague, Niamh Humphries, is carrying out research, of which the Deputy will probably be aware.  She has spoken to doctors in Australia and is looking to survey doctors based in hospitals in Ireland.  She is looking at cyclical patterns of movement among doctors going abroad, coming back, perhaps pursuing training and leaving again.  She is looking at what this looks like and the impact on the health service.</p></speech>

The IHCA represents 95% of all hospital consultants working in Ireland&rsquo;s public hospital and mental health services.  Our members are calling on us to stand up for the rights of patients, in particular their right to timely access to high quality care.  As the committee will have heard from the Irish Medical Council, we are losing hundreds of our highly trained medical doctors and specialist consultants each year to other countries.  Doctors want to work in a system that works for patients.  Our current system is not working for patients.  Our acute public hospitals are understaffed of consultants and patients are waiting far too long for care; many have worse outcomes as a result.</p> <p>  A total of 1 million people are waiting to access care in our public acute hospitals and every day and month new records are broken for the numbers waiting on trolleys, the numbers waiting for an outpatient appointment and the length of time spent waiting.  Consultants live with the impact of these deficiencies each day on, for example, children with scoliosis whose life-changing operations have been cancelled three or four times already, the elderly widow, housebound and in pain, waiting three years for a hip operation, and the almost 30,000 women to whom the State promised better healthcare but who are now waiting to see a gynaecologist.  Hospitals consultants carry this burden each day, while working on teams with half the required number of consultants compared with the EU average.  Many leave.  This ongoing exodus is being driven by a loss of hope among doctors.  They do not see a future for themselves in the Irish health service and equally have no confidence that there exists the experience, willingness or leadership to fix the Irish public acute hospital system.  For the doctors who have left and those who remain, they can see no evidence of concrete improvements over recent years.  We all have a responsibility.  Committee members, as public representatives, cannot accept this.  The people who elected them have put them in a position to fix this.  Hospital consultants on the front line believe our system is fixable but we need policymakers to work with us, not against us.</p> <p>  Our population has grown by 9.7% since 2008, with the most significant growth in the number of those aged 65 and over, which has increased by 44% over that period.  This is nearly three times the EU average growth rate.  It is important to note that, while those aged 65 and over make up approximately 13% of our population, they account for 54% of total hospital inpatient bed days, 37% of day-case bed days, and 26% of emergency department presentations.  These demographic changes are one of the main factors driving increased demand for public hospital and mental health services.  In the past decade, the number of inpatient and day-case patients treated in our public hospital and mental health services increased by 22%.  In addition, unmet demand continued to increase due to significant capacity deficits as is evident from the large numbers on waiting lists and patients being treated on trolleys.  The ESRI has projected a further 37% increase in patient demand for hospital care by 2030.</p> <p>  It did not need to be this way.  The consultant recruitment and retention crisis has been self inflicted by successive Governments and Ministers for Health since 2012.  The unilateral cut imposed on new entrant consultants and the exacerbation of it by not applying the High Court settlement to all 2008 contract holders represented a flawed policy.  The realistic solution is to restore parity for all consultants appointed since 2012.  The failure to do so has resulted in adverse consequences for patient care and their outcomes.  With 500 permanent consultant posts either vacant or filled on a temporary basis, this is resulting in an extremely overstretched work environment and it is impacting adversely on the quality and safety of care that can be provided to patients.  The new entrant salary inequity is the root cause of Ireland&rsquo;s consultant recruitment and retention crisis and the unacceptable numbers of people on record waiting lists which are now the longest in Europe.  The failure to address the crisis is destroying the basic fabric of our public hospital and mental health services.</p> <p>  I would like to clarify a couple of key issues on the number of consultants working across our public hospitals.  The HSE, before this committee last week, stated that the number of unfilled consultant posts now stands at 377, yet, HSE data confirm that there were 3,281 approved permanent consultant posts in our public hospital and mental health services in June 2019.  The same data confirm there were 2,762 consultants in post, leaving about 519 permanent posts unfilled of which a significant proportion are occupied on agency contracts.  The number of consultants in post is significantly below required levels.</p> <p>  The association has previously highlighted to the committee that the inability to fill over 500 permanent consultant posts is leading to the appointment of non-specialists to specialist consultant posts.  As at February 2019, there were 108 non-specialist doctors in consultant posts, who had been appointed since 2008 when the requirement to be registered on the specialist division to practise independently as a specialist consultant became law.  These appointments are also in breach of the terms of the 2008 consultant contract and the HSE&rsquo;s recruitment rules.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, President of the High Court, wrote to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the health service management in May 2018 to outline the resultant serious patient safety concerns this is causing.</p><p>The main reasons for the employment of non-specialist division doctors in consultant posts are the new entrant consultant pay inequality and our public health service&rsquo;s lack of international competitiveness in recruiting consultants.  There are significant risk and governance issues with so many non-qualified doctors working as specialists in our public hospitals.  They are also concentrated in regional hospitals and mental health services.  In January 2019, a total of 44% of consultant posts at the midlands mental health service were occupied by doctors who were not on the Medical Council specialist register, according to a HSE reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Donnelly.  Equivalent figures at other hospitals included 31% at South Tipperary General Hospital, 13% at the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, 12% at University Hospital Kerry, 11% at Sligo University Hospital and 7% at University Hospital Waterford. </p><p> Ireland has the lowest number of medical specialists on a population basis in the EU, 42% below the EU average, and between one quarter and one half the number in many specialties.  In Scotland, the number of public hospital consultants is 56% higher than in our public hospital and mental health services, when adjusted for population levels.  The current number of public hospital consultants in post is far short of recommended levels for most specialties.  For example, we need 140 additional radiologists by 2027, or a 55% increase on the current number, to reach the European average when adjusted for population levels.  In emergency medicine, the existing cadre of 86 consultants needs to be increased by 90% to provide a safe level of emergency care.  The consequences for patients of not having a sufficient number of permanent hospital consultants in post are very damaging and represent a false economy.  Almost 570,000 people are waiting to be assessed by a hospital consultant on an outpatient basis.  Since the start of the year, more than 53,000 people have joined hospital outpatient waiting lists, while in the past five years, the numbers waiting have increased by more than 205,000. </p><p> More than 1 million people are on myriad hospital waiting lists at present.  Our public hospital and mental health services can ill afford having approximately one in five of our permanent consultant posts unfilled.  It places several important national healthcare programmes at risk.  For example, phase 1 of the national children&rsquo;s hospital, the urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital, could not open 16 hours a day, seven days a week, as was originally planned in July, due to a failure to recruit a sufficient number of paediatric emergency medicine and paediatric radiology consultants.  Instead it is open for less than one third of the planned hours.  Ongoing consultant shortages put the wider children&rsquo;s hospital project at risk.  The national cancer care programme is failing to meet its requirement of seeing 95% of patients within two weeks, due to a combination of consultant and bed shortages.  The national maternity strategy, launched in 2015 following several adverse maternity events, cannot be fully implemented because of a failure to recruit the additional consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology recommended under the strategy.</p><p> The national critical care programme has fewer than half the ICU consultants required to provide the standards of specialist care recommended for the most critically ill patients in our hospitals.  There are only 35 whole-time equivalent ICU consultant posts, rather than the 82 that are required.  The urology model of care, launched in early September, has little chance of success as there are so few consultant urologists.  There are 37 urologists in Ireland, which is one third of what New Zealand has, or 15% of the number in Denmark, both countries having similar populations to Ireland.  The Government&rsquo;s national mental health plan, A Vision for Change, published in 2006, is a blueprint for the delivery of a modern service but it remains severely under-resourced.  Children and adolescent mental health services have 50% of the specialist staff they need, while older people&rsquo;s mental health services have a similar deficit.  Adult services have 25% fewer staff than required.  </p><p> There is a cost of doing nothing.  The restoration of pay parity for consultants appointed since 2012 will result in an outcome that is better than cost neutral, when account is taken of the resultant patient benefits and the savings on medical agency locums, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, outsourcing, and State Claims Agency claims and payments.  Medical agency costs have increased by &euro;57 million per annum, totalling more than &euro;90 million per year, compared with 2012, when the then Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, imposed the salary cut on new consultants.  Furthermore, the cost of engaging an agency consultant is up to twice that of employing a non-new entrant consultant and three times the new entrant consultant salary.  In recent years, the cost of NTPF outsourcing has increased by &euro;75 million per year in an attempt to reduce waiting lists.  In addition, State Claims Agency medical compensation payments have quadrupled since 2013, totalling &euro;247 million in 2018, or an increase of &euro;184 million.  The cost of restoring full pay parity in one step in January 2020 would have been substantially less than the &euro;45 million per year estimated by HSE and Department of Health.  It is questionable in respect of the number of new entrants the HSE has assumed to be on the lower new entrant salary and the lack of allowance for the higher cost of existing agency contract holders.  In addition, a high proportion of new entrant consultants are already on the higher, ninth point of the new entrant scale, which would reduce the estimated cost significantly.</p><p> The word "crisis", when describing our health services, is unfortunately an overused and devalued term, yet all indicators point to the fact that the delivery of our health services, year after year, faces much greater challenges.  In this regard, the IHCA&rsquo;s #CareCantWait campaign has identified the extent of the difficulties arising from vacant consultant posts.  Our acute hospital and mental health services are crumbling with no sign of improvement.  One of the most effective ways to address the deterioration would be for the Government to restore pay parity for consultants appointed since October 2012 to end the medical brain drain and ensure that Ireland will become a more attractive place to pursue a medical career.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting the association to its meeting.  We look forward to a discussion with members on the issues and challenges I outlined .</p></speech>

More than 1 million people in Ireland are waiting for care.  Nothing like it has ever been seen here and nothing like it exists anywhere else in the developed world.  More than 100,000 men, women and children have been waiting more for than a year and a half just to see a consultant.  Children have been waiting for years for surgery, including some with scoliosis, as Dr. O'Hanlon noted, whose spines are curving to almost 90&deg;, something that does not happen in any other European country.  Elderly men and women must wait for days on trolleys in accident and emergency, while there are unsafe staffing levels in various specialties, as mentioned in our guests' opening statements.  There are hundreds of unfilled posts and we have the lowest level of consultants and the longest waiting lists anywhere in Europe.  There are non-specialists in specialist roles and doctors are leaving medicine in record numbers.  Agency costs have shot up more by more than &euro;60 million in recent years and national care programmes, including for cancer and maternity care, are at risk.  The national children's hospital's satellite could not even fill its posts and as a result operates on less than it was meant to.  Pay inequality for new entrants has been identified and accepted across parties, by the Opposition and the Government, and has been championed and pushed by the medical community for a long time.</p><p>Given all of these crises in healthcare that leave men, women and children waiting, suffering, deteriorating and dying, and given the relatively low cost of fixing this bloody thing, why is the Government steadfastly refusing to do so or even to meet representatives of the consultants to talk about it?</p></speech>

The only reason we come to any of these things is because we want to help and we really believe in the public system.  I could say the same for everybody who is on the Joint Committee on Health.  The only reason we show up in the morning is that we believe people should have timely access to excellent care and that it should not matter where someone lives, how much money he or she earns, or what is in his or her local hospital.  All of those things should be irrelevant.  Every person should have equal access to excellent care.  Once people get into the public health system, we do an excellent job.  They are really happy.  When we survey our patients, we find that the ones we have seen are really happy.  As has been said, it is the million people we have not yet seen who are disgruntled and they are totally entitled to be.  They have not accessed care.</p> <p>  The Government has a fear of dealing with us and with doctors in general.  It has this horrible fixed narrative that health is a big black hole or an unfixable problem where good money goes to die.  The Government feels that it continues to pour resources into this big black hole and nothing comes from it.  In a way, the Government chooses not to engage with us because it does not want to face up to that black hole or start looking at how to pull back from it.</p> <p>  I look at examples of solutions.  This morning I was in a clinic and I met one of the nurses.  She told me to make sure to tell the committee that the staff are doing a great job.  I said that I would.  The truth is that the people who work in our health service do a great job.  We have fabulous healthcare workers, but we do not have enough of them.</p> <p>  I can give my own hospital as an example.  I work in Beaumont Hospital.  We used to be terrible, but our numbers are now excellent.  The rheumatology department in Beaumont Hospital went from having two rheumatologists to having three.  Our waiting list went from three and a half years to less than six months.  I delved into the data for the other specialties in our hospital.  There were thousands of people waiting for longer than 18 months to see an orthopaedic surgeon.  The hospital added 1.5 new posts and changed the triage system.  Everyone now on that waiting list has been there for less than nine months.  That is pretty much the only orthopaedics department in the country that has achieved that.  Now, nine months is still terrible, but it is not the same as waiting to be seen for a year and a half.  The same can be said for respiratory care.  Nobody has been waiting for longer than six months because a new body was introduced and took the tail of the waiting list.  The waiting list is now gone.</p> <p>  The only places in our hospital that have not seen improvements are the places where people have resigned and left.  We have lost three or four people in the dermatology department to the private sector.  That waiting list has skyrocketed.  That is the only place where we have had to put some of the workload out to tender via the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  Yesterday, we were discussing the cost of getting people out for their dermatology assessments, their biopsies and their subsequent treatment.  I will not outline the numbers because I would be killed, but they were massive.  I was absolutely astonished.  That is the only place in our medical service where we are outsourcing.  That was a huge cost.  It certainly cost more than it would cost to hire three consultants a year.</p></speech>

I have had the health brief for about a year and a half and some things were soon very obvious to me.  They will be very obvious members of this committee who have been doing this for longer than I have.  One of these things was the fact that the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation applying to GPs needs to be reversed.  Many people have pushed for that and it is beginning to be reversed.  Another was a stance taken by the nurses and midwives.  Things needed to be done there and movement was achieved.  They did not get everything they wanted but there has been movement and provisioning in the budgets for that.  Another thing that obviously must happen immediately is that new entrant pay inequality must be eliminated for consultants.  We are running out of doctors.  To the best of my knowledge there has been no movement on that.  Is movement happening behind the scenes, out of all of our sight, or are consultants hitting a brick wall with the Government?</p></speech>

Dr. O'Hanlon may not be able to answer.  The figure we received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is &euro;45 million.  That does not take into account reduction in locum costs or real cash savings, so let us assume the figure is closer to &euro;20 million over a full year.  We do not know exactly.  A full-year sum of &euro;20 million is minuscule in the context of the &euro;17.4 billion current spend unveiled yesterday.  This is an obvious way to save money.  Arguably it is a higher priority than some of the items we saw in the budget yesterday.  Do the witnesses have a sense of why we are seeing such intransigence on the part of the Government towards one of many obvious solutions to the need to hire more doctors?</p></speech>

That is only my opinion and my reading of the situation.  It is partly because our public health system has been politicised and weaponised.  When I was a trainee, consultant posts were really sought after.  They were really competitive.  There were multiple applicants and the best person would be picked.  In 2012, the then Minister, Senator James Reilly, imposed a unilateral 30% additional cut on new entrants' pay.  He was warned that it would decimate recruitment and retention.  He did it anyway.  Multiple Ministers since, including the current Taoiseach, said that this was a mistake, it had not worked, it was not saving us money, and it needed to be reversed.  However, nobody has had the political courage equal to desire to say the Government made a mistake.  As doctors, we live with the fact that there is uncertainty in medicine.  We make our best decisions with the information we have.  I am a radiologist.  We have an error rate of between 3% and 5%.  We know we make mistakes.  We have to learn from them, improve and move on.  To me it seems there is an ideological or political determination not to admit that this was a mistake.  This measure never saved us money.  We are spending a fortune on agency locums, far in excess of what we would spend on permanent staff who would be leading, innovating and developing the service for our patients.  Everybody seems to see the figures, recognise the impact on patients and realise that this needs to be changed, but there is a lack of political courage to do it.<br/><br/>The Taoiseach made a commitment in the D&aacute;il on 24 October 2018.  He said he would sit down with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, which represents more than 95% of consultants, and our colleagues in the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and simply do this.  So far what we have seen is kicking the can down the road - inaction, lots of talk, selfies and spin.  I call on all the members present to say &quot;Enough&quot;.  We are not a political football.  We are the people who look after the patients of this country - the constituents, families, friends and children of the members of this committee.  We do not have enough people on our team to provide timely access to high-quality care.  Every person in this country should expect that if his or her GP feels he or she needs access to secondary or tertiary care, he or she will get it within six weeks.  That is their right.  Our Constitution says that the Government has a duty to defend their right to life.  The 1 million people waiting on lists, some of whom have been waiting three or four years for access, do not feel very defended or protected by politicians right now.<br/><br/>The five of us who are here this morning should not have to come here like this.  We should not have to call politicians out on an issue as basic as having enough people to staff our teams safely.  Our number of consultants <i>per capita</i>is half the OECD average, and some of those comparator countries are not rock stars with whom we would want to be compared.  Some 20% of our posts are empty.  We have the fewest consultants <i>per capita</i>in Europe.  Our system is burning out and spitting out our doctors because those of us who are in post are firefighting to protect patients from the gaps in care.  We are on intolerable call rosters, we have workloads that are not safe, and we go to work and do this every day to protect patients.  We look to politicians to lead us and to give us the resources and the front-line staff to provide the high-quality care that we provide to everybody when they need it, but politicians are ignoring us.  They promise to engage with us and then do not follow through.  We are willing to meet them any time, day or night, Monday to Sunday.  We work those hours 24-7, 365 days a year.  We provide the medical cover.  There has been enough talk.  We have implementation deficit disorder in this country.  It is time for politicians actually to do something.</p></speech>

It has been going around my mind for the past seven years.  When will people really engage at ministerial level and at official level?  I ask this question after representing the food sector and the health sector since 1990.  I am not a novice in representation.  Prior to that, I worked for two years in the Department of Finance.  I have an understanding of what officials are there to do.  That is the nub of the problem.</p><p>We have an inexplicable position where the Minister of the day is not engaging on an issue and the senior officials in the relevant Department, or potentially Departments, are not engaging either.  My understanding, prior to moving to the private sector, was a civil servant had a responsibility to analyse problems and formulate the best solutions.  We have made most of the analysis ourselves and I have not seen any from the other side.  It is a win-win solution and would be better than cost-neutral, as we have alluded to, if we allow for the better outcomes for patients, leading to shorter stays in hospitals, fewer medical bills and less home or nursing homecare.  If we leave patients on lengthy waiting lists, as we are, it becomes a big problem for the effectiveness of delivery of care across the spectrum.  There would be a large cost saving.</p><p> I again request what we have repeatedly asked of the Minister.  I ask him to engage and sit down with us.  The question is why he is not sitting down with us.  Any public servant with a role to deliver more effective and efficient service in the State should sit down with the organisation that is coming to the table with solutions and pointing out the direction of travel.  If that public servant is not sitting down with that organisation, it indicates a problem somewhere on the other side.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il's position is unambiguous.  In government we would reverse this in full and immediately.  We included it as one of the top priorities for the budget negotiations and although we saw movement on some matters, for the second year in the row we got no movement on this issue.  I do not understand it and it makes no sense.  It is not logical.  When I saw the budget documents yesterday, it really bothered me that there was no provision made for this.  The delegate will understand as someone who worked in the Department of Finance that there is a loose suggestion that all parties will come together for talks with the Government at some undetermined date in the future, but there is no provision made in the budget for next year for bringing about the reversal if the talks are successful.  We heard from the Medical Council earlier that for every one doctor leaving medicine in 2014, three doctors left in 2018.  It feels like we have passed a tipping point in the collapse of access.</p> <p>  Perhaps I might get the thoughts of the delegates on a final point.  The shortfall in the number of doctors is far more than what we typically speak about.  Dr. O'Hanlon indicated the shortfall was approximately 500 consultants; there are approximately 3,300 approved posts and we are missing approximately 500 full-time consultants in thse posts.  That is a number that would keep us from having the lowest level of consultants in Europe.  Accepting that the figure is 43% below average, based on the latest data, getting to the European average number of consultants for our size of population would require us to add approximately 1,600 posts.  If we are just to get to the European average, therefore, we need to fill the 500 posts and hire an additional 1,600 consultants.  That suggests we are short more than 2,000 consultants.  Does the Irish Hospital Consultants Association have a view on what it would take just to get to a normal level of doctors in this country?</p></speech>

We could compare the number to that in Scotland which has 60% more consultants.  As it also has more beds, those consultants can work more efficiently.  Going back to the Deputy's earlier question, there is a feeling of inertia and helplessness in that the Government is not really making any change in the health service, as far as I can see.  There is much talk about what might happen ten years from now, but this is something that could be tackled relatively quickly and it would stabilise the system.</p></speech>

I am not just referring to their day jobs which would probably be enough for most people, as they do additional advocacy work.  As a former shop steward, or whatever term one may use, I know that work is done in one's own time and at the expense of time spent with families, etc, but it is appreciated.</p> <p>  I have a few questions, but I will begin by referring briefly to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  I had the pleasure of attending the IHCA annual delegate conference at which I spoke to one of the delegates' colleagues.  He advised me of the mechanism being used with the NTPF and the targeting of those who had been waiting the longest for their first appointment.  Such persons are being wiped off the list after seeing a private consultant, but they are then placed on another list.  They are not getting any closer to getting better, rather they are being shifted from a list that looks atrocious to one that looks slightly better.  They will soon be joined by others.  Will the delegates explain how the process works and the real impact of the NTPF which is sometimes sold as a mechanism to solve the problem of waiting lists?</p> <p>  I do not have and have never had private health insurance.  People in my immediate family do not have it and most people in my extended family do not have it.  There was mention of 1 million people without insurance and they are not anonymous to me.  They are not just people I see in my advice clinics either.  They are my close family members and this is not something I must read about in the newspapers.  I live this experience.  Will the delegates explain the impact of the NTPF?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100900002#T00500"><p>The purpose of the NTPF is to be a short-term sticking plaster solution, while we add capacity in the public sector.  Essentially, money is being transferred from the public health system to the private system.  When there is such low staffing and restricted access, there is major risk to patients who have to wait.  We are forced into a position where we must try to buy access to quality care wherever it is possible to do so.  Deputy O'Reilly's point is absolutely correct as if people are seen and have their first outpatient appointment, they might need a scan and be transferred to another list.  They would be new to that list.  The numbers might improve, but we must see the impact on the patient.  What would work for patients is having enough consultants in posts to provide access to care in order that everybody can be seen within six weeks.  It is something we could achieve if we all worked together with a shared vision and a focus on patients by listening to them and responding to their needs.  That is what the Peoples Needs Defining Change platform in the HSE is all about.  It is about reacting to the changing and ageing population, where one person in eight is over 65 years to where one in six will be over 65 by 2030.  The NTPF is just a short-term sticking plaster.  We need capacity in public hospitals.  Dr. O'Hanlon mentioned Scotland.  It has twice the number of consultants and 30% more beds.  We need investment to provide capacity in the public sector because the NTPF is very expensive.  Investing in the health service is not just about increasing the budget but spending the money properly on front-line staff and in providing capacity to facilitate the treatment of patients.  The quote from Warren Bennis is that we are "over-managed and under-led".  Therefore, we need the leadership to show the vision of investing in the public health system in order that we will be staffed at capacity to meet the changing population's needs.</p></speech>

We have widely acknowledged that there is a national difficulty in recruiting doctors and consultants, particularly in regional hospitals.  I am based in the west and north west where there are examples of recruitment difficulties.  For example, in Letterkenny four acute medicine posts have been brought to advertisement recently and there has been a failure to fill three of them.  One third of the hospital's necessary radiologist posts are filled, while half of the emergency department posts are filled on a permanent basis.  There is a difficulty in filling posts in Mayo University Hospital and Sligo where posts must be advertised two, three or more times.  Some of them remain unfilled.  The effect is that in County Mayo there are over 8,000 people waiting for an outpatient appointment, according to the NTPF waiting lists.  In County Sligo there are almost 17,000 people on the lists, while in Letterkenny there are just under 18,000 on the lists.  Between the three hospitals which have clear difficulties in recruiting consultants, there are 22,800 people waiting for over six months to be seen at an outpatient clinic.  We can directly correlate the recruitment difficulties with the long NTPF waiting lists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.735" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conall Dennedy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100900002#U00100"><p>We base many of our statistics on what we see on the NTPF waiting lists.  I would like to point to an inaccuracy I have seen in the figures quoted by the NTPF for the waiting list for endocrinology in Galway, where I work as an endocrinologist.  According to the NTPF figures, there are 144 patients waiting for an outpatient appointment at our centre for diabetes and endocrinology.  The longest waiting time quoted on the site is up to 12 months.  As I said, I work in Galway University Hospital.  As I triage the general endocrinology waiting list, I am familiar with the real figures.  There are 1,543 patients waiting for an outpatient appointment to see an endocrinologist in Galway.  Some 890 patients have been waiting for more than six months to see an endocrinologist in Galway, of whom 50 have been waiting for more than three years.  Based on the endocrinology waiting list in Galway University Hospital alone, the official figures on the NTPF's website represent a tenfold underestimate of the actual numbers of patients who are waiting.  I can see from the figures in front of me that the longest waiting time has been underestimated by approximately two years and four months.  I will explain what this means in a patient context.  I suspect that this also applies to paediatrics.  I have seen a significantly higher number of paediatric endocrinology referrals to the adult endocrinology clinic in Galway.  By the time a child over the age of 13 years has waited the three to four years required to see a specialist paediatric endocrinologist, he or she will be classified as an adult.  This denies children access to endocrine healthcare at a vital stage in their development - I emphasise that endocrinology is vital to the development of children - and to the transitional care model which represents best international care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.736" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100900002#U00200"><p>The figures that cited by Dr. Dennedy are shocking.  My views and those of my party on the NTPF are well known.  It is not going to be news to the delegates that we do not think investment in the private sector will improve the public sector.  Such investment has never helped the public sector and will never do so.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about what is being done.  Representatives of the Medical Council have told the committee about the culture in which medicine is practised.  When they were questioned, it became obvious that an understaffed medical facility was a tense and fraught atmosphere in which to work.  The delegates from the Medical Council described the culture in which medicine was practised as almost toxic.  It is not that the individuals working in the sector are toxic but that the organisation is dysfunctional.  It is no reflection on the people working in it; it is more of a reflection on the system.  It has been suggested some doctors and consultants who are abroad might be available to come home.  I know that some of the delegates have returned from overseas and their return is most welcome.  Is anything specific being done in that regard?  When we speak to individual hospital managers, we learn that they use informal networks for these purposes.  One such manager has told me that people with whom she was in school now have sons and daughters who are working overseas as doctors and consultants.  She is working hard to try to get them to come home.  Are the delegates aware of any specific measure being taken to make it attractive for consultants who are abroad to come home?  Are packages being offered?  Is every effort being made to attract doctors back to Ireland?  Is it simply the case, as I suspect it is, that the word is out that the Irish health service is a deeply unattractive place in which to work and that Irish doctors overseas are deterred from returning home on that basis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100900002#U00300"><p>Many of us have come back from abroad.  Dr. Durcan likes to say Irish people are like salmon in the sense that they want to come home.  Irish people are very passionate about their healthcare system and really want to contribute to it.  The reality is that when one goes away to work in different systems that are properly staffed and have the capacity needed, it is very hard to come back to work in a system that does not work for patients.  I will explain what I mean by referring to the concept of moral injury which comes from the military.  It means that doctors tend to move into healthcare because they care about people, want to help patients and improve things.  When an endocrinologist like Dr. Dennedy is working in our system, he deals with patients who have to wait 12 or 18 months to access the CT or other scans that determine the next forms of treatment they need.  In such circumstances, the greatest impact is on the patient.  It is hugely damaging for them and their lived experience.  For the doctor who wants to help and improve things, there is a moral injury that occurs day in, day out when he or she is working in such conditions.</p> <p>  We have heard about the culture in the medical sector and the bullying that happens.  There is a very high level of burnout among doctors in our system.  When people start to burn out, the first thing that starts to happen is dehumanisation.  Doctors start to lose their empathy for others because they are so overstretched.  Our consultants have huge workloads.  Staffing levels are at half of the European average.  Consultants have to run around to cover the gaps.  They try to protect patients from risk.  They try to pick out the person among all of those who have been on the waiting list for 18 months who has a hidden cancer or a degenerative neurological condition that needs earlier intervention.  They have to manage significant levels of risk.  There are substantial levels of burnout and moral injury as a result of being unable to provide care.</p> <p>  Any time I treated a child in Boston who needed an MRI scan, I was able to ask his or her parents whether an appointment that evening or on the following Saturday would be best for them from a employment point of view.  I was able to ask parents what worked best for them.  As a doctor, there is great satisfaction in being able to provide care when people need it in a way that is responsive to their needs.  Doctors in our system do not experience this because of the lack of capacity.  No amount of resilience training or packages will help.  We need to staff our teams.  I appreciate that pay parity, pay equality and equal pay for equal work are  some of the basic things in which Deputy O'Reilly's party believes.  For us, it is a basic part of safe staffing and making the workplace attractive.  Proportionately, we train the highest number of doctors in Europe.  Our doctors are of a really high quality and can go anywhere.  They are loved in the New Zealand and Australian medical systems.</p></speech>

Our teams in emergency departments are firefighting on the front line.  We have 89 emergency department consultants across 29 acute emergency departments.  There are 42 such consultants in one part of Australia alone.  We have exported our medical talent and need to bring them back now.  We need to change the narrative.  To be honest, the Government has been at war with consultants for ten years.  It has to stop.  We are the Government's full-forward line.  Consultants are part of a health team that includes the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE.  We have to work with patients as part of a team to deliver care.  As I said, the narrative has to change.  Health has to stop being a political football that is used for political gain by people on either side of the political divide.  We have to start putting patients in the centre where they are.  None of us has a job without the public and patients.  We would all do well to remember that.</p></speech>

It still goes on.  When we start to talk about pay parity and working conditions, it tends to be a very short conversation.  I am not aware of any initiative in the past few years that sought to recruit Irish doctors working abroad.  The nursing initiative was not that successful, but at least it was an attempt to bring people back.  The final point I would like to make about recruitment is that fewer jobs are being advertised, partly because there is a fear that applicants will not come forward.</p></speech>

Is the IHCA aware of an elevated level of mental ill health among consultants due to the shortages?  I am not aware of any specific effort being made by the Government to provide for pay parity.  Without putting words in anyone's mouth, I do not think the delegates are aware of any such initiative either.  Nothing in the outcome of the budgetary negotiations, as announced yesterday in the Minister's Budget Statement, suggests pay parity is on the agenda.

No engagement is scheduled.  We would not necessarily know if people were developing mental health problems.

She asked if efforts were being made to recruit highly trained specialists to come back to take up posts in Ireland.  An excellent Irish specialist trainee who spoke at our conference, Dr. Toby Gilbert, is now a consultant at the Royal Adelaide Hospital.</p><p>He presented his views on that, and did so quite well.  He has a stay or go decision to make in his life <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>his career.  The stay means staying in Australia and the go means going home and being with his family and friends and back in the Irish health service.  His conclusion was that for as long as there is pay inequality, he has no decision to make.  It is already made for him.  That is the problem.  The difficulty we have is that for as long as successive Ministers for Health perpetuate the inequality that was introduced in 2012, it will continue to drive away our highly trained specialists who are embraced in other services and given all the resources they need to treat patients on time.<br/><br/>One third of the graduate classes, the intern classes, goes to Australia each year from all the colleges and locations.  More than 200 interns are in the Perth hospitals.  They go from there to other hospitals and they stay.  They are very well looked after.  It is not about being looked after but being valued.  They are valued to the extent that there is no discrimination.  They are also given the resources to treat patients on time.  They are the two basic ingredients to get people back.</p></speech>

The Chairman knows me too well.  I have a few questions and I do not wish to go over old ground.  I have great sympathy with regard to the pay differential.  None of us can give a guarantee of being in the Oireachtas or in government after the next election, but the issue will certainly have to be dealt with by any coalition that is in place.  It is high time it was dealt with because it is a significant contributing factor.  Given my age profile, I know many of the people who are affected by it.  I have a practical question.  Is the IHCA affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU?</p></speech>

We are very concerned that the funding will not be put in place to provide the replacement equipment that is long overdue, the 2,600 additional beds that are in the national development plan, which will cost &euro;2.6 billion, and the staff for those beds.  If we were convinced that the funding would be provided, we would examine how to do all the things that are recommended in Sl&aacute;intecare and engage very positively in that regard.  We have a genuine concern that the funding will not be provided and we do not have the luxury of rejecting &euro;7 billion in a decade that we otherwise need.</p></speech>

The issue for me is that I deal with acute patients who present at the emergency department.  I have no understanding of whether they have private healthcare or what type of funding they are bringing with them to the emergency department.  These are people with strokes and heart attacks.  They are too sick to use the private system.  What we are here today to discuss is creating access for everybody to the public system.  Martin Varley is saying that whether one decides to have private health insurance should be an irrelevance.  If somebody decides to have private health insurance and have his or her tonsils dealt with in Blackrock, that is the person's own business.  The truth is that any of us could be in a car crash on the way home, and if we suffer trauma, we go to the public hospital.  If we have a stroke, we go to the public hospital.  This discussion is about the public hospital.  If the public hospital had enough consultants and beds, how people are funding their healthcare would become a complete irrelevance.  It would be just that they go to the hospital.  That is why we are here today.</p> <p>  I do not have a private practice and have no vested interest in private patients.  I am here because I want to make things better.  We want to make things better and for VHI, Laya Healthcare or the like to be a choice.  Whether that lines up with Sl&aacute;intecare or with the de Buitl&eacute;ir report will be borne out over time with a great deal of discussion.  What we want is for everybody to be able to access timely care in an emergency department and be seen by excellent people.  That has yet to be borne out.</p></speech>

Our acute hospitals get &euro;4.5 billion in funding, so &euro;700 million of funding from private health insurance being taken out is a huge loss of funding.  I work in paediatrics and very few children have private health insurance.  I do not know when they are coming to me if they have private heath insurance.  My concern, when I look at our recruitment issue, is that our recruitment issues are most prevalent in the specialties where there is the least private practice and the most type A contracts, such as emergency, psychiatry and my specialty, which is paediatric radiology.  I am concerned that if the private income were to be removed, our recruitment and retention crisis would get worse.  I work with equipment in both of the hospitals I work with that is beyond its end of life and has not been replaced.  There is a huge need for investment in the capacity, the people and the infrastructure.  I worry that &euro;700 million a year being taken out of our &euro;4.5 billion a year funding will have a catastrophic impact if it is not replaced.  I am being very honest with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

I am with Dr. Colleran when it comes to the two-tier system.  It cannot operate anymore and the drawbacks are huge.  The finances of it do not make sense.  It is obvious it cannot continue.</p> <p>  On changes to contracts, we also need to have greater transparency with the public-private mix because that would help everyone.  It would help the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, it would help us as decision makers and it would help in the provision of funding.  We will have to have it to deal with that turnaround period of time in the next decade or so to achieve what we want to achieve with Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is my last comment on that matter.</p> <p>  I come from the mid-west.  I am on a campaign at the moment regarding University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  The Chairman is my colleague in this campaign.  Neither of us is even from Limerick.  We are from Tipperary and Clare, but it is our main hospital.  It is a scandal if one does a comparative analysis on the volume of doctors and consultants in UHL versus Beaumont Hospital.  They are both model 4 hospitals.  I have the tables done on this analysis and it is a disgrace.  It cannot continue.  The people of the mid-west are being discriminated against.  UHL had eight medical physicians and consultants who left in recent years.  A number of them joined different organisations.  Two of them moved because they had more than 100 patients on their lists and they just could not cope.</p> <p>  I have only one more question after this but I asked the Medical Council of Ireland about this earlier and it did not have very good quantitative analysis, to be fair to it.  It will improve that based on suggestions we made.  I return to the issue of why consultants are leaving.  There are a variety of reasons for this, and I dare say they are not always financial, although some of them are.  Working conditions and geography are other variables.  Are there any instances of consultants leaving that are specifically geography related based on the structures of the HSE in certain locations or does the Irish Hospital Consultants Association have any evidence of same?</p></speech>

I demonstrated earlier that our waiting lists at Beaumont Hospital have plummeted as our consultant staffing levels have come up.  The outpatient lists in UHL and the wait times are as a direct result of consultant understaffing.  The Deputy is completely right about that.</p> <p>  The geographics of the country have always been a factor.  We spoke to-----</p></speech>

Also in the mid-west, we do not have a private hospital.  We have Barringtons Hospital, but the witnesses know what I mean.  We do not have a full overnight private hospital.  I am trying to correlate the figures based on the structures.  Our region is the only one that got reconfiguration.  We were reconfigured before the solutions to capital funding were ever provided.  We are an outlier in that regard.  I am trying to see if there are correlations with those leaving because of that.</p></speech>

As the Deputy says, there are people who will have 100 patients on their bed on a Monday morning at their ward round having done a whole weekend, and that sounds horrendous.</p> <p>  On the geographical challenges in Ireland, if we look to the past, there have always been people who have wanted to staff the regional hospitals.  The fall in staffing in the regional hospitals has been very recent.  It is really only since 2012 that we have seen that there are no applicants for those jobs.  There were gastroenterology jobs in University Hospital Waterford that had ten or 12 applicants in the past.  If a gastroenterologist job in University Hospital Waterford were to be advertised now, it would be a good result if one suitable applicant came forward to fill it.  The same can be said for all the other hospitals.  There have always been people who have wanted to be county physicians and there have always been people who have wanted to be down the country for many different reasons.  Historically, there have not been specific geography challenges, but now there are hospital challenges whereby people are slow to come home for a different salary and, equally, they are slow to come home to a hospital that is almost entirely staffed by locums.  They do not want to work there.</p></speech>

I was very much taken by what the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said recently about having no confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I have been very much taken by what the witnesses have said here today.  I want to quote what the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said on escalating a campaign, and I would like it to give us more information on what that campaign is.  That is the first question.</p> <p>  The second question is as follows.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association said the Minister did not have "the authority, understanding, inclination or experience to deliver timely, quality hospital care ... or improving conditions for patients".  Very few people have been as critical of the Minister on various different issues as I have.  Others have as well, to be fair to them.  I am saying this as an Opposition spokesperson, but the tone of that statement did not help the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  I have to be brutally honest about this.  It did not help.  I listened carefully to what the witnesses said earlier about being on the one team, stopping this being a political football, and that the different sides of the political divide do not matter.  There are many sides to the political divide here, not just two.  The witnesses may want to really remember that because I am not sure it comes across a lot of the time.  There is huge sympathy across politics with the issues the Irish Hospital Consultants Association are dealing with and the consequences for patients.  Again, I am saying all of this as an Opposition spokesperson and I have put out statements that are critical of the Minister on numerous issues, but to refer to the Minister's inclination, understanding and experience, particularly to refer to his experience, needs an explanation.  Also, when the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said it was escalating its campaign, what did that mean and how will it manifest itself?</p></speech>

That was a response to a feeling of anger and frustration throughout the membership of the association throughout the country.

Our last meeting was in early March.  He agreed to meet us and to speak at our conference in mid-September.  He wrote with his apologies that he could not attend that meeting and committed to meet us in the following week or so.  Despite numerous calls to his private secretary, I got no response to engage.  That has been the pattern and not just in recent months.  When one is trying to come to the table with solutions and to engage, it becomes quite frustrating and difficult for people who are trying to deliver care in difficult circumstances on the front line.<br/><br/>There was a question of what we are doing with our Care Can't Wait campaign, which I will get to.  A number of months ago, when we met the Minister, we determined that an avalanche of problems were brought to our attention that we had to highlight relating to the difficulties in delivering timely, quality care to patients.  We touched on some of them today.  For example, in University Hospital Limerick, six whole-time pathology post are approved.  There has been failure to fill one third of those posts over the last seven years, having been advertised repeatedly, and it is causing major problems in timely diagnostics.  It is also jeopardising the post mortem service, which people like to see delivered in a short time for all the obvious reasons.  That is now hanging by a thread and has been for the last number of months.<br/><br/>I watched the committee's earlier engagement with the Medical Council and the Deputy asked a pertinent question for which I do not think it had an answer.  He asked if the shortage of consultants and the overstretched nature of work in hospitals is giving rise to increased claims.  I checked the situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the State Claims Agency and clinical claims.  In 2010, there were 1,935 active claims.  Last year, which is the most recent year we have statistics for, there were 3,196, a 65% increase in less than a decade.  That is indicative of what we think is happening and we know why it is happening.  Patients rightly have an expectation to get timely, quality care.  When 1 million people are on a waiting list, that does not happen.  People arrive and their treatment is effective insofar as it can be, but it is too late in some cases.  Patients have a reason then to feel short-changed.  I would if I was in their situation and I certainly hope that I am never in that situation.  To be left on a waiting list not knowing how serious is one's problem is not good.  It does not help with having a good flow and effective treatment of patients in hospitals, and makes their stay longer.<br/><br/>There is significant frustration with the system.  Two cardiology posts have been advertised in Kerry and are unfilled.  One locum is in position.  One geriatrician post has been advertised but the hospital has not been able to recruit for it.  There is a vacant obstetric post filled by a locum.  A radiology post has been advertised numerous times and cannot be filled.  A half-time haematology post is vacant.  A histopathology post has been transferred to Cork University Hospital.  We have major recruitment problems and there is a knock-on effect for patients and stress for doctors and consultants.  The Care Can't Wait campaign is about ventilating the real problem.</p></speech>

I did an interview with Galway Bay FM yesterday.  We need to engage with Deputies in their own areas, as is happening in Limerick.  We have to be objective about the problems and make them known.  We will appeal to Deputies to engage with the Ministers responsible in order that we do not see a repeat of an earlier discussion, where we asked why we were not having engagement on an issue that is win-win.  My concern is that we are getting disengagement by official Ireland on one of the most important services that the population needs.  Disengagement means that if a Minister does not meet one for seven months, despite repeated promises, then one has to call it out.  We have a job to do and all of our members are frustrated.</p></speech>

Please excuse the pun.  I thank them for their patience with the system as it is.  I am almost fully aware of the challenges that they face every day.  I seek clarity on a few things.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is often lauded.  Yesterday was budget day and the fund had &euro;100 million as of this budget, if my memory serves me correctly, having had &euro;75 million last year.  It is always lauded as being great that this spend exists.  As some of the witnesses probably know, I work as a pharmacist at times but have worked in the hospital sector too.  It seems that part of the health service is essentially subcontracted to a private company, whether in Dublin or abroad, and it is not as simple as just having a great value service.  It is a success for somebody who gets an operation done abroad.  Will the witness who is best placed to explain tell the committee and people at home what the impacts of that are?  A person might get the operation but what about administration and follow-on care?  It is an expensive way of doing business, from my reading of it.</p></speech>

In those cases, patients have gone to a private hospital for their first-time visit and if they are diagnosed with something or require further follow-up, they then go to the original unit as a return patient.  That is dreadful for the person.  The consultant in charge of that unit has not met the person who is now a return patient to the service with a rheumatological diagnosis.  The same happens in many different places.  It is something to be avoided for medical outpatients with conditions that need chronic care because it is a disaster.</p> <p>  I see many patients with joint replacements who have gone north of the Border or to other places to get their hips or knees done.  It works really well for a young, healthy person who does really well with a hip or a knee and comes back saying it was fabulous and a great experience.  Unfortunately, it becomes very difficult when somebody has a poor experience or does not necessarily do well with it.  That person is then back in the public system with the complications of an operation that were done by somebody else.</p></speech>

With all due respect to my surgical colleagues, nobody likes cleaning up someone else's mess.  It is difficult for those patients to then be cared for by someone with a surgical speciality who did not do the operation.  That chronic care is a major problem for patients.</p> <p>  Last week, I had a lady in who had a knee operation in Santry under the NTPF.  She came back in and said that she thought she needed to have her other knee done and really wanted it to be done in Santry.  I said that I did not think the knee was that bad.  She said that it would be two years before she got to Santry and asked if I would refer her now so that she can get into Santry in two years.  I did not do that but it changes patients' expectations of how healthcare works.  I think it is a very short-sighted intervention but it is necessary at times.</p></speech>

I am an endocrinologist.  We deal with diabetes, which requires a multidisciplinary care structure.  We often hear of efforts to get people off diabetes waiting lists by referring them to the NTPF.  If one tries to take someone off a diabetes waiting list and takes that person out of that multidisciplinary care setting, that person may be seen be a single consultant, the waiting list may be massaged, and he or she may be put on metformin or such.  Individuals who are complicated patients may have been taken from a primary care situation and placed in that setting.  Where do patients get their footcare and eyecare?  What diabetes specialist nurse or advanced nurse practitioner can they ring up to adjust insulin should they be put on insulin?  Those structures do not exist, for the most part, within private healthcare.  Massaging a waiting list by taking somebody who requires that level of multidisciplinary care off the waiting list, by getting them a single visit to the NTPF, is not logical.</p></speech>

Set, contained procedures can work but our view is that we should mainly be using this funding to fund the capacity in public hospitals.  Moving to outsourcing outpatient appointments, as we have heard from the two consultants present, is not really effective because the same patients come back in and need treatment in public hospitals.</p><p>Unfortunately, they will, in all likelihood, go back in at the end of the queue.  It is a very cynical exercise, which does not deliver value for money.</p><p> I was speaking to a nephrologist in Tullamore, one of our main hospitals, earlier today.  Normally that hospital has two nephrologists, but the second person took a post in another hospital.  One nephrologist has been carrying the work of two for the past five years in Tullamore.  The post has been advertised three times but there are no eligible candidates.  The waiting list for an outpatient appointment is two and a half years, whereas the ideal is for patients to be seen within three to four months in order that urgent cases can be diagnosed.  This type of scenario plays out all across the country; I am merely giving the committee a few vignettes to illustrate the problems.  The situation is causing difficulties for patients, GPs and community services.  Until we sort it out, the problems will spiral into greater problems throughout the whole health service.</p></speech>

That is an extremely serious problem.  When we are discussing waiting lists, different figures, and &euro;20 million for this and that, the whole message can be lost.  Will one of the witnesses explain, as concisely as possible, the impact of this particular situation?  It seems to me that more than 50% of NCHDs are not wedded to the system.  They are almost transient, taking their pay at the end of the week and going home and closing their eyes without a worry.  On the other hand, there is a cohort of people working in the system for whom it is their whole life.  Nobody does the job the witnesses do for a laugh.  To my mind, it is a vocation.  What are the impacts on the system into the future when more than half of the people involved are just doing the job and going home, as such?  They are doing an important job but they are not in the system and helping to create a matrix that can be built upon.</p></speech>

On 25 September, a conference took place in University College Cork, organised by Professor John Browne, director of the SPHeRE research and training programme, to discuss the recruitment challenges for smaller hospitals.  Professor Frank Murray, formerly professor of gastroenterology at Beaumont Hospital and now director of the HSE's national doctors training and planning, NTTP, unit, gave a presentation on exactly the topic to which the Deputy referred.  Things have not always been as they are now.  In 2010, for instance, only 30% of non-consultant hospital doctors were in non-training posts.  This year, for the first time, that cohort is at more than 50%.  It is a very bad situation to be in because when trainees are in training posts, they are affiliated to a college and faculty, take examinations and have training days, and can access a range of supports that come with being affiliated to a training scheme.</p> <p>  Moreover, the distribution of these non-training posts is not equitable, with smaller hospitals affected to a greater extent than the larger hospitals.  The same hospitals that have a high proportion of empty posts, locum consultants and non-specialist consultants also have the highest proportion of non-trainee NCHDs in post.  This leads to inequitable access to care for patients and an unsupported experience for the doctors in those roles.  In order for a post to be a training post, however, there must be a permanent consultant in post who is a trainer.  We have ended up in a horrendous chicken and egg cycle where we do not have enough permanent consultants to be trainers and not enough training posts.  As a consequence, there has been an explosion in the number of non-training NCHDs.  We cannot fill our permanent consultant posts, we do not have enough training posts and the hospitals are left desperately trying to cover the service and provide the care.  That has to change.</p></speech>

The latter must have equitable access to training and specialisation so that when they finish, they can either go on the specialist register and become consultants here or will have acquired the excellence skills to do the same in their own countries.

I know the background to this because we submitted a freedom of information request concerning the cost of agency doctors in certain hospitals where we knew people who are not specialists had been appointed in a temporary capacity through agency contracts.  Not only are we paying them double the normal salary for consultants who are not new entrants and triple what new entrants are being paid, but those doctors are not specialist trained.  That raises several concerns.</p></speech>

It also is in breach of the Medical Practitioners Act, which prohibits persons who are not on the specialist register from practising independently.  A consultant is described as a doctor who can practise independently.  The HSE is well aware that it is in breach of its own guidelines in this regard.  Proper supervised training cannot be provided by somebody who is not on the specialist register.</p></speech>

I understand that Beaumont Hospital has lost several dermatologists to the private sector, leaving only one permanent dermatologist in post.  What seems to be happening now is that patients are essentially being subcontracted out to the people who used to work in the system.  The seriousness of this type of thing sometimes gets lost in discussion.  There is the idea when a person's knee is fixed or he or she is put on metformin, that everything is hunky-dory.  The witnesses are working in the system and are worn out talking about the problems in it, as are we, but I am not sure whether people at home really understand how much these types of challenges can affect their lives.  When staff are shed, as happened in Beaumont, there is a significant impact on patient care.</p></speech>

The people who are not yet patients are the first to be affected.</p><p>Obviously there will no longer be anybody left in those posts to see new patients so we are left with the urgent dermatology referrals.

If a GP thinks a person has a melanoma then he or she should be straight in.  We have a huge cohort of patients who are lesion query cancer.  The second cohort of patients that are not being seen are the people with what I would call routine cases, but which are still horribly life changing conditions such as psoriasis, eczema and so on.  Those kinds of chronic conditions also need to be seen in the dermatology clinic, but they are on the other side of the waiting list.</p> <p>  In addition to that we have the responsibility to patients.  If a person is a patient of one of those people who have left, and if the patient is, for example, on a biological therapy for severe skin disease, or possibly on methotrexate - a form of chemo - for a severe skin disease, that person then has nobody to follow his or her progress over time.</p></speech>

The service as it stands has nowhere to put those patients.  We are having a huge change around to try to establish which patients are on the most toxic medications so we can pull them out and they can be seen safely.  There is the clinical risk for those who have not yet been seen, which is huge, and there is also the clinical risk for those people who are already established patients of a service, who will also not be seen in their follow-up appointments.  Both of those are really dreadful scenarios when someone leaves a post.  It is what happens when any post is emptied anywhere in the country.  This is what one is left with; the new cases and also all of the returned patients who have a diagnosis.  It is dreadful.</p></speech>

It was said earlier that politics should be taken out of medicine.  Where did I hear that before?  It has been ever thus, unfortunately.  Think back to 2003 and 2004 when the health boards were abolished.  The purpose of that exercise, according to the consultants with whom I had regular consultations at the time, was to take politics out of medicine and that it was going to work much better.  It was not true.  The consultants were wrong.  It was the wrong diagnosis and they missed the point.  It had nothing to do with it at all.  The politics at local level in medicine at that time had the effect of gingering up the system and creating a combative approach within the system that everybody tried to deal with as best they could.</p> <p>  I am also concerned about another issue.  In a previous presentation this morning there was a reference to bullying in the workplace.  Unfortunately, consultants were mentioned in that context also.  My question to the witnesses is how much of that goes on and why does it go on?  In anticipation that the answer might be "when we are under stress we all tend to bully others", if that is the case then there would be an awful lot of bullying going on in here, and the Chairman would know this too.  I want an answer to that please.  There is no excuse for bullying in the workplace.  It is illegal.</p></speech>

The Deputy's situation is a little bit different from ours.</p> <p>  On the serious matter of bullying, which does exist in medicine and in medicine in Ireland, it is not just non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, who are bullied even though the rates of bullying for NCHDs are slightly higher than for consultants.  The rate of bullying of consultants is also very high.  Who does it?  It is other consultants, managerial staff, nurses, patients and families.  It is totally unacceptable but it reflects a system that is toxic from within, and some of that is down to the fact that people are too overstretched.  One may dismiss this as if it does not matter but there is a lot of research on burnout and its impact on people.  The first thing that happens is dehumanisation.  If one is overworked to the point of being mentally affected by it, the first thing that happens is that it becomes easier to be rude, to be mean and to be difficult with others because one perceives oneself to be under inappropriate stress.  Is this what we want?  Is this a system in which people flourish?  No, it is not.  Part of changing this requires us to change the culture and what is acceptable.  It is about safe staff, a high quality and safe service, open disclosure and a just culture.  All of this comes back to having enough people on the team to provide the service.  Many of us are on rosters with half the number of people we should have.  We are providing 24-7 care.  Many of us here on this panel will be up multiple times during the night and will still have worked the full day the previous day and will work a full day the day after.  Many of us are operating in situations where our workloads are far in excess of what is safe.  We are constantly trying to protect our patients from risk, trying to train our NCHDs, and we come under huge pressure.  Is bullying ever acceptable? No, it is not.  Has it been a problem in our system for years? Yes it has.  Many of us here display leadership in being the change we want to see for our own teams and our own NCHDs.  We need to have enough staff on the teams to be able to provide the service safely.</p></speech>

I know the witness is anxious to give replies but tarry a little.  We will wait and see.  The then Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, was named as the culprit in 2012.  I am not certain as to whether any suggestion was made by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association as to how best that particular situation could be handled.  Most of the country was broke, serious cuts were coming down the track, GPs had to make sacrifices and to accept cuts, judges had make sacrifices and to accept cuts, as did everybody right across the board.  Nobody liked it and nobody wanted to do it but the then Minister for Health did not go out at that time and decide &quot;I am going to punish the consultants, reduce their incomes and render them worthless&quot;.  There is a danger here.  I will not go along the path of my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, but he made the point that one can over-politicise medicine also.  It is not necessarily in the interests of the patient, the consultants or the system.</p><p>I have one more point, and the witnesses can answer all of them then.  Reference has been made to the State Claims Agency and a dramatic increase in recent years of &euro;184 million per year.  That is not unique to the health services.  The State Claims Agency in Ireland and its equivalent in other jurisdictions have had the same problem.  I can get the figures on those if the witnesses wish.  I am concerned that it is very easy to throw out the figures and say &quot;Look, this is the cause of our problem and we need more money&quot;.  Everybody needs more money.  Has the Irish Hospital Consultants Association<b></b>considered how much more money consultants need to deliver the services that the witnesses say they need?  I agree.  Can the witnesses can tell me the amount of money they need?  Is it &euro;3 billion? Is it &euro;4 billion? Is &euro;10 billion or &euro;20 billion?</p></speech>

We touched on some of these issues during our last exchange with the committee and I thank the Deputy for raising them again.</p> <p>  The reduction imposed on new entrant consultants in 2012 was an additional 30% on top of the 10% for new entrants.  It has never saved money, for reasons I can point to.  We have longer and longer waiting lists.  We are outsourcing more than an extra &euro;100 million next year.  Our agency bill has gone up to &euro;90 million.  That is the medical agency only, which is an increase of more than &euro;60 million.  Our cost of indemnity has quadrupled, and I only quote the cost of clinical indemnity that the State Claims Agency is responsible for.  If one compares this internationally, our costs of indemnity are much higher than any other jurisdiction.  There are a variety of reasons for this.  I am quite sure that our low staffing is a contributory factor.  A recent Medical Council report on training counts found that where trainees were working long hours - as often happens with a 50 or 60 hour week - there is quite a high incidence of being involved directly or indirectly in an adverse incident concerning a patient.</p><p>There is a correlation which the statisticians will see if they wish to go and do the work.  It is common sense that understaffed teams will lead to more clinical indemnity problems and that longer waiting lists will cause more adverse outcomes for patients.  We are dysfunctional in how we are managing the health service, not in how we are delivering it.  There are excellent staff on the front line who are doing their absolute best in extremely difficult circumstances.  The decision by Dr. James Reilly was not justified at the time and no other group of public servants was singled out for such a cut.  There was a related but not equivalent cut for the Judiciary, but it was reversed in full earlier this year.  One group of public servants has been left with a salary differential of between 30% and 40% and it is the one with the biggest recruitment and retention problems.  We want to engage with the Minister and have been seeking a meeting with him for the past seven months.  Making progress involves engagement.  When officials and the Minister do not sit down and engage with the body which represents 95% of consultants, we know that there is a problem.  The problem is not with the consultants who are seeking the meeting but with those who are not engaging.</p><p> The amount of money required to run an efficient and effective health service is multifactorial and we do not have the manpower to analyse it.  We spend &euro;1.23 billion less in Government funding on public hospitals than the EU average and have the lowest numbers of beds and consultants, with the highest bed occupancy.  In running any service such indicators would be used as guidelines in progressing and solving the problem.  We need to redirect funding to the front line to deliver care, meaning that acute hospitals and mental health services have to be funded appropriately.  The mental health service is very poorly funded by international comparisons, as are acute hospitals.  We want to sit around the table and work through these issues, but we are not in a position to tell anybody what the health service requires by way of funding for the future, as thousands of public servants are paid to do that job.  I was a public servant once, but I do not have to do it any more as I am preoccupied with a far wider brief.  I hope the public servants to whom I refer are prepared to meet us to brainstorm on the issues and come up with solutions.</p></speech>

The &euro;4.5 billion spent on acute hospitals is well below the figure for the OECD.  Mr. Varley was asked what was needed to provide a service.  I would compare Ireland with Scotland in that context.  Representatives from the Scottish system visited us recently and had a very productive meeting with the Minister for Health.  It has twice the number of consultants and 30% more beds.  I ask the Government to give us the staff and the capacity to enable us to do our jobs.  We do not want to be here throwing stones at the Minister; we want to work with the committee, to be leading, innovating and providing care for patients, for whom we are responsible.</p></speech>

We need to see an increase in the numbers of front-line staff treating patients.

The overrun in the health service this year will be &euro;310 million lower than last year, if one is to believe the figures included in the Budget Statement yesterday.  Something must have happened to reduce spending to that extent and I would like to know what it was, although I am not asking the question of the delegates today.  One worries that the reduction has led to an increase in unmet needs.  We are trying to find solutions.  If the director general of the HSE is to balance the books, services must be reduced or the system reformed.  Can the delegates demonstrate to the Minister that a restoration of consultant numbers and pay parity would reduce costs to the health service?  Can they demonstrate a relationship between restoring pay parity and saving money in the health service?  The HSE's service plan will be delivered in the next three or four weeks.  It invariably starts off with a statement to the effect that the money the HSE has been given this year will present challenges in delivering services similar to what was delivered last year, as well as in coping with innovation and the development of services.  A winter initiative will also be presented in the next few weeks.  It will include the cessation of elective care in December and January in order to free up beds.  That will lead to longer waiting lists.  Will the delegates comment on the association's campaign for pay parity in the context of delivering cost savings to the HSE?</p></speech>

Therefore, there are savings to be made in that area alone.  There are always background expenses related to providing sick cover and maternity cover, but addressing the locum bill could generate huge savings.  However, there are things that are harder to quantify such as the savings to be made in seeing and treating patients earlier.  In the context of Mr. Reid's attempts to balance the books, I ask everybody to give him a chance.  If he goes to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for additional funding, the fact that there has already been so much additional funding while waiting lists have got longer will make it more difficult for him.  He has had a few meetings with multiple consultants and senior leaders in nursing and midwifery, as well as allied health professionals, to discuss how we can save money without impacting on patients.  The impression I get from him is that he wants to show that he has a stable pair of hands and can manage the money in order that he can have investment where it is needed.  As consultants, we want to see that cost savings are not made in providing patient care but in eliminating waste within the service.  In any healthcare system across the world there is 30% waste.  Consultants are very keen to lead in that regard.  Dr. Durcan is involved with biosimilars which enable us to save money without an impact on patients as the priority is to ensure patient needs are met.</p></speech>

Therefore, taking it from the agency or locum bill, to get people in posts and have service development for patients, should be better than cost neutral.  We are selling the proposal as cost neutral, but we could actually save money on the locum bill, though I am loath to say that before it happens.</p><p>It should be possible to balance those.</p><p> In rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology, we use quite expensive biological drugs which cost a huge amount of money.  There has been a HSE initiative to bring on a biologic hub where one electronically prescribes these medications.  The HSE has put forward this programme where we prescribe biosimilars, which is similar to the concept of generic prescribing.  One prescribes the slightly cheaper version.  In return for that, the Government has set out that the units will be rewarded with a once-off payment in order to facilitate this kind of process.  The Irish Society of Rheumatology and my hospital will weigh in on this.</p><p> The truth, however, is that people want to weigh in in a scenario where they have a good relationship.  Rheumatology is full of nice people who want to help but there are other specialties which will kick back against this type of initiative.  There are many of my colleagues who do not want to engage in a process where they see a system that is flogging them to death but gives them nothing back.  It is undervaluing them and chasing them away.  If one has a system where one engages with the lead players to give patients the best service they can have, then it is a relationship that works both ways.  There are huge cost savings which we had in many different places.  At the moment, however, we are all operating in silos and we think those outside them hate us.  We may not be as facilitating as perhaps we could be.  That is being honest.</p></speech>

Surely the continuity of care with a permanent consultant delivers much more coherent and long-term quality of care than even the best-intentioned agency consultant or locum.  That must have an effect on patient care.</p></speech>

Somebody who is planning to spend the next 30 or 40 years working in an area is invested in looking for resources, as well as innovating, leading and bringing in the newest changes.  We have many excellent locums.  However, when one is transient, clocking in and clocking out, one is doing a clinical service job but one does not have the commitment to the education, the research or the quality improvement, namely, all those elements that consultant leadership brings.  Importantly, one is not a trainer.</p> <p>  One of the most important points going forward concerns our next generation, our excellent medical graduates who are wanted everywhere in the world.  Dr. Rita Doyle has been a magnificent advocate for non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and for all doctors.  She describes interns as the jewel in the crown.  We want our interns and NCHDs to see a future, leading and innovating within our health services.  It is important we really tackle this now because we are at a tipping point.  One in eight of the population is over 65 years of age.  By 2030, it will be one in six.  There will be a shortage in Europe of 200,000 doctors by 2030.  We need to hold on to our people.</p> <p>  We keep replacing the doctors, however.  We really need to fix our system to ensure our brilliant NCHDs want to work in our system.  Deputy Alan Kelly has left the meeting.  UHL and smaller hospitals around the country are at a tipping point.  I will not name the hospitals but there are some where the majority of consultants are either locums or non-specialists, as well as the majority of their NCHDs in non-training posts.  This is a health apartheid and it has to be tackled.  Until ten years ago, we had excellent physicians wanting to come back and work in these hospitals.  These are wonderful communities which are paying the same taxes.  They should expect the same access to health care.  We really have to fix this.</p></speech>

My hospital and other local hospitals are routinely staffed with locums.  I do not want anyone thinking that locums do not provide good quality care at the coalface.  At the moment, they are plugging a necessary gap.</p> <p>  However, the Chairman is correct that the biggest deficit we have is in the continuity of care for individual patients.  If one has not met a patient in clinic before, one is less likely to discharge them and more than likely to bring them back in six months.  This is because one does not really know them and not entirely sure if something might have been missed.  The next locum comes along and something similar happens.  This speaks to the efficiencies within the service.</p> <p>  I took up a post as a permanent consultant several years ago.  I do my day-to-day job but I also sit on several hospital committees.  A temporary appointment in a hospital will not take on such roles, however.  They will not get involved in drugs, therapeutics, policy-making decisions, clinical protocols, etc.  Those are the matters which really make a difference on a systemic level.  Locums can look after individual patients but it is not a way to run a service.</p></speech>

The last two require senior well-qualified individuals in permanent posts.  Somebody in a permanent academic post can, over the period of their career, bring in &euro;20 million to &euro;30 million in non-Exchequer training and research funding to train doctors for the future.  This is future planning and providing care for our doctors for the future.</p> <p>  Take the example of the ICAT programme, a group of eight physicians got together and applied to bring in &euro;16.5 million in non-Exchequer funding from the Wellcome Trust.  This programme funds doctors to do PhDs to be the academic and medical leaders of the future.  While also providing fantastic healthcare, it leaks into our academic system and universities whose falling rankings we should be trying to increase as well.  We have not mentioned medical students.  We want to teach them to become the doctors for the future, as well as to become the excellent consultants, clinician scientists and academics we need for the future to provide cutting-edge healthcare for our patients.</p></speech>

Based on the budget, we spend about &euro;5,000 million on acute hospitals.  Most business people would say that it is not beyond the stretch of capability to introduce a 1% productivity efficiency gain which, as it happens, is &euro;50 million.  This is way above the cost of putting the people in place on a permanent basis.</p> <p>  The effectiveness and benefit of having permanent staff compared with serial locums cannot be underestimated.  I am quite sure we are missing out on significant productivity and effectiveness gains by the way the service has evolved since the inequity and discrimination was introduced with these posts which were filled on a temporary or an expensive agency basis.</p> <p>  The maths on this is absolutely certain.  We have a situation we can resolve.  It would be better than cost-neutral when one looks at the benefits and cost savings.  I cannot understand why official Ireland is not engaging to do the necessary.</p></speech>

Dr. Colleran described a scenario in some hospitals where we have gone over the 50% threshold of non-specialists plus locums.  Will Dr. Colleran detail for us the potential impact of this?  I am referring to the context of non-specialists who, because they have a lawful entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration, work and are paid as consultants but are not eligible to be entered on the specialist register.</p><p>The HSE has advised that there are no specific supervisory arrangements in place for this cohort of workers.  Of course, how could there be?  My reading is that precious little is being done to convert them or address the situation.  Are the witnesses aware of any supervisory arrangements, specific or otherwise?  There have been varying responses from the HSE.  What is the impact on the ability to innovate and deliver a service of them not being on the specialist register?  I am not suggesting that they are not working, since they are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.877" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100900002#CC00200"><p>The Deputy's point relates to the definition of a consultant, which is a specialist consultant on the specialist register who is capable of independent practice.  The Deputy asked whether we were aware of a method of supervision for those who were practising as consultants but were not on the specialist register.  No, we are not.</p> <p>  My parents-in-law are from Kerry.  If they go to their local hospital and see someone with a consultant badge, I expect that that person is, by definition, on the specialist register.  What being on the specialist register means is that someone has gone through the appropriate training scheme and passed the relevant examinations.  There is a minimum standard that he or she has met.  If someone is not on the specialist register but is on the general register, the minimum it means is that he or she has passed an internship.  However, there can be a large discrepancy in what examinations they have passed and what experience they have.  For the public, it is false advertising if someone has a consultant badge and is not actually qualified in that way.  Speaking as someone with family outside Dublin, my concern is that the numbers are not spread evenly across our acute hospitals and are mainly concentrated in pockets.  I will not name the hospitals, but committee members could probably guess them.  It is a concern that there are pockets where there is a lack of permanent consultants, locums and non-specialist consultants who are not on the specialist register are in place, and the majority of NCHDs are not in training posts.  That is not the desired mix for a high-quality and safe service for patients.  Everyone in Ireland deserves timely access to a high-quality service.  We have to do better than this.</p> <p>  To be fair to the hospitals in question, they are desperately trying to provide the medical care that is needed.  When they do not have the qualified staff, they are faced with a choice between whether it is riskier not to provide any care or to have the care provided by someone who is not fully qualified to provide it independently.  I do not know of research in other countries into this question, as other countries do not do this.</p></speech>

I am actually a big fan of the Senator.  As Deputy Durkan stated, the country was on its knees.  We all accept that.  It was not just the Judiciary and the doctors, as pharmacists took a similar cut.  It had a massive impact on the sector.  That took the form of a reduced pay bill, but the long-term impact has been far greater.  It was essentially a false economy.  We had to balance the books at the time.</p> <p>  The impact of what we discuss in the Houses is sometimes difficult for people at home to understand.  Dr. Colleran has mentioned a person's expectation that the consultant his or her mammy meets in Tullamore or wherever is a real consultant.  We are all of an age to remember the yellow packs.  We do not want a devalued, inferior or two-tiered consultant.</p> <p>  It was always the case that doctors left college, entered the system, trained up and wanted to be consultants "when they grew up".  I am not trying to trivialise it.  As such, it is concerning that people are not even applying for jobs anymore.  A question has been asked about how much money is needed.  Some &euro;20 million has been requested for the restoration of pay, which would to some extent encourage people back into the profession and even out the differential between private pay in private hospitals and the public contract.  Although Sl&aacute;intecare commits to removing private care from the public system, my understanding is that, when the 2008 contract was negotiated, it was to ensure that a consultant was not disadvantaged by working in the public sector.  The contract was designed so that a consultant would not just leave to work in a private hospital.</p></speech>

I do not mean to be dramatic, but I am concerned.  I have read much of the material the witnesses have supplied.  We are clearly not breeding a new cohort of consultants, given that we are not training them.  If we are not paying them, they will stay abroad or go to the private sector.</p> <p>  Senator Burke often speaks about the differential in the recruitment of front-line staff versus managers.  If we are top heavy, what is the witnesses' view on the manager idea?  Is it to manage consultants?  What is the logic behind there being so many administrative staff and others in the system who do not cure or fix anything?  Is it an anti-consultant attitude, as in, consultants are always asking for things but they are grand really?  Why is the HSE placing more value on managers than people like consultants who can fix illness?</p></speech>

I was prefacing what I was going to say in case I was misinterpreted.  We have probably layered up management and administration by default over a series of reconfigurations and policy changes and by virtue of the fact that a proper effort was not made to determine how the service could be restructured possibly.  We could point to the change from the health boards to the HSE.  By the way, Deputy Durkan, the IHCA did not seek that.  In our most recent documents, we have encouraged an integration into regional areas where hospitals and community services would be put together.  Our main ask therein is for one streamlined team and one budget, for community services and hospitals to work together and for bureaucracy to be delayered.  This is not intended as a criticism of anyone who is in administration or management, but we have six administrative or management personnel for every consultant.  That is too high by international standards.  The fault rests with the failure to restructure, not the individuals.  The individuals probably do a very good job but, given the significant change in IT services, some of those functions and jobs may need to be redeveloped such that we would have less administration and less management.  This is where we can work together.  We can spend the money we have better, though.  There is no doubt about that.</p></speech>

One of the points that I made time and again was about the need to revert to original structures where there was local accountability and, as staff throughout the health services have indicated to me for many years, they got more satisfaction and were more dedicated.  I did not get what I wanted because everyone did not agree.  It was an all-party committee and it can be very difficult to get a committee to agree.  That is how the camel was invented in the first place.</p><p>However, we did get some part of what we wanted and there are regional structures in place.  I hope that will work out, with the benefit of local knowledge and a response at local level.  It cannot be done without that aspect.  Some of my perspective on this comes from my experience as Opposition health spokesperson in very difficult times.</p><p> The final point I wish to raise is one I have raised on many occasions in the past.  It relates to the ability, or lack thereof, to make a comparison between a private hospital and a public hospital within the system, size for size, consultant for consultant, doctor for doctor and so on.  Somebody should be able to tell me what the cost is of running one system as opposed to the other.  When I tried to engage in that discussion over the years, I was repeatedly told that the public sector is more expensive.  I cannot understand how that is the case.</p></speech>

It is a question of patient morbidity, that is, how sick they actually are.  Any analysis that looks at the cost per patient or cost per hospital stay must be adjusted for comorbidities.  The patients who present to us in the acute hospitals are astonishingly more unwell than the patients who present to most of the private hospitals, mostly because the former present in a crisis via the emergency department.  These are people who have a comorbidity list of 20 illnesses and are taking numerous medications.  It is not the same patient population presenting to the private hospitals as that which presents to public hospitals.  As a result of paper-based record-keeping, as one factor, we are not very good at capturing the degree of complexity and comorbidity we are seeing in the public system.  That is very much reflected in the cost of a patient stay in the public system versus the cost in the private system.  It is a huge factor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.906" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019100900002#DD00500"><p>The patient profile is totally different as between public and private hospitals, such that one is not at all comparing like with like.  Public hospital emergency departments must be sufficiently staffed and have the capacity to treat any emergency case that presents.  Such cases would include a person who has had a stroke or brain haemorrhage or is presenting acutely with a tumour, as well as people involved in a serious road traffic accident who might need to see a vascular surgeon, neurosurgeon and orthopaedic surgeon.  All of those specialists must be there to provide care in the middle of night, with access to anaesthetic services and an intensive care unit.  Within the private sector, on the other hand, hospitals can cherry-pick the types of care they provide.  To illustrate, I will use the example of a private MRI scanner.  A private hospital providing a musculoskeletal MRI service might have 20 young men with sore knees in and out at a cost of &euro;200 each.  In Holles Street, on the other hand, we have very sick and intubated premature infants coming down for MRI scans, accompanied by senior nurses and neonatologists, with each such infant possibly spending an hour and a half in the scanner.  If we compare our scanner with the scanner in the private hospital, the latter will seem to be much more productive because it was used for the young lads who were able to hop on and off in quick succession.</p> <p>  In fact, we are providing complex, high-level care and, as such, we will always be more expensive.  However, if one is pregnant, if one is a child, if one is in a road traffic accident, if one has a stroke or a brain tumour, one will not be going to a private hospital but to one of our public hospitals.  We need to be adequately staffed and have the infrastructure to provide that care.  When one needs an intensive care bed in a public hospital, one does not join a waiting list.</p></speech>

Whether one likes it or not, one cannot make a like-for-like comparison between private and public hospital care provision.  We have spoken today about balancing the books in terms of pluses and minuses.  We probably need to look, too, at logistic regression, a range of confounding variables and projections and very complex health economic models.  The demographic and socioeconomic status of the two groups of patients who come to the two different types of hospitals must be taken into account, as well as the acuity of each type of patient, the case mix and the requirement for multiple models of multidisciplinary care for the different patient groups.  The differences are such that one cannot make a direct comparison between them.  It would simply be bad economics and bad research to do so.  Indeed, if a research paper came to me as a reviewer which contained that type of comparison, I would reject it.</p></speech>

I am head of public policy for Facebook Ireland and I am joined by Ms Claire Rush, our lead counsel on content and regulatory matters.  We are based at Facebook's international headquarters in Dublin.</p> <p>  We recognise the real concerns of citizens and Oireachtas Members regarding the fast-moving and evolving nature of harmful content on the Internet, including on our platform.  We take our role in keeping harmful content off our services very seriously.  We recognise that if society were designing the Internet as it exists today from scratch, it would not ask companies to make the judgments that Facebook must make in regard to harmful content alone.   We, therefore, welcome the fact that governments and policy makers around the world are taking an active role in addressing harmful online content.  It is with their help, including that of the committee, that the rules which govern the Internet can be updated in a way that allows people the freedom to express themselves and allows entrepreneurs to build things, while also protecting society from broader harms.</p> <p>  Our community standards are the rules which govern what is allowed on our platform.  We draft and update these rules in consultation with a wide range of experts, including NGOs and academics from around the world, including Ireland.  They cover a wide range of content issues including hate speech, bullying, harassment, graphic violence and nudity.  In many cases, our community standards go further than national laws, such as, for example, in the area of non-consensual intimate images, NCII.  We have zero tolerance for the sharing of NCII on our platforms.  Once we are made aware of these images, we remove them and use media-matching technology to prevent further sharing or re-uploading of the images.  However, decisions about content can be complex and we do not always get it right.  That is why we are establishing an external oversight board which will adjudicate at a global level on decisions we make on content.  The decision of the oversight board will be binding on the company.</p> <p>  We submitted a detailed response to the consultation convened by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, earlier this year.  In the interest of informing this discussion, I will summarise two of its points.  We outlined how, in our view, an effective and efficient system of oversight by a regulator might operate.  On the subject of notice and take-down, we recognised there can be a role for a regulator to review certain incidents where content is first reported to a service provider but not removed.  We look forward to the publication of the related Bill and to engaging in future consultation opportunities.</p> <p>  Every piece of content on Facebook, including photos, text posts, comments, profiles and pages can be reported to us for violating our content policies.  In each case, one can report the content by clicking on the link in the top right hand corner or, in the case of a comment, by  pressing one's thumb on the comment for a few seconds if using a mobile phone.</p><p>If the content is found to be against our community standards, it is removed.  We are also investing heavily in artificial intelligence, AI, so that we can more rapidly detect harmful and illegal content on our platforms, and it has been very successful in certain areas.  However there are types of content which are more challenging for Al, such as bullying and harassment where context can be important.  This is why we depend on reports from our community of users.<br/><br/>Our most recent community standards enforcement report, in which we publish quarterly breakdowns of the content that we have removed, demonstrates the efforts we are making to tackle a range of illegal and legal but harmful forms of content.  For example, in the first quarter of this year we removed 5.4 million pieces of child sexual abuse material globally, 99.2% of which we removed before it was reported to us.  The report also demonstrates the improvements we are making in developing Al tools to deal with challenging areas of harmful content such as hate speech, where our proactive detection rates have increased from 38% in the first quarter of 2018 to 65.4% a year later.<br/><br/>Our community standards recognise that bullying and harassment take place in many different places and can have many different forms.  We do not tolerate this type of behaviour as it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook.  In addition to removing content, we give users tools to help them protect themselves against bullying, such as blocking other users and controlling who sees your posts, and we operate a bullying prevention hub which gives young people, parents and teachers the tools and resources to address the complex issues which bullying presents.<br/><br/>In Ireland, we work with experts to inform our safety policies and deliver online safety programmes.  In the past 12 months we have invested &euro;1 million in a partnership with the national anti-bullying research and resource centre in DCU and <i>SpunOut.ie</i>.  The main goal of this partnership is to help raise awareness of online safety and tackle the issue of online bullying among young people by offering online safety and anti-bullying training to every secondary school in Ireland.  The programme is under way with more than 100 teachers from schools across Ireland attending the first set of training sessions in September.  In addition, the research carried out through the school's training programme will inform <i>SpunOut.ie</i>'s online safety resources for teenagers.<br/><br/>I hope that this gives committee members a brief overview of the steps we are taking to address harmful content on our platform.  We have put these measures and more in place because we want users to feel safe and secure when they are using our services.  Claire and I look forward to your questions and we would be happy to follow up in writing on any point which is of interest to the committee members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.923" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen White" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to Twitter to participate in today&rsquo;s session.  My name is Karen White and I am director of public policy for Twitter in Europe.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ronan Costello, public policy manager for Twitter in Europe.</p> <p>  Twitter is an open, public service.  Our singular mission is to serve the public conversation.  We serve our global audience by focusing on the needs of the people who use our service, and we put them first in every step we take.  Twitter is committed to improving the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation on our platform.  Our success is built and measured by how we help encourage more healthy debate, conversations and critical thinking.  Conversely, abuse, malicious automation and manipulation detract from our purpose.  We provide people on Twitter with a range of tools so that they can control and manage the type of content and accounts they see, ranging from being able to keep an account private to blocking, muting or reporting other individuals on the service.  We also give people control over what they see in search results, through safe search mode, which is enabled by default.  This excludes potentially sensitive content from the search results such as spam, adult content and the accounts an individual has muted or blocked.  We strive to provide an environment where people can feel free to express themselves and we recognise that if people experience abuse on Twitter it can jeopardise their ability to do this.</p> <p>  An individual using the service is not permitted to promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people in a range of protected categories.  A person may not engage in abusive behaviour, which is an attempt to harass, intimidate or silence someone else's voice.  We do not allow individuals to use hateful images or symbols in their profile image or header and individuals using the platform are not allowed to use their username, display name or profile bio to engage in abusive behaviour such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group or other protected category.  Under this policy we take action against behaviour that targets individuals or an entire protected category with hateful conduct.</p><p>With regard to self-harm and suicide, after Twitter receives a report of such behaviour, it will contact the reported user and let him or her know that someone who cares about him or her identified that he or she might be at risk.  We will provide the reported user with available online and offline resources and encourage him or her to seek help.  In response to certain keyword searches relating to these issues, using Twitter's search function, we direct individuals to online prevention resources.  This service is available in Ireland, where we have partnered with the Samaritans, to whose website and support services we direct individuals.</p><p> Twitter does not allow individuals on the service to post or share intimate photos or videos of someone which were produced or distributed without their consent.  Such material is sometimes referred to as "revenge porn".  This content poses serious safety and security risks.  We inform our users that sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the Twitter rules.  </p><p> People who do not feel safe on Twitter should not be burdened to report abuse to us.  Earlier this year we made it a priority to take a proactive approach to abuse.  Today, through the use of technology, 38% of abusive content that is enforced is surfaced proactively for human review.  We have made meaningful progress towards creating a healthier service.  Since we announced our focus on improving the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, we have seen a 16% year-on-year decrease in reports from people about other users allegedly abusing them on Twitter.  We have seen a 45% increase in the number of account suspensions for those who attempt to create new accounts following the suspension of their original accounts.  Over the first quarter of 2019, this amounted to more than 100,000 account suspensions for these reoffenders.  We are suspending three times more abusive accounts within 24 hours of a report and are taking two and a half times more private information down, with a new, easier reporting process.  </p><p> We have always provided an appeals mechanism for individuals who have had enforcement action taken against their accounts but earlier this year we launched a new feature that allows people to appeal within the Twitter app itself.  This change has meant that we have been able to respond to people 60% more quickly than we had previously.</p><p> We have well-established relationships with law enforcement agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have continuous global coverage to address reports from law enforcement around the world and have a dedicated online portal to swiftly handle requests from law enforcement.  We provide regular training on our policies and procedures and have publicly available guidelines for law enforcement on our website.  </p><p> The committee has asked for our recommendations on the proposed legislative changes.  It is important that legislation is as consistent as possible with existing legal frameworks to avoid uncertainties and discrepancies.  The effectiveness of any legislative solution relies on it being proportionate, technically feasible, and flexible, particularly given the diversity of companies within the digital ecosystem.  In this context, the committee will need to consider and assess how different legal and illegal harms manifest themselves across different platforms and varied jurisdictions.</p><p> We all share the objective of protecting our systems of due process and our commitment to freedom of expression.  Preserving these tenets in regulatory proposals can be achieved by collectively ensuring there is clarity on the obligations of all stakeholders, thereby avoiding an outcome whereby companies could overreach or erroneously remove content that should otherwise be kept online.  A clearly defined scope in that regard will assist Twitter and, I imagine, others.</p><p> In order to ensure people can continue to express themselves freely and safely on Twitter, we must continue investing further in our proactive technology and safety tools, as well as developing policies which keep pace with the changing contours of the public conversation we see on our service.  We stand ready to work with this committee as we continue to explore options to ensure that all people are protected from online harassment and harmful communications.  I thank members for their time.  We look forward to taking their questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.925" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ryan Meade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#L00200"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to contribute to the committee's deliberations on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications, and related offences.  I work with Google in Ireland as government affairs and public policy manager and am based in our EU headquarters here in Dublin.  Google supports all efforts by legislators and governments to engage with stakeholders in considering appropriate protections, remedies, and forms of redress for individuals who are the victims of online harm.  A range of governments, technology platforms and civil society groups are currently focused on how best to deal with illegal and problematic online content.</p><p>There is broad agreement on letting people create, communicate and find information online while preventing people from misusing content-sharing platforms like social networks and video sharing sites.  We recognise that there can be a troubling side of open platforms and that bad actors have exploited this openness.  We take the safety of our users very seriously, and we are committed to ensuring that inappropriate content that appears on our platforms is dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p> Now 21 years old, Google has grown from a small start-up to a global company with legal obligations in each of the countries in which it operates.  We work hard to protect our platforms from abuse and have been working on this challenge for years, using both computer-science tools and human reviewers to identify and stop a range of online abuse, from get-rich-quick schemes to disinformation, to the utterly abhorrent, including child sexual abuse material online.  We respond promptly to valid notices of specific illegal content, and we prohibit other types of content on various different services.  A mix of people and technology helps us to identify inappropriate content and enforce our policies, and we continue to develop and invest in smart technology to detect problematic content hosted on our platforms.</p><p> As well as making significant investment in technology and human resources, we have engaged with policymakers in Ireland and around the world on the question of the appropriate oversight for online content-sharing platforms.  Google is supportive of carefully crafted and appropriately tailored regulation that continues to address the challenges of problematic content online.  We are keen to work constructively with legislators to build on the existing legal framework and to build trust and confidence in the systems and procedures that ensure online safety.</p><p> Having considered the committee's issues paper, our comments today are directed towards those aspects that concern the role of Internet service providers in preventing online harassment and certain harmful communications.  We have submitted a longer written statement which outlines all of these points in greater detail.  In this statement, we have also provide some comments on the approaches taken on this issue in other jurisdictions where Google operates and which were mentioned in the committee's issue paper.</p><p> In the statement, we suggest a number of central principles that should be considered for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms and problematic content online.  These include clarity, suitability, transparency, flexibility, overall quality and co-operation.  I have set them out in more detail in the longer statement and can refer to them later if the committee wishes.</p><p> In framing any measures in this area, it is important for legislators to have regard to and build on the existing legal framework.  We operate in an environment where extensive regulation of online content and actions already exists and is being enforced.  Many laws, covering everything from consumer protection to defamation to privacy, already govern online content.  From consumer rights legislation to the new EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive, online behaviours come under the scope of a diverse and evolving set of legislation, multi-stakeholder initiatives and regulators.</p><p> Specifically relating to regulation of Internet service providers as a means of combating online abuse, the distinctive role played by Internet service providers is reflected in the EU legislation that underpins the regulation of electronic commerce in Europe.  The eCommerce directive provides strong incentives for service providers to establish and operate efficient notice and take-down procedures.  A service provider that does not operate such procedures will be exposed to potential legal liability for unlawful content hosted on its platform.  Many service providers, including Google, have developed extensive infrastructures which provide efficient tools for the reporting and removal of illegal content.</p><p> The eCommerce directive has the advantage of setting out different requirements for different types of Internet intermediaries, rather than being aimed at a particular business activity.  It has led to the growth of a wide variety of services and business models, and is flexible enough to cover the multiplicity of activities and content types online.  For example, an online news site can contain content authored by the news organisation, along with material licensed from third parties and also user-generated comments - the news site will be directly responsible for the editorial content it publishes but will have different legal responsibilities with respect to user comments that the website is hosting as an intermediary.  This online intermediary liability regime has fostered the huge economic and cultural benefits of the Internet while ensuring platforms are taking appropriate and speedy actions in removing unlawful content online.</p><p> In addition to legal regulations, Google has over the years developed extensive community guidelines and content policies that offer clear rules on what it does not allow on its platforms.  These often go above and beyond the law and we employ thousands of staff around the world, working 24 hours a day, to ensure violations are acted upon.  Companies have also worked together to address these challenges, for example, with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a coalition sharing information on curbing online terrorism.</p><p> We continue to improve on our processes and our technology to enforce these rules.  We continually review and update our policies based on new trends and invest in new machine learning, ML, technology to scale the efforts of our human moderators.</p><p> ML is helping us detect potentially violative content and surface it for human review.  For example, YouTube removed 9 million videos during the second quarter of 2019, 7.9 million of which were first flagged through our automated flagging system.</p><p>For example, YouTube removed 9 million videos during the second quarter of 2019, 7.9 million of which were first flagged through our automated flagging system.  Of those videos, 81.5% had no views at the time they were taken down.</p><p> We thank the committee for providing us with an opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications and related offences.  Addressing problematic content is a shared responsibility across society, in which companies, Governments, civil society, and users all have a role to play, and it is appropriate that this committee is hearing from a variety of voices on this topic.  We hope the committee will give our suggestions for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms due consideration and look forward to further discussion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.929" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ana Niculescu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#N00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  ISPAI is a not-for-profit organisation and the legal entity delivering the <i>hotline.ie</i>service, which is the national reporting mechanism where the public can anonymously, securely and confidentially report suspected illegal content online.  <i>hotline.ie'</i>s remit is distinct and limited to combating online material which is simultaneously harmful and illegal, namely child pornography, also known as child sexual abuse material, CSAM.  The<i>hotline.ie</i>service has been effective in having CSAM swiftly removed from the Internet because it operates within a clearly defined legislative framework where the harm is clearly illegal.  Additionally, it is a transnational crime which allows for decisive international action when CSAM is hosted outside Ireland.  There is no burden of proof in respect of consent as engaging a child in sexual activities is prohibited under all circumstances and any presumed consent would be null and void.  When talking about CSAM, it is important to note that we are talking about materials showing the extreme abuse of children, the majority of them infants to 12 year olds.  For example, 84% of the material classified as child pornography from January 2017 to June 2019 showed children estimated to be four to 12, with 7% aged three and younger.<br/><br/><i>hotline.ie</i>has been working in an environment predominantly governed under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, amended by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  It is clear national legislation that comprehensively defines what would constitute child pornography and corresponding offences.<br/><br/>The broader context commonly referred to as industry self-regulation consists of, as a non-exhaustive list, the EU directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which provides for an international framework.  The e-commerce directive is also transposed into Irish law and sets out the requirements and exemptions for intermediaries' liability for illegal content.  There is a national co-ordinated multi-stakeholder approach, where <i>hotline.ie</i>operations and procedures are agreed and overseen by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Since inception, we have been working in conjunction with national law enforcement and in co-operation with Internet companies operating in Ireland for the removal of CSAM from the Internet.  Our <i>hotline.ie</i>analysts are internationally trained by INHOPE and Interpol in content and age assessment.  There are national reporting mechanisms such as <i>hotline.ie</i>in more than 40 countries worldwide, coming together as the International Network of Internet Hotlines, INHOPE, allowing for international co-operation and co-ordination.  When child pornography is hosted in Ireland, we will issue a notice for takedown to the Internet service or content provider and will notify the paedophile investigation unit of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  In most cases, the notified material is removed from the Internet within 24 hours.  When CSAM is hosted outside Ireland, <i>hotline.ie</i>will still notify the paedophile investigation unit and thereafter the INHOPE member hotline in the relevant jurisdiction, so that CSAM may be swiftly removed at source.<br/><br/>INHOPE figures show that 64% of CSAM reported across different international jurisdictions in 2018 was removed within 72 hours.  As previously outlined, in Ireland, it is removed within 24 hours.  However, slower international removal times may be due to CSAM hosted in countries without a hotline presence, a lack of designated points of contact and streamlined notice for takedown process with Internet companies, or countries with inadequate or deficient legislation.</p><p>The self-regulatory model is effective in the circumstances in which<i>hotline.ie</i>operates and may be useful to look at as a reference point for other types of content but it would warrant further scoping.<br/><br/>For those who may not be aware, the <i>hotline.ie</i>service will be 50% co-funded by the European Union through the Connecting Europe Facility's safer Internet programme until June 2021.  The other 50% is co-funded by ISPAI member Internet companies, comprising Internet service providers, hosting providers, search engines and mobile and telecommunications operators.  <i>Hotline.ie</i>was established as one of the key recommendation of the Government's working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet in 1998.  It provides a free, secure and anonymous online reporting mechanism, content assessment expertise to ensure reported material is subject to objective evaluation in accordance with rigorous standards by reference to Irish law, a triage function through assessing public reports and notifying only content that is most likely illegal under Irish law, thereby reducing the burden that would otherwise be placed on law enforcement by, for example, assessing complaints that may not prove to reside in Ireland and operating the notice and takedown service, which is recognised worldwide as a vital and efficient tool in the removal of child sexual abuse material at source and which, in turn, reduces its availability on the Internet, disrupts the cycle of sexual exploitation and prevents further victimisation of children.  In my written statement I have provided statistics that are worth looking at.<br/><br/>I stress that we welcome the committee's engagement with a variety of experts and stakeholders and we are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to these discussions.  We are also supportive of the Government's attempts to address the spectrum of harms and that different harms may require different legislative and regulatory responses, with due account of the fact that the Internet is an ever-evolving, technically challenging and complex environment.  Superimposed on that is a continuum between offline and online behaviour that contributes to the complexity of developing effective responses and remedies.  I am happy to provide further information in writing as required.  I thank committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

So the witnesses are aware of the function of the committee, we are all Members of the Oireachtas considering whether there needs to be greater regulation.  When we talk about regulation what we mean is the extent to which social media companies should be liable under law for harmful information they store and which they and others publish.  Do the witnesses accept that regulation in Ireland should increase beyond what is provided for in the e-commerce directive?  I will begin with Mr. &Oacute; Broin on behalf of Facebook.</p></speech>

As outlined, including in Mr. Meade's statement, the e-commerce directive already provides for a liability regime for the removal of unlawful content.  What we are here to discuss is a broader level of harm, some of which may be illegal and some which may be lawful or permissible under the terms of the law.  We are here to engage on how these can be appropriately defined, how an appropriate notice and takedown regime can be defined and how there could be a role for a regulator in developing standards or guidelines to which Internet service providers or online intermediaries should have to adhere.  Naturally as part of this there would need to be a reasonable sanctions approach.  We appreciate this and we understand it entirely.  The nitty-gritty detail would be a matter for the Legislature.<br/><br/>Our position is that there would be a phased proportionate approach that would look at systematic adherence to the standards or guidelines a regulator might lay out as opposed to focusing on individual instances of content <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

We have certainly appreciated the collaborative approach of the committee, other committees and various Departments on this issue.  I joined Twitter more than five years ago and remember one of the first consultations I undertook was with the Law Reform Commission.  There has been a very collaborative approach.  As our CEO has outlined, and as we have said on the record many times, we view regulation as a net positive.  It can have very good outcomes.  In this sense, we certainly view our role as educators and we work with Governments on trying to educate on the technologies available and how our services operate.  Ultimately, it is for law makers to decide the breadth of that-----</p></speech>

A number of the self-regulatory measures already in existence, including the EU code of conduct on illegal hate speech of which Twitter was a founding member, the code of conduct on disinformation and others, are certainly bearing fruit.  There are a lot of models in existence, particularly in Europe, that can be leveraged.  When moving to a place of reviewing any existing legislation or introducing new legislative measures we must ensure we are not fragmenting the legislative frameworks in place in Europe.</p></speech>

In this sense we are in favour of regulation and looking at what is in the existing legal framework and what scope there is for improving it where new regulations are introduced.  In the document we submitted we make suggestions on principles that could apply to this additional oversight.  Specifically, I referred to the e-commerce directive to emphasise that it provides an opportunity for legislators to oversee notice and takedown procedures.  In a sense, this is what is happening not just in Ireland but elsewhere.  People are looking at how we can use the regulation.</p> <p>  With regard to the principles I mentioned, a number of people referred to clarity.  Platforms as much as users would benefit from clarity on what the definitions are, what is actually expected of platforms and how we can operate them.</p> <p>  Another key point is suitability and that the form of regulation that applies is suitable to the specific service.  We are sitting here together today but we all have quite different products and services that operate in different ways and present different issues and challenges.  We suggest legislators should definitely take this into account.</p></speech>

Its businesses operate in various countries irrespective of boundaries.  This can create difficulties for the company when it comes to the application of laws.  Is it in agreement with the president-elect of the European Commission, who has indicated she wants to introduce a digital services Bill that would apply throughout the European Union and would have an impact in this regard?</p></speech>

As other witnesses have said, that regime has been in place for approximately 20 years.  Society and technology have moved on and it seems quite appropriate that legislators continue to look at it.  We do not have an issue with legislators doing this.  As I said in my opening statement, we should be cognisant of the benefits the intermediary liability regime has provided for the flourishing of online services.</p><p>I will ask Ms Niculescu the question that I asked the others, although she is in a slightly different position.  Should there be increased regulation beyond what exists?</p></speech>

We could use examples from other jurisdictions, such as the German Network Enforcement Act, which provides for a tiered system.  It is important to look at the model in New Zealand where there is user education and empowerment, with a culture of reporting.  Self-regulation is tier two.  There is also oversight from a statutory body.</p></speech>

It is a very vague term.  As I said last week, people should be allowed to be critical of politicians.  That could be categorised as harmful and is not what we are talking about here.  An example which we will all agree is harmful, illegal and should not be facilitated is child pornography, an issue raised by Ms Niculescu.  I am sorry to be blunt about this but do the witnesses agree that their businesses have increased the incidence of child pornography significantly throughout the world?</p></speech>

We have a zero tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation, CSE, material.  If we find it, accounts are suspended immediately and the content is reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  We work with a range of organisations from the Internet Watch Foundation to INHOPE, which runs 46 hotlines across 40 different countries.  We work closely with law enforcement on these matters.  The chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation stated in a previous report that 1% of the content the foundation had removed for violating CSE policies was found on social media services in 2017.  It is a very low percentage in that respect but is nonetheless a grave issue.  In our most recent reporting period, for which we provided figures of our enforcement actions in the Twitter transparency report which is published biannually, we took action on 29,824 pieces of content for violating our CSE policies.  We are certainly open to further collaboration in this area but we take the issue of child safety on our service very seriously.</p></speech>

If somebody makes a comment about a politician and the politician feels that the account is not a real person, he or she can flag that to us and we can then put that account into a cross-check where the account has to be authorised.  The account holder then has to provide proof of identity to us.  While I understand the conversation about verification of accounts and the reasons for it, it raises a wider question about the operation of the Internet.  We would essentially be required to verify all users globally before they could use our systems.  There are a number of considerations, including whether the system of identification is available in each country.  Are people ruled out from using our services because they do not have access to an ID?  In Ireland, for example, there is a cost to obtain ID.  That is not to say that we do not take the issue of child sexual abuse extremely seriously.  We take proactive steps.  As others have said, we have zero tolerance for this type of behaviour.  There are genuine concerns about how proof of identity would operate and whether us holding all of that information about more than 2.7 billion people globally would respect the data minimisation principles within the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  That is not to say that we are not looking at this as something that we have to do better.  We are looking at artificial intelligence to determine whether it can assist us in verifying accounts.  We talk about fake accounts and removing them.  In the first quarter of this year, we removed 2.2 billion fake accounts from our platform, 99% of them before they were reported to us.  We take the issues of authenticity and child sexual abuse extremely seriously.</p></speech>

If it were the case that there was criminal liability or penal sanction such as a fine for social media companies that happened to facilitate, unwittingly or otherwise, the publication of child sexual abuse material, would that not have a deterrent effect in reducing it and changing the companies' actions?</p></speech>

While they may not be that visible or well-known to everybody who walks down the street who may not know that we have reporting, notice and takedown and that we remove content when we have notice of it, it is something that we have been doing for a long time.  We have always taken that seriously and are always responsive to these reports.  That system of notice and takedown and liability upon notice has allowed Internet companies to develop and flourish.  That is not to say that there is not room for new conversations about broader responsibilities for other types of harmful content, but we need to be careful about adjustments or alterations to the fundamental nature of the intermediary liability regime, as has been operating across Europe since the e-commerce directive in 2001.</p></speech>

First, to put my cards on the table and be very clear, I believe the principle under which the companies operate is wrong.  I do not accept this made-up term of "intermediary".  To me, the companies are publishers and should have the liabilities of publishers.  As an industry, it has pulled off an amazing trick over many decades, which has enriched the companies and their shareholders to a vast level, and the cost is too great.  I want to be absolutely clear and our witnesses can respond to it.  I am aware of the response about intermediaries and publishers and the difference the companies always seek to strike on this.</p> <p>  All of the companies' representatives have collectively outlined the takedown process.  Will each of them give me a figure that is spent globally by their company on that process?  Let us start with Google, which I understand, roughly, give or take the small change, is a &euro;100 billion plus revenue company.  Is that roughly correct, give or take?  Let us take the parent company, Alphabet.</p></speech>

Absolutely not.  I believe businesses should make a profit.  I am a business person.  I do not ever advocate the idea of wholescale censorship or that we should live in a restrictive world.  The Internet does good things.  My problem with Internet companies is that the harm cannot just be discarded.</p> <p>  Each of our witnesses made their way into work somehow this morning, whether it was by private car, bus or whatever.  None of them would one expect the company who made the motor car to make it to the minimum standard, to recall it if there is a problem with it, but not to do all the necessary things to keep our witnesses safe on their journey.  The problem with what the Internet companies do is that, if we are honest, they are really publishers who have more impact on the world today than probably all broadcast and print media combined together, which is a terrific compliment to the way the companies have been built up.  Yet, for the purposes of making profits, they want to have no obligations to what those impacts are, apart from saying that they will take material down when the damage has been done.</p> <p>  I go back to my central question to our witnesses again.  Do the companies believe that at any point that they should accept the principle of being a publisher of material?  I ask each of the witnesses to reply in whatever order they like.</p></speech>

It is open to legislators to decide to apply the same rules that publishers work under to the various online services.  This would need to be taken through to its conclusion.  What would it mean and what impact would that have on the operation of the open Internet?  We have developed our services on the basis that they are open and for everyone.  One of the great features of our services is that the same Gmail, drive or whatever service we offer is available anywhere in the world on the same basis.  That brings with it a huge volume of material.  On YouTube, for example, there are hundreds of hours of video material uploaded to our services every minute.  If we were to be considered publishers, each item would have to be reviewed before appearing on the platform.  It would be open to legislators to make that a requirement but it would fundamentally alter the availability of that service.  It is up to legislators to decide what the rules should be.  The point I would make, in common with the other members of the panel, is that legislators should also take account of what benefits the liability regime has provided.</p> <p>  Just because we do not consider it appropriate that the regulation should be the same for publishers as for the platforms, that does not mean the platforms cannot be regulated.  As I said in my opening statement, there are regulations that apply to platforms and it is obviously open to legislators to decide if they are appropriate, if they can be strengthened, changed and made more clear and whether we can get better outcomes for users.</p> <p>  I do not know if the Deputy and I will agree on the question of publishers versus platforms.  Perhaps we can agree, however, that just because we are not regulated in the same way as publishers and are not subject to exactly the same regime, that does not mean there is no ability for legislators to regulate.</p></speech>

By being deemed an intermediary, it escapes this consequence.  This is why, in my opinion, this is like the wild west of the 21st century.  There is a very interesting historical analogy.  In the United States at the start of the previous century, European copyright was not accepted.  This meant, in effect, that authors could not be paid.  The American Government and the publishers, some of which are now the biggest names in publishing in the entire world, did not accept European copyright.  The publishers made their money in that way.  When they got to a certain size, they of course turned around and said that they wanted copyright enforced and regulation.  It suits Internet companies to grow to a certain size and then look for a bit of regulation to prevent entry into the market.</p> <p>  There is one main stumbling block, if one takes an honest look at it.  This is the bit I can never quite get.  It reminds me of the chief executive of a cigarette company sitting before the US Senate and saying that smoking is not harmful.  The witnesses answered one of Deputy O'Callaghan's questions about whether their companies increased the proliferation of child pornography.  The honest answer to that is "Yes".  Whether the companies accept that they are individually responsible for that or that they should be legally responsible for it, the Internet did increase that proliferation.  There is no getting around that.  My point is that, by not being declared publishers, the companies avoid the liabilities with which almost everybody else has to deal.  I do not believe a decision in this regard should be made in Ireland alone.  It should be broader and decided at least at the level of the EU.  The traditional western countries need to operate together and to look at this issue.  There is a role for the Internet and for what the companies do, but there is also a role for regulation.</p> <p>  I will conclude with this because I am conscious of time.  There are two things that really changed my mind.  It is not so much about the area of pornography or anything like that.  There was one horrendous incident in Ireland involving Facebook, and I do not want to go into too much detail about it out of respect for the family involved, in which the public shared multiple images of an horrific incident.  There is no comeback for that family.  They cannot unsee it.  It does not matter that it was taken down in 24 hours, which in fairness it was.  People should not profit off that level of absolute horror being inflicted on someone.  The other issue, unfortunately, also involves Facebook.  Somebody went on a murder spree and, using the live-streaming facility Facebook developed to make further profits, live-streamed himself murdering people.  I cannot understand, from a moral perspective, how people are comfortable with defending themselves against liability for that.  That is my issue.  That is why I believe there should be a change.  Any of the witnesses are more than welcome to reply to me on those points, but that is where I will leave it for now.</p></speech>

We are subject to rules and regulations as it stands.  We are here today and, in all of our opening statements, we have said that we are open to further regulation.  We have been saying quite publicly since March of this year that we recognise the need to work with governments across the world, globally, nationally, and at EU level, to figure out how, as a society, to deal with harmful content.  We have a major role to play in that.  I am not saying that it is a societal issue from which we will just stand back.  We have a major role to play in it.  We will play that role in working with legislators around the world to deal with this issue.</p> <p>  I know the Deputy does not want to go into detail on the particular case involving the car accident.  With regard to the Christchurch incident, which he raised, we are doing everything we can to learn from that incident and to ensure that it can never happen again.  For example, one of the weaknesses in our systems was that the artificial intelligence, AI, system did not recognise a video being made because the shooter framed it in a first-person view, that is, he had a camera on him.</p><p>We are working with the Metropolitan Police in the UK and with the American armed forces.  We are inputting their weapons training footage into our AI, which will ensure that type of incident can never happen again.  This is a rapidly evolving area and we have rapidly evolving harms on the Internet.  We are committed to doing absolutely everything we can to make our platform safe.  I do not accept the premise that we profit from these types of incidents being on our platform.  It is the opposite.  We hear from both our advertisers and our users all the time that they do not want this type of material on our platform.  The advertisers do not want their advertising anywhere near this type of content.  We are extremely serious about removing it.  I will ask Ms Rush to come in on the legal points the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy and note and appreciate his concerns in this regard.  One of the points he made is that the heightened layer of responsibility arising from being a publisher would result in people queueing up at the door to take claims and so on.  As Mr. Meade mentioned earlier in respect of an obligation to preview, pre-screen or pre-moderate every single piece of content against all the laws in force anywhere in the world the content might be available or might be shared, regardless of the operational burden and cost, such an obligation would have a significant chilling effect.  Companies would be incentivised to take down anything that is remotely dubious or questionable from a legal perspective.  They would have to err on the side of removing everything, which could have a very detrimental effect on the availability of content.  It is just one perspective.  I absolutely appreciate all the other points the Deputy has raised, to which Mr. &Oacute; Broin has responded.  We are here because we accept and know that this is an opportunity to find a better way forward with regard to a future regulatory model which would learn from and build on other models and which would be conscious of EU developments and developments that have worked in other countries.  I hope that we can constructively engage in such a discussion with the committee.</p></speech>

In our case, these policies are our community guidelines for YouTube, our advertising policies and so on.  That is provided for under the existing legal framework.  It allows the companies to exercise a degree of moderation and to impose their own standards with regard to what they will or will not allow on their platforms.  From our point of view, that has served the purpose of allowing us to keep our users safe on our platforms and to provide them with a more positive experience.  The Deputy's point is that is a form of editorial control which would lead to us being defined as publishers.  What we do, and I believe all the platforms have similar systems of enforcing guidelines, is allowed for under the existing legal framework.  If it was not allowed for, we would be in a much worse situation in respect of platforms' ability to take proactive measures to keep users safe.</p></speech>

Tweets are the lifeblood of the platform.  Users' comfort in expressing themselves on the platform is dependent on them feeling safe and their feeling safe on the platform is dependent on them having confidence that Twitter will be responsive to issues they report to us and that we will be proactive, where necessary, in leveraging machine learning and so on to surface content for review proactively.  If people stop tweeting because they do not feel comfortable expressing themselves on the platform, the lifeblood of the platform is extinguished.  There is therefore no reason for people to be on it or for advertisers to use it.</p><p>The very model of the platform is dependent on them having the trust and confidence in us to invest in safety.</p></speech>

Many of them should be here on the politicians side of the table because I am hearing a lot of political speak, waffle and diversion from the questions, which is interesting.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  The stuff about publishers or facilitators is very interesting.  As far as I can see, it is a movEable feast from the witnesses' point of view.  Facebook was involved in a case with a company called Six4Three that came to court in 2018 where it said that it was a publisher, that it had to make decisions on what not to publish and that it should be protected because it is a publisher.  However, it is not a publisher when it comes to abusive posts and so on.  That is an interesting aside.  </p> <p>  All the witnesses said there were different aspects of the regulation, that sometimes they have to make one decision and another decision on other occasions.  It seems that the entire regulatory framework is unclear.  From our point of view, and the point of view of the public, we could do with that being clarified.  That would be important.</p> <p>  I ask all the witnesses, starting with Facebook, if they have the technology to track the sharing of illegal identical and equivalent posts?  If I post something that is illegal and it is shared widely, can that be tracked the whole way to the end of the process?</p></speech>

We have media matching technology.  I refer to a piece of content that is an image or a video.  If we get that piece of content or image, and this is the way we would deal with child sexual abuse material, images that promote terrorism or images of violence, we can put it into this system.  The term we use is that we bank the image.  That prevents the re-upload of the image across our services.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a previous case where we would have used this technology.  Once we became aware of the image, we banked it and made sure that image could not be re-uploaded.  If there is another image taken from a slightly different perspective, that will not be caught by that.  We would need to identify that image and start the process again of removing it and ensuring that it cannot be re-uploaded to the system.  </p> <p>  Across industry we talk about the database of hashes.  These are images which have been banked and a specific fingerprint or hash has been added to the image.  Across industry that ensures that images cannot be re-uploaded.  We use that in child exploitation.</p></speech>

One is that across industry there is a shared database of hashes so if Google or Twitter were to input, say, 100 images into that database, once that content is in the database, if someone tried to share that image on Facebook it would be caught and immediately removed.  The second way it would work is through the way Mr. &Oacute; Broin just described it.  If new images were uploaded, our classifiers in AI would look for certain thresholds or signals to see if that image would meet a certain threshold of violation.  If that ticks the box, so to speak, of being violating material, it would also be caught, hashed and banked.</p><p>There are two mechanisms, one of which is the shared process while the other is for new images we discover.</p></speech>

Our technology is very similar.  In the case of child sexual exploitation, we use photo DNA, creating digital fingerprints of the material, and any related material can be removed automatically and immediately from our systems.  In the case of terrorist related content, for example, when certain content is identified, as Ms Rush and Mr. &Oacute; Broin noted, it is hashed and given a taxonomy of the type of content before it is shared within our hash-sharing database.</p> <p>  We deploy other measures at Twitter when we identify rule-violating content, such as that which promotes terrorism, in our URL-sharing project.  If we identify URLs on our service that direct to another service, whether it be YouTube or others, we will share the URLs with the companies in question to let them know we have removed the content from our service because it violates our rules and promotes terrorism, and to suggest they might wish to review the content to which the links connect on the companies' own service.  It is a multi-pronged approach.</p></speech>

Like the other companies, we develop artificial intelligence, AI, classifiers that are able to identify content likely to be violative of our policies.  The classifiers are getting more efficient and better all the time, although one note of caution is that AI is better at identifying certain types of content.  Some types of content are readily identifiable by machines, whereas others will require a human review to detect.  Nevertheless, the technology is constantly developing.</p> <p>  On the timeframe, like in the case of the other companies, pieces of content may take different lengths of time to action.  Given there may be questions over context or issues that need to be escalated and further reviewed, timeframes can differ.  As I stated earlier, of the videos we removed from YouTube in the second quarter of this year, a total of 80% were removed before they gained one view.  That gives an idea of how quickly the majority of violative content is removed.</p></speech>

In all their submissions, our guests note the high percentage of material that is identified as violative and removed.  There is no mention, however, of how much content the companies monitor.  For example, while a total of 38% of abusive content on Twitter is removed, that could be 38% of ten, 10 million or 100 million posts.  To what total figure do the percentages relate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.1038" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen White" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#X01600"><p>One of the main areas of focus for the company over the past two years, in particular, has been the proactive identification of potentially rule-violating content.  In the latter six months of the 2018, we received more than 11 million reports.</p><p>What leveraging technology has allowed us to do in one instance is to dedupe reports.  For example, a few years ago, if we received 1,000 reports about the same piece of content, it would be a cumbersome process of review and we would review all 1,000 reports.  We have become much smarter with our technology and we will now review only the one tweet that has been reported 1,000 times.  Accordingly, we process reports much more quickly.  As I noted in my opening statement, we take three times the amount of action within 24 hours on reports we receive.</p><p> Nevertheless, our objective is to reduce the burden on people in order that they will not have to report such content to Twitter because we find it ourselves and take action.  We will never take any sort of action on certain types of content automatically or suspend accounts automatically.  It is about finding potentially rule-violating content and surfacing it for human review.  The results are very positive in that regard, given that we process reports and potentially rule-violating content much more quickly than we did previously.  Much of that is due to leveraging the technology we use.</p></speech>

It is in the scope of the AI to which Ms White referred.  AI is good in instances where the violation is clear cut and the line is not blurry, but it is not as good in areas such as bullying and harassment.  While our proactive rate on terrorism or child sexual abuse material is 99%, for bullying and harassment the rate of effective AI drops to 20% or 14% but we are committed to developing the technology.  As Ms White noted, we try to ensure that people will not have to view the content and that it is removed from the platform before anyone does.</p></speech>

I have been working in this area for many years.  The role of content reviewers has really changed because of the evolving lead-in and the technological advances we have been able to make.  Some eight or nine years ago all the content reviewed by content reviewers would come from human reports, that is, people clicking on a piece of content and indicating that they did not like it because they thought it was hate speech or violence.  That would be reviewed manually.  The volume of content has increased.  Some forms of harm are particularly egregious and abhorrent.  All types of harmful content hold their own in some ways, but it is easier to develop the technology for areas like terrorism and child sexual exploitation imagery, CSEI, because they are very visual and clearcut.  Context does not really come into it.  That is different from a piece of hate speech, for example.  It is much harder to train classifiers or machine learning to tell if a hateful slur is being used in a derogatory way or in a comedic, satirical or self-referential way.  That is why the rates of AI detection are lower for bullying and those types of content.</p> <p>  To return to the previous point, it is increasingly the case that content reviewers are not just reviewing reports from human users.  The AI is always trying to learn and become more precise.  Where it cannot take automatic action to remove content once it matches it, it will sometimes send content to humans for review as a double-check.  </p></speech>

I have a final question.  I will start with Facebook.  Does Facebook value the type of content it removes depending on the amount of followers the associated user has?  Is that a factor in the decision?  There was a Channel 4 documentary called "Inside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network" in 2018 which said that pages posted by an English Nazi were left in place because the user had a lot of followers.  As such, there was a lot of revenue to be generated.  Is that a factor in Facebook's decision on whether to review and remove posts?  Would different rules apply to my posts because I have a lot fewer followers?</p></speech>

One of the reasons they are so difficult to frame in the first place is that they have to be applied equally to all users.  It can be tricky to develop a policy that is enforceable in all cases so that one reviewer looking at a piece of content in light of the policy will make more or less the same decision as another.  We do a lot of work on testing our policies before we introduce them.  For example we updated our policy on hate speech earlier this year.  As others have said, these are areas where context is important.  Before we launched that policy we carried out extensive testing with reviewers in different parts of the world to ensure to the greatest degree possible that it was enforceable, in the sense that when a rule-violating piece of content was identified, a decision could be made on it that would not be arbitrary.  In other words, a similar decision would be made regardless of who the reviewer was or the identity of the user posting the content.</p></speech>

Whether it is someone who has 50,000 friends or 5,000 friends makes a big difference in how far the post goes.

There is one wrinkle, which is that our policies sometimes allow for public figures.  The allowable speech about public figures can be different from what is allowed concerning a private citizen.  Extra nuance can be required when a reviewer is deciding whether content violates our policy, depending on who the speech is aimed at.</p></speech>

It is the other way around.  We do not tolerate hate speech under any circumstances, but the decision about whether it violates our policies may be slightly different if the speech is about a public figure.  If so, it may be considered to be legitimate political comment.  If the same thing was said about someone who is not a political figure it might be considered in violation of policy.</p></speech>

Those actions have changed over the years.  Previously, Twitter had a binary sort of a system whereby a user was in or out.  If a user broke the rules, his or her account was suspended.  That led to people trying to create new accounts or that behaviour being taken to other services and the offender trying to find new platforms.  We now have a range of enforcement actions that we can take and the changes that we have made have been partly based on feedback we have received from safety organisations, including the European Network against Racism and the European Commission, working as part of the EU code of conduct on illegal hate speech.  It was identified that not talking about content or individuals who are operating at the extremes was not the way to go.  Instead, we had an opportunity to try to educate people, to try to bring them back into compliance with our rules.</p> <p>  We now do a number of things.  We can lock an account.  We can tell a user that he or she has violated our rules and what specific rule has been violated.  We can ask a user to delete the content in question, or to verify an email, telephone number, or many other things.  Such a user's account would be locked for a period of time.  The objective of these enforcement actions is to try to educate people and bring them back into compliance.  We have found that 65% of people who are placed in a limited state of functionality are in that state only once.  That enforcement action is having a real world impact.</p></speech>

Consistent rule violations will result in permanent suspension.  If a user engages in violent threats, for example, that could lead to the permanent suspension of their account.

This notion of counter-speech has been established for several years now.  As Ms White referenced earlier, we have been part of the EU code of conduct around illegal hate speech.  Indeed, in January this year, we held a workshop in the office which was participated in by the council, the Commission and a range of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, from across Europe.  The purpose of that was to create a counter-speech campaign that would be rolled out across Europe and would reject hate speech and encourage people to take an alternative view.  At the early part of that workshop, we had attendees who were a part of successful referendum campaigns in Ireland in the past few years.  They talked about how they had promoted a positive and inclusive narrative in Irish society by creating counter-narratives around conversations that could have taken an altogether negative turn.</p></speech>

The net response is to broaden the fudge, with respect, and that seems to be Twitter's public policy.  The response to many of these issues is that they are complicated, multinational and difficult.  Twitter maintains that it is a platform, not a publisher.  When the argument is brought down to the family who was affected on the platform, the response from Twitter was to delete the tweet and that was it.  Surely Twitter's enforcement mechanisms can be improved.  Would our guests agree that the e-commerce directive and current legislative framework does not go far enough to mandate companies to protect citizens who are subject to that content?</p></speech>

There are enforcement actions on one hand, which include removing content that is violative of Twitter rules, or illegal in a particular jurisdiction.  It is also a matter of challenging viewpoints, ideologies and prejudices online.  As Mr. Costello pointed out, counter-speech does have a valuable impact within that.  Counter-speech and organising EU-wide anti-hate speech campaigns, whether through the European Network against Racism or the Council of Europe's No Hate Speech campaign, are fundamental components of the commitment Twitter made to the EU code of conduct on illegal hate speech many years ago.</p> <p>  My point is that a multi-pronged approach is needed.</p><p>One measure is not going to stop racism and intolerance within society. </p></speech>

Was the counter-speech online and in the media worth it?  There has been a lot of solidarity in the media and among the public, but should they have had to go through that experience and rely on the kind of counter-speech Ms White refers to?  I would argue that Twitter should have stopped it before we had to have this conversation about counter-speech.  I accept that in other, broader debates counter-speech may be important, but not when a family is at the centre of the issue.  In the context of the issue this family faced, Ms White's approach of resorting to counter-speech misses the point.  They were in the middle of this.  They would be pretty concerned that Ms White is advocating counter-speech as a way to deflect from their experience.  As far as I am concerned, Twitter should not have allowed them to become the epicentre of this very difficult experience.</p></speech>

Counter-speech, as I said, is one measure in what should be a wider multi-pronged approach to what are wider societal problems in many cases.  We need to challenge the hateful discourse that we are seeing.  Counter-speech is one measure within that approach.  I was not laying everything at the feet of counter-speech, or implying that it has the potential to remedy all of the problems we see online.  It is simply one measure that can be taken.  As academic studies have shown and as the European Commission has attested to, we see positive results when those who engage in abusive behaviour such as racist activity online are challenged or called out.  There is some benefit to being able to have these conversations in the public domain and challenge these ideologies, intolerances and abuses.  This is just one measure that can be taken.</p></speech>

I would like to broaden the discussion.  Last week witnesses mentioned account verification as a key issue for all of the platforms represented here.  Of course freedom of expression is extremely important, but does anonymity on these platforms allow for a lot of the hateful issues we are talking about?  Have the witnesses' companies looked at moving their account structures to a verified model?  A lot of other platforms, such as membership clubs, have proper verification systems that are relatively simple and accurate.  I accept that some people will circumvent those, but the majority will not because the barriers would not be as soft as the current ones.  The view of law enforcement and the NGOs that testified here was that account verification could play a huge role in creating a better online space.  Do the witnesses agree with that?  I know they do not agree with the publisher concept, which I have issues with.  These are currently community platforms.  How would the witnesses feel about a legal obligation to verify all accounts and a responsibility to provide information relating to them?  I will ask each witness to respond.</p></speech>

Facebook has a real-name policy, although that is not the same as authenticating every person on the platform.  We require people to use the name by which they are known in real life.  If an account is suspected to be false, we will act on that and ensure either that the person verifies it or, if he or she is not who he or she claims, that it will be removed.  We also take strong measures against fake accounts that people try to establish on our platform.  In the first quarter of this year, we removed 2.2 billion accounts from our platform.  That figure does not include the accounts we stopped or prevented from being set up in the first instance.  They are accounts that managed to be set up but were caught within minutes.</p> <p>  I mentioned a couple of the issues relating to what such a system would look like.  At the global level at which we operate, what would the system of authentication or verification look like and what sort of requirements or burden would it put on the user to be able to access our services?  We are not dismissing such issues out of hand but rather they are the types of questions that arise.  We are working hard on the issue of age verification for children's accounts, which is just a small subset of the wider question of authenticating accounts.  The types of steps we are taking in that regard include enabling AI to detect where somebody has submitted an age of, say, 20 but where it is clear the pattern of their behaviour does not match that of a 20 year old.  While we do not have the answer just yet, we are examining and exploring the area.  As some of the other guests and I noted, it is for legislators to make a decision on what is required.  We can offer our opinions on what such a system might look like and we are happy to have more in-depth conversations on the matter.</p></speech>

As of now, it is a general judgment and is being referred back to the national court in Austria for further guidance and information.  It remains to be seen how its specifics and details will pan out.  It does, at the outset, raise significant questions around exactly what we are talking about here today, namely, the responsibility and role of online services for moderating content, their role or responsibility over illegal content and obligations of monitoring and so forth.  There are also very real freedom of expression concerns with how it could be applied in practice.</p> <p>  Another element that has been discussed widely, including in the media in the aftermath of the decision, and a concern we share, is that the judgment tends to cut against the widely accepted principle that a court in one jurisdiction should not have the ability to determine what is available, or should be seen or accessible in other jurisdictions.  There are some concerning notes in the judgment and we are still considering them.</p></speech>

Do our guests accept that, in all the documents from each of the companies before us today, there is a combined fudge?  The documents refer back to the e-commerce directive, which it seems as if it is placed above everything else.  The companies seem to allow an element of harmful content by using the e-commerce directive as a net defence, even though it has more to do with a regulatory impact on the companies' profitability rather than the freedom of expression aspect.  Why will these companies not suggest something?  For example, we all accept that the e-commerce directive was outdated before all of these companies arrived here.  Should there be another legislative move in that space?</p></speech>

Our community standards are an exercise in rights balancing.  There are rights to be considered on the one hand, but if a user engages in certain types of behaviour, other things will also be taken into consideration in coming to an outcome.  Freedom of expression is important, but we are demonstrating Facebook's experience of rights balancing over the past 14 years.</p> <p>  We are also saying that Facebook would welcome governments, legislators and policymakers critically reviewing where we have drawn the lines in our community standards.  We are open to being told where we are and where we should be going further.  There may be places where we are doing more than legislators and policymakers would have been satisfied with.  The goal is to come to an acceptance of how, as a whole, we are going to deal with the issue of harmful online content.  As I said, that is not putting the onus back on society.  We have a significant role in this and intend to play it, but we need input and guidance.  People such as those on the committee will ultimately decide what will and will not be allowed.</p></speech>

Anonymity is ingrained in the DNA of the company.  Some of the earliest users availing of our policy on anonymity have been human rights activists, journalists, whistleblowers and people operating in countries where they need anonymity to do their work safely.  We have also seen how it serves a positive purpose for young people, for example, who may feel isolated and do not want to speak out on Twitter without being able to do it anonymously.  We have seen many positive use cases.  It is important to note that anonymity does not by any stretch of the imagination serve as a shield against the Twitter rules.  We have introduced robust policies over the last year relating to fake accounts, so one cannot set up accounts with the purpose of misleading or engaging in deceptive behaviours or disrupting the service.  We have rules relating to impersonation accounts so one cannot impersonate a brand, an organisation or others on the service.</p> <p>  Anonymity is incredibly important to the company.

I am referring to personal data.  It is sensitive personal data such as the data that would be contained in a government ID, for example.  We would have to examine that against the data minimisation principles of the general data protection regulation.  We have always sought to collect as little personal, sensitive data about our users as possible.  It could open us to a variety of challenges, not least the cybersecurity challenges we would be open to by holding that type of personal data.  There is much debate still required about verification and what is meant by true and meaningful verification.</p></speech>

We carry out account verification in certain circumstances where we feel it is proportionate, for example, when we introduced new policies for election advertising for the European Parliament elections.  That involved a process of account verification so that anyone who wanted to advertise had to provide documents and so on.  The degree of data that was required to be collected in that process was quite significant. Our view is that it was proportionate to apply that in that case but perhaps not proportionate in every case.</p> <p>  In terms of a universal obligation, there are certainly countries in which we operate that require people to verify their account with us, using a government ID or some other form, in order to use our services.  There are certainly countries where that would exclude large numbers of people.  In particular, it would exclude people who were perhaps not as well got with the government as other parts, shall we say.  That is just the nature of them.  That may not necessarily apply here in Ireland but in many countries in which we operate.  That is a consideration we have to take into account. </p> <p>  I will not repeat the issues concerning data minimisation.  That point would have to be considered against the GDPR.  </p> <p>  Speaking for Google, we do see a role for private or anonymous use of the Internet.  There are use cases for various reasons.  We offer, for example, in our browser incognito mode where people can switch into a mode to use the Internet without their identity being known.  Overall it is useful to hear from the companies on this but, primarily, one would have to put that question to the people who would be affected by it, which would be our users.  I know that next week the committee will hear from civil liberty groups and so on and that is a really important question to tease out.  At present, our view broadly is that there are circumstances that are proportionate to require account verification but I am not sure we would go as far as to say it is appropriate in all circumstances.  </p></speech>

It is very important.  We all need to learn, so I welcome their effort and the collaborative spirit they have shown.  At the end of the day, however, this is a balancing exercise, is it not, between freedom of expression and the right to privacy and the right not to be harmed?  We had a number of witnesses before us last week, including a representative of Rape Crisis Network Ireland; Professor Joe Carthy from UCD; Garda representatives; and a representative of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  There were two common themes, or points of agreement, which I will put to all the witnesses.  Do they accept there is a need for a digital safety commissioner - yes or no?</p></speech>

The EU code of conduct on illegal hate speech has been in existence for a number of years.  Initially, the main signatories were the companies represented here, but the flexibility it has allowed has meant that many additional companies have signed up to the code of conduct over the years.  The European Commission and Commissioner Jourov&aacute; have spoken about the effectiveness of the code.

All the witnesses will be asked the same question so I thank Mr. &Oacute; Broin for telling us this.  Excuse my manner, but we have spoken to people last week and will be speaking to more next week and ultimately we must tease it out.  I am acutely aware of the importance of the right to freedom of expression and the dangers that are inherent in a system that seeks to stop it.  I know that and do not need to be told it.  I am acutely conscious of what governments can get up to stop that.  Within that we must look at people being harmed online, and that is where I am coming from.  Now there is an oversight board and it will be set up next year.  Facebook is probably ahead of the posse or are there other oversight boards?</p></speech>

There is also a specific section that relates to terms of service enforcement.  I previously referred to figures relating to the number of reports we have received - more than 11 million across six different categories - on matters ranging from our safety policies, hateful conduct, abusive behaviour, right through to child sexual exploitation and terrorism.  It details the various figures with regard to reports received and actions taken.</p></speech>

On the back of many of the enforcement actions we have taken, we have seen a 16% drop in reports relating to abusive behaviour.  The data certainly show that our enforcement actions are having very positive results.</p></speech>

I preface what I say by saying that freedom of expression is vital.  We interfere with freedom of expression at our peril.  Within that framework we need transparency; we do not need jargon.  We need honest communication of information.  I am not hearing that.  I would not go away reassured that the self-regulation by any of the companies represented here is working.  I have listened to the submissions - I will stay on to listen to the others -  and they seem to be reactive.  I am hearing that in the past year things have been set up.  Twitter has referred to robust policies in the last year.  It is reactive depending on some outrage on our part over somebody suffering.  I will not go into any of the personal details.  That is what I am hearing.  In addition, our guests all referred to the e-commerce directive, which is greatly outdated.  None of them mentioned that it is greatly outdated.  They have all used it as a shield.  I understand that new legislation is about to be introduced.  How will that affect the companies represented here?  Have they looked at it?</p> <p>  I interrupted Ms White.  What is the nature of the harm?  Does it appal her on a personal level?  Does she say, "Good Lord, if it was my child accessing that ..." or whatever?  Can she point to things Twitter has done as a result?</p></speech>

I appreciate why there may be the impression of reactivity when we say that we have introduced measures in the past year.</p><p>Sometimes we are reacting to the changing behaviours we see online.  Twitter is a window to the world.  I have worked with Twitter for more than five years and nobody could have anticipated how online services and the Internet in general would be used by terrorist organisations.</p></speech>

I appreciate the fact that Twitter is before us and I hope its representatives will come back again because we need to work together.  However, I would have been more impressed if they had stated that the e-commerce directive was greatly outdated.  It is the law at the moment and we are complying with it but, within that law, we are passive and there is no obligation on us to be proactive.  None of our guests stated this.  They seem to be saying they only have to act when it is brought to their attention.  Few of them were even born at the time the directive was introduced.</p> <p>  Facebook has a proactive approach to teachers.  It has a programme involving over 100 teachers and the first set of training sessions started in September.  We are commencing something in response to the outrage.  How many teachers are in Ireland and how many will take part?</p></speech>

I had taken it as a compliment.  Technology moves on and legislation needs to be reviewed, which is happening.

We will commit to looking at other ways in which we can do it.  Under the code of conduct for hate speech, we have regular monitoring where NGOs, including Irish NGOs, sit with us on a quarterly basis and look at how we deal with the material.  Google is looking at ways to provide extra transparency and we undertook a transparency report a number of years ago, to which we have added material over time.</p> <p>  I agree that we need to work together.  Some 20 years ago, the e-commerce directive involved a complex balancing of rights and freedom of expression.  It is appropriate that we continue to look at that balance and that legislators, companies and other stakeholders get involved in it.</p><p>As service providers in this area, we are hoping to get across our experience of the benefits of the legislation for the open Internet in general.</p></speech>

It is used in one of the documents we have seen today.  It is not I but other organisations which have drawn attention to it, and asked for it not to be used.  They are sexually explicit images of abuse, not porn revenge.  I would not like to be the person who had to look at these images.  Can Facebook, Google and Twitter tell me if the people in question are part of their entities?  Are they outsourced?  What do the companies learn from them?  Have they listened to them?

I read in detail all the written contributions.  I will start with a few questions on the issue of explicit images, which, according to the submission, is the main focus of <i>hotline.ie</i>.</p><p>While child sexual abuse material seems to be its focus, I imagine <i>hotline.ie</i>also receives reports of more general sexual abuse material.  The witnesses emphasised that child sexual abuse material is clearly illegal and therefore the issue of consent does not apply.  I would like to tease out the issues of consent and freedom of expression and where the platforms stand in that respect and also how they deal with those issues.  We all regularly come across content online which is not considered appropriate or normal.  We do not know from looking at this content whether the people depicted in the images gave their consent.  A couple of decades ago, page 3 of many daily newspapers featured a picture of somebody wearing very little or no clothing.  That was considered normal at the time but it is no longer considered normal and these pictures no longer feature.  One of the reasons for this is that much of this material has moved onto the Internet.  The reality is that society has deemed it not to be appropriate.  If it is not appropriate in a newspaper, surely it is not appropriate in formats like the various Internet platforms.  I understand completely that what makes these platforms unique and what makes them work is freedom of expression and the ability to put something online immediately.  At the same time, there is an element of responsibility around this, including as regards consent.  I would like to get Ms Niculescu's views because we have not heard from her in regard to checking out that consent or whether consent is checked out regularly in respect of images other than child sexual material.</p></speech>

The mandate of <i>hotline.ie</i>is to handle reports of suspected illegal content.  In assessing those reports, we have to apply the provisions of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act.  If content does not meet the threshold which is clearly detailed in the Act, it will not be classified as child pornography.  We prefer to use the term &quot;child sexual abuse material&quot; because of the serious nature of the content.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, we are talking about infants to 12 year olds.  We also get reports in respect of self-generated content but in terms of the age group, that would involve those aged over 14 years and it is not as severe as the sexual abuse of a two year old infant.  I am not sure that-----</p></speech>

We all agree and know what type of content is illegal.  We have experiences, however, of seeing different types of content being shared and uploaded on our services and platforms, some of which is equally harmful and has no place on our platforms.  I am referring, for example, to an area such as the non-consensual sharing of intimate imagery.  Even if that an image was initially taken with consent, that is not allowed to be shared or posted on our platform subsequently without the consent of the person originally involved.  That is not allowed on our platforms.  We would take such an image down and also bank it to prevent it from being uploaded again.  Some of the content referred to earlier, such as implied sexual, or sexually suggestive content, involving minors, would also breach our policies and we would also take that down.</p></speech>

In most cases, the context is lacking, so we need to judge the image on its own.  Sometimes we only get one image reported, with no comments or further description from the person making that report.  In assessing that one image, we need to ensure that the image itself is manifestly illegal and meets the threshold set out in legislation.  When there is more context, then we can make judgments regarding inappropriateness.  When we are talking about harmful content, the language we use is very important as it helps us to conceptualise the problem and also to forge responses.  We must ensure we are referring to the same thing.  To avoid any confusion, <i>hotline.ie</i>only deals with illegal content online.  We think more can be done regarding self-generated content and content which may be age inappropriate, but that does not fall within our current mandate.</p></speech>

Our view is that what is unacceptable offline should be unacceptable online as well and the law should reflect that.

We have all seen live feeds of people going around towns in Ireland, making comments such as "look at all of the black people in this town, isn't this terrible?", and using that in a way to enable the promotion of a certain type of racism.  It is almost like the modern version of the Ku Klux Klan has found a new place to operate on the Internet and they seem to be free to do so.  Many complaints have been made about several individuals and organisations that engage in that type of behaviour.  Very little seems to be happening to address this issue because it is ongoing.</p> <p>  We can look it up right now on the computer.  I am sure we will find those people are there livestreaming some commentary which is very racist, abusive and dangerous.  I do not understand how the organisations represented here today cannot take responsibility.  If they are responsible, they have to extend that responsibility beyond just stating that they will take down such material.  It then happens the next day and is taken down, and then the next day and so on.</p><p>At what stage does a company reach a point when it accepts that it must go further than simply continually removing the content, and that it needs to be proactive rather than reactive?  There seems to be no limit where that line is crossed. </p></speech>

When something meets the threshold of hate speech, it is one category of this type of content which would violate our community standards and would be removed.  There are several different nuances within the type of content being shared on the platform.  There is material that obviously violates the terms but we must also respect that there may be political views within that criticising asylum seekers or the migration of people.  It is not a clearcut process where one can run through each and every one and say that they are all hate speech and they must all be taken down.  We do take it very seriously.  That is why we take review of each of these cases extremely seriously.  Having said that, we have said what our line is.  We are open to hearing whether our line should go further.  I will ask Ms Rush to speak on the legal situation in Ireland on hate speech.  Facebook has set out its policy and we enforce against that.

It can be difficult when reviewing a piece of content without the surrounding circumstances to know whether, in theory, it would rise to the level of incitement.  It is very hard to know that when there is a vitriolic or malicious attack on a person.  Our position is that making derogatory threats or statements or dehumanising speech is not allowed, even if the content is perfectly lawful within a jurisdiction, and we will still take it down if it violates our policies.</p> <p>  One example of a fairly successful self-regulatory regime is the EU code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech.  That tests us on our responsiveness in taking down illegal hate speech as swiftly as possible.  We go through rounds of testing, most recently at the end of 2018.  After that test, the EU Commission observed that the most serious types of hate speech, that is credible threats, had the highest rate of removal at 82% whereas in more nuanced speech, where it was difficult to make a determination whether or not it constituted incitement or if it was insulting language, that a greater balance had to be struck, and it seemed as though the signatory companies were trying to take that balancing exercise very seriously when assessing the content. </p></speech>

If the same content is coming from the same organisation or individual, is there precedent for the company to say that this organisation or individual will no longer have access to the platform?  That would be a start.</p></speech>

If criminal, dangerous or hate organisations start to have a presence on Facebook we will remove them immediately.</p><p>I do not mean this flippantly, but Deputy Martin Kenny referred to the KKK earlier.  If it wanted to set up a benign page which had nothing whatever to do with hate speech, we would take that down as its ideology is contrary to our principles and policies.  We would not allow the organisation itself to have a presence on the platform, nor would we allow any other user to engage in praise, support or representation of that organisation.   </p></speech>

Twitter has a hateful conduct policy.  It outlines that it is against our rules to promote violence against, threaten or attack others on the basis of a range of protected categories such as gender and race.  Twitter's focus is on behaviour over content in particular.  It is much easier to identify certain types of abusive behaviours and scale that than solely looking at hate speech which is highly subjective and often context dependent.  Twitter is somewhat unique in that it is a public communications platform.  We are looking at behaviours of different types of accounts.  Our systems can proactively detect if, for instance, one account is @-mentioning another account repeatedly and that account does not follow them.  That might signal to us that someone is engaging in some level of abusive behaviour or if there is some sort of dog-piling with an attack on another account.  Sometimes we take a variety of these signals in combination to give us some indication that we need to review an account for hateful conduct or abusive behaviour.  I can assure the Deputy that our policies are applied consistently across the board.  When violations are found actions are taken.  There are various actions, which I outlined, that we can take beginning with the outright suspension of an account.  We have vastly improved the stopping of repeat offenders coming back to Twitter by setting up another account and leveraging our own technology; we are finding new ways to do that and to stop them coming back to Twitter to engage in the same behaviours.  There are those on our service who set up what we classify as sole purpose accounts where they engage in nothing more than abusing others.  That type of behaviour is reviewed against our policies and we take appropriate action.  There is a range of actions we can take.  We also introduced a change to our hateful conduct policy on dehumanisation.  Research shows that dehumanising language leads to offline violence.  We have made a change to our hateful conduct policy in regard to religious groups.  We will continue to iterate on those.</p> <p>    Mr. Costello might talk to some of our efforts with NGOs with whom we work.   </p></speech>

Earlier, in reply to Deputy Connolly, she spoke of the idea of counter speech, that Twitter allowed a conversation to happen so that others from a counter view could get in and put their piece in.  That might be all right at one level but at another I wonder if it is part of a big picture which Twitter is trying to create.</p><p>From the point of view of the platform gaining traction and popularity, be it Twitter, Google or something else, if there is controversy, a heightened conversation or a major debate, it means people are interested, watching and keying into it.  As such, creating these two counterviews and giving them amplification helps the platforms gain traction.  Many people have the view that, although the platforms claim they are watching over something, they are really just letting it run.  To date, there has been at least some evidence of this.</p></speech>

We take on board that it is our responsibility to try to change it and educate people on the work that has been undertaken by the company over the past couple of years to improve the health of public conversation on Twitter and put various mechanisms in place to help empower our users so that they feel that they have a safer experience online.  There is still work that we need to do as regards perceptions.</p> <p>  There is no business incentive to leave rule-violating content on our service.  Counter-speech works.  There are different categories of content that we address.  There is content that is illegal and content that is not illegal but is in violation of the Twitter rules.  In certain jurisdictions, our terms of service and rules go far beyond the laws.  Then there is content that is neither illegal nor a violation of the Twitter rules.  We find that counterspeech in particular can have a positive impact on that type of speech, as it is a space where people offer diverse views that challenge prejudices, intolerance and racism online.  They are calling others out, saying that certain types of speech are wrong and showing a more tolerant and respectful viewpoint.  It is within the context of the type of speech that is neither illegal nor a violation of the Twitter rules that counterspeech can have a positive impact.</p></speech>

It is short.  One cannot get into the detail of an argument on Twitter.  One just puts out a paragraph at most.  From that point of view, it is difficult to see how counterspeech can work, given that all one ends up with is a whole lot of people shouting at one another.  Ms White called it a "perception", but for most people it is the actual experience.</p> <p>  I understand the Chair wishes to get through this, but the other issue is-----</p></speech>

Young people in particular use many of the platforms.  We hear of young people who are self-harming, sometimes to the extent of suicide.  Much of that comes from pressure they have been put under online.  We often discover in the aftermath that various complaints were made but material was not removed from online in spite of people's requests.</p> <p>  The committee is undertaking work on the issue of spent convictions.  The people in question have moved on with their lives.  Someone in my area had mental health issues when young and got into trouble.  However, if one were to Google that person's name today, a media report would come up.  There was a request to have that search result taken down, but the response was that it was in the public interest to leave it even though it was hurtful and damaging to the individual in question.  Anyone looking at this logically would not see a public interest in the matter at all.</p> <p>  A large amount of work is to be done by all of the organisations before us if they are to gain people's confidence in these matters.  How and where are the organisations moving as regards the right of a person to move on with his or her life and the issue of young and vulnerable people being victimised online?</p></speech>

We will take Mr. Meade first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-09a.1401" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ryan Meade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019100900002#XX00200"><p>I might also answer the Deputy's previous question.  He was right to mention livestreaming as a category of content that needed special caution.  At YouTube, we have preliminary hurdles that people need to jump through before they get the ability to livestream.  For example, they need to have a certain number of followers and cannot be brand new.  They cannot just create an account and suddenly start livestreaming.  If there is a violation of our policies, their ability to livestream can be taken away.  We have taken the approach that livestreaming is something that needs special attention.</p> <p>  Regarding the types of livestreaming the Deputy mentioned, he may or may not be aware that we updated out policy on hate speech this year, which has resulted in violations by people who were livestreaming.  In one fairly high-profile case, we terminated that account.  The Deputy may have seen that there has been quite a reaction to that.  This shows that there has been progress in the development and implementation of our policy.  There is no question but that we will suspend accounts and remove people's opportunity to use these tools if they violate the policies.</p> <p>  The question on spent convictions is an interesting one, in that it cuts across privacy law.  The right to be forgotten was been established in European privacy law.  The practical implication of this is that platforms, including Google Search, must assess requests from users to delist information.  The information may still be out there on the Internet, but we must assess the request to delist it from our search engine.  The law also requires us to apply a balancing test.  As such, there has to be a consideration of whether other issues need to be taken into account.  Naturally, any decision we make on this basis is subject to dispute, in that people may say that we made the right or wrong decision.  In such cases, there is recourse to the Data Protection Commission, DPC, as the matter is handled under privacy law.  The individual in question can make a complaint to the DPC if he or she is not happy with our decision.  The law requires us to have a balancing test.  As Mr. &Oacute; Broin stated, private companies like us may not always be the right arena in which to make such decisions, but that is what is required of us under the law.  We need to consider requests as they come in, apply the test and make a determination on whether information should be delisted.</p></speech>

She was present for quite a part of the meeting and is well entitled to that.</p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge that, while the focus of our engagement over a number of hours today has been on what we all accept are the worst excesses of human usage of each of the platforms' sites, the services they provide are very valuable, appreciated and utilised responsibly by the overwhelming majority of their respective customers.</p><p>That needs to be said because, otherwise, we are giving a very skewed image and perception of the respective sites with which our guests are involved.  I am of the view that this acknowledgment is important, but the focus of our address is harmful online activity.  Although we are some steps away from producing our report and recommendations, I get the sense that there is a general unified opinion coming from all the members that the platform companies are facilitating significantly harmful postings, including criminal acts, that have given rise to serious injury and worse.  I hope our guests are equally committed to addressing and, where possible at all, eradicating that activity.</p><p> I wish to reflect on the contributions of those who appears before us last week.  They were very strong in their recommendations.  The committee is very mindful of the importance of working together.  The respective component parts of the industry must work with legislators to try to reach a better situation where safety is critical and most especially in respect of children, but where there is safety for all users if at all possible.</p><p> Some of our guests keep referring to rules.  There has been talk of Twitter rules and Facebook rules.  When the rules have been broken, the companies respond.  It is almost a competition from our perspective.  In terms of breaking the rules, in many of those instances and most certainly in the most serious of the cases that have been reported to us, we would like to see that people have broken the law.  It is not enough just to look at some as being inappropriate.  We would like to see some of the cases that have been reflected to us as involving illegality.</p><p> I am minded of the contribution last week of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  I am very grateful to Mr. John Church, its chief executive.  I will just instance one of the cases that was brought to its attention.  A 16 year old girl told Childline that she had sent images to a former boyfriend, who then shared them with others without her permission.  With the images circulating widely, the girl told Childline she could not face going back to school and was contemplating suicide.  I do not expect a response on that today but, in the context of the exercise we have embarked on, we are very mindful of the harm, hurt and serious consequences involved and we want to try to find a means of address.  We have only the power of recommendation to the Minister and the Government, but we will not shirk in our responsibilities in outlining the strongest recommendations if we believe they are the most appropriate.</p><p> Professor Joe Carthy was mentioned.  He is the founding director of the UCD centre for cybersecurity.  He made an analogy with automobile legislation.  Every car has a number plate.  Every car is registered to someone.  He said while it is perfectly acceptable to use the Internet in any anonymous fashion, it is not acceptable to abuse, bully or libel others anonymously.  He said it is akin to allowing people to drive cars without number plates.</p><p>This is a key area in respect of which legislation could make a huge difference.  Professor Carthy believes that we should require social media platforms and online providers to register their users and that users should provide appropriate evidence of identity, and not just after the event or in following through when something outrageous has happened.  He stated that users who can show that they have been bullied, harassed or abused on a social media platform should be legally entitled to find out the identity of the user carrying out the inappropriate behaviour.  I would welcome a brief response to that.  I know that if Professor Carthy was here he would like to ask our guests about this matter.  I invite a response from Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  Our guests have probably all looked at a recording of last week's meeting so they know what I am talking about.</p></speech>

As I understand it, however, the basis on which we provide that information to a third party is through something called a Norwich Pharmacal order whereby we are given a legal basis on which to share information about an account to a third party.

Deputy Howlin wants to place that on a statutory footing in his proposed Bill.  That is something we already comply with in any event and do so in a large number of cases.  We are open to discussing how that would work in practice.</p></speech>

We have already had much debate with other members of this committee about the introduction of verification and some form of digital ID.  The European Commission is looking at the issue.  It must weigh up the benefits of introducing a harmonised system of digital ID across Europe.  We are very much looking at how something like that could be applied globally, because that is what we would need to do.</p> <p>  I have mentioned some of the challenges in respect of collecting additional data, for example, government ID, but introducing that kind of verification mechanism where we might have to register individuals who use our service could also have severe implications for human rights activists, dissidents and in countries like Russia where similar requests have been made to us.  There is a balance to be struck and much more consultation and debate are needed on the benefits.  I understand many of the arguments made by Professor Carthy.  I looked at last week's session.

Unfortunately, there is no simple solution but we can commit to continuing discussion and collaboration to find a solution in this very important area.</p></speech>

The question of proportionality is really the big issue when it comes to verification of accounts.  There are cases in which it is a proportionate response to require verification of accounts, but I am not sure we would go so far as to say that universal verification of accounts for anyone engaging in activity online is a proportionate response.  On the other hand, in many ways, that is for legislators to decide.  Professor Carthy may have a different view and he may feel that is proportionate.  That is a matter for debate.</p><p>The only thing I would say is a variety of voices would need to be heard on that issue.  As the Chairman rightly pointed out earlier, we are focusing on the activity of a minority and the worst activity of that minority.  There is a vast corpus of Internet users out there who are benefitting from these services daily and their interests must be taken into account as well.  Apologies for the fudge, but I encourage legislators to look at the proportionality of that as a measure.</p></speech>

I hear what Mr. Meade is saying.  I wish to make one other point.  Senator Higgins need not worry; she will get her bite at the cherry.</p><p><b></b>The representatives from Facebook cited, in their opening statement and in their contribution since, the extent of their response to material that is inappropriate and that is brought to their attention internally or reported to them.  I am going to refer to a particular case of which I am aware, and to at least two Facebook pages that existed for a number of years.  I refer to the recent outrageous and dreadful attack on Kevin Lunney, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings.  At least one of the Facebook pages in question referenced, by name, the senior executives of the company and allegations were made against them.  Other posts included mock-ups of posters calling individuals traitors and warning of consequences.  The intention in this regard was to misrepresent and label those executives.  Some of them were referenced on the page.  When I sat with these people, including Kevin Lunney, earlier this year, I was mindful that we were embarking on this particular exercise.  My question would have been put to our guests in any event, regardless of what happened to Kevin recently, which was an absolute disgrace.  My question is the same as it would have been if the attack had not taken place.  The executives in question made repeated requests of Facebook to remove the offensive material.  I understand that Facebook removed it he day after Kevin Lunney was kidnapped and attacked.  Facebook described is as a violation of authenticity guidelines.  I wonder how our guests will explain the meaning of the latter.  In any event, it was action after the event.  It was much too late.  The material was hugely offensive.  It was intended to harm the good name and reputation of the people involved and, as a Deputy representing the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, I believe it fed into a view that in some way those people, the named parties, and the businesses they were involved in, were a legitimate target for the worst excesses of what I can only describe as the most ill-informed people on this island.  How does Facebook respond to the example I have cited?  I would have raised it with Facebook even if the attack had not taken place because the pages should have been removed.  The vile content and its intent and purpose is an affront to any and every one of us.  I invite Mr. &Oacute; Broin and Ms Rush to respond.</p></speech>

We were all shocked by the events in Cavan and we extend our sympathies to Mr. Lunney.  We have been working with the Quinn Industrial Holdings team for a number of years and it has made a number of reports to us about content.  We have removed a significant number of posts from a number of pages.</p><p>There is a focus on a particular post.  I will not go into the details.  When it was reported to us initially, it was reviewed and found not to be violating our community standards.  It was then brought back to our attention through the media on 20 September.  At that point, it was put into an authenticity check.  It was then reviewed and found to be violating our community standards.  The post and the page on which it appeared have been removed from the platform.</p></speech>

The series of attacks and outrageous actions that have taken place, clearly targeted at the executives in Quinn Industrial Holdings, not only put their safety at risk but also put at risk the jobs of the approximately 850 people who depend on their expert oversight of the respective companies.  As another member stated, it would be to return these fields to fields of rushes.  The community is so dependent on the organisations that it would be an absolute tragedy if any or all of these companies were to fold.  Even to have them put at risk is an outrage and an affront to the community that depends on them.  If the post met the community standards, Facebook needs to examine those standards.</p></speech>

It was found not to be violating our community standards.  We should have taken the wider context into account.</p></speech>

The issue of targeted harassment is one I hope to return to in a moment, specifically in conversation with the representatives from Twitter.  It is notable that in its testimony today, Facebook has told us it is not confident there is any lawful weight to its guidelines.  Twitter, with regard to the Ryan case specifically, said that if there had been any legal action, it would have co-operated in the case.  Even in the representatives' own words, they are strongly making the case not only regarding legislation on hate speech but also regarding legislation on online regulation.  Representatives from both Facebook and Twitter pointed out that they would have moved further if required to by law.  This underscores the need for legislation in this area and the fact that self-regulation clearly has its limits.  Community standards have little concrete weight when it comes to persons' lives and persons who may be the subject of online abuse, regardless of whether they choose to be part of the online community.  That is important because the duty of protection is not simply to users but to all citizens.  That is a wider concern.  The duty of protection also extends to those who may not be citizens but who are resident in our country.</p> <p>  Let me point to an issue raised by Deputy Brophy.  Follow-up information and granular detail may be required.  Deputy Brophy asked about the resources and number of staff allocated for taking down offensive or harmful content.  I would like a breakdown also on the resources devoted to brand protection.  All the organisations represented today have a large number of staff working on brand protection, for example, to ensure their advertisers' branding is not being misused.  I am aware there are those whose work is dedicated specifically to targeting and watching out for issues that may be of concern to advertisers.  I do not know the extent to which those issues, in terms of brand protection removals, are subject to notification requirements.  Are there staff permanently allocated to deal with these issues?  In providing us with the information on staffing and resources allocated for taking down content that violates standards, the representatives might give a specific breakdown on the proportion of resources allocated to deal with harmful content and the proportion triggered by notifications, by comparison with the resources allocated to deal with issues such as brand protection.</p></speech>

It has been pointed out time and again that the e-commerce directive is wildly out of date.  In many cases, individuals are not in a position to notify because they may not be aware of the offensive or harmful content related to them.  I want to focus a little on the facilities associated with the targeting of information.  If I do not see abusive content about me, I am not in a position to notify the relevant organisation about it.  This leads to the question of the targeting of information.</p><p> Twitter has a policy whereby it can block content but it tries to support a person's experience on the site.  I may not be simply concerned about my experience on the site but about abusive content about me.  As I understand it, Twitter changed its rules, and perhaps there has been a further change, whereby if I block somebody and assume that person no longer has access to my information, that person can still see me and speak about me but I do not see what he or she is saying.  That change in the blocking provision is a very serious concern and relates to stalking, harassment and so forth.  It is not just my experience but misinformation.</p><p> Ms White indicated that Twitter never automatically suspends accounts.  I have spoken to people who have been the subject of very targeted campaigns of harassment and a person who has been suspended as a consequence immediately created a new account and resumed the harassment.  This is a real concern.  When the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, spoke to this committee it emphasised that this should not apply only to repeated activity but a single incident should be enough.  Stalking is one of the concerns that may be included in this Bill.  Someone can repeatedly re-register on new accounts but Twitter will wait until that person does something offensive or dangerous.  That approach creates a very chilling fear for a person.  I will not bring the people involved into committee testimony but I know there are people who have been repeatedly targeted by accounts which effectively threatened them and when those accounts were suspended a new one immediately appeared.  How can Twitter improve its blocking mechanisms to address those concerns? </p></speech>

She mentioned a strong emphasis on notification.  I have tried to communicate to the committee this morning that we are trying to reduce the burden on victims having to report to Twitter.  People absolutely need a mechanism to get in touch with Twitter to tell us if they have been subjected to certain types of behaviour.  In response to the Senator's point that if someone cannot see something, that person cannot notify us, we made a change some years ago to allow bystander reporting.  If a person sees something online, it goes back to the "see something, say something" principle.  If people see someone being bullied in the playground, they should say something to the teacher.  The same principles apply online.  We allow bystander reporting. </p> <p>  In addition, I have highlighted that 30% of the action that we take on content deemed to be abusive behaviour is taken proactively.  That is without any reports; it is content that Twitter has surfaced for human review.  We hope that figure will increase so that we can further reduce the burden on victims having to report content to us.</p> <p>  We had a problem with repeat offenders at Twitter.  It was a bit like playing whack-a-mole in that we would suspend an account and another account would be opened.  We did significant work with our trust and safety council which advised us of the need to remedy this situation.  We have stopped repeat offending by more than 100,000 accounts over the past year.</p><p>Our actions are having real results.  I do not mean to imply that we have fixed the problem in its totality but we are slowing it down.  Our actions are stopping repeat offenders opening new accounts or engaging in multiple account abuse, where one individual has multiple accounts with the sole intention of abusing others on the service.  We rely on behaviour base signals.  There are several signals that may not be visible to individuals who use our service or to the public at large but they are behind the scenes, such as whether an email address has been verified or whether an account is mentioning other accounts in large volumes.  That would give the impression to us that an account is potentially violating rules on behaviour.</p></speech>

If we believe an account holder has opened another account, there are several ways we can do that.  He or she may use the same email address, IP address or telephone number.  We automatically suspend those accounts once we have made a determination that somebody who has been suspended is trying to circumvent the Twitter rules to open another account.  That person will be suspended from the service.</p></speech>

Previously, I understood blocking meant that person would not see my content if I did not wish to engage with that person on Twitter and did not want him or her to see my content.</p></speech>

If the person happens to be in a group direct message conversation, the person who has been blocked is ejected from the group conversation.  Blocking on Twitter is a definitive way to cut ties with someone on the platform.</p> <p>  Muting is the low-friction way of controlling interaction with someone else on the platform.  That may be what the Senator is referring to.  If the Senator mutes someone, she will not see that person's content and timeline but if she navigates to the person's profile, she will see what he or she says about anything.</p></speech>

The appendix to Facebook's presentation was optimistic when it suggested an amendment to the Bill which provided that communication does not include provision of information society services.  I hope and expect that would be roundly rejected because it is a very ambitious attempt by Facebook to remove itself from its responsibilities.  There are questions about what a platform and publication are, which need to be teased out but there is a communication function and communication is taking place.  That was acknowledged elsewhere.  This is not a neutral platform for freedom of expression.  It is a commercial platform in which certain particular messages can be promoted, highlighted and amplified.  It is not a neutral <i>tabula rasa</i>where people place their tuppence worth.  What steps does Twitter believe need to be taken to change its financial model?  I accept that there are serious concerns about freedom of expression.  I do not know that we should automatically move towards identification of persons online.  We need to consider what happened in China and avoid government ideas being used in that sense.</p><p>If I am paying to have my message amplified then there is a different responsibility and in terms of the facilitation of the anonymous targeting of information.  On the question of harmful communications, which I know is a wider issue here, Senator Lynn Ruane and I previously put forward a measure that has not been commenced but is in legislation on the use of information to target vulnerable persons such as an 18 year old with, for example, an eating disorder.  There is a wider issue around the targeting of messaging. </p></speech>

Particularly in Google search, the ads are clearly labelled on the top and on YouTube the ads are clearly labelled as ads.  That is a very important principle for us.  We do not take payment for boosting content.  We have the ability for users to click in and see why the ad was displayed to them.</p> <p>  I welcome the Senator's question because she addressed an important matter.  I think the question is what standards should apply to platforms, as platforms, rather than identify whether we can just apply the standards that exist for publishers and apply them to platforms.
