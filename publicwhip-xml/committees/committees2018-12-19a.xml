I will briefly introduce our strategic plan and talk about specific initiatives we believe are relevant to the committee's agenda on climate change.  Ms McEvilly will speak about smart metering which I understand is of particular interest to the committee.</p> <p>  We have recently completed drafting our new strategic plan for the period 2019 to 2021 and initiated the formal process to lay the plan before the Houses of the Oireachtas and publish it.  While keeping our mission pretty much unchanged, we have put climate change at the heart of our strategic plan and vision for the future.  Specifically, we have identified our vision of a sustainable, reliable and efficient supply of energy and water and a secure low carbon future.  That is a big step and change for us.  It shows, following on from some of the recommendations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, that we do intend to step forward and demonstrate leadership in this area.  </p> <p>  We have identified four strategic priorities for the next three years: to deliver sustainable, low carbon solutions, with well regulated markets and networks; to emphasise compliance and accountability; communications, particularly to support customers as they make the transition; and to foster and maintain a high performance culture within our own organisation to deliver on our mandate.</p> <p>  We are in the process of delivering an enduring connection policy, following a significant period when we were operating what was called gate 3, or the previous batch processing of connections.  That meant no connections were being processed for a long time.  We are looking to change this and introduce regular batch processing of connections.  Our first batch, enduring connection policy, ECP-1, has been initiated directly to facilitate the 2020 targets.  We are also considering our second batch, ECP-2, and will work with the Department to ensure that batch facilitates the new renewable energy support scheme.  In addition, we are taking an active interest in renewable gas, how it might be connected to the system, its future role and how it can be done safely.  </p> <p>  We undertake five-year price controls for gas and electricity networks.  There is nothing new in this, but it is the key enabler in the delivery of infrastructure.  A low carbon future will rely very heavily on infrastructure to deliver the outcomes sought.  We are also working on interconnectors, another area which is key to the integration of renewables into the system.  The three interconnectors of particular note are the North-South interconnector which links Northern Ireland and the Republic; the Celtic interconnector which links Ireland with France and the Greenlink interconnector which links Ireland with Great Britain.  We are also actively engaged in considering how gas and electricity might be integrated into the transport and heating sectors.  The electrification of transport relies on networks to deliver that power.  To the extent that gas is being used to help to decarbonise transport such as the use of compressed natural gas, CNG, in place of diesel, it requires working with the network developers and also the CNG station developers.  </p> <p>  Through our network price controls, we will seek to support Irish Water in making the necessary investments to ensure the water and wastewater infrastructure in Ireland is resilient, that it promotes conservation and that it is capable of adapting to climate change, the extremes of rain and drought.  </p> <p>  There are three significant revenue streams in the electricity wholesale market - energy, capacity and ancillary services.  The recent completion of the integrated single electricity market, SEM, project and the launch on 1 October of the new single electricity market support flexible units and the roll-out of renewable technology.  They also support the introduction of flexible demand and storage to the electricity system.  It has been demonstrated that we are now getting highly efficient use of the existing interconnectors between the island of Ireland and Great Britain - the Moyle and the east-west interconnectors.  The Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System, DS3, programme which is well advanced and has groundbreaking ambitions has been designed to accommodate higher levels of renewables in the system.  We can accommodate up to 65% of renewables in the system at any point in time and maintain security.  The target is to get to a figure of 75% by 2020.  As recently as last Friday night, 73% of the demand on the island was being met by electricity from renewable resources.  That was facilitated because we were able to export the amount of electricity above 65% through the interconnectors to Great Britain.  That demonstrates the benefits being derived from DS3 and the role of interconnectors in delivering these benefits.  We also welcome the significant progress being made and the political agreement that seems to have been reached on the clean energy package for all European citizens and very much look forward to working to implement the changes that will come about as a result.</p> <p>  Ms McEvilly will talk about retail markets and smart metering.</p><p>It is an ambition of national and EU energy policy to put customers and citizens at the heart of the transition to a low-carbon future.  The Citizens' Assembly also placed an emphasis on finding ways to encourage businesses to reach out to customers to bring them with us on this journey.  We believe the CRU will have a role in regulating retail markets, particularly in the context of the smart metering project.  We will put customers at the heart of everything we do.  Our strategy focuses on protecting and empowering customers, ensuring that they have the correct tools and information and are able to make the correct choices in order to benefit from the transition.  That means enabling customers to benefit from competition and also focusing on the types of new technologies we believe will become available in the context of smart metering and smart homes.  It also means supporting customers to actively engage in energy markets to ensure that they can become what we have called "prosumers" or can become involved in microgeneration.  They can also switch some of their energy consumption in order to avail of cheaper tariffs at certain times or of different technologies which will help them to lower their own bills and assist in the decarbonisation agenda.</p><p> Our smart metering project is really a facilitative project which will enable much of this to happen.  We believe it will have benefits for customers, the economy and the decarbonisation agenda.  If we get it right it will be a rare win-win-win project.  We have been working with the Department, ESB Networks - which is going to roll out the electricity meters - and with the entire supply industry in Ireland to try to ensure that we can achieve the conditions necessary to make this work to the benefit of customers.  We hope to empower customers by giving them better information and choices and encouraging, enabling and incentivising them to avail of energy efficiency options, providing better price information and better information about their consumption and facilitating the use of renewable energy.  We spoke about the possibility of having more sources of renewable energy on the network and about making the best use of those renewables.  It is really important to us, and it would be great if customers could get the benefit of that.  One of the really interesting features of the wholesale market redesign is that we can see that when there is a large amount of wind energy on the system the wholesale price goes down.  It would be wonderful if we could enable domestic customers to avail of those lower prices at certain times.  That will involve the provision of better information through smart meters, and smart home technology in some cases, which will help them to do this without having to constantly decide when to turn on the emersion, and enabling smart products to come through from suppliers.  We see this is as the way forward.  It enables ESB Networks to do things in a smarter way.  We have to consider where to invest in the grid, where we can be more efficient, how we can support the electrification of transport and heating on a mass scale at least cost and how we make better investment decisions.  It is an enabler of all of those options.</p><p> This is a massive project.  It will cost &euro;1.1 billion.  We had to weigh up the benefits as we see them and we conducted a major smart metering trial to that end.  In some ways the data is now outdated.  We were looking at very simple applications for customers, but found that they could save up to 10% on their bills through simply having better information about how electricity is used in their homes.  A better understanding would mean that their consumption could be reduced.  A time of use tariff, which would enable a family to move some of their high energy consumption usage, for example, turning the washing machine or dishwasher on, would involve adding a low-cost time during the evening, discouraging people from using electricity at peak times.  If that is taken up on a large scale we might be able to avoid having to build additional generators to meet peak demand.  We looked at peak demand events over the last few weeks.  It is wintertime now, and we are seeing quite high prices because we were bringing on old and often very carbon-inefficient peaking units to meet the very high peak in the wintertime.  It would be great if we could avoid that and have customers pay less money by using their electricity off-peak.  Those are the kinds of benefits we see.</p><p> It would offer a better service to customers.  There would be no more estimated bills.  The members may know that CRU has a customer care team which deals with customers who are having problems with their suppliers.  Estimated bills are one of the most intractable problems we face.  A customer believes he or she has been paying his or her bills and discovers that they have been estimated over a period of years, leaving him or her owing a large amount.  That is a very difficult problem to resolve.  However, smart meters will help us resolve it by providing more up to date information for customers.  It will also help us avoid the manual costs of meter reads and network investment.  We can gain from many areas of this project.</p><p> Phase 1 of the project will commence this year.  ESB Networks is in the process of finalising procurement at the moment.  This is a major project.  We have to buy and install the meters, and then we will face a huge IT project around the availability of the data from those meters.  ESB Networks has to update its central IT systems, as does every supplier active in the market.  We will go from a situation where each customer is getting four meter reads a year or four items of data for all customers regarding consumption and how they will be billed, to potentially having much richer data.  IT upgrades are required across the board.  In our phased approach, over 2019 and 202 we will roll out the first 250,000 ESBN meters in a replacement programme, effectively upgrading the meters from what we have at present.  The IT project is ongoing and we will be able to go live with the smart services by January of 2021.  Meters in homes that have are capable of transmitting that richer data set will be live and suppliers can start offering different services to customers based on that.  In the following two phases we will roll out more meters so that this will ultimately become a national replacement project.  By 2024, we should have significant penetration by these meters.  In effect, all homes and small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in Ireland should be covered at that stage, and the meters and the data will be working at full functionality.  That is the plan, and it is well under way.</p></speech>

Why is it taking so long for community energy projects and community energy initiatives to get connections to the grid?  I am hearing stories of projects which have been waiting for seven to ten years.  Why has this not been sorted out?</p></speech>

There was a period when the focus was on connecting a large volume of wind energy in order to meet the 2020 targets for renewable energy, which led to a situation where a queue of various projects began to accumulate, including solar - small and large scale - offshore wind and others.  Our approach to connections has changed and we have introduced a regular batch system, the purpose of which is to bring forward many of the projects that fit with the renewable energy support scheme the Government is initiating.  If the Government, in the renewable energy support scheme, RESS, places an emphasis on community projects, our connection policy will also place an emphasis on them in order to try and match the support scheme with the connections.  We acknowledge that there have been delays in connecting projects heretofore, but we have now adopted a different approach to connections.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Melvin" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#F00500"><p>The previous system involved one large batch, perhaps 3,000 or 4,000 MW of connections, which took many years to build.</p><p>The current approach is that every two years or so there will be a smaller batch that could be developed, with offers made, and built.  The timing of those would line up with the various Government policies and initiatives, including the RESS.  The timing of the offers would coincide with the schemes there to support them.  If those RESS auctions take place every two years, the batches will be designed to match that so that all the different arms of policy are lined up.  Essentially, the batches for the connections will be timed to align with that every couple of years.</p></speech>

Is the RESS live now and what is the expectation for a community energy project in rural Cork, for example, if it started tomorrow?</p></speech>

It is a Government target but it is not within our bailiwick so I cannot be definitive about it.  It is our understanding.  It is important to say that if the RESS prioritises community projects, our connection policy will prioritise community projects.</p></speech>

There is much talk of the front end of what consumers will see and the choices they might have relating to energy supply into their homes.  That is fine and wonderful.  I have had some briefing from the ESB about smart metering.  I want to get to the back end.  If we are going to encourage a move towards renewables, we need to hear from the CRU about how it will unlock the regulatory burdens for community energy projects to get on the smart grid, as it has been called, and incentivise people to start producing electricity.</p></speech>

We now have a series of approximately 2,000 MW of connection offers out there supporting the likes of batteries, wind and solar in order to meet that policy priority.  The next batch will look at the next policy priority.  As I have said, if this includes community schemes under the RESS, the connection policy will meet that aim.</p></speech>

I will try to avoid duplication so I will leave aside points I was to make around community ownership and smart meters, which have been covered extensively in the presentation.</p> <p>  In the area of microgeneration, the Citizens' Assembly recommended the selling back into the grid of electricity from microgeneration by private citizens at a price at least equivalent to the wholesale price.  Incoming European Union legislation in the form of the recast EU renewable energy directive will usher in some of these elements to generate, store and sell renewable electricity for consumers in Ireland.  What are the challenges to microgeneration, storage, self-consumption and exporting to the grid?  How can we overcome these challenges and will we do so?  How far are we from getting a tariff for selling electricity back to the grid?  Many farmers are seeking to produce and sell renewable energy as part of their business models by using, for example, rooftop spaces for solar power or other methods.  When will they be able to produce and export to the grid?</p></speech>

They will be able to record how much electricity is being exported, which just is not possible through the current metering system, and suppliers will be able to receive the data.  The smart meters will also match the supplier and the customer's home with the wholesale market, it will be possible to link with the half-hourly price on the wholesale market.  People will be able to see the pattern from when electricity was exported and what the price was, effectively, in that period.  It can be fed through.  The smart meters are the enablers but there may be other actions that need to be completed in market methods to enable suppliers to offer that process.  We are happy to work on that because we know there is a real appetite to do it and we know it is part of the Citizens' Assembly agenda.  There will be a real benefit.  It is worth stating that for most customers in a domestic setting who invest in solar photovoltaic systems, a majority of the benefit will arise from them avoiding the purchase of electricity.  I am not sure what will be the value of exported electricity.  From the idea of equity, we will work towards people obtaining the wholesale price.</p></speech>

We heard from EirGrid about its ambition to reach to a level where 75% of renewable generation is in the system.  Ireland is currently at a world-leading 65% in this regard.  It is great that we are showing leadership in the area.  What is the impact of having large levels of intermittent renewables on the grid?  How is EirGrid and the ESB planning for more stable generation that would underpin the process?  That is also necessary.</p> <p>  There is enormous potential to generate renewable energy in maritime areas off the coast.  What are the obstacles to development of successful offshore renewable energy and how can these be overcome?  How exactly are our guests examining the position regarding renewables?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul McGowan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#G01900"><p>I will start and then pass over to Mr. Melvin.  It is widely acknowledged that the DS3 programme and the delivery figure of 75% is groundbreaking internationally.  Many people are looking at what we are achieving.  The reality is we are at 65% and security of supply has been shown to be maintained.  We have demonstrated that the system can cope with 65% and the increase to 70% and 75% will be subject to trial before it becomes transmission policy.  It will require a radical change in some aspects of the generation portfolio.  For example, one of the key elements we are considering is the role of batteries or fast-acting storage and discharge devices.  Batteries seem to be the predominant technology in this area.  DS3 is now delivering competitive auctions to bring that type of technology into the system.  Next year we will run the first auctions to deliver between 90 MW and 110 MW with that type of technology.  This is the sort of technology we must see on the system in order to deliver the required level of renewables penetration in the system while maintaining security.</p></speech>

The DS3 programme was designed to indicate the services that the grid needed to see in order to be secure while having large amounts of intermittent renewables.  The wind may or may not stop blowing, for example, so reserves need to be ready to react quickly.  Frequency on the grid can change when there are many renewables on stream.  The purpose of this product was to keep the grid frequency stable.</p><p>We have seen that evolve over time.  We are purchasing the amount of these services required as the level of intermittent renewables goes up.  As Dr. McGowan said, many of the existing generators have modified and changed their equipment.  At one time the key focus for generation was efficiency, that is, to burn less fossil fuel for more electrons.  In the recent past because of these signals, it makes sense for generators to have flexibility to be able to respond quickly as well as efficiently.  That is because flexibility allows the greater levels of on-grid generation.  </p><p> Other ways to support more traditional generation are capacity mechanisms, including making payments to generators for being present on, and available to, the system.  As more and more renewables come on stream, the actual energy price declines.  As there is no margin at zero pence, why would those generators stay?  There are two parts to answering that question.  The first is payments for creating the services allowing a greater amount of renewables onto the system.  A support or a price also then will be paid for actually having generators on this island that are useful to us.  That is how we can allow that to develop and be supported.  </p></speech>

We have seen a major change, mainly as a result of auctions.  As the new RESS process is auction-based, it has been driving down the cost of offshore generation.  From our point of view, as my colleagues have explained, we will follow whatever is in the RESS system and try to facilitate that.  It is a matter then for the Minister and the Department as to how that is designed.  We are happy to input into that and to give further information.  If offshore generation is part of that system, we will look at its efficient integration.</p></speech>

Has that been examined in an Irish context for the emissions trading system, ETS, sector and how would the CRU view that?  Ireland's Climate Change Advisory Council has also recommended that a long-term price be set for carbon of &euro;80 per tonne by 2030 and that any increase in carbon taxation should be accompanied by measures to address energy poverty and reduce negative impacts on poor households.  How could this be implemented in a way that would not negatively affect those who are fuel poor or in rural areas?  We have had the process with water charges so it is really important that we bring people with us however we do this.  Are there lessons we can learn from the water charges process?</p></speech>

I will say, however, that a price floor or whatever will have an impact on the wholesale energy price in the market.  We have always stated that our role is to ensure the cost of energy is as low as it can be - not cheap - taking account of the need for security, sustainability and so forth.  It is a matter for Government policy as to how the impacts of those charges are dealt with at a societal level.  I do, however, agree with the Deputy - this is one thing we have noted regarding any major change we are looking at introducing - that people must want to go on this journey with the energy retailer, the generator or whoever it is.  People need to accept the gas or electricity infrastructure in their communities, they need to accept the generation technologies and they need to accept smart meters in their homes if this journey is to be a successful one.</p></speech>

While the energy sector has done more than the agriculture and transport sectors, which have done absolutely nothing, the reality is that we are still 90% dependent on fossil fuels for our energy mix.  That has to change.  Renewables are only 9.3% and that will lead to significant cost to the Exchequer.  Last year, emissions only fell marginally and that was because of a mild winter and because Moneypoint was out of action for a while.  We have to scale up our ambition.  I am fearful that we still do not get that across the State.  I have some direct questions.  When will the auction be next year?</p></speech>

Moneypoint has been down but we have had really good wind, good interconnection, neither of the interconnectors were down, and peat has been part of the fuel mix.  If all of those were to go overnight I do not think any of us would be as comfortable about security of supply.  We should, however, start planning in that direction.  It is worth saying that the PSO ends shortly.  By 2019 and early 2020 that PSO will be gone and 100% peat burning should be no more in this country.</p></speech>

The ESB has just got money from the Government to put fast chargers on motorways.  If the Government came to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities or if the Oireachtas recommended the initiation of a mechanism whereby supermarket car parks, public car parks and offices were mandated to provide a certain percentage of fast-charging EV connection points, would that fit within the new structures being put in place on how EV charging networks should work?</p></speech>

In the longer term, if nine out of ten people have an electric vehicle, they all arrive home at the same time and they all charge at the same time, local distribution issues might arise.  As we have supported ESB Networks in a trial to understand the impacts of electrical vehicle charging and electric vehicle infrastructure, the Irish distribution system operator, DSO, has a head start in understanding those impacts.  It is, therefore, something that could be dealt with or handled in the current structures.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that we have to turn the long run into the short run.  I believe we need to invest ahead of demand in this area and we need to make some bets on infrastructure investment to turn the long run into the short run.  Perhaps Mr. Blaney, as the future data communications commissioner, might be best placed to answer my final question.  I am very supportive of the smart metering project, as he knows.  In our other committee we have been screaming for this for years.  Who will own the data?</p></speech>

As it stands, we need to ensure we comply with all of the European legislation, particularly GDPR.  My colleagues have been in discussion with the Data Protection Commissioner on this.  It is important that consumers have confidence in the smart meter, that they have control of their data and that the data are not being used for any purposes for which they would not wish them to be used.  I am not sure it is necessarily a telecoms dimension.  Certainly, between the Data Protection Commissioner and the rights that are set in the process with ESB Networks, we are confident there will not be misuse of data and that data protection is built in.  Perhaps Ms MacEvilly might like to add to what I have said?</p></speech>

It is, ultimately, the customer who owns the data.</p><p>If we take what might be very granular data such as the half-hourly data, the Data Protection Commissioner and ourselves would view that as personal data and, therefore, the GDPR, would apply.  On the other hand, data are coming from our meters already and that is necessary for billing.  We want to make sure we get the right balance between still being able to extract a level of data from the meters to enable billing and better information to customers but nothing that would be construed as personal data without the customer's opt-in acceptance of that.  If they allow it to be given to ESB Networks or their supplier, the supplier does not have the right to simply pass that on.  The customer has the right all the time.  That is an important point.</p></speech>

I welcome the approach of putting customers at the heart of this process and that they will be able to avail of different technology that will enable them to lower their bills.  Better price information and education on this is key.  How do the witnesses propose to educate customers about smart meters?  It was stated that the installing of smart meters will be part of a national replacement programme over the next few years.  Will the witnesses confirm that the installation of a smart meter will not incur a cost for the customer?  Can I presume that the smart meter will feed into a central database and provide up-to-the-minute data for the CRU and other organisations?  That question was partially answered in respect of the GDPR.  One of the witnesses might further tease out what will be involved in that respect.</p></speech>

It will hold that information.  The information will be pulled a number of times a day back to ESB Networks.  This all assumes that the customer has opted in and has allowed the information to travel on that basis.  That will record the consumption every half hour.  That information is then passed on to the supplier of that customer.  CRU will not be getting these data on a minute by minute basis.</p> <p>  On the question of whether the customer will see a bill for the installation of a smart meter, the answer is, "No, they will not."  However, the meters cost money.  There is already a meter in place.  The paying down of the cost of that and its maintenance is inbuilt into the distribution system tariffs that form part of a customer's retail bill.  No one will approach customers and present them with a bill for the new smart meter, rather it will be a case of providing them with their new meter.  They either will have opted in, in which case the data will flow, or they will have not, in which case only the standard amount of data will come.</p> <p>  As for getting that price information to the consumer, there are many different methodologies and mechanisms.  For example, the half-hourly price is available on our website today.  One of the ways in which this might work, and it is only one such way, is for the customer to have an app in their home that is connected to the Internet that knows the price in this half-hour and that, essentially, could turn on the immersion now because the price is very low and there will be hot water when X, Y and Z comes home.  These sorts of decisions can be made without human intervention.  When we did the customer behaviour trial, essentially, as Ms MacEvilly said, the technology was not that sophisticated and it required customers to decide themselves that they would not turn on the dishwasher or the washing machine until after 7 p.m. or that they would get an item of work finished before 5 p.m., if they were home before 5 p.m.  Even that required level of human intervention allowed people to shift nearly 9% of the peak most expensive consumption out of that area.  People had the simple information that the period from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. was expensive and could move consumption from that period.  Those who participated were able to move activity away from the more expensive periods into the cheaper periods.  Also, by being able to see their information over the past week, they could see, for example, that the immersion must have been on all day and no one was in the house.  The provision of such information to the home, possibly by way of the Internet of things in the future in a more sophisticated way, will allow people to cut their overall consumption by around 3%. </p></speech>

One of the key areas on which we are currently working with ESB Networks and suppliers is a communications strategy.  We are starting to roll out the meters in 2019 but the smart services will not be available until 2021.  We realise there is a gap in that regard.  We will not be going out with a big singing and dancing national advertising campaign about smart meters when they will not be very smart for two years.  It will be more about informing customers, making sure there is information available to address any concerns they have in advance of the meters being installed in their areas and then, as we get to the point where the smart services are turned on, we will step up the information campaign to ensure customers can understand how they can benefit from having a smart meter, how they can avail of it and the offers available from their supplier.  There will be much more information coming down the tracks then as we move through the phases of the roll-out.  That strategy is core and I thank the Deputy for this opportunity to set it out.</p></speech>

That can be replicated in every local authority area although the numbers would be different.  Those 10,000 homes would comprise 10,000 individual customers with different accounts across the utility companies.  I have a suggestion which would offer many advantages.  Is it open to a local authority to organise a best-deal system for its 10,000 social housing tenants?  If it is, there is a quite a substantial housing stock.  I know the CRU will be rolling out smart metering.  Many of the innovative solutions offered by some of the companies are quite pricey.  They may offer savings and they definitely offer savings over the medium term, never mind the long term, but they are aimed at middle-income earners who can afford it.  I am mindful of those who cannot afford these types of measures.  If a local authority could purchase bundles from utility companies, it would put it in charge, in a much better way without controlling the entire process, of securing deals, reducing energy costs and monitoring all those energy costs.  Retrofitting is often the way we deal with some of these matters but that involves a major cost.  I do not know if this question has been raised previously or whether the commission has a view on that.  Would that proposal be an option if South Dublin County Council decided it would be in the best interests of its tenants to look after the supply of electricity to those 10,000 homes, that it would get the best deal from the ESB or Energia and would renegotiate it from time to time, as well as ensuring its tenants were as well educated as possible in terms of energy use?</p></speech>

As soon as ESB Networks has procured smart meters, all new houses will have them.  In terms of mass buying on behalf of customers, it will almost be like the Big Switch campaign because customers might group together to negotiate a deal that is open to the local council.  From our point of view, customers will always have a right to switch and we need to ensure it is available that if someone moved into a house and found a supplier he or she did not like, he or she could switch to a different supplier, and that it would comply with the supplier handbook on customer protections.  That would be open to local councils to explore if they wanted to bring those customers together.</p></speech>

It is about beginning a process of reducing energy use and so on.</p></speech>

Rather, it would be the individual householders.  There are options and there are quite a number of suppliers that are certified as supplying 100% green electricity.  People could engage in that regard.  Many suppliers offer bundles and, as the Deputy noted, smart home bundles, such as Nest, Climote controllers and other smart home technology, are available if the customer switches supplier.  As long as the customer, who is the householder, has the right to choose, those customers could be brought together as a group and shown an attractive deal that is green, renewable and offers alternatives which could be facilitated.</p></speech>

Ms MacEvilly referred to the customer, but she is wrong in this regard.  Someone who rents a house, not from a local authority, approached me recently and asked whether rules could be brought in to obligate landlords to introduce the best energy technology in their home.  He said he is very much in favour of doing what he can to reduce his carbon footprint but his landlord controls the heating system in the house.  The man said he pays the bill but he does not control the energy that creates the heat in his house.  This is a matter we can consider.  If a local authority controls and essentially owns 10,000 homes, as in the case of south Dublin, while the customer has a right to decide the supplier, the State owns the house.  There are 10,000 homes which Ms MacEvilly said could purchase exclusively green energy.  Who will argue with that?  It may make only a small impact but it will be a significant impact if it becomes a policy issue.  The customers may be in charge of the supplier but they are not in charge of the energy.  The constituent I spoke with would love to have a heat pump but there is a gas boiler and he has no control over it because he does not own the house, which is owned by the landlord.  We might have to investigate this matter.</p></speech>

With significant growth projected in the area, who will pay for future maintenance and upgrades of the grid?  What impact will it have on electricity consumer bills?

On the grid and its ability to cope with future demands, through the price control we look to the utility to bring forward what it considers to be the investment that needs to be put in place to meet future demands.  The utilities carry out rigorous exercises to try to forecast demand in both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.  They try to pitch an infrastructure investment plan that will meet the needs of the next five years, as well as looking into the longer term with longer-term projects.  We work with them and determine whether their plan is reasonable.  Ultimately, our decision on their revenue control will ensure they have the funds available to make the necessary investments.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned data centres and their impact on grids.  It is clear that data centres are a significant driver of demand on the Irish electricity system and that will continue in the near future.  They tend to be fairly flat loads and, therefore, they tend to be a reasonably efficient load to feed.  Nevertheless, they raise the peak and they will have an impact on grids.  Part of what we are trying to do is ensure that data centres can locate in parts of the country where there is more capacity on the grid than in others because they will take less time to connect.  If they insist on connecting in areas where there is a lack of grid access, our role is to see whether they can be part of the solution.  As part of their development, can they deliver some of their own energy solutions, while also recognising that in some cases time may be required to roll out the grid and meet their demands?  Ultimately, one of our roles is to ensure the cost of all of this infrastructure is met on a fair and equitable basis across the range of customers.</p> <p>  On the roll-out of smart technology, I will hand over to Mr. Melvin or Ms MacEvilly, who are more up to date.</p></speech>

By the end of 2020, it is expected that there will be approximately 700 million smart meters, mostly in Europe and the USA.  It is a major infrastructural project that will take a number of years to be rolled out.  We underwent a number of phases in the evaluation of the project, which involved statistically relevant customer behaviour trials, a high-level design phase and a detail-level design phase.  In 2017, we made the decision to roll them out because the cost-benefit analysis was such that it made sense.  The most cost-effective way to roll it out was the phased approach that Ms MacEvilly described earlier, where we will do 250,000 from next year.  Once the 250,000 have been completed, it will allow time for the communications infrastructure, that is, the backbone of all of this, to be put in at approximately the same time.  We are, therefore, up to date.</p></speech>

I wish to inquire about the efficiency of the CRU in granting the various generation licences, certificates of high efficiency and so forth to organisations and individuals who want to get into electricity generation.  I refer in particular to the Mayo Renewable Power project for the 45 MW high efficiency combined heat and power plant, which will be biomass fuelled, at the former Asahi site in Mayo.  This project has been ongoing for some time and it took from approximately 2006 to 2015 for the project to get all the consents in place, including a certificate of high efficiency at 100%.  In 2016, the project ran into difficulty with the boiler which led some investors to pull out.  Thankfully, it is now back on track.  Basically, there is a new promoter who is trying to replicate the same project with the same design, proposition and so forth.  There is no material change to it.  It needs four consents from four different authorities, including the CRU.  It has succeeded in getting consents from Mayo County Council, for planning permission, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and ESB Networks.</p> <p>  However, an application was made to the CRU in June for the consent it requires but it appears to be encountering a great deal of difficulty.  First, the certificate of high efficiency which was granted at 100% previously was given a 70% rating by consultants retained by the CRU.  I am aware that the CRU has gone back to the drawing board on that because there has been no indication of where there is a material change in the proposition.  Mayo Renewable Power has no idea when the consent will come through.  It is a &euro;255 million project, and &euro;95 million has already been spent on it by the investors.  It has strategic national significance in that it will help us achieve our renewable electricity targets and in meeting heating targets.  With regard to the region, it is required for the development of a data centre for which there is planning permission.  It has been identified by the county council, the IDA and everybody involved as being of strategic importance but the project is in danger of falling flat on its back-----</p></speech>

There are generation licences and supply licences.  Mayo Renewable Power is a specific case.  There is a European directive on high efficiency CHP and our role is specific under that.  We must refer to the European legislation and demonstrate that it is definitely a useful heat.  Useful heat is a key part of the high efficiency.  Once it gets that useful heat certification, it can get specific support under the renewable support mechanisms.  There is a much higher amount of money available if one is high efficiency as opposed to low efficiency or normal efficiency.  This is genuinely quite a complicated area.  It is complicated legislation in terms of interpretation.  There is a great deal of thermodynamics in the process.  We must assess whether, in the absence of the project, that is, the high efficiency CHP, this heat use would still have been done.  That is the test for us to try to assess it.  It took us quite a long time originally.  The project itself has questions about the specifics of biomass fuel.  The useful heat in this case is drying fuel, so we must ensure that we are confident that it is properly dried and has a proper use.  It has taken longer than we would like.  It took us a long time the first time, and we are trying to work our way through a number of legal aspects.  We have engaged in quite an amount of activity on it.  It has been a priority for the organisation.  I have talked to the county manager on numerous occasions.  It is an issue for the county manager and the county as well.  We will continue to examine it but there is nothing more I can say.  It is still under consideration at present.</p></speech>

I have three questions.  With Brexit ongoing, what discussions have taken place with the utility regulator in Northern Ireland and the UK on energy security and the impact Brexit will have, whether it is a soft or hard Brexit?  Will they brief us on that?  It is important to see what is coming and what is happening in the UK.  At EU level, what is the EU interface on moving towards better energy security across the EU in the context of climate change?  What discussions are there in that regard?  As regards price fluctuations and our dependence on carbon at present, what are the hedging strategies or mandates whereby the CRU interacts with the various energy providers?  Does the CRU have a macro hedging strategy for Ireland given that it is carbon dependent?  Obviously, price fluctuations occur and consumers complain.  Despite the number of companies that provide energy, there is frustration with the ongoing price fluctuation which appears to be linked to the active market position.  Many developing countries are trying to hedge some energy efficiently.  What are we doing on that as we transition to a more efficient energy scenario?</p></speech>

That is a matter for the players in the market to determine.  They have a variety of tools available to them, such as proxy hedges.  For example, as the cost of electricity is so closely linked to the price of gas, they can back off some of their price risk in the electricity market with the gas market.  There are also hedging tools available within the electricity market such as two-way and one-way contracts for difference, CFDs.

Their ability to have an effective hedging strategy, whether that is owing their own generation capacity or engaging in different types of hedging, is the way they compete.  That is their competitive advantage.  If we start to tell them they must do it in a particular way, it means, first, that we are saying we have a better idea than anybody else about what is happening in the market, which we do not, and second, we would eliminate one of the key competitive areas.  It is interesting that while there is a major focus on hedging, because everybody is thinking about protecting against the future price, we may move to a market where there are more dynamic tariffs available.</p><p>For instance, large energy users might expose part or all of their energy consumption to the market price because they would get the benefit of the lower wind related price periods.  Hedging may become less important and we may move more customers, including domestic customers, into that tariffing arrangement with some protections obviously because hedging is notoriously challenging.  In fairness, however, we would not get into that space.</p></speech>

It is jointly regulated by both the Utility Regulator, UR, and the CRU.  The focus of the single electricity market, SEM, committee - comprising the UR, the CRU and the independent member - which oversees that is to protect the single electricity market and ensure it continues in its current form, regardless of the outcome of Brexit.  We have sensed a level of political commitment from both London and Brussels in that regard, and it is on that we are focused.  We do not get involved in any negotiations in respect of Brexit.  Those negotiations are carried out by the Government.</p></speech>

On prices and moving to different forms of energy to protect against rises in electricity prices, Ireland has the fourth highest electricity prices in the European Union.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities appears to judge competition in the market on switching rates alone.  These are not fully indicative of competition in the market.  Some people cannot be bothered to switch, while others know that if they switch, they will go back to the original contract after perhaps a year.  What investigations is the CRU doing in the market?  It is seeking further powers but more powers bring greater responsibility?  Is the CRU using the powers it already has to investigate individual suppliers?  Investigations into pricing in the market are important because pricing is key to people buying into the new technology.</p> <p>  Regarding delays in connections, there have been many complaints from different industries about delays but that was alluded to earlier.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the use of smart meters for energy efficiency.  The CRU is also the regulator of water services.  The reference to smart meters and water in the same sentence will not cut it with the public.  We saw this in the outrage expressed in marches on the streets, which resulted in the idea of universal metering being abandoned.  In terms of having smart meters for water, we need data on water use and quality and we need ideas at community level on where it is going.  The introduction of meters is anathema to people.  Unfortunately, legislation providing that the public water system would remain in public ownership was voted down.  Would it help to have such a provision inserted in the Constitution?  We will at some stage need to quantify all the data on water usage.  There is not much on water in the CRU's submission, which is focused on energy.  While I understand that, water services are also crucial to our sustainability.</p></speech>

We conducted a major review of competition in retail electricity and gas markets in 2017 to examine what was happening, what was working well, what was not working so well and what we could do better.  We saw there were many changes in wholesale prices and our customers saw the changes in the retail price.  In general, we found that the changes in the retail prices were broadly following the underlying market trends.  When prices went down in the wholesale market, the retail price came down following a small lag because of hedging.  As wholesale prices have gone back up, we are seeing the retail prices following.</p> <p>  We found that there are benefits to competition and that the customers who switch and are active get the best of those benefits.  We decided to examine what we can do, using our existing powers, to empower customers and to get more people active.  We did a fair bit of research into the reasons some people do not switch.  The Senator is correct that some people may not care and switching may not be a big issue in their household.  However, there are customers who want to get better value but are sometimes put off in that they find the task confusing.  If people are confused or worried they might make the wrong decision, they step back and do not make any decision.</p> <p>  We introduced three new measures to help support customers.  One is called the estimated annual bill.  We know from some of the behavioural research we have done that it is impossible for customers to compare two offers where one promises a 25% reduction and the other promises a saving of &euro;300.  We required all suppliers to indicate the estimated annual bill a customer would face based on an offer.  For example, if in the case of one supplier the estimated bill is &euro;1,000 and in the case of another supplier it is &euro;950, the customers can decide to take the option offering an estimated bill of &euro;950.  That is now a requirement in respect of all advertising from suppliers of offers to help customers.</p> <p>  We were aware that customers switch but, as the Senator noted, subsequently revert to a higher standard tariff.  This often occurs because they have forgotten or do not realise their account will revert to the previous tariff.  A few months may elapse before they get the higher bill and ask why that is the case.  We now require all suppliers to send out a notification 30 days in advance of the expiry of the offer period and remind customers it is time to look around or renegotiate.  The Senator is right that the issue is not only about switching.  We place considerable emphasis on customers renegotiating with their current supplier.  As customers come to the end of their tariff period, they should phone their supplier and ask what it can offer as they will otherwise consider switching provider.  In many cases, the supplier will make another offer to retain the customer. </p> <p>  The third measure provides that suppliers issue a notice to customers who have never switched and those who have not switched for a long time noting that they have been on the same offer for a long time and that better offers are available and asking if they would like to discuss the matter.  These measures were rolled out in different phases earlier this year.  While it is early days and it may be because prices are going up, switching levels in October of this year were higher than in any one-month period during the past seven years.  We believe the message is getting across.</p> <p>  For the first time, the CRU has had a consumer outreach campaign, Switch On, mostly on social media.  Customers might not trust SSE Airtricity or Electric Ireland to give them objective information but we hope they will trust us and we provide such information on our website.  Those are the types of activities in which we are engaged.  Also, if there are complaints against suppliers, we follow up on them.  We audit suppliers to make sure they are complying with the supplier handbook, which is the key regulatory protection for customers.  We are quite active in that space.</p></speech>

All households already have electricity meters and there is a long history of charging for those commodities.  In that context, I would like to separate those two.  <br/><br/>The CRU does not have a view on the constitutional amendment <i>per se </i>but we do have a view on the importance of good data.  Good data is absolutely key.  We, for example, cannot incentivise leakage reduction unless we know the actual level of leakage.  We cannot hold Irish Water to account for its ability to deliver conservation or other requirements unless we have good data.  We rely on the more than 200,000 industrial and commercial meters and the more than 600,000 domestic meters currently in operation.  Meters will be installed in all new houses.  As well as that, Irish Water has in place an existing network of district metering in which it is investing to ensure that it is upgraded and fully functional.  It is through data gleaned from this multitude of sources that we would expect to have the ability to deliver on the conservation and leakage reduction targets that are required for water.  That will not be possible until we have really good data and we are not there yet.  Irish Water has a long way to go in terms of delivering the level of data that we require.  As I said, good data is absolutely vital if we are to successfully deliver the leakage reduction levels that are required.</p></speech>

It will also allow for the measuring of the level of export and enable a settlement to be agreed between the prosumer and the buyer, which could be an energy retailer.  The two are intrinsically linked.  The delivery of smart metering will deliver the ability of microgenerators to sell to the grid on a national scale.</p></speech>

The usefulness of that when it comes to selling any microgenerated power in the home will depend upon things like smart services being turned on and whatever other arrangements are available, such as an entity to buy the power.  If individuals are actively generating power and want to avail of this opportunity, they can request a smart meter in the first phase of roll-out and take it from there but they will have to wait for the smart services to be turned on before the meter becomes useful.  In short, microgenerators can ask for a smart meter now.</p></speech>

What role does the CRU have <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>offshore wind?  Does it control the connection points for offshore wind farms?  Does it give permission to access grid connection points in order to ensure that there are only one or two such points along the coast, rather than ten or more, for example?  Does the CRU control that?</p></speech>

Connection policy is part of our remit and we must determine where the transmission system ends for these projects, which tend to be large-scale in nature, and where direct connection to the offshore wind farm begins.  That will form part of the work that we will be doing if, for example, the new renewable energy support scheme supports offshore wind.  In that instance, that will be one of the key questions that we will be answering.</p></speech>

If they are in very disparate locations that would drive a particular approach whereby individual connections would make sense.  If, on the other hand, they were all clustered in one area, it might make more sense to take an alternative approach and connect the clusters to one hub.  The key issue from our perspective is that whatever we do, there must be absolute clarity on where the developer's obligations end and the transmission system operator's obligations begin because without that, we may end up paying twice and we do not want to do that.  We must be absolutely clear because the connection of offshore wind power will be, by definition, expensive.</p></speech>

When will that stop?  Can the PSO be used to support a just transition for the workers and what administrative or legislative measures would be required to enable that?</p></speech>

As I understand it, if there is no successor co-firing with biomass contract, the contract for the first plant will end this time next year and the second one will end in early 2020.  Given the way that the PSO works, the final settlement may not be until the following year but it will effectively be out of the PSO levy system at that point.  We will no longer be supporting peat generation through the PSO.</p> <p>  The PSO is allowed, under Irish and EU law, to support electricity generation that would not normally be delivered by the market which is beneficial either from a renewable, low carbon perspective or from a security of supply perspective.  The individual rules have to be agreed through the state aid clearance process.  There is a complex set of very specific state aid documents that outline exactly what the money can be used for, no more and no less.  There is also legislation which binds the CRU in terms of calculating the payments.  It would be difficult to continue collecting the money and to use it for a different purpose but there may be other ways of funding a just transition.  That is a broader question relating to issues such as carbon tax or carbon price wars.</p></speech>

Does the CRU have the resources to make this happen?  The transition involved is huge and we need systemic change.</p></speech>

Those who know the CRU will know that our responsibilities have increased over the years.  In fairness, when we have sought additional resources, we have generally had a good reception from various Departments.  We will carry out a workforce planning exercise early in the new year and, to be honest, my expectation is that we will identify resource gaps in terms of the delivery of our vision and what we have at present.</p><p>We will make that case and put it forward to the relevant Departments and I am hopeful we will have a successful outcome but we will be challenged from a resource perspective as we go into 2019.</p></speech>

With the advent of smart meters and smart grids, will it be possible for business-to-business transactions and trading?  If one business is a producer of energy and another business is a consumer of energy, could they work together to maximise efficiencies and use best practice to be as efficient as they can?</p></speech>

The Deputy may be familiar with ESB Networks' Dingle project, which is looking at different types of smart technology that would enable what he is talking about on a community basis.  It may use things like block chain and new technologies that we will all have to get to grips with as to how they work best from a consumer perspective.  That is the kind of innovation the CRU will try to incentivise to see what works best.  The value of community schemes is not just about building wind farms and some of the approaches the Deputy is talking about will help to bring people with us.  We are open to that.</p></speech>

We were very pleased to come.  I will start by outlining my experience.  </p> <p>  I have been Chairman of the UK Committee on Climate Change for the past six years and have another four to go.  During my time as Chairman, certain issues have become very clear to me as the key ones that have affected our ability to operate.  First, the Climate Change Act under which we operate has sought &ndash; successfully, I believe &ndash; to deal with the dysfunction of time.  Democracy demands that a mandate be given again after a regular period.  One has to have the mandate refreshed.  On the one hand, that is what democracy is, but, on the other, climate change demands a continuous policy over a long period because otherwise we cannot deliver what we have to deliver.  What the Act did was ensure these two elements could operate together.  What happens is that every five years we produce the carbon budget and present it to Parliament.  We have now produced five and Parliament has accepted each one of them.  Once it has voted on a budget, meaning that the democratic mandate has been adhered to, it cannot change it, unless the climate change committee agrees.  That is crucial because the difficulty is that when decisions are made, everybody immediately thinks not about the long term but about how they will affect his or her constituency and what will happen to Mrs. Miggins or a particular small factory.  Our next carbon budget which will be our sixth will cover the period 2032 to 2036.  That is far enough ahead for most Members of Parliament to think independently and in an holistic way.  Therefore, the discussion is moved to reality and the issues are moved away from the individual questions asked if one was talking about what to do tomorrow.  This means that what to do tomorrow is put into the hands of the government and Parliament.</p> <p>  The second point is that the climate change committee's job is not to lay down an annual statement of what the government has to do.  What it has to do is keep its feet to the fire to meet the targets.  It can do it in any way it likes.  I have sometimes said that if the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy who is responsible for dealing with climate change wants to meet the targets by standing on his head and it works, that is perfectly all right.  We will give a series of explanations for what needs to be done and a choice or menu.  As we have to prove that what we propose in meeting the targets is possible, we present a series of scenarios and outline that if one does not do this, one has to do that.  We give the government a range of options, but, ultimately, our role is not to make decisions of a kind that should be made by Parliament but to set the parameters within which the decisions have to be made.</p> <p>  That brings us to the third issue, which is that the system be very carefully arranged.  It means that before the end of June every year, we have to assess how well the government has done in meeting the targets.  That is an independent assessment.  Before the end of October, the government has to produce a response.  If our assessment is pretty tough, as it was this year, the government has to explain what it will do and it has to do so publicly.  The advantage of the law is that one has to do it which for us is sometimes quite difficult.  Whatever else we have got on, we have to produce our assessment by the end of June and whatever else the government has got on, it has to produce its response by the end of October.  Therefore, the rule is very tough and clear.</p> <p>  The fourth element is that, unlike anywhere else, the climate change committee is a scientific and economic committee, not a representative committee.  This is to distinguish it from the representative bit - the elected Parliament.  The committee consists of scientists who are regarded by their colleagues as the leaders.  The same applies to economists.  I am the only non-scientist and non-economist.  I have to be appointed, not by the Prime Minister but by the Minister responsible for dealing with climate change, the First Minister of Scotland, the First Minister of Wales and the First Minister of Northern Ireland when Northern Ireland has one.  Therefore, the mechanism normally involves four parties making the decision.  In my case, I had a Liberal Democrats member of the coalition government, a Scots nationalist in Scotland, a Welsh socialist and a Protestant unionist in Northern Ireland.  They have a Catholic and a Conservative as their Chairman.  It gives enormous independence because it means that someone has genuinely been chosen by a range of people who have said he or she is an independent and that they accept that independence.  Consequently, that person is able to be critical of whatever government is in power and can also be congratulatory, which is important.  When the government gets it right, it is very important for people to say, "Thank you."  Being independent, someone can say "Thank you" without appearing oleaginous or sucking up to the government.  That is important because otherwise people receive no encouragement.</p> <p>  Based on experience, there is one thing about the system that I would have written differently, not because it has not worked but because I can see it might not work.  We do not have an independent judgment of how much money we need to run the secretariat we need to meet the requirements of the Act and perform the tasks the government asks us to perform and that we believe we have to perform in order to meet the requirements of the Act.  I have to say we have never had an occasion to complain about governments.  We have had three sorts of government to work under and never had to come with a complaint.  The governments tried to keep us within rules and restrict our expenditure - all governments do - but I really do not have a complaint about it.  I believe, however, that the one thing we did not get right was not having a court of appeal, so to speak.  We should have been able to appeal to the Comptroller and Auditor General to assess whether we were being given the money.  The Act states we have to be given the money to make it possible for us to do the job.  There ought to be a bit in the law affording some independence, which the Comptroller and Auditor General has.  That is what I would do.</p> <p>  They are the crucial elements which we believe are important.  It seems helpful for me to repeat them because, having been Chairman for six years, I am very conscious of how valuable they are.</p></speech>

We are grateful for their insights thus far.  My question is simple.  I will have an interactive session with the deputation, if I may, in the time I have.  I want to get a sense from Lord Deben about Brexit and to what extent Brexit is informing his thinking as chairperson in terms of the challenges faced throughout the United Kingdom in the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

It is quite wrong.  I have done everything I can to stop it and I will go on doing that.  I want to make it quite clear where I stand on this matter.  It is barmy and it is run by barmy people.  It is not easy to operate when we are trying to deal with that.<br/><br/>It happens to be true that our legislation is in fact British or United Kingdom legislation.  That climate change legislation is in place and we will continue along those lines.  What Brexit makes difficult is that so many of the protections for the environment as a whole are thrown into doubt.  All manner of promises have been given by the UK Government about what it will do and so on, but they are not in place now.  I believe that the insight of the Pope in <i>Laudato si'</i>is singularly important.  He talks about climate change as a symptom of what we have done to the world.  I always look at it in those terms.  The rest of the environment is important for fighting the battle about climate change.  We should not think of it as a box on its own.  We are concerned about the other areas of environmental protection that are guaranteed under European law.  The UK Government has said all these will be taken into account and will be brought in and so on, but we do not actually have that legislation and such legislation as we have does not have money in it.  I am basically a practical man in that I like to know where the money is coming from, and I do not see much of that at the moment.</p></speech>

This is a feature of the landscape in the United Kingdom.  We do not have that system here but we are talking about that system at the moment.  It is developing as a concept.  There are some signals coming from Government that it might be a way for Government to proceed.  I am keen to get a sense or understanding of the dynamic that exists between the UK Prime Minister's office relating to setting targets and how individual UK line Departments measure up to those individual targets.  If a Department does not reach a given target or hit a milestone, is there a punitive effect thereafter for individual Departments?  It would be useful for those of us on this committee to have a sense or understanding of the dynamics that exist between the UK Prime Minister's office and the actual principle of carbon budgeting in the first instance.</p></speech>

No government is really joined up.  That is the nature of all our systems, whatever they are.  People complain about two things: one is the treasury and the other is joined-up government.  The treasury is bound to find the things we want to do difficult because it likes to have control.  Of course what we are asking for is long-term loss of control, which is what always happens.  Governments are not joined up and this is our biggest problem.  The UK Prime Minister's office has been highly supportive for us, but that is not where the power sits.  It sits now in the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which is actually a great success.  Those responsible were rather worried when the Department of Energy and Climate Change was amalgamated with the business Department, but actually it works.  It works because we are moving from the position where decarbonising our electricity system was the key point.  That is what has enabled us to decouple growth from emissions.  Now, other things become more important, including transport, houses and especially land use.  All those become more important.  We are going to have to be far more iterative with other Departments now.  It would be foolish to say that there is enough joined-up policy.  I am pleased to see, however, that the UK Department for Transport, having been recalcitrant and having incurred my ire, has now come into line and has accepted the budget properly.  In the end we win these battles.</p> <p>  I do not believe it is only about climate change.  It is about many other things.  It is difficult to get policies across the board.  Let us consider nutrition and obesity.  Ireland has a similar problem to the problem we have in the United Kingdom.  It should be a matter for the ministries responsible for education, health and the Prime Minister's office.  It is very important to get the policy across government, but Ireland has not managed it and we have not managed it either.  This is a battle we will always have.</p></speech>

It spoke about creating an independent body above Government with legislative teeth that could put manners, as it were, on individual Departments.  The idea was that it would take the matter out of the silo-based system that we all understand so well.  Is there merit in that argument?</p></speech>

I think it is dangerous to take it like that.  We need to distinguish between the two elements.  I am referring to parliamentary decision-making on what we should do and setting the targets against which we will be judged.  In the end, what happens if the UK Government does not meet its targets?  They are statutory targets and the UK Government could be taken to court and forced to meet them.  I would not take the UK Government to court, but if someone did so, I would be the first witness for the prosecution.  I hope the UK Government will do its job.  Otherwise I would be rather embarrassed.  That is what we have to do.  The system works in that sense.</p> <p>  It is difficult for people to say there is no proper democratic control.  It is really up to the specialist committee.  If we give enough power to the equivalent of the Joint Committee on Climate Change, then we enable ourselves to pressurise the matter.  I have used the example with the UK Department for Transport.  So that he knows it is happening, I am about to start the same campaign with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government because he is the housing Minister and at the moment we are building crap houses.  In other words, we are building houses that we will have to re-kit rapidly.  Those responsible are doing it in Ireland too.  One of the areas where the Parliament could make a major difference &ndash; I am trying to get the devolved parliaments to do the same &ndash; is to refuse to allow those houses to be built and to insist that a given standard must be met.  It is so dishonest.  Those responsible are selling houses at a given price and people then have to pay significant sums to keep them warm when that is not counted in the price.  We have to build houses where people do not spend that sort of money.  At the same time, we are reducing the impact on the environment, pollution and, therefore, on climate change.</p></speech>

I have a few quick questions around agriculture.  What approach was taken in the UK in respect of agriculture and climate change?  Where were the quick wins in agriculture?  Where are the current challenges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Deben" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#S00900"><p>I am a former minister of agriculture.  I come from an agricultural background and I keep cows, so I like to think I am reasonably in line with this.  I never think that the phrase "quick wins" works with agriculture.  This is a long-term operation.  We have recently produced the first of two reports on land use.  I am keen on using the expression "land use" rather than agriculture because we have to think about the whole of that.</p><p>In the United Kingdom we have a slightly different issue because agriculture there was intensified to a greater degree than in Ireland and as a result we must have far more mixed farming because we have damaged the fertility of our soil.  That has led to dealing with the issue of emissions and the fact that the fertility of the soil has been damaged such that it is not capable of sequestering the amount of carbon it should.  We are moving towards a de-intensification of livestock.  As members can imagine, that received a mixed reaction from the National Farmers Union, but it is surprisingly supportive so long as we do it properly.</p><p> Our problem is that because of the barmy policy of leaving the European Union, farmers will be without production supports for the first time since 1939.  No living farmer in the United Kingdom has worked in a situation without production support.  The British Government has told farmers that production supports will not be available.  Farmers happily think that &pound;3 billion will be allocated to farming in a different way.  However, they have not met the Treasury.  The fact is that it will not be like that.  The farmers will be lucky if &pound;500 million is allocated and the &pound;2.5 billion is removed.  This will be a huge problem for farmers.  Deputy Sherlock asked about Brexit.  One of the problems will be that we will have to ask farmers to make real changes at the same time as they are hit by these measures.  Ireland will not be in that position.</p><p> Ireland needs to recognise that there are no quick wins, but there are ways of improving the situation by using modern technology, getting farmers on side and measuring things better.  One of the things we are very bad at is that we do not measure agricultural or pollution output.  Farmers may assert that they have done certain things but we do not know whether those things have been done.  One must get the measurement right.  In the UK, we refused to do that work until the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs gave us some basic measurements to facilitate that.  There are no quick wins.  Working with farmers to reduce emissions requires slow, regular and continuous policy but one must do it because farming in Ireland, the United Kingdom and everywhere else is a major emitter.</p><p> One of the things I hope Ireland could do would be to join with countries such as New Zealand, which has the same intensity of problem because it has a big agricultural sector, to share knowledge about the things that can be done.  Ireland could be a real leader on this and shame the rest of the islands into doing better things.  There is a role for Ireland in the agricultural world because we must make progress  We must face the fact that we cannot allow agriculture to emit at the current levels.  We must find ways to enable farmers to continue farming, but to do so in a more environmentally friendly way.</p></speech>

Has that been discussed by the UK committee?</p></speech>

One of the reasons it is more difficult is that because we have moved to monoculture to a greater degree than has Ireland, we can make changes in that area which Ireland cannot because of its already lower intensity, carbon-based agriculture.  No one should argue that we should not attempt to lower emissions for fear that if we do so, someone else will take up the slack.  We must all lower emissions, as stipulated by the Paris Agreement.  We cannot stop trying to do so because of a fear that somebody else will take advantage of that.  All countries, including those that people claim will take advantage of the situation, are going to do it.  France, Germany and the UK are trying to do it.  I will not accept claims by farmers in the UK that if they reduce emissions, Irish farmers will take up the slack.  In the context of decarbonising energy, all industries claim that they cannot make changes because companies in France, China or elsewhere will take up the slack.  However, companies in other countries have not taken up the slack because all countries are trying to reduce emissions.  It is far better to take the opposite view and to work with those who could potentially take up the slack in order to find how we can all reduce emissions, which is what must be done.  I toured New Zealand 18 months ago and attended a very large number of meetings there.  The New Zealanders, who face many of the same problems as us, want to work with other agricultural areas to find answers.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  I am a passionate believer that vegetarianism is not the answer, but we eat too much meat.  No previous generation has eaten as much meat as we do.  The production of meat has a significant effect on the climate.  We will have to eat less and better meat.  That ought to be of benefit to Ireland because it produces a significant amount of good grass-fed meat.  We must recognise that much meat is produced in a way that produces a lot of emissions and is not very good meat.  We must move away from copying the American meat concept and towards eating less meat.  That does not mean that we must become vegetarian.  I do not even propose that we should eat meat at the level which departments of health say would be good for us.  I am not going that far.  We propose a relatively limited reduction in the amount of meat we eat which would not meet the figures proposed by dieticians.  I am slightly questioning of those figures.  We will not reach that level of reduction.  However, we must move down that route.  People will be far better off if they only eat good meat and some of the rubbish which is currently on the market is removed.  We very much want to get rid of such products.</p></speech>

The production of meat in the manner that occurs in much of Ireland involves the replenishing of soil in a way which is very important for sequestration and provides meat which has the ingredients which people ought to have rather than the sort of meat that comes from feed lots or similar.  It will mean that people will eat less meat because it will be more expensive as it is more expensive to produce in that manner.  However, that will do us no harm.  One must be honest about it.</p></speech>

I will propose that we do not let the brothers next door get us down but, rather, maintain our close connection, particularly in terms of energy and climate, because we will not be able to decarbonise if we are not connected.  We must balance the variable supply of electricity.  It makes sense to do so on a north west European grid basis.  We have everything to do in that regard.</p> <p>  We have fantastic connections.  Lord Puttnam, who was involved in the drafting of the UK legislation, is a good friend to this House and has been of significant assistance to Irish Governments through the years.  Similarly, we brought over Mr. Alex Chisholm, dusted him down, trained him up and sent him back to the UK, where he is now a permanent secretary.  Our energy regulator, Mr. Dermot Nolan, heads Ofgem.  The former head of EirGrid is a director of National Grid in the UK.  We have a significant number of connections and I am sure we will be able to overcome political issues and maintain co-operation.</p><p>Britain has been successful in reducing emissions, with a 40% reduction since 1990 and ongoing reductions last year of 2.5%.  That has largely come from power generation and a move away from coal.  As Lord Deben said, in transport, land use and other sectors, however, Britain is flatlining much like everywhere else.  I agree fundamentally with Lord Deben, and the vision France has, that we are doing big picture change and that we need system change.  This is a broad question but how is that going to be brought about in the UK?  How close is the UK to that type of system change, particularly in transport and agriculture?  That seems to be the key to unlocking the next step in decarbonisation. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.173" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Deben" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#U00200"><p>The Deputy is right that the decarbonisation of electricity has, in some senses, overshadowed the flatlining in other areas.  Transport will be significantly changed by decarbonisation of electricity because electric vehicles will become more sensible as non-carbon fuel is used.  We are pressing the British Government to move much faster on that front.  The Government has a policy which will not meet the requirements.  We are not going fast enough and that change will have to happen.  I have no doubt that will be made to happen because there is certainly not going to be any move to net zero, which we are now working on, without it.  That is one of the areas we have to speed up significantly.</p> <p>  I also agree that we will have to work together because, of all things, energy is a northern European issue.  It is not just a matter between Ireland and the UK.  It is much wider than that.  I hope Ireland continues to stick to its guns about what are the UK's responsibilities towards Ireland.  For the UK to walk away as if it has no responsibilities is both historically wrong and morally unacceptable.  A bit of continued pressure is going to be important.  I certainly think we have to keep the relationships because that is the only way in which both parts of these islands will be able to operate.  It would be ridiculous if it were otherwise.  </p> <p>  We in the UK depend significantly on the energy we get from France.  It is very helpful at different peak moments and it is not just a question of bringing the energy over.  France has a different peak system from ours.  We are, as the Deputy is aware, hoping to have a link with Norway, which would be very important.  There is a great deal to be done in getting the continental European links to be more effective.  Ireland could play a major part in that.  I do not know how accurate this is, but there is an estimate that there is a saving of 11% to be achieved by getting interconnectors between, for example, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as Belgium and France and France and Spain.  Frankly, we ought to be using the sunshine in Spain and the wind in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  It is mad that we are not doing that but the links are not good enough yet.  I agree entirely that is what we should be doing. </p></speech>

Am I right in reading that the UK is going towards a national land use plan?  It would deal with where forestry is located, what type of farming there is and where that farming occurs.  Does Lord Deben think it is useful and important to have such a land use plan as part of how we manage climate change?</p></speech>

I do not think it is quite as directive as the Deputy has made it seem.  To give an example, if we are to do something about flooding, we are going to have to plant trees in the right place and we are going to have to plant the right sort of trees.  All of that is really difficult because the right trees are not the trees which the public think of when there is talk of forest trees.  They are not broadleaf trees.  The right trees are actually conifers because, being much older and having existed since prehistoric times, they have an ability to absorb carbon for a longer time.  They also produce wood which can be readily used in furniture and in building so that the sequestrated carbon is maintained.  We have a big story to get right all across the board.  That is part of the process but it is not just adaptation we are trying to achieve in this case.  We will also need to do much more in respect of soft defences against flooding and a great deal more on how we deal with land use as far as the sea is concerned.  Rising sea levels are a serious part of what we are faced with.</p></speech>

It is the same in every country.  We have been watching from a distance as the UK Treasury has been getting energy policy completely wrong.  When it comes to parliamentary committees, however, with which the Committee on Climate Change engages, is that done with each sectoral committee or is there any collective parliamentary system in the House of Commons or the House of Lords to engage with on this issue?</p></speech>

There is also a select committee for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, BEIS, which specifically deals with climate change and business and energy.  The BEIS select committee does consider itself as overlooking the whole collection and we use it in that sense.  There are also other select committees for each of the Departments and we try to use those effectively to try to get the particularities of climate change listened to.</p></speech>

It is science heavy, in that there are only one or two economists, unless people are disguising their economic credentials.  Does Lord Deben think that is the right balance?

I do not think that is a problem.  The point about the scientists is that they all contribute different things to the committee.  For example, when I became chairman, the one thing I insisted upon was having a behavioural scientist on the committee.  We had never had that.  One of the problems we all face is that we have to move on from getting what is right in science and economics to helping people to take these things on board.  We need a behavioural scientist to give us advice on doing that.</p> <p>  I think, therefore, that the balance we have is the right one.  I have nearly got it to 50:50 between men and women and I am quite proud of that.  It is necessary then to go and seek people.  Nobody is appointed on the basis of gender but women are sometimes less willing to put their names forward, so we do have to work on that.  That is an important aspect.  It is one of the areas where there is a real need for a range of people and women bring a different way of looking at things from the men on the committee.  That is what I find.  </p></speech>

Simply speaking, when people build their houses, in Ireland or anywhere, much thought and effort has to be put into those homes and people are happy with the outcome until they live in those houses for a while.  If there was then a second change, they would do many things differently.  From his experience, and because Ireland is a phase behind the UK, if Lord Deben was on this side of the table with a second chance on climate change policy, what different directions would he like to see taken?</p><p>If he had a blank page from which to work in the context of the UK Committee on Climate Change, are there any directions Lord Deben might have taken or any issues he might revisit?</p><p> Agriculture was mentioned.  Ireland never had an industrial revolution.  The reason our percentage of agricultural emissions is so high in the overall context is that we did not have the heavy industries that Britain did.  From a transport perspective, a person in London might never put his or her head up from the underground but we do not have the same public transport facilities here.  With those two perspectives in mind - agriculture and transport - we are starting from a different position.  If he had a second chance, and having looked at our model, is there any different approach Lord Deben might have taken?</p></speech>

We could not do the work on it because we did not have the figures.  I was not prepared, nor was my predecessor, to put out information which was not absolutely correct according to the statistics and the science.  I should have said in my opening points that the other crucial aspect is that if one has a climate change committee, it has to get a reputation for being accurate and scientifically based and not be a campaigning group.  It is not an NGO.  It has to be very scientifically based.  As I was saying, addressing land use is one of the things I would have done if I had been running it at that time - although, looking back, I cannot be sure I would have thought of it.  Deputy Neville referred to "quick and easy".  There is no quick and easy and, therefore, one has to get it started much earlier.</p> <p>  The other thing that might have been done differently would have been to start pressuring the UK Government earlier with regard to the need for electric vehicles, which will be important.  I think we hit the ground a couple of years later than we might have done on that, thereby enabling the Government in the UK to set targets which are just not sensible.  We cannot wait until 2040; we have to make the changes in 2030 because, otherwise, the figures do not add up.  We have got to do this together.  It is all part of the same market, so is very important for Ireland also.  The motor car companies are behaving disgracefully.  If people go out and try to buy an electric car today, they are put on a waiting list unless they can afford a Tesla.  That is because the motor car companies are busy trying to sell the cars they can make cheaply now and they do not want people to buy electric cars.  At the same time, they are telling a different story to governments.  I think we have to be much tougher, as we have to be tough with the building companies.  The house builders have got to be forced to build to a higher standard.  Those are the things I would have started earlier.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#V00500"><p>I know he is from the House of Lords but I find it hard to use the title "Lord" in reference to him.</p> <p>  Something I have noticed in England recently is the pressure from the fracking companies and the response of the people.  I have been in awe of the protesters.  They have gone out of their way to get their voices heard in a democratic way, although they have been blocked by local authorities left, right and centre.  The protests at Blackpool and other locations in Lancashire have in some ways been quite scary in the sense people feel they have to do that.  In other ways, fracking is also quite scary.  As the representative of the Committee on Climate Change, will our guest comment on the attempt to increase the use of fracking and also on the protests?  I would like to use the opportunity to say I would extend my solidarity to those protesters and to the young people involved in the extinction rebellion, where they blocked the bridges around London and glued themselves to Westminster.  What young people are saying to us, as we have seen in Sweden and Australia, is "Listen to us, it is our future".  They are tired of old farts like me not listening to them.  I would like our guest to comment on that.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the mechanisms of the Committee on Climate Change.  The first recommendation of our Citizens' Assembly - it enjoyed the support of 94% of the assembly's members - was that we should establish a new and independent body with a broad range of functions and powers to deal with climate change and to ensure it is at the centre of policy-making, with some legislative scrutiny and oversight.  The resistance to that from representatives and from the Department of Finance so far has been quite passionate.  They do not believe in this at all and they do not want to see it.  Can our guest tell us, as Members of Parliament, why he thinks that would be a good idea since he is part of a parliament?  He might give two or three main reasons he thinks it would be a good idea for us.</p> <p>  I also want to ask about the value of a carbon budget, which I think is needed here.  I understand the UK carbon budget is set at a certain level through the use of science, which is very important, and those who exceed that level are breaking the budget.  What penalties are there for the UK Government or the state for overstepping the mark or can they offset the budget by means of carbon offsets?  Does our guest agree with that or think it should be allowed, or is it just another market mechanism that fails to actually deal with emissions?  I have some other questions but I will leave it at that for now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Deben" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#V00600"><p>There was quite a lot there.  We compiled a report on fracking.  We have to distinguish between the issue of fracking and the protests on the bridges in London, a matter to which I will return.  We have to follow the science in this regard.  If one is going to insist that people accept the science relating to climate change, then one has to follow the science in respect of other matters.  The science relating fracking is very clear.  As long as one does three things, fracking is perfectly reasonable.  First, one has to ensure that any gas produced from fracking is a replacement for gas that would otherwise be imported from somewhere else and is not additional.  Second, one has to ensure that there are proper environmental controls in place.  For example, sometimes there is a rogue well which bursts upwards and has to be capped immediately.  Controls for that need to be in place.  Third, one has to ensure that infrastructure is not built which then gives an excuse to go on using gas beyond the point at which it is possible to do so within the envelopes which we have put in place.  That is what we have said and fracking has to be done within those restrictions.</p> <p>  People might not want fracking.  However, we must remember we will need gas until the early 2030s, as we have said in the context of our budgets.  Let us say, as an example, that a reasonable amount of gas is found and a company wants to frack.  It will be producing gas with less environmental impact than the gas that would be imported from other countries, many of which are not believed to be taking any of the steps they should take.</p><p>I am not an absolutist on this.  I believe if we can get some fracked gas at a lower carbon cost than the imported gas for that period as long as it does not give the excuse for continuing longer - that is part of the deal - that is the right thing to do and the science certainly indicates that.  To get people to believe in climate change on the basis of science, we must use science across the board.</p><p> I find the protesters rather different from the Deputy.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the protesters on the bridges of London; I will come to that in a moment.  However, I find the fracking protesters wrong because they are trying to say their non-scientific position should be forced on the public because of the scientific position on climate change.  That seems like an illogical position.  That is why we did the independent report and why the Government is supporting it.</p><p> On the campaigners, the greatest problem with climate change is that even though we believe in it now, we are not moving fast enough.  The urgency is tremendous.  It is very important for those who care about it to remind people of that.  While I am not sure that all their tactics are right, I have a sympathy with people who get out there to encourage us to move faster.  That helps us enormously.  It helps the good side of Government enormously and has a good effect on some of the sillier members of government who do not take this seriously.  I have a greater degree of sympathy with that.</p><p> Of course, the Deputy equated it with what is happening in Australia.  In Australia there is every reason; it is a very bad government which is not doing anything on climate change and should be ashamed of itself.  Any protest there is different.  At least in Britain we have an all-party consensus.  It does not matter to me what sort of government we have because it will do the same programme.  There is no doubt about that.  We are fortunate; Australia is in a much worse position.  The present government under Mr. Morrison is worse than the previous one - I did not think that could be.  The previous one was no better than that led by Mr. Abbott.  If one cannot be better than Mr. Abbott, then one really is in a mess.  They have a reason, therefore, to be powerfully opposed.</p><p> On the issue of the independent body, I believe that treasuries are always opposed to this because it means they are restricted in what they can do.  However, they have to be because climate change demands that we have long-term plans.  Treasuries like to able to move things very rapidly and in general terms that is right.  However, we are not in that situation; we are in an extinction situation.  This is a really serious thing.  Treasuries do not like it, not because they are not green or because there is something evil about them; it is simply that those in the treasury do not want that kind of control.  We had it in Britain.  When we managed to get a parliamentary majority for the Climate Change Act which was unthought of, the adviser to the Labour Government went into the department then responsible for climate change, flung the Bill across the table and said - I will not use the word she used - "There you are; you've got your Act."  They were furious not because they were opposed to it, but because it meant the Treasury no longer had that control and that is exactly where they are now.</p><p> We need to say to those in the treasury wherever they are, including here in Ireland, that we know what they instinctively want, but they cannot stay there because we are fighting a battle which will distinguish human beings as being really human.  We either win this battle or we lose the battle for our own existence.  Therefore, we must win this battle.  Part of it is about us being human and we need to find new ways of expressing that.</p><p> Having an independent committee is crucial.  I would give it the powers that we have but I would make a distinction.  I know what the Citizens' Assembly suggested, but it is quite important that I do not have the powers to legislate about particular answers because that brings me into the political arena.  I have the powers to fix the budgets and keep them fixed.  Governments must find the way of meeting those budgets.  As I have said, it does not matter to me how they find the way, but they have to do it.  My power is to make sure they do it.</p><p> The Deputy asked me what the penalties are.  The penalties are that this is justiciable.  They would be taken to the High Court, which would insist that they produce policies that would meet it because that is what the law requires.  We must reduce our emissions by 80% by 2050 and we must meet the targets in the budgets - the fourth and fifth carbon budgets, which are the next two budgets.  The law can be brought into play at the point at which it is clear that the government is not taking the measures it ought to do.  The courts will not prescribe what the government must do, but will point out to the government it has a target to meet and it must prove to the courts that it will meet it; that is what the law requires.</p><p> That is the power this committee ought to have.  I would not ask me to do the legislation because if I do that, then I am choosing between, for example, electric cars doing so much and houses doing so much.  That is a decision for government democratically reached.  What is not a decision is how it adds up.  I do the sum; government can do bits of the sum but it must add up to the figure that I and my committee do.  That is the power and that is the distinction.  If it is done any other way, the Government will claim it is above politics but it will become politicised.  The moment it is given legislative powers, it then has a competition with the D&aacute;il.  There is no other way out of it.  The committee should not do that.  The D&aacute;il makes those decisions and those choices, but the committee sets the standards against which those decisions have to be made.  I do not know how we managed to invent this, but it is really a very good invention.</p></speech>

However, I take issue on the science.  We have banned fracking in Ireland and we did so on the understanding that the science has settled on the fact that 80% of known fossil fuels should be left in the ground.  That flies in the face of what Lord Deben is arguing.  It is a bit like what he said earlier, that if we cannot do it, somebody else can.  However, if the gas is extracted, be it in Europe or elsewhere, why would people want to take more out of the ground in Lancashire or Blackpool?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Deben" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#W00300"><p>Under the budgets we have set, we will take more gas out of the ground in Dubai or Russia in the coming years.  By saying 80% will be left in the ground, it means that 20% will not be left in the ground.  That will happen anyway.  However, if we produce it at home under the tough measures we have, we will not buy it from Mr. Putin.  If we buy it from him, he has not got any of those measures in place.  If, for example, one were producing 100, one would not be allowed to produce 120 because one is producing it at home; one must keep it at 100.</p> <p>  There is an issue in this regard.  The science is clear.  The Deputy can say the science requires us to keep 80% in the ground, but that means we must decide where the 20% comes from.  The science is clear that fracking properly with these tough measures means producing gas with less emissions than by taking gas from many of the existing sources today.  In order to stick to the science, it is not feasible to claim that fracking is unscientific, which is what the campaigners do.</p><p>It is a choice one makes.  I would prefer to get what we need for gas from a source that is not controlled by Mr. Putin, because it would ensure that the polluting effect was significantly less.  If someone was to take that approach, however, they should not think that they will have a market after around 2032 because there will not be one.</p></speech>

Lord Deben mentioned his agricultural background.  In Ireland, and across the world, producers are looking for more for their product while the consumer is looking for that product at a lower price in the supermarkets.  To achieve what we want in the area of climate change, additional costs will be involved.  How do we square the circle in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.197" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Deben" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#X00300"><p>We have to accept that some circles cannot be squared.  We are, for health reasons as well as climate change-related reasons, going to have to eat less meat.  The way to do that is to cut out the meat that is produced in the least climate-friendly way, which will mean emphasising the meat that Ireland is best at producing.  Ireland is the best at extensive meat production and that is why people buy Irish beef.  They do not buy it because the cattle are fed on beef lots but do so because they are fed in a traditional way.</p> <p>  One of the questions was about food prices.  All of us have lived our entire lives with food prices coming down and none of us can remember a time food prices went up.  It is only very recently that we have begun to see a slight change.  Politicians have, in a sense, promised that prices will always go down but I am afraid to say that they will not, not just because of climate change but because there will be some 1 billion more middle-class people in the world by 2030, all of whom will have the opportunity to buy food for more than subsistence.</p> <p>  The pressures on food are going to be considerably greater and members of the committee will be aware of the damage that has been done to our food industry.  I sit on the food and drink sector council in the United Kingdom and I am a passionate supporter of the food industry.  I suggest people look at the damage done to the food industry by fraud.  Fraud took place because people were trying to produce meat at an unacceptable price.  We are going to have to talk truth.  The truth is that if we grow food properly, it will not be as cheap as it was and the proportion of our incomes that we spend on food is not going to continue to fall.  Whatever political party we belong to, we will not be able to solve that problem.  Our job is to try to manage the transition to a situation in which food prices are more stable and people do not expect 14 meatballs for &euro;2.  This will mean helping the poorest and making sure farmers are incentivised.  It also means reform of the CAP so that the money goes in the right ways, as opposed to some of the wrong ways.  Above all, it means us telling the truth and we have not been prepared to do that.</p></speech>

We have to tell people about the situation as it is, as Lord Deben is doing today.  How did he go about doing that across the water when he started the process?  How did he start to educate people as to what was going to be involved, what the consequences would be and what the implications would be of what needed to be done?  What is the communications strategy across the board, for the agricultural sector, the consumer and the ordinary Joe Public?</p> <p>  He also mentioned intensification in agriculture and I believe British farmers are more factory-orientated than Irish.  Is he referring to a reduction in the herd in this context?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Deben" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#X00500"><p>In the UK, we are faced with health advice that suggests we reduce the volume of meat we eat dramatically, and much more than is necessary for climate change reasons.  We have not, therefore, found ourselves in the position we would otherwise have found ourselves.  We are talking about cuts of between 25% and 50% in the meat industry but the health people are talking about much more.  We are at the beginning of a process and we are finding considerable support among farmers who want to do that and who want a higher price for well-produced meat.  We all eat much more than we need and we could spend the same amount buying the volume of meat we want.  Some restaurants mix up quality and quantity but in the best restaurants, the quantity is not great while the quality is particularly good.  This can be managed.</p> <p>  Most people are bored to the back teeth with most things related to climate change and it is not the big issue they want to talk about, though they believe in it and they notice that the rain comes down in a different way, that spring comes earlier and that the weather is different.  My view is that we should talk about it in other contexts.  For example, the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh is going to point out to the vast number of people who go around the garden to look at the specimen trees that the trees have come out 17 days earlier than they used to, which is because the bees do not come out at the same time.  At the point at which somebody is interested in something, one should tell them about it.  The Forestry Commission has agreed that it will do the same thing in its forests and will tell people that it is planting different trees because of climate change.  We are pressing for news bulletins to mention climate change in the context of the stories they are reporting.  It may be controversial to say this, but I believe it is important to get the same reaction to leaving out the climate change aspect of a report as one would get to leaving out the sexist angle to a story.  There is a terrible row when news bulletins do not recognise the part women play in society and women and their supporters spend a lot of time getting back at broadcasters and newspapers to make sure they do not make such omissions.  We have to do the same with climate change and make sure that people cannot ignore it.  At long last, the BBC has started to treat it seriously but we have had awful trouble in the past.  I was, for the first time as chairman of the climate change committee, asked to comment on the COP meeting in Poland recently.</p><p>I did not have some lunatic Lord Lawson sitting there telling me about a science he did not understand.  The conference accepted that this was a proper conversation, and we then had a proper conversation about how well COP had done and what it had missed.</p><p> There has been a change, which we must keep going.  My communication strategy is to ensure that the implications of climate change are talked about when other matters are being discussed.  Take bottled water, for example.  I hope everyone else does the same as me.  If people offer me bottled water in a restaurant, I insist upon having tap water.  Often, I politely explain why it seems to me to be barmy to do otherwise when our islands have perfectly good water.  Therefore, if people want flat water, they should have it out of the tap.  I do not know where the water in front of me is from, but I am sure it is out of the tap, which is as it should be.  That is a small action, but it is what we have to do with everything - when an issue comes up, talk about it quietly.  It is no good having a public campaign because that is not what people want to spend their leisure hours learning about.  Rather, it is about inserting this matter into the conversation at the right points.</p></speech>

I will follow up on what he said about Katowice, COP 24 and the enormous contribution of Sir David Attenborough to the discussion.  Someone of his stature has a significant ability to influence.  Could Lord Deben roll him out as often as possible or engage someone like him?  When he spoke, it went worldwide and had an impact to the extent that it brought tears to my eyes, it was so stark.</p> <p>  The land use report went into some detail on the rewetting and restoration of peatlands, which is a matter that our committee has discussed at length.  What, if any, incentives, regulations or tax mechanisms does the UK use to support the rewetting and restoration of peatlands?</p></speech>

There is a good reason for talking about him in any case because he is very encouraging for those of us who are slightly older.  If someone can still go on doing like he does at his age, it means I have a long time to go.  I am keen on that.  He also has a voice that is listened to.  Katowice was much more successful than any of us dared hoped.  With Mr. Trump, we in Poland thought it was bound to be a disaster, but it was not, which is important.</p> <p>  The peatlands arrangements are a part of our environmental support system.  We will have to do much more about the situation and we have significant planting issues that we must sort out.  There is much work to be done.  The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who is responsible for this area, is Mr. Michael Gove and I disagree with him on almost everything except this.  He seems to have got hold of the issue of the environment in a remarkably intelligent and driven way.  He produced a document on waste yesterday that is worth this committee's consideration.  It is significant and goes much further than most of us had expected.  We will be pressing for more work to be done.</p> <p>  This is one of the issues that Ireland has a special need to address.  Peat is a very serious area of damage and, I am afraid, Ireland has historically done things that it should not have done.  We all know that.  There is no point in disagreeing, as that is what happened.  Therefore, the replacement of peat and attempt to repair the damage are important.</p> <p>  This is one of the pressures that Ireland can bring on the EU.  That is why I am a passionate European.  This is the sort of thing in respect of which the whole of the Communities ought to be helping us make up for the sins of the past.  This is one of those sins.  It is one of the reasons that CAP needs real reform.  Just like deficiency payments in Britain prior to that, it was created to ensure that we had food to eat.  That should not be its purpose today.  Rather, its purpose should be to enable farmers and land users to move from where they are to where they have to be in the context of climate change.  That will be a major battle.  Ireland has a special role to play because it is an agricultural country that recognises that we have to do something in the immediate future.  Ireland has tended not to be on that side but is increasingly moving to it, so it has a large role to play.</p></speech>

That will be a difficult report to produce.  We must first define what we mean by "net zero".  Do we mean net zero greenhouse gas emissions or net zero carbon emissions?

The system has been successful.  It has also exposed a problem.  If a nation is one of the longest standing countries with a grid system, it will find that the grid was not built for this.  Rather, it was built for big generating centres.  There are still people who hanker after that.  I tease my colleagues in the Conservative Party that they like big things that they can build and look and point at.  Somehow or other, they feel that windmills are a bit like fairies, that is, they are not really there.  The great achievement of offshore wind is that we have shown people that it is not an impractical joke system.  Next to onshore wind, it is now the cheapest way of producing electricity.</p><p>It is an amazing achievement.  We should occasionally remind ourselves of how far we have come in the past ten years.  It is amazing.  Nobody would have thought that we could have moved as far as we have already.</p><p> Deputy Neville and Senator Paul Daly spoke about farming.  It is very tough and very difficult, but we have to recognise how much can be done.  Ten years ago nobody thought that the United Kingdom would end up with as many wind farms as it has now and become the leader in wind technology.  Nobody would have believed that.  Similarly, today nobody would believe that Ireland could be the leader in how land use is changed, both in terms of peat use and in agricultural use, globally.</p></speech>

How did the UK get around that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.215" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Deben" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121900002#Z00500"><p>We got around it because those who campaigned against onshore wind made a great fuss about saying that we should have wind offshore.  We said yes to that.  It was what they wanted and so we did it.  I faced a lot of opposition to onshore wind in my own constituency.  People there did not want onshore wind energy production but rather offshore.  The energy there is now being supplied by offshore, in very big quantities.  They are now complaining about the fact that because the energy is offshore, it has to be brought onshore, and so something must be built to put the electricity into.  This is not an easy game.  We simply have to get over the problem.  Onshore wind energy is now the cheapest means of electricity production available, and governments have to be frank with people.  They should say that, without windmills, electricity will be more expensive and that bills will be higher.  It is surprising how people begin to change once that is done.</p> <p>  Another thing which could be done, which Britain did not do but which Ireland should do, is to ensure that the locality with the windmills gets some of the advantages so that it is worthwhile.  The Germans have been very successful with this approach.  Some 50% of their wind energy is owned by local communities and co-operatives.  If there are three windmills on a local hill, a person there knows that his or her electricity is significantly cheaper than normal, if not free.  He or she is getting cheaper electricity in exchange for providing the opportunity to generate electricity to the community.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that once the windmills are in place, people who did not like them before change their minds, which is surprising.  I live in the countryside, but up the road from me is the little town of Eye.  It is a very small, historic town, and there are three windmills there.  The people there hated them.  They were so angry about them, and planning permission was very difficult to achieve.  Now they are part of the scenery.  We recently had a wonderful local rendition of a ballet at three locations in the town, the third of which was out on the sward, in order that the windmills would be in the background as the sun went down.  They are now seen as something quite different.  Ireland should not forget that aspect.</p></speech>

His last point was very interesting.  I listened to a BBC Radio 4 interview with a German farmer who was asked why wind turbines and wind generation were considered more successful in Germany than they were in the UK or Ireland.  He made the point that when he looked out of his kitchen window, the turbine he saw was his turbine and did not belong to someone else.</p> <p>  Agriculture and transport are portrayed as the big villains in the area of climate change, but we often forget the potential solutions that agriculture can present as we attempt to mitigate its effects.  We need to take a holistic approach to this, because there is no magic bullet which will solve all of our problems.  I farm in Northern Ireland and work in Queen's University Belfast in the Institute for Global Food Security, which was born as a result of food fraud and the horsemeat scandal in the UK and a concern over the integrity of food and food security issues.  We spend our time looking at agriculture, food, health and nutrition.  We look at issues such as food waste, the carbon footprint of agriculture and food integrity.  The reality is that there are more people dying in the world from obesity than starvation at the moment, which is obscene.  Everything we look at is underpinned with science.  We substantiate and validate our findings.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear Lord Deben discussing fracking.  He has an interesting perspective.  From my own experience in Northern Ireland, the UK and Dublin, and thinking about the role and function of governments, the fact that politicians have a four or five-year term, from election to election, jumps out at me.  One has to make an impact, make a difference and be seen to be doing the right things if one wants to be re-elected.  My concern is that, in the court of public opinion and in the media, we can sometimes make knee-jerk decisions that are reactions to pressure which will have an impact in ten, 20 or 30 years which may be unintended.  Given that, I would like to hear Lord Deben's opinion on the status of evidence-based policymaking.  In my opinion, governments need the support of evidence-based policymaking which is underpinned with science and fact rather than sentiment and emotion or based on what is popular at a particular time.  We look at the mitigation and adaptation objectives, strategies used and land use policy, and it is critically important that we base our findings on facts.  Where does Lord Deben stand on that point?</p> <p>  On Lord Deben's point about Michael Gove's report on waste, released yesterday, we are working with a UK-based company which is focused on accelerated aerobic digestion.  In 24 hours, food waste can be turned into a product that will power a CHP plant and produce heat and electricity.  Science can offer solutions and answers to some of these problems.  I am interested in Lord Deben's opinion on government policy and evidence based policy.</p></speech>

There are two timetables in play. the political timetable, encompassing the mandate of four or five years, and the climate change timetable, which is a continuous battle we are fighting.  We are trying to win the war on that front.  It is true that politicians are concerned to make an immediate impact, which is perfectly understandable.  Science-based policy is very important, and the UK Government, in terms of listening to scientific evidence, has improved considerably.  It was not nearly as good at taking it on board 20 years ago when I was a minister, except in specific areas.  It is difficult because it is always possible to find one rogue scientist with a different opinion from the general view.  It is also the case that some of the conclusions are very unsettling.  The vice chancellor of the Senator's university has been the leader in food safety, and is a man of huge strength, in my view.  We relied on him enormously.  He is a thoroughly nice man as well.</p> <p>  The scientific advice in terms of diet is largely ignored, and the UK Government is totally unable to deal with the problem of obesity.  It is good at telling other people what to do, but it is not enacting its own advice in the NHS or in all sorts of other areas, even though the science is so clear.  The Senator is correct to say that the situation with scientific advice is getting better.  It is better than it was, but it has to get better still.  So many of the measures we want to take to mitigate climate change have other important advantages as well.  In the taxi on the way to this meeting Mr. Stark and I were talking about the issue of soil fertility.  Not only do we have to return fertility to soil so that it can sequester carbon, but also because at the moment it is so diminished, not only in the UK but elsewhere too, the trace elements in the vegetables and fruit we are supposed to be getting our five a day from are not as good as they were.</p><p>We need to improve the fertility in order that the fruit and vegetables will actually hand on what we need.  The same applies to obesity and the amount of meat we are eating and all of those things come together.  That is important.</p><p> We have no claim on the public unless we get the science right.  This is not a matter of opinion or campaigning and it is why I have to be really tough about the difference between the Committee on Climate Change and the NGOs.  I very often disagree with NGOs because I have to keep the science right.  The fact that I am not a scientist is helpful, in a sense, because I ask the difficult questions - in other words, the stupid questions.  It is very helpful to ask scientists what they mean and ask how I would explain a certain bit of science if I was speaking on a platform.  One thing we must say to scientists is that they are not always very good at explaining what they mean.  Politicians have an important role in getting scientists to speak a comprehensible language that resonates with the public and connects to the way people live.  We want to try to do that.</p><p> Ireland has a special role to play because Northern Ireland has not been as good as the rest of the United Kingdom.  Scotland is doing best, Wales is doing second best, England is third, but I am afraid Northern Ireland has not done well and that is partly because there are still people in politics in Northern Ireland who do not believe climate change is happening.  They are the same people who believe the world was created 86,000 years ago.  There is a real problem there and Ireland has got to show it.  Ireland has done a great deal for encouraging Northern Ireland to understand the realities of the world and it is tremendously important that Ireland helps.  This is a co-operative matter and Ireland and Northern Ireland can do an enormous amount of work together.</p><p> One of the great advantages we have with climate change is that it is not the old argument.  The Church of England and the Catholic Church are working together on these issues because there is no history of argument, we never fell out on this.  Catholics like me can sit together with people who have a different view and we can do a lot of these things.  The same is true about the North and the South.  It is possible to do some work here because there is very little baggage so we have to try very hard.</p></speech>

Specific money comes from work the committee does quite separately through our employment by the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales.  We can bid for money when people ask us to do more.  For example, we told DEFRA that neither it nor us could do our work unless there was serious work done on land use that would cost a significant amount of money and we needed more people to do that.  We got the money and, frankly, we have been extremely well treated by the Government on this.  There might be a situation in the future whereby we would not be well treated and that is why I would like a system with an independent authority.  We could then tell that authority that the Act requires us to give advice and we cannot do that unless we have a budget.  We have never had to worry about that but, if we ever did, I would have to turn to the public and say that, if it wants this job done properly, either the Government pays for it or we find the money independently.  I would be quite surprised if the Treasury would not pay in those circumstances because the last thing it wants is the committee to have an independent source of income.</p></speech>

It has been able to use that very distinct scientific quality to support the science in an effective way.  The previous head of the meteorological office, Julia Slingo, had a very determined effect.  Dare I say this message is sometimes better coming from a woman who gets up and says it in that sort of way.  She was a surprising success while under particular attack from Lord Lawson because she did it so well.  The Met Office has been very helpful.</p></speech>

There is a silly argument about whether it should be carbon capture and usage or carbon capture and storage.  We do not have the uses we would need to make it really worthwhile.  We have to be able to store carbon because there is a great gap otherwise which we cannot fill in all our targets which is why we are pleased that the Government has finally understood that this has to be done and the only alternatives are hugely more expensive and therefore we have got to do this.  There is no reason the United Kingdom could not be a leader because we have the advantages of holes down which to put it.  This is a post-fossil fuel situation and the places where we cannot do it are very difficult.  For example, we have been trying to work with the Welsh Government because its problem is that its biggest emitters are all in that south corner of Wales where there is not a natural place to store the carbon, so there is an issue there.  Carbon capture and storage is crucial.</p></speech>

Our job is to fix the outcome and we have to prove that is possible within the present context.  We would perhaps say that if the speed of the switch to electric cars was increased, or if more was done about land use, a certain level could be reached, or through a whole series of other things that the Government decides.  I can conceive of situations in which we might suggest the Government ought to look at the taxation system in particular ways but the problem is that, in the end, we have to be practical.  We do not know what the result of a particular tax would be and, in a sense, it is where a government should be acting.  The taxation system is, in the end, the prime role of a government and it must make that decision.  All we would do would be to say that among our scenarios, there is a possibility of decreasing the use of fossil fuels by a different taxation and I can imagine doing that but we would not go further than that.</p></speech>

That must be significant.  Getting a Conservative Party Chancellor of the Exchequer in a very tough time to do that and defend it right the way through was of great importance, despite the attacks made by newspapers and suchlike on what they thought were green taxes.  Connected with it was we realised nobody listened to the climate change committee when we talked about the price of energy.  Nobody understood what a kilowatt hour was, let alone the cost per kilowatt hour.  We were the ones who decided to talk about bills and what people actually paid.  This enabled us to show that the effect of the measures we were taking was to lower the amount of electricity people needed.  If they had new boilers or toasters, they all used less electricity.  The clincher for us was we were able to say one was paying about &pound;9 a month more than one would otherwise pay for the green measures.  However, bills are &pound;20 a month less because one is using less electricity.  There is a saving of &pound;11 a month on that basis.  For the first time there was a connection between what people understood and what we were actually doing.  I consider this to be one of our real triumphs in communication.  One of the reasons I say that is that it annoyed the doubters enormously.  They were so angry because it got rid of their only real argument which was fairly pathetic one that we were laying all of the weight on the poor who were having to pay for it.  The poor were benefiting significantly, even though our system in the United Kingdom was not as sensitive to deprivation as it should have been.</p></speech>

The science becomes more and more clear and people's experience of climate change becomes greater.  It then becomes more difficult to defend the opposite line, which must be accepted.  The third thing is that we are very tough about not becoming party political.  Part of the reason for this is that it is known that I have been a politician all of my life and that I have to keep my independence.  It would be very easy to make points as somebody who sits as a Conservative in the House of Lords.  The element that has been very effective is that we have clamped down and been really tough on anyone who tries to use climate change as a party political operation.  As a politician, I know that in oppositon it is very much easier be green.  All parties are greener in opposition than they are in government.  In opposition one does not have the pressures of delivering electricity next week, or, for example, a protest march.  We are very careful.  The only time I speak politically is when I wish to object when a party of any kind tries to use climate change as differentiating, except when it proposes going further than the government, of which I am all in favour, but not when it is used as a party political weapon.</p></speech>

The government has met the first and second and probably the third budget, but it will not meet the fourth and fifth budgets, unless it makes some very big changes for which we must press very hard.  It has been spectacularly more successful in electricity generation, but that was necessary because one cannot do one thing without the other.  There is no point in having electric cars if they are using fossil fuel energy.  One has to do it in order to facilitate this change.</p> <p>  It is arguable that the fact that we are flat-lining in general and not going up is a success.  It has not been successful enough, but it has been a success.  The fact that there are budgets means, for example, that this very week - yesterday - we have had the Department of Transport producing its first aviation report and accepted in it the restrictions the climate change committee placed on it.  Previously, there would have been equivocation.  We are being successful, but I return to the point I made to Senator Marshall that it is all about urgency and the comment of his neighbour when talking about campaigners.  We ought to be very worried about how slow all of this has been, how much has to be done and how we all have to do it.  We have to say to people that the one argument that is unacceptable is that one cannot do it because somebody else will take my place.  If we do that and are in the "After you, Claude" world, it will not solve the problem.</p></speech>

There are always arguments about it as to whether we have the right kind.  One of the problems with smart metering is that when we started to have laptops, some people never got one because there was always going to be one that would be better one than the one they were going to buy and they could not settle on any one in the end.  There is a problem like it with smart metering technology.  We are, however, using it and there is a lot of other technology available.  Ireland has been wonderful because it has invented this fantastic system where one keeps the chickens and then collects the manure to produce the energy for the next lot of chickens.  One uses only approximately 50% of the energy, with the remaining 50% being put back into the grid.  It is an Irish invention.  Before I joined the climate change committee, we did some work for them which we would not be able to do now.  I am enthusiastic about these initiatives.  Very often it is these exciting things, if they come out of left field in technology, that really impress.  There is a man who has just done some work on the issue of turbulence, for example, and shown how one can now be 60% more accurate in the case of an aeroplane.  This means that it does not have to move so far when it wants to escape turbulence as one knows where it is.  As a result, the amount of energy and fuel used by the aeroplane is reduced and it does not have to fly excessively high because one knows precisely where there is turbulence.  It is a fantastic piece of technology which is not on the list of things to reduce emissions from aeroplanes.</p> <p>  Very ofteurn it is these exciting </p></speech>

I laid down the rules, when I was Minister, which made sure that organic farming was genuinely organic and not fraudulent, which sometimes it can be.  We are talking about extensive farming and there are many bits in the organic argument which, scientifically, I find difficult to take.  I do not understand why it should be right to use, for example, copper sulphate but not right to have potassium.  I do not see that their rules about a number of things make sense.  I have strong views on the remarkable work of the woman who was much the leader of it.  She made people respect the soil.  Even though I do not accept the organic argument of the Soil Association, I do accept the fundamental view that the soil is important and that we have misused it, and I come back to the comments of the Pope about that.  It is this misuse, through greed, that has put us in the position in which we are.  We have allowed the soil, which we should have been protecting and looking after, to be diminished because we have misused it.  She was right.</p></speech>

Previous meetings took place on 17 January and 28 February last.  Today we will hear from two former members of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, Professor Deirdre Madden, from the school of law at University College Cork, UCC, and Professor N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Hayes, from the school of education, Trinity College Dublin, TCD.  We will also hear from Ms Marian Barnard and Ms Gillian Keegan from the National Infertility Support and Information Group, NISIG, and Ms Emma O'Friel and Dr. Joanne Rose who will give some donor conceived perspectives.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I have submitted a more detailed paper on the Bill and at this point, given the short time available to us, wish to highlight from that submission the area of most pressing concern to me in the Bill, which is surrogacy.</p> <p>  Surrogacy can play an invaluable role in helping to create new families but it raises complex legal and ethical issues on which there are many diverse views.  From a policy perspective it is important to bear in mind that surrogacy is a reality and must be dealt with by ensuring respect and protection for all parties involved, particularly the rights and interests of children.  Prohibitive approaches in this area will fail.  We must not put our heads in the sand but instead learn from what works and does not work elsewhere to craft an appropriate legislative model for this country.  Developments in assisted reproduction mean that it is now possible to separate conception, gestation and child rearing, with a number of different potential parents due to various combinations of gametes and roles.  This challenges our traditional and cultural norms on what parenthood is and what a family should look like.</p> <p>  An important question that arises in surrogacy is who should be recognised as the legal parents of the child and why.  In answer to this question, the Bill proposes that a surrogate mother, who is required by the Bill to be genetically unrelated to the child she carries, should be the legal mother of that child.  This requires intended parents, who are required to be genetically related, to go through a legal procedure to gain recognition of that relationship.  We know from studies of surrogate mothers that surrogates generally do not consider the children they bear to be theirs and do not wish to be regarded as the legal mothers of those children.  I submit that this proposed legal policy is not in the best interests of surrogate mothers, the intended parents and certainly not the child.</p> <p>  The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in 2005 recommended that the child born through surrogacy should be presumed to be that of the intended parents.  This recommendation, which I support, was based on the "intent of reproduction" concept which aims to identify those people who are most strongly motivated to have a child, have initiated the reproductive process without which the child would not exist, have been closely involved throughout the pregnancy and have demonstrated a commitment to caring for and rearing the child as their own.  This concept would provide the most consistent outcome in surrogacy cases and, most important, would prioritise the best interests of the child, as it would legally recognise him or her as the child of those who were highly motivated to plan and bring about his or her conception and who fully intend and desire to take on the responsibility to raise and care for him or her.  I urge members of the committee to examine the surrogacy frameworks in other jurisdictions where legal parentage is accorded to the intended parents prior to birth, rather than take the easy route of following flawed legislation from the UK which has been the subject of extensive criticism in recent years from lawyers, judges, advocates and academics.  In fact, the Law Commission in the UK is currently reviewing surrogacy law there, having taken the view that its surrogacy laws are not fit for purpose, yet we are proposing to copy those same laws.</p> <p>  Payment of surrogate mothers is also an issue that provokes much debate.  The Bill proposes a model of reimbursement of vouched reasonable expenses.  However, the consequences of transgression are extremely harsh and expose the intended parents to potential criminal prosecution with significant penalties.  Most important, transgression results in loss of eligibility to apply for a parental order.  In these circumstances, the birth mother and her husband will remain the unwilling legal parents of the child to whom they are genetically unrelated.  How is this a child centred approach?  The reality is that in the UK, on which our scheme is proposed to be modelled, family courts always authorise payments to surrogates in excess of notional reasonable expenses so that parental orders can be made in the child's best interests.  One of the UK's most senior family judges, Sir James Munby, recently called for a relaxation of the rules against paying surrogates saying that it would be better to face up to reality than to have the law say one thing but accept another.</p><p>The current proposals in this Bill risk causing parents to mislead the court about payments, and will cause great anxiety to honest people who fear that their child will be removed from their care if they cannot justify the payments made to surrogates.  Why is it proposed to copy the English model and insert a similar provision into the legislation here that we know will similarly be ineffective and will be ignored by Irish judges in practice?</p><p> It may be argued that facilitating payments to surrogates encourages commercialisation of reproduction which can be exploitative of poorer women and I fully accept that there are legitimate and important ethical concerns in this regard.  However, the avoidance of potential exploitation will not be achieved by this Bill, which will merely ensure that it does not happen in our jurisdiction.  The appropriate response is not to put in place an unenforceable prohibition but rather to insist on proper safeguards to ensure written agreements, counselling, screening and preparation.</p><p> The Bill does not attempt to regularise the situation of those couples who are faced with trying to bring their child back from another jurisdiction, which will be the reality for most families who choose to have a child through surrogacy.  As the experience of other jurisdictions demonstrates, this may leave children in legal limbo, potentially stateless and parentless pending the outcome of litigation.</p><p> This Bill will result in the birth of Irish children in other countries who will probably never know the identity of the woman who carried them for nine months and gave birth to them.  This is inconsistent with the right of the child to access the identity of their biological parents as provided both by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  I agree with the Chief Justice of the family Court of Australia, Judge Diana Bryant, who described it as extremely irresponsible for governments not to deal with international surrogacy arrangements.  This Bill cannot therefore be described as child-centred and I urge the committee to recommend to the Minister that it be revised.</p></speech>

As a member of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, I welcome the publication of this Bill.</p> <p>  My background is psychology and professionally my focus is on early child development and education.  I am a founder member of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and I approach my work and research from a child rights perspective, which holds that children of every age are independent rights holders &ndash; a position now captured in our Constitution.  The Committee on the Rights of the Child is clear in its guidance that implementation of the convention requires states continually to review how law, policy and practice affect children&rsquo;s rights.  It is in this context that I make my observations, which relate to three particular issues, namely, the design of the Bill, the welfare of the child and the child&rsquo;s right to identity, particularly in surrogacy. </p> <p>  On the design of the Bill, the intention behind assisted human reproduction, AHR, is, in all cases, the safe arrival of a child.  The current design of the Bill could be strengthened by a more robust child rights approach.  Such an approach would draw attention to the need to realise and protect children&rsquo;s rights at all stages of their childhood and take account of their views in keeping with Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC.  It would also provide a basis from which to address the central role of parents in protecting the rights of their children and the State&rsquo;s responsibility to support them in this regard.  The issues raised are particularly relevant to surrogacy where due attention must be paid to the developmental needs and rights of every young child. </p> <p>  Under Article 18(1), parents are recognised as having primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child.  Article 18(2) notes that State parties shall render appropriate assistance to parents and legal guardians in the performance of these responsibilities and shall ensure the development of institutions, facilities and services for the care of children.  The Bill should therefore endeavour in its design to support parents in protecting children&rsquo;s rights to know their parents, be cared by them and have their views taken into account.  The Committee on the Rights of the Child notes that the "views expressed by children may add relevant perspectives and experiences and should be considered in decision-making, policymaking and preparation of laws and/or measures as well as their evaluations."  How can this latter right to participation be realised at birth?  The committee notes that, in relation to the totality of the CRC, participation can be addressed by using reliable data on and from children to identify and to inform all policy development for children.  There is a growing population of children and young people who are the direct outcome of AHR procedures and, over their lifetimes, they can offer insights into how policies and practices have affected them and could be changed or improved.  The current Bill only references research in terms of medical research.  I suggest it be amended to include a recognition of the importance of social science research into the lives and experiences of children born through AHR and the contribution such research evidence could make to the quality of lives of future generations of children born through AHR. </p> <p>  The Bill specifically attends to the welfare of the child noting that "AHR treatment may be provided ... subject to a consideration of the welfare of any child who would be born as a result of the proposed treatment."  Relationships are the primary mode through which children develop and the effect of the relational process is often more powerful than that of the context within which it occurs.  Living in environments characterised by chronic, poorly managed stress has a direct impact on early brain development, especially in the weeks and months immediately after birth.  Stressors in early childhood can disrupt neurologic, metabolic and immunologic systems leading to poorer developmental outcomes.  Where parents experience stress through uncertainty or lack of clarity around the security of their role as parents, the environment within which children are developing may be unnecessarily stressful.  Proactively supporting the development of positive relationships between adults and children requires careful consideration of the relationships that happen in the lives of children and the factors that can contribute to enhancing or challenging the quality and impact of such relationships.</p> <p>  The Bill may contribute to stress in the lives of parents and children.  For instance, in the case of the proposals regarding surrogacy the explanatory notes identify three stages of counselling, namely, before the agreement, after the birth of the child but before the child is living with the intending parents, and at the time of the application for the transfer of parentage of the child.  These requirements could span a period of up to six months and seem onerous, adding a dimension of uncertainty around the precise parentage of the child.  Such distress could have a negative impact on the child.  Providing for a judicial pre-authorisation, where legal parenthood is granted to the intending parents before the birth of a child, would provide clarity and certainty from the moment of birth, thus minimising the stress in the immediate environment of the child following birth. </p> <p>  The child&rsquo;s right to identity in cases of donor assisted human reproduction, DAHR, is protected under the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  However, the Act makes no explicit reference to the issue of the right to identity in relation to surrogacy.  In light of this, it is critical that the Bill makes clear the right to identity and the procedures to ensure the realisation of this right for children born through surrogacy.  In this regard, the Bill proposes that children born through surrogacy be issued with a "surrogacy certificate".  I use this simply to illustrate a point.  In a rights-based Bill efforts would be made to ensure that the language used would limit the degree to which proposals create situations where children stand out as different from other children.  In this regard, and to limit the emphasis on any particular type of birth, I suggest that the proposed &ldquo;surrogacy certificate&rdquo; be re-titled the &ldquo;birth certificate&rdquo; with &ldquo;by surrogacy&rdquo; included in parentheses, if necessary. </p> <p>  In conclusion, this Bill is a welcome step on the path to regulating for a safe AHR environment in Ireland for parents and children.  However, in design it highlights welfare considerations without due attention to the rights of the child, particularly in relation to support for the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights across their lifespan, identity in surrogacy and support for parents to protect and realise the rights of children. </p></speech>

My statement will briefly detail the areas of interest to NISIG&rsquo;s members.  We have provided ongoing support to people who are facing these challenges for over 30 years.  </p> <p>  The National Infertility Support and Information Group is a patient group formed in 1996 and is the only charity in the Republic focusing on infertility.  Our mission has been to provide practical and emotional supports to, and advocate on behalf of, those experiencing reproductive challenges and to provide support to families created using assisted human reproduction, AHR.  Therefore, we provide support not only to those prior to birth but also afterwards and we have developed those services, especially recent years.  We provide support at all stages of the fertility journey, from trying to conceive to IVF through donor conception and surrogacy.  The AHR landscape has become quite complex in the past ten years and our group tries to represent that.  </p> <p>  A key service provided by the group is peer to peer support and networking opportunities.  Meeting others who are in a similar position makes the experience less isolating and gives people emotional support.</p><p>NISIG also supports families created through AHR.  We ran our first family conversations event a year ago.  It aims to support families of donor-conceived children who are starting to discuss their children's origins.  We have developed our services over recent years.  Funding is critical for our organisation to continue to provide these services.  We have found that funding has been especially challenging over recent years.  We were getting national lottery funding but unfortunately have not received that in recent years.</p><p> As an organisation, we welcome this overdue forward-thinking legislation and the proposed introduction of a regulatory body.  We have had acknowledgement that patient voices will be included on that body.</p><p> Over the last ten or 15 years, NISIG has concentrated on laying the groundwork for public funding for fertility.  Given that one in six people suffer from fertility issues, Ireland is only one of three countries, along with Lithuania and Cyprus, that does not currently have public funding.  The sector in Ireland has become increasingly commercialised over the past decade.  The lack of public funding and the entry of multinational companies into the sector has meant people going through fertility treatments are open to exploitation and it is very costly for anybody going through treatment, especially where they are doing repeated cycles.  We ask that consideration be given to the number of cycles that may be publicly funded.  We suggest that three cycles would be reasonable.  We have seen evidence in support groups that a significant number of people travel abroad when certain treatments are not available in Ireland, for example, double donation, embryo adoption and egg sharing.  We ask if funding for that will be considered and for secondary infertility, including for the transfer of frozen embryos, when people hope to expand their families.</p><p> As an organisation that provides emotional support through our 24 hour helpline and regional support meetings, we recognise the inherent value of counselling for those undergoing fertility treatments, particularly at points where treatments have failed, in donor conception and surrogacy.  We find that people have a number of treatments, then have a conversation with a clinician where the clinician says that if they want to have a family, they may have to consider donor conception.  That is a significant blow for people when they hear that and it takes quite a long time to come to terms with it.  While counselling should be encouraged, it should not be arbitrary.  It is certainly beneficial in situations where donor conception and surrogacy are considered, but it might be best for it to be separated from the treatment provider.</p><p> The Bill addresses the upper age limit of 47 for women undergoing IVF treatment.  We consider that to be unnecessarily restrictive, especially as reproductive technologies continue to evolve.  NISIG feels that there should be room for flexibility which needs to be exercised by clinicians.  Before I address surrogacy, we would like clarification on whether egg sharing will be permitted in Irish clinics.  We would also like clarification on whether a male surviving partner can use embryos via a surrogate.  Regarding single embryo transfer, we would defer to clinicians&rsquo; recommendations on this and agree that this might be decided on an individual basis.  The time limit on storing embryos can be unnecessarily restrictive for those trying to complete their families and for those who have had cancer treatment.  Regarding the proposed national surrogacy and donor conception registers under the Children and Family Relationships Act, as I think was mentioned by a clinician, Dr. John Waterstone, in February, we feel that the proposal whereby a donor-conceived person who applies for a birth certificate would be told by the State that he or she was donor conceived without ever seeking that information is a dangerous invasion of privacy that needs to be reviewed.</p><p> As Professor Madden mentioned, restricting surrogacy to domestic arrangement will effectively rule out surrogacy as an option for many couples in addition to leaving the children and prospective parents of foreign surrogacy arrangements in a legal limbo.  The prohibition on providing technical, professional and medical services, save for domestic surrogacy arrangements, will cause unnecessary further distress to many couples in the State while also potentially leaving clinicians open to fines or criminal action.  While we appreciate that surrogacy is a very complex area, the legislative framework will need to reflect the actual realities of surrogacy in Ireland, namely, that most of it takes place outside of the country.  We have a surrogacy support group and people who come to it are dealing with surrogacy outside the State.  We ask on behalf of our members for clarification on whether parental rights such as maternity and paternity leave will extend to the parents of children born via surrogacy.  That is one of their key concerns.</p><p> The areas of concern are funding, counselling and the register with regard to surrogacy.  NISIG thanks the Joint Committee on Health for the opportunity to submit this statement and to speak at this hearing.  We ask that due time and consideration be given to review the questions and issues raised in this statement as they reflect those of the people who are going through surrogacy and donor conception.  As a support group, we have been helping those people for the past 30 years.  We thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

In recent years, since doing my masters degree in psychological science, I have researched the practice of donor-assisted human reproduction.  I have found no evidence that it prioritises the best interest of the child.  It prioritises adult interests.  Donor-conceived people are the only party who not only do not benefit but are harmed.  Our parentage is a straightforward, unaltered relationship.  Donor-conceived people's parentage is altered at the hands of a third party before they are even conceived.  State practices acknowledge the primacy of a child only being removed from kin as a last resort, yet we do not apply this protection to donor-conceived children.  We ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to know and be cared for by our natural parents, yet we do not apply it equally to donor-conceived children.  We teach our secondary school children that every human being without exception comes from one man and one woman.  We expect donor-conceived children to have no knowledge of this man or woman.  We talk about family likenesses, cousins, heritage, and ancestry, yet we deny donor-conceived people this essential part of belonging.  We tell them that their genetic family does not matter while we would not be without ours.  We give them, or propose to give them, birth certificates that differ from ours.  We make them unequal and try to convince them that they are special.</p> <p>  This Bill will consolidate the disadvantaged position of donor-conceived people who will be bound by law to accept inequality.  The longing for a child cannot override the child's need to know the people from whom he or she comes.  To say that the donor-conceived child playing or at school is doing fine is an inaccurate measure.  Adoptees of the previous century as children would have shown little or no sign of the pain to come.  The impact of injustices done in childhood can only be dealt with in adulthood.  There are thousands of donor-conceived people worldwide who testify to the long-term harm.  The Adoption Rights Alliance describes layers and layers of parallels with adoption practices and those of donor-assisted human reproduction.  Psychological well-being is bound with a solid sense of self, formed by integrating all the elements of who we are.  Our genetic identity provides us with a sense of belonging.  It grounds us in space and time.  It answers the question of to whom one is related.</p> <p>  I am very concerned by the commercial nature of this industry, by the misuse of language and concepts, the dehumanising rhetoric and the exploitation of students and young Ukrainian and Czech mothers needing cash, recruited on Facebook to breed.  I am concerned that in a town called Brno live 350 young Czech women whose biological children live in Ireland with false birth certificates, not allowed ever to know them.  I am concerned that an Irish clinic's partner in Ukraine spoke of expanding into new markets in India and sends weekly publicity emails to potential clients offering discounts, even, cruelly, Mother's Day specials.  I am concerned that this industry refers to a child's right to his or her identity as "utterly meaningless" and argues in favour of donor anonymity when we have acknowledged that it is grossly harmful.</p> <p>  Donor-assisted human reproduction does not treat infertility.  The infertile person remains, sadly, infertile.  It is simply the outsourcing of a young fertile person to have a child remotely and sign away all contact.  There is no mention of the thousands of children born in Ireland through anonymous parentage who carry false birth certificates, most of whom are still minors, because this practice has really only flourished in the past 18 years or so.  According to one clinic, most of them will never be told the truth.  We will be complicit if we do not halt a practice that we know causes profound human suffering.  Will we say to these future adults that we did not know?  We know.</p> <p>  That was short because Dr. Rose and I have split our five minutes.</p></speech>

I was conceived from donor conception and have fought for the rights of donor-conceived people.  In 2002, I won a test case in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales to bring an end to donor anonymity.  I am aware that the committee is concerned about providing for adults seeking reproductive interventions.  Today, however, I hope to bring to the attention of members the other stakeholders involved, namely, those who donated their sperm or eggs or who were conceived from reproductive interventions.  First, I appeal for the acknowledgement that donors who become genetic parents and those produced from them are stakeholders.  Second, I note that they must be given equal or even greater representation than the others owing to their special vulnerability to risks yet to be understood.  International developments in regard to the legal and social recognition of the rights of these groups have been incremental and have taken decades of hard work and campaigning.</p> <p>  Sadly, the best interests of the child are not properly considered in the general scheme of the Bill, apart from the provisions to end donor anonymity.  The child's interests and legal recognition are reduced to the provision of having his or her welfare taken into consideration "as far as is practicable".  I would like to reflect on these words and the degradation of legal protection and discrimination accorded to this group.  I wonder if it is legal to provide such discriminatory approaches to this particular group of children.  The general scheme of the Bill speaks with confidence about providing counselling and informed consent on the implications and consequences of these practices.  This is a false reassurance because of the dominance of the other two stakeholder groups, namely, fertility clinics and the adults who acquire their services.</p> <p>  Reproductive technology is a social and medical experiment and the adverse impacts and consequences are unravelling over time around the world.  I have submitted to the committee a document which provides details on some of the activities of campaigning donor offspring around the world.  It is only they who can inform best practice in this area.  For the most part, we pay for our own counselling and genetic tests.  We find lost relatives and sometimes live with false birth certificates and absent or misleading medical histories.  We have lost ethnicities and ancestors and large numbers of siblings and half siblings.  All this confronts us privately in adulthood.  There is little understanding of the resulting grief and its disenfranchisement by our families and the community at large.  Ending donor anonymity addresses only some of these problems.</p> <p>  We should know from bad adoption practices in Ireland and elsewhere the grief that can be caused by severing natural ties.  The difference between adoption and donor conception is that, in the case of the latter, the natural ties are intended to be broken for a child before he or she is even conceived.  Unlike best practice in adoption, donor conception is really about child production, not child protection.  With adoption, parents have to pass a vetting process, whereas for donor conception, this is not the case.  Why is that so?  The general scheme of the Bill refers to plans to create scientific and ethical advisory committees to oversee the practice of assisted human reproduction.  I suggest that the relevant authorities, including the Committee on Health, should consult adopted persons' groups and professionals who understand the long-term impact of adoption, kinship loss and displacement and speak widely to those already conceived from assisted human reproduction practices.  I urge the committee and the Government to listen carefully to the voices of donor-conceived people and try not to let this become the adoption-style scandal of the future.</p> <p>  Ideally, donor conception should not be permitted because it involves the intentional severing of the genetic kin of future generations as a service or treatment.  Children lose their knowledge of and relationships with their natural father or mother or both and all associated family.  This is a huge loss to preplan for another generation.  At a minimum, the impact of deliberately severing these natural ties must be minimised by providing long-term state support to donor-conceived people and the funding to provide them with the help needed to find their natural families in future, most importantly, when they face these issues as adults.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

It has been very interesting.  Since we discussed this issue previously at the initial stages, the witnesses seem to have firmed up their conclusions.  Professor Madden referred to comparisons with the UK.  Its legal system is different from ours.  It has a different constitution which goes back centuries to the Magna Carta.  We have a written Constitution which is referred to in a different way.  I refer to the issues which have arisen on foot of court cases taken in the UK and elsewhere, which I referred to on the previous occasion.  Is Professor Madden satisfied that the UK's model is not suitable for replication here?  Would she like to comment further on that?</p></speech>

I am satisfied from my knowledge of the court cases and legislation in the UK and contacts with academics and commentators and lawyers working there that their legislation is not fit for purpose and does not achieve what it set out to.  It is being reviewed by the Law Commission there.  Nevertheless, we are planning to copy that model to transfer parentage from the surrogate mother and her husband where she is married to the intended parents who are required to be genetically related between six weeks and six months after the child's birth.  That is flawed for many reasons.</p> <p>  Putting a time constraint in place is flawed in circumstances in which parentage is not certain for the first six weeks of the child's life.  While the child is in the custody of the intended parents at that time, they will not have any legal relationship.  When the child is delivered in hospital, the optimal situation is that the child is handed to the intended parents who are genetically related to it.  Will the hospital here allow the intended parents to leave the hospital with that child even though they do not have any legal relationship with it?  In some instances in the UK, the child is handed over in the car park.  A child's baby seat is handed from one car to another because the hospital will not allow the intended parents to leave the hospital with the child, even though that is what all of the parties intended.  For that first six-week period, the parents looking after the child and who have custody do not have the right to consent to medical treatment or vaccinations where the child requires them.</p> <p>  It can be for an even longer period depending on how long it takes the parents to get to court to obtain a parental order.  This is at a time in the child's life when the parents should be adjusting to their new life and family and bonding with their child rather than going through a court procedure which is unnecessary.  I accept fully that there has to be some judicial oversight and regulation of the relationship, but that can take place during the pregnancy so that legal parentage is certain from the time of birth, as are responsibility for the child and commitment to it.  It can happen during pregnancy, as happens in California, New Hampshire and Greece.  That is a good model to follow.</p> <p>  On the payment issue, court cases in the UK show that the model is very unsatisfactory.</p><p>That is because it presents judges with a difficult scenario where they are faced with two different conflicting policy objectives.  On the one hand, there is a policy objective in the English legislation which says that one should not pay more than reasonable expenses for surrogacy and anything more than reasonable expenses is prohibited.  That is a policy the UK Parliament has set and on the other hand, all courts of course have to prioritise the best interests of the child.  Consequently, faced with a situation where parents have perhaps paid more than "vouched expenses" - to use the language which is in the Bill - what is a judge to do?  Is he or she supposed to adopt the policy that any payment in excess of expenses is bad and therefore these parents should not be allowed to have legal recognition of their relationship with their child or does he or she prioritise the best interests of the child?  This is a child being raised by fit and loving parents, everybody is happy with the relationship and with the establishment of that family unit, including the surrogate mother and the intended parents and there are no aspersions cast on these intended parents by virtue of the fact of them going through surrogacy as that in itself is not a negative connotation.  The judge will always go with the best interests of the child as courts are always obliged to do and that means that the judge is ignoring the other policy which is against commercialisation or paid surrogacy.  In my view, that brings the legislation into disrepute because the law is saying that no more than reasonable expenses shall be paid but when it comes to it, the courts will always ignore that in favour of the best interests of the child, as they should and as they must.  Why would we insist on putting something into the legislation that will be ineffective, that will be ignored in practice and does not serve any purpose?</p></speech>

I particularly like the example in New Hampshire because it involves judicial pre-authorisation of the surrogacy arrangement in order that there are evaluations, screenings and counselling of all of the parties prior to any medical procedure taking place to make sure that everybody knows what they are about, that everybody knows what the object of this medical procedure is and that everybody knows that it is intended that the intended parents will receive custody.  There are home studies of the surrogate and the intending mother and father, there are age requirements, there are requirements on genetic counselling and there are residency requirements.  At the initial hearing the judge will validate the surrogacy agreement after meeting with the parties, reviewing the terms and agreements in the arrangement, verifying that all the required counselling sessions and evaluations have occurred before finally determining that everything is ultimately in the best interests of the resulting child.  That process takes place at an earlier stage, before the impregnation, embryo transfer or, depending on the state, it can happen during the pregnancy.  The birth mother has the right to take all healthcare decisions regarding the pregnancy and the foetus and once parental rights are transferred to the intending parents, they have a duty to support the child from the moment of birth and the child born under surrogacy is always considered the legitimate child of the intending parents.  That is a very good model.</p></speech>

The issue that arises in those instances is that if the children are not informed by their parents that they have been born through donor conception, then they do not know that they can access that information and therefore they never seek it, so they are never told by the State or by anybody else.  Public awareness, education and support should be given to intended parents through surrogacy, through the donor health registry, DHR, or through whatever procedure is being used such as egg donation or embryo donation, for example.  There should be encouragement, counselling and support for parents in that instance to encourage them to tell their children at the earliest possible opportunity that they have been conceived in this way and therefore it never comes as a shock to them and they grow up knowing the circumstances of their birth and that they can access information on the donor when the law considers it appropriate.  I am fully supportive of the identification of donors.</p></speech>

The genetic link can be important to children and from the research that is available, it seems that in cases such as surrogacy for instance, we are still in the early stages of understanding the trajectory across the lifespan but in early adolescence, young adults do have a curiosity but are largely indifferent and do not have a great urge to seek out further information but the observations that were made by my colleagues about the sense of belonging and the sense of being part of something as one gets older are valid and that does appear to be the case.  Where openness has been the norm, it makes that much easier for everybody and there is no secrecy or apparent deception.  While I appreciate that parents sometimes choose not to tell their children out of a sense of protection and so forth and not necessarily out of deceit, it is nonetheless a withholding of information to which children have a right and consequently I am very much in support of it and believe that the research supports it also.</p></speech>

Narelle's law was developed in Victoria, Australia, as a result of somebody dying from having the wrong medical history.  There were eight children in eight different families who were predisposed to the same medical history but they were not necessarily informed that they were donor conceived so they have a "Time to Tell" campaign in Victoria.</p> <p>  If Ireland is to model its legislation on anything, I would not go for the UK model, rather I would opt for the Victoria model of Narelle's law at the least.  My court case established that we have a human right under Article 8 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to know our identities but that is irrelevant if one does not know that his or her human right is being deprived because of a misleading birth certificate.  With all of these gene tests that are available from Ancestry.com to Family Tree DNA, I am on all of these support groups where people are finding out in their 60s that they are donor conceived and that they have been lied to and misled all of their lives.  The anger that people invariably feel towards their parents and towards a system that was complicit in that type of deception is intense.  It is vital, if Ireland is to proceed with this, that it at least legislates for transparency about this taking place for the next generation in order that they know that they cannot be lied to and that the State is not complicit in misleading them.</p></speech>

While it is better not to withhold the truth, there are plenty of donor conceived people who have known from the beginning and their parents were completely open but they reached the stage that we all reach of wanting to know who they are and of feeling different.</p><p>I hear a common thread in talking to adoptees and donor conceived people who say they feel different or displaced.  My neighbour calls herself a late discovery adoptee from the illegal system within Ireland and she found out she was adopted at the age of 50.  She never knew her mother and, through DNA, was able to find her biological mother.  She says that it makes everything make sense.  Here is a woman who she laughs like, with whom she has many similarities and a connection that she never had with the family in which she grew up.  That is not to say there are not very good experiences and loving people involved, but the starting question has to be when is it right to separate a child from their genetic family.  That is the starting point, not farther down the line, and we need to ask how can we make this better.  We have to ask when is it right and we know, in all our other practices, it is never right unless it is for their protection.  This is not for their protection.  It is not even a medical procedure.  It is using a medical tool, in IVF, which is a fabulous medical tool that means fertilisation can occur outside the body, but it is taking that tool, which is being used for AHR and affecting the concept of distance, in that a man and a woman anywhere in the world can be used to fertilise a client.  The important part is that the distance makes it all seem clinical and sanitised and we do not see it down the road.  These clinics are finding the greatest sources of fertile young people and that is students, namely, 19, 20 and 21 year olds, who are our children.  The clinics can go to Trinity and UCD and tell their clients to sit down and wait while they find somebody who will breed.  They recruit a mass of young students.  These students are young and money is an issue.  This comes back to the point about compensation.  There can be regulation for compensation but it remains an incentive, it is still money.  Men get &euro;200 in Denmark and that is a lot of money to a student, even if it is just drinking money.</p><p> Similarly, women get paid roughly &euro;1,000 in England.  That is a huge incentive for somebody in the Czech Republic or Ukraine.  Once money is a factor, it becomes business.  Clinics are doing wonderful things with IVF and technology and are helping but, when helping somebody else is tightly connected with financial gain, then it is a business.</p></speech>

I do not think one can intentionally separate a child from his or her genetic parents by design and say that is in a child's best interests because it is not.  Having said that, I have to argue for damage limitation and raise awareness that, if someone is to proceed with this, it should be done in a way that avoids damage as much as possible.  Things like sister clinics abroad and State funding to facilitate conception abroad, with anonymous donor conception, which does everything that is not in the realms of recognised human rights, must stop.  That happens in England all the time and there are loopholes.  Having committees that are dominated by the infertility service providers and those who receive those services just has to stop.  Before we try even to think about appropriately protecting the best interests of the child and those people targeted to be donors, the practice needs to be re-framed and there must be a more appropriate representation of those stakeholders.  I am desperately unhappy about the dominance of those other groups in this Bill.  The wording of the Bill states that the welfare of the child is taken into consideration where practicable.  That term applies to the prospective children to be conceived from reproductive technology but, on page 60 of the general scheme of the Bill, head 22(7) refers to a future child who might be found to be infertile and that it is in the best interests of the child to remove their gametes, without their will or consent necessarily, in order that they can be genetic parents.  Genetic continuity for one group of children is seen as important, and their best interests is a term that is used and applied legally, but yet there is another group of children whose welfare is taken into consideration where practicable and their genetic discontinuity is not even a consideration.  That is so clearly discriminatory that the emperor has no clothes.  Can anybody see that?  That is clear discrimination.</p></speech>

This is a point to which I was alluding across the general references I made in my opening statement and the language of the Bill needs to be reconsidered to take account of the child across the age range, not just at the point of birth, but beyond that.  That has implications for support and advice services.  It has implications for raising awareness in society as a whole.  The reality is there and therefore we need to be careful to counterbalance the previous, overly powerful role of the clinic, the parent and the State.  It can be done.</p> <p>   We are coming to this late and for that reason, we have an opportunity to develop a model legislation in which we really take account of what the research is saying.  There are good examples here.  I have talked about the need to listen to the voices of people who have gone through this process because we have a lot to learn from those voices.  We should take that on board in terms of the supports and that feeds, to some extent, into the observations that were made here.  The language of the Bill is not sufficiently robust in terms of the child across the age range and the State support for the parents of that child, to guide the parents on the importance of openness and transparency and to support the parent-child dyad as they progress through life.  There is no doubt that there will be points at which tensions can arise and information can create difficulties and problems.  The likelihood is that, if we are thinking about those tensions at this stage, they can be handled rather better than if we are not thinking about them at all.</p></speech>

I, like Professor Hayes, as a member of the Commission on Assisted Reproduction, welcome the point we are now at.  I have been involved in this area for 30 years as a researcher, writer and academic.  I have a master's degree and PhD in the law relating to assisted reproduction so I strongly welcome that we are finally at this stage of at least talking about introducing legislation.  I welcome the fact that this proposed Bill has been informed by the recommendations of the Commission on Assisted Reproduction because that was a lengthy process that took four years, with a multidisciplinary group, expertise, submissions and so on.  As it was a worthwhile exercise, I particularly welcome that the Bill has been informed by that in establishing a regulatory authority, independent inspections of clinics, national standards and international best practice.  All of those are crucial and the Bill broadly achieves the aims of clarity and certainty in relation to IVF and treatments of donor gametes.</p> <p>  There is still a lot of room for improvement in the current Bill.  Revisions in wording, language, terminology and all of the things the other witnesses have mentioned are necessary and I have expanded on those in my submission.</p><p>The major flaw of the Bill relates to surrogacy, and the flaw will result in continued travel for Irish people to go abroad for surrogacy to other jurisdictions because they will be unable to avail of the limited mechanism offered by the Bill.  The lack of clarity in respect of those children born in those circumstances is contrary to the best interests and rights of those children.  I urge that that part of the Bill, at least, be rectified.</p></speech>

From listening to them, I sense that no amount of tweaking will undo that perceived injustice.  I do not wish to put words in their mouths but rather clarify what I broadly understand their position to be.  </p> <p>  I did not hear them speak but I have read their comments.  Is it fair to state that they believe the benefit for infertile individuals or couples who want to have children outweighs the negative consequences?  Are the two speakers sitting in the middle broadly stating that we must go with it and that, therefore, it is a question of tweaking it as much as possible to take account of their concerns?  Is it the case that, broadly speaking, they are in line with the idea that, given this is happening already, it needs to be allowed to happen as opposed to being publicly discouraged?  Am I in the ballpark of fairly understanding our guests' positions?</p></speech>

I do not think it is a matter of tweaking anything.  Rather, considerable work needs to be done to address the reality of the contemporary AHR in Ireland.  Some of the issues that have been raised are critical issues that need to be considered, and this is the opportunity to consider them.  It is beyond tweaking.  There is a power issue that must be taken into account, and the child is the central element that we need to consider.  Historically, that has not been the case, for which there are many reasons, but we have an opportunity now.  There are issues of language and directionality of points, and commitments that are long term rather than short term.</p></speech>

There are complicated situations that can definitely be resolved by assisted human reproduction, and there are needs met that can certainly be legitimised.  I do not hold the particularly strong view on genetic origin being predominant, in that sense, that the Senator holds.</p></speech>

In one instance, we are asking for State funding to try, as much as possible, to help people become a genetic parent, and it is considered a huge blow if intending parents have to use a donor.  To return to Head 22(7), if a future child might become infertile, there is an effort to help those children become genetic parents with State funding.  In the case of another group of people, there is a complete disregard for their genetic kinship, which is severed as a means to an end.  That is discrimination.  One group of people's genetic continuity is valued and advanced with State funding at the expense of the other.  There is no way that is not the case.  If genetic continuity does not matter for one group, perhaps it does not matter for the other.  If it matters for one group, it should matter for the other.  As a result, people say it is happening anyway, that we have to become modern and liberal, and that we must put laws in place to limit the kind of damage that can take place.  The laws and ethics, therefore, are made on the hoof.</p></speech>

I have problems with it from an ethical point of view.  If I understand it correctly, however, nobody is being deprived of the opportunity to pass on his or her genes.  The question is whether one is to be allowed to know the person whose genes have been passed on?  Are they not two different matters?  If what Dr. Rose is talking about is a provision that will allow genetic intervention to ensure a future child may be able to pass on his or her genes, that is a different right to the right to know whose genes one has.</p></speech>

The implication is that all we want is information.  As a group, some people will not want anything, in the same way that some women do not want the right to vote.  As a group, however, we need to be given the whole range of rights and we can access which ones we choose.  Meeting a genetic parent at 18 and finding out that one has 20, 30 or maybe 200 half-siblings in different families and maybe in different countries around the world hands a significant burden on to that next generation to deal with in adulthood, which is the kind of discrimination I am talking about.  There is an absolute empathy for people who want to become genetic parents or who become genetic parents, and they are represented at committees and in so many ways they are so powerful.  For that next generation, however, the real, complex issues that they are handed as a means to an end for another group and another generation is not properly understood and we are not appropriately protected or represented in these kinds of environments.</p></speech>

Professor Hayes will know from psychology that one cannot even interview a child or do any experiment on him or her, even if it just a verbal interaction or questionnaire, without seriously scrutinising the ethical implications of any harm.  The case we are discussing, however, was an experiment that involves children, but I do not see any assessment of harm.  As was stated, we are dealing with what is here and now.  What is here and now may be harmful, however.  The train has come in and we are saying we need to legislate in order that it can carry on its journey, but we are not seriously scrutinising what is on board the train or where it came from.  We know the origins, however, and we were told an amusing anecdote on RT&Eacute;'s "Vogue: Going it Alone".  A woman, namely, a fertility counsellor rather than a doctor or a scientist, brought sperm from England through customs in Dublin Port and registered it as cattle sperm because there was no other category for it.  It is meant to be amusing that it is just sperm, but I am just one sperm and one egg.  We all are, and we are all donated.  That cannot be separated.  I understand we have to grasp what is here and now but before that, we need to examine all the various elements, not least the financial element.</p> <p>  On language, as Professor Hayes said, the term "donor" is used but it is a parent.  One cannot write about donors, eggs and gametes as if they are just bits of tissue.  They are the pieces that make a human being.  They are not donated blood or just a tissue.  They are the only elements in the nucleus of those two cells and they are me.  I do not want to be called a gamete or a property.  One can see in the brochures of the clinics the word "property".  If I present to buy an egg from a woman down the road or from Ukraine, I sign to the effect that the egg is now my property, which is the language that is used.  It is a human being that is being transferred as a commodity.  It was the same problem in Ireland with adoptions, which we talked about as being commodified.  We are doing the same in this case and we are saying it is okay.  All our discussion has been about this commodity, but it is a human life.  One must look a child in the eyes and say: "This is you and this is your life."  No matter how much we legislate with this language, none of it acknowledges the harm and the human emotional impact of all of this.  Identity is not just a bit of paper.  Rather, it is fragile and can be easily damaged.</p><p> There is a need to go back to the beginning, I am afraid, to look at the practice and the money involved.  Kidneys and blood are donated.  Donating a kidney can involve expenses but there is no compensation for that and that is for a reason.  The incentive is removed.  We have all of these international conventions, such as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, that forbid financial gain from the sale of body parts.  How does that fit in?  There is also the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine which clearly states that biomedicine brings great hope but also poses a major threat.  That convention also forbids the sale of body parts for financial gain or advantage.  I do not see any acknowledgement of that here.</p></speech>

The co-founder of the organisation, Ms Helen Browne, was part of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction.  She was unable to have a child unfortunately.  We are dealing with the situation as it is.  People who come to our meetings are considering different options to see how they will deal with them.  As an organisation we did the first family conversations event concerned with starting a conversation with our children.  Ours is a small organisation with little funding that relies on volunteers.  Only one person works part time for us.  We are trying to do the best we can to provide what support we can.</p> <p>  I take on board what everybody has said here today.  I am not claiming to be an expert.  Dr. Rose has her viewpoint and there are also psychological and legal aspects.  There was commodification in the adoption process some decades ago.  Perhaps we can learn from that when the legislation is being drawn up.  Is the process in Ireland and England when a child is adopted dealt with in an appropriate way in respect of the child coming to terms with that situation?  I am trying to understand.  Is there something we can do?  My feeling about all of this is that there is a major element of emotion regardless of whether we are referring to donor conception or adoption.  A couple who adopted a child ten years ago may also have to deal with these issues as the child grows up.  Is there anything we might learn from that situation?</p></speech>

I am going to move on but we can come back to these issues.  Will Professor Madden outline the current situation in respect of surrogacy in Ireland, what this Bill proposes and what she feels should be the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-19a.300" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Deirdre Madden" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121900002#L00700"><p>The situation with surrogacy in Ireland is that we do not have any legislation which deals with it.  It is a complete legal limbo for couples.  As I understand the matter, Irish clinics do not generally provide surrogacy services.  There were one or two cases in the past.  One, the MR &amp;amp; Anor <i>v</i>. An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors case, ended up before the Supreme Court a few years ago.  That was about a birth registration issue.  As a result, most couples who seek surrogacy go abroad to avail of the service.  The issue then arises as to how those couples can regularise their legal relationship with their children when they bring them back to this jurisdiction.  Some countries are easier in that regard than others.  Couples I have spoken to in Ireland who have gone to the United States, to California for example, have found it fairly easy to avail of the legal process there because they are regarded and registered as the legal parents of the child.  The couple goes to the Irish embassy, obtains travel documentation and an Irish passport for the child and then they can bring him or her back here.  The process is fairly easy for them.  For others who go to other parts of the world, such as India, until relatively recently at least, the Ukraine, Mexico, Nepal and places like that, the process can be more difficult because there can be a conflict of laws problem.<br/><br/>Irish law takes the view that the woman who gives birth to the child is the legal mother and must be registered, whereas in some jurisdictions where surrogacy is allowed it is not the birth mother who is regarded as the legal mother but the intended mother.  Those are two different conflicting legal frameworks and the problem then arises as to what happens in that clash.  Who is the legal mother?  There have been examples in English case law involving children born in other jurisdictions where that conflict of laws problem has arisen.  In the Ukraine, for example, the intended parents would be regarded as the legal parents but in the UK the surrogate mother would be regarded as the legal parent.  There have been difficulties in that context with getting travel documentation and passports, bringing the child back into the jurisdiction and going through a court procedure to regulation the situation.<br/><br/>That is an extremely stressful and anxiety-ridden time for parents and probably not in the best interests of the child.  I say that without the expertise of Professor Hayes.  That is the situation we are in now.  This Bill proposes a situation where there would be pre-authorisation of the surrogacy arrangement by the regulatory authority in Ireland but the legal transfer of parentage would not take place until between six weeks and six months after the child's birth.  That goes back to the point I was making earlier about that not being in best interests of the child.  From my perspective, that transfer of parentage should take place before the child is born so that there is legal certainty from the moment of birth.  That child might need medical intervention or surgery but without that transfer, the intended parents looking after that child will not be able to sign a consent form.  The Bill should definitely address those issues as well as the issue of bringing children back into the jurisdiction who are born to Irish parents abroad and it should regularise their legal relationship.</p></speech>

There has been quite a lot of emphasis on the importance of the people who are the intended parents being genetic parents.  All of a sudden that is important but for the donor offspring it does not really matter.  This is a very interesting change in emphasis.  In the case of surrogacy where there is IVF treatment, often the surrogate mother can, by accident, become the genetic parent so there is a need to legislate to have testing of that child to check whether he or she was conceived from the surrogacy of a donor egg.  When there is discussion about the best interests of the child, I am fascinated to hear about stress for the child.  I refer to things such as separation from the mother who carried that child.  That matter has not yet been discussed.<br/><br/>When we look at adoption, for example, we have information from Nancy Verrier in <i>The Primal Wound</i>on the significance of the child being removed from the mother.  She is only person the child has known during gestation, and that includes things such as the food eaten by the mother and the sounds and the music listened to by the mother.  When a child is born - and I know this from experience - the only person that child really wants is the mother who gave birth to him or her.  This provides an example of the sheer lack of understanding about the types of emotional impacts for those children produced that there is no discussion at all yet about the stress caused to a child by being separated at birth - in the car park perhaps or wherever it is legally - through surrogacy.  I refer to the fragmentation of the sense of motherhood.</p></speech>

Senator Mullen used the word "tweaking".  There are some wording issues that would help to improve the Bill, and perhaps areas such as the welfare of the child and consent should be looked at again.

Professor Madden referred to the surrogacy frameworks in other jurisdictions, and I note that she is critical of the British system and our apparent eagerness to adopt it.  I have said before that if something is being done wrong across the water we immediately want to copy it.  Are there frameworks in countries which have got it right and which are fair to couples who need the help, and indeed to the children?</p> <p>  Dr. Rose spoke about the potential damage to mothers, but is Professor Madden saying that the research she has consulted does not bear that out?  </p></speech>

Professor Madden also referenced the avoidance of potential exploitation, which we must all be concerned about.  It is a very serious issue, which I raised when this Bill was considered first.  How can this be achieved?  Will it take a legal agreement?  Can it be achieved?  Is it optimal to build it into the legislation, or would it be preferable to produce guidelines that might ensure proper procedures?  The difficulty is obvious when people travel outside of Ireland.  As Professor Madden has said, we then have to marry two different sets of laws.  As a committee and as legislators we clearly do not want to do something that will somehow inadvertently lead to exploitation.  We need to have those safeguards in place.  I am interested in the views of the witness, although we may not have time to discuss this now as it is a bit complicated.  If that is the case, she could send us some of the research.</p> <p>  Ms Keegan referred to the upper age limit of 47 as being problematic.  Does she have an upper age limit in mind?  Should a limit apply?  I am interested in her view.  She also mentioned that most surrogacy takes place abroad.  Are there any figures on that?  I am aware that this area is not highly regulated.  Perhaps the witness could hold off on answering and I will ask all of my questions together if that is okay.  Do we have any idea of the percentage breakdown of surrogacies abroad?  </p> <p>  Dr. Hayes and Ms Keegan provided conflicting views in their submissions.  Dr. Hayes said that a birth by surrogacy certificate should be issued, while Ms Keegan said that people should not be given information they do not necessarily need or will want to look for.  Can each witness comment on the other's viewpoint, in order to ascertain the best arrangement?  It is tricky.  In one respect it is correct to say that it is information that people have not looked for, but that does not mean that they do not have a right to it.  How do we marry those two viewpoints?  </p> <p>  Dr. Rose spoke about her intention to carry out "damage limitation".  We received a submission from the Iona Institute, co-authored by Dr. Rose, in which questions are raised about family structures.  I fully support the rights of same-sex couples to adopt and raise children.  Does Dr. Rose see the exclusion of same-sex couples as being part of that damage limitation exercise?  Does she have a view on that?  It would be very interesting for us to know that.  </p> <p>  Ms O'Friel, in her submission, referred to a TV3 documentary and made reference to "the industry".  I am aware that she studied medicine for two years, although she is obviously not a doctor.  Does she have any academic evidence?  She referred to industry advertisements and a TV3 documentary, but does she have any empirical or academic evidence to back up her assertions?  I would be grateful if she could provide us with some of that evidence here, and perhaps she can send us a comprehensive list afterwards.  We have a huge amount of reading, consideration and discussion to do on this legislation, and there will not be an easy way to do that.  We have to get right in and read all of the available academic research and expert evidence.</p></speech>

There certainly are better frameworks out there, and I have referred to some of them in my submission.  California and New Hampshire are those which are most easily accessible in terms of language, but also in terms of the clarity achieved.  The Commission on Assisted Reproduction recommended that a child born through surrogacy should be presumed to be that of the intended parents.  The frameworks I refer to as better frameworks would adopt that model.  They recognise the parentage of the intended parents before birth to make sure there is no ambiguity from the moment of birth and to avoid any legal uncertainty.  That process of recognising legal parentage of intended parents can be achieved by a judicial process during the pregnancy, or before the pregnancy commences, to ensure that everyone is appropriately screened and counselled and has availed of independent legal advice so that all concerned know the relationships they are going to engage in and to ensure the transfer of parentage occurs at that earlier time.  That, in my view, would lead to a much better outcome for the child, and would be a much better framework.</p></speech>

Access to the law is expensive, and if we are to take this approach it will involve a very time-limited process.  I am only teasing this out, but it might be better if the transfer of parentage took place before conception.  There would not be a ticking clock or time pressure if that was the case.</p></speech>

It would ensure that the judge or the person scrutinising the process can be satisfied that the surrogate mother undertaking this task has been appropriately screened, knows what the process involves and is aware that she will be relinquishing the child after birth.  It would also ensure that the judge is satisfied that all statutory criteria are met before the pregnancy is in existence, so that if there is any doubt or any concern about the surrogate's appropriateness for the role, there is time to remedy it.</p> <p>  The Bill we are discussing already involves a judicial transfer of parentage, so there is already a cost involved.</p><p>It is just a matter of timing.  One either does it before conception, before birth or after birth.  There is still the judicial transfer so the cost will remain the same.  It does not necessarily have to be complicated litigation.  It is a quite straightforward court application that should not necessarily cost much money, but access to courts is certainly not cheap.  That is my response to the Deputy's first question.</p><p> The second question was about the issue of harm.  I do not claim to be an expert in this area.  I read the studies and research from a legal perspective so perhaps Professor Hayes is best placed to answer those questions.  However, from my understanding of the studies and research I have read, there is no demonstrated evidence of harm to children born as a result of assisted reproduction or surrogacy.  I must also state that in the studies to date in the case of surrogacy, for example, the children are still probably in adolescence and we do not know whether those studies will show the same effects when the children reach adulthood and later life.  As longitudinal studies-----</p></speech>

The children are now in adolescence and do not demonstrate any negative effects thus far.  However, we must continue.  I echo Professor Hayes's point about the necessity to have ongoing research in longitudinal studies to make sure that this remains the case.</p> <p>  The last point mentioned by the Deputy was about exploitation.  The issue that arises regarding exploitation, which we are rightly concerned about, is the potential for vulnerable women in poorer socio-economic climates to be used and exploited in this way.  There are two responses to that.  The first is that people go abroad to these jurisdictions to avail of surrogacy because the legal regimes there are more favourable to them and give them clearer legal rights to their children.  That is probably the primary reason they go abroad.  They do not wish to go through the stress of litigation in their own jurisdiction.  In light of that, the preferable approach to avoid exploitation would be to put surrogacy on a proper footing here so there is no incentive for people to go abroad.  If it is regulated properly here with proper safeguards, screening, counselling, informed consent and the like, there would be no need for Irish people to go abroad.</p> <p>  Obviously, the potential for exploitation will remain.  The Hague Convention is currently considering the possibility of putting an international convention in place to reduce the possibility of exploitation in places such as India, Nepal and Mexico but we are not yet at the point of having an international convention.  However, that is possibly the only way we will be able to avoid exploitation on a global scale in the future.  As to why people go abroad, it is because they want the security of knowing-----</p></speech>

She asked if we have numbers regarding surrogacy.  I do not have such numbers.  There is a surrogacy group that is quite active in NUSIG, but I do not believe there are numbers available unless somebody else has information.  There are specific groups that are campaigning on and dealing with surrogacy in the Republic of Ireland and they would be better placed in terms of providing a patient voice regarding surrogacy and their issues.  I can represent some of their issues but they might be better placed to give an idea of the numbers.  There is obviously a legal-----</p></speech>

Basically, where people are considering opting for surrogacy the bulk of that is foreign based.  There have been certain situations where there has been domestic surrogacy but that has probably been very rare over the last ten or 20 years.  However, I do not have the numbers and I do not know if anybody else has them.</p> <p>  Regarding the age limit, we are not clinicians.  We are just representing the patient voice and we would probably defer to what the clinicians say.  I have looked at the position in other countries in Europe and in some countries 50 years of age is applied as the age break in terms of when a woman can have treatment.  In the majority of cases it is probably before 47 years of age, but I believe Dr. John Kennedy from Sims IVF said last February that when reviewing files there were 160 cases over a number of years where the women may have been over 47 years of age.  Obviously, it is the clinician's viewpoint as to whether that is possible or whether it puts the child or the mother at risk.</p></speech>

This is something that was mentioned by a number of clinicians back in February.  One of the matters that was mentioned was the circumstance in which somebody who reaches 18 years of age is presented with a birth certificate which states that he or she was donor conceived.  Two issues arise.  First, the person might not have been told that and in certain circumstances, it could be a great shock.  The second issue is that the person might be aware that he or she was donor conceived but may not necessarily want that fact to appear on his or her birth certificate.  They are two different circumstances.  I do not know if it is proposed under the Children and Family Relationships Act that two birth certificates would be available for that person.  Perhaps that matter could be clarified.  In one case, that fact would be included on the birth certificate if the person wished, or it would not be included where the person does not wish it to be.  I am not sure what the position is in that regard.  On reaching 18 years of age, the person might not want it or might not be aware of it so it is probably dangerous to include it without due consideration.</p></speech>

There was frustration with the type of research that was going ahead, such as Susan Golombok's.  It validated, for example, parents being given a choice as to whether they tell their children that they are donor conceived and often asked the parents how the children were doing and then had results that reported the children were doing fine.  I had a great sense of frustration about that which led me to my PhD.  There is a list in the information I provided to the committee of proactive donor offspring around the world.  They are the people one needs to consult rather than people like Susan Golombok in terms of understanding the long-term implications because it is when we are adults that finding out that one has 30 or 40 half-brothers and sisters has a major impact on one's identity.  That is when one is grappling with the real stuff.  I wished to draw the committee's attention to those proactive donor offspring and the kind of things they have had to set up in their own time and with their own funding.

What is seen as reproductive rights or gay reproductive rights is, in this instance, a right to have a genetic child who is somebody else's.  If there is a reproductive right, there is a duty to provide that and to provide gametes.  I do not believe there is a duty to provide a child to anybody who is infertile.  I do not believe that is a duty our society owes those people.  We need to come back to base and think about it.</p><p>If people want to adopt a child, they are screened.  A child is not made available just because they want one.  Children are only removed from a genetic family as a last resort for child protection.  The fact that a group of people are waiting and want to have a child does not create supply; demand does not create supply in the case of adoption.  People may want to have a child through donor conception, regardless of whether they are gay.  That is the issue at hand in considering the best interests of the child.  It is the level of identity fragmentation that can be facilitated, funded and promoted on behalf of the groups of people who want to have a child.  It is not a homophobic argument.  The difficulty is that when we say these practices are inherently flawed, people think it is a homophobic argument.  There are plenty of gay people who will say they do not support surrogacy.</p></speech>

I was simply saying that if a situation arose where a surrogacy certificate would be issued for a child, in my view, we should call it a birth certificate.  We should limit the extent to which children are made different by the processes or procedures we use.  It is true across the entire process.</p> <p>  I will respond to the research evidence about children.  It is true that, historically, research in this field has tended to depend on parental reports initially.  However, more recent and contemporary research has engaged directly with children.  By necessity, it has been with children who know that they were conceived in this way, as that is the route of access.  There are other efforts being made to access the broader population, but it is very difficult to envisage how that might be done.  Professor Susan Golombok's work is frequently referred to because it stands up to scrutiny.  As Professor Madden points out, the evidence on child outcomes and mother-child and broader parent-child engagement has been, broadly, comparable for surrogacy children, donor children and children conceived normally.  There are systematic reviews where aggregate data have been brought together and generally the evidence of harm or distress is not emerging.</p></speech>

It is clear from this session how complex and varied are the issues we must consider.  I certainly suggest it could be a good idea to devote some time to looking at research and what it states as a key aspect that should be considered discretely.  That said, we must be conscious that research is not everything because it is emergent or incomplete.  It is an indicator of the possible effects on people, but it does not state if their rights are breached in principle.  Not being able to demonstrate positive or negative effects does not dispose of all of the issues.  A person's rights may be breached, but it may be impossible to demonstrate the suffering of harm.  That does not make it okay to breach those rights.  We must look at the research, but as Churchill famously said about scientists, they should be on tap but not on top.  There are other issues, apart from what research shows in the area.</p> <p>  On the subject of surrogacy, the delegates should contradict me if I am wrong on any of these issues as I do not hold myself to have specialist knowledge.  I understand Sweden is considering banning altruistic, as well as commercial, surrogacy and that there are quite a few countries that ban surrogacy.  It is not the case that the entire civilised world is moving towards recognition that because some individuals or couples engage in or avail of this practice, or have a deeply personal need to avail of it, the only direction in which public policy can move is permitting the practice.  I presume I am correct and that it is not settled ground of consensus.  It is a very divisive issue. </p> <p>  If I am correct about what I understand to be the case in Sweden, is it because of cases such as that described by Professor Madden?  If I understand it correctly, she has indicated that to prevent misunderstandings, heartbreak and problems, it should be clearly understood - ideally before conception but certainly as soon as possible and before birth - that the genetic or "commissioning" parents will have the child.  It is not a phrase I like.  This means that if the birth mother bonds with her child or the child bonds with the mother, it will not be reckoned in the final analysis.  It is a consequence of wanting to regulate surrogacy in a way that is effective.  It is a perverse outcome, about which many people would be concerned.  It seems to go against our deepest instinct. where a birth mother is bonding with her child, that some prior contractual arrangement would take precedence.  That is why the Supreme Court made its decision and overturned the High Court's decision, but it is just my opinion.  Is it not the inevitable consequence that one must make these Solomon-like decisions?  It is a case of once we practice to conceive, as opposed to deceive, which is where we go with surrogacy.</p> <p>  In the light of this, it comes down to whether people think surrogacy is good on balance.  Should we not be considering, whether we legalise or regulate it, if there ought to be a public policy campaign to discourage it on the basis of rights being violated as argued by our guests, Dr. Rose and Ms O'Friel?  It is, I presume, conceivable, if those present pardon the pun, that one could publicly discourage something through whatever means the State uses such as advertising or counselling.  In other words, the message would clearly be sent that this is not something that ideally should be done, that there are other and better ways to try to ease the pain of infertility and so on.  As it involves a fundamental violation of the rights of the child, it should not really happen at all.  If we were to regulate it, we would be recognising the fact that we could not control and would not seek to control people's travel to other jurisdictions to avail of very different legal arrangements.  We do not criminalise smoking, but we permit it.  However, we do everything we can to discourage people from engaging in the practice, including having rules for packaging and limits on advertising, etc.</p><p>Would the witnesses accept that, in principle, this is something that we ought to discourage given that, without trying to put words in people's mouths, the issue of rights being violated has not been contested here, if I understand it correctly?</p></speech>

Is that really the case?  Is not a big aspect of this the financial and social vulnerability of people in developing world countries in this area?  There are countries in the western world where this is legal but - my understanding is and I could be wrong on this - it is not to those countries people are going.  This issue is inextricably connected with poverty, financial vulnerability and disadvantage.  Is it really correct to say that the primary reason is the more favourable legal regimes or whether it is really separable from the financial vulnerability of people?  Those are my questions on the subject of surrogacy.  I will leave it at that.  I have other questions abut birth certificates and so on but I will hold them for the moment.</p></speech>

I referred to my court case and I provided a list of court cases that donor offspring have brought and are bringing forward around the world.  Research such as that of Susan Golombok did not forewarn of serious human rights violations that have been found now in our favour in terms of the right to know one's identity.  In Germany, children now have the right to know information about their genetic donor parents throughout their lives and anonymity is overturned retrospectively.  I refer to Narelle's law in Victoria.  It is all based on interviewing adults or children and saying everybody is fine.  The are long-term complexities, as in adoption and the stolen generations in Australia.  Those children might be raised in happy loving families but there are consequences for adults in terms of integrating their identify, as to whether they want to know who their genetic family is or what their ethnicity is.  I was raised Jewish and then that was taken away.  Other donor offspring are suddenly discovering they are Jewish when they are in the 50s or 60s.  These kinds of lived realities and complexities are not appropriately understood.  The only real appropriate research that exists is in those other groups of people who have had that separation and loss, for example, through adoption or the Australian stolen generations.  Those are the roots to which we need to turn.  While this is a new notion - it is a social experiment - being human is not something new.  Our human response to not knowing our genetic roots or kin has been well documented for thousands of years.  Unfortunately, there is the notion that it is happening anyway so we have to legislate for it and come up with the least restrictive, most liberal option.  The Senator is exactly right.  I do not believe that is the right way to approach this practice.</p></speech>

It might not be appropriate for me to say this but I suggest she might be invited to give evidence before the committee on her methodology and the types of studies she has carried out over many years.</p> <p>  Regarding the ban on surrogacy in some jurisdictions, the Senator is correct, this is not a universally accepted practice.  I hope I have never suggested that is the case.  It is prohibited in a number of jurisdictions for policy reasons.  My view on that is that when one considers the evidence in any jurisdiction where surrogacy has been prohibited, it has not worked.  It has either pushed surrogacy underground with no protection for anybody or it has forced people to go abroad to engage in surrogacy elsewhere and that raises the risks of exploitation the Senator mentioned.  The evidence shows that in any country where surrogacy is prohibited people in that jurisdiction still avail of surrogacy outside the national boundaries of that jurisdiction.  </p></speech>

We should not put our heads in the sand and say surrogacy is not happening.  Surrogacy is happening in Ireland.  It is happening by people going abroad and trying to bring their children back.  That is not an optimal situation.  We should face the facts that people are going to engage in this practice and we should regularise it and make sure the rights and interests of everybody are protected.</p> <p>  The Senator also referred to the birth mother bonding with the child and so on.  I am not an expert in that area.  I am here as a legal expert.  However, I know it exceptionally rare for a surrogate mother to want to keep the child after birth.  In the studies that have been done, it is estimated that the birth mother changes her mind and wants to retain custody of the child after birth in only 1% of surrogacy cases.  That is because surrogate mothers, particularly where they are not genetically related to the child, do not feel and never consider the child to be theirs.  They consider they are carrying a child for another couple and, therefore, they never feel that bond, that they want to be recognised as the legal mother, or that they want to have custody of the child because they feel it to be somebody else's child.  Therefore, it is exceptionally rare for a surrogate mother to want to keep the child after birth.  It can happen but it only happens in 1% of cases.</p> <p>  The Senator asked whether people go abroad, as I suggested, to avail of a more favourable legal regime.  That is my understanding.  He said perhaps it is because of cost reasons.  I have no evidence of that.  My evidence is that people go abroad because of the certainty and predictability of the outcome of the surrogacy arrangement, which is that they will be recognised as the legal parents of their child.</p></speech>

Far from that being a statement, it was a question.  My first question is regarding Professor Madden's response to what I asked about Sweden.  Is it her understanding also that they are moving in a more conservative direction, in that there are moves to ban even altruistic surrogacy and why might that be the case?  Second, the other issue I asked her was whether there ought to be a policy of discouragement.  If she thinks there are downsides to this for children, that might influence her view on how we would go forward in terms of whether we regulate this practice on the basis that is happening anyway.  If she thinks it ought not to be happening, would she agree that perhaps one might come to different public policy choices?</p></speech>

My response to that is that it will not work.  People will still engage in surrogacy but they will engage in international surrogacy arrangements rather than domestic surrogacy arrangements.</p> <p>  Regarding whether there should be a policy of discouraging surrogacy, I do not believe there should be.  I do not see any evidence of harm arising from surrogacy in the research I have been carrying out over the past 30 years.  There is no evidence of harm in the studies that have been done of surrogate mothers, of intended parents or of children.  It has been shown to be a positive way of creating and helping to build families for people who otherwise cannot do that.  I do not see any reason to discourage it.</p></speech>

The exchange has been very informative and helpful.  In all of this we should be mindful that we had a referendum for civil marriage equality in recent years.  For many people, it redefined what it meant to be Irish, it recognised there is no single proposition for family formation and it also recognised that family formation is diverse.</p><p>This was illustrated when children of heterosexual lone parents tore down posters from the lamp posts which told us that every child deserved a mother and a father.  Every week, I and others receive representations from same-sex parents, one of whom has no legal connection to their child.  The knock-on effects are many, particularly in areas such as health, and they lead to huge anxieties.</p><p> Subhead 3 in the general scheme, under provision of information, states that each intending parent must have also received counselling from a genetic counsellor.  Where there are two intending parents involved the counselling should be offered to them individually, jointly or both, depending on the couple's preferences.  Do our guests have anything to say about whether this counselling should be offered beforehand, in addition to during and afterwards?

This type of parenting is complex and includes complexities which we do not necessarily have in the more natural types of conception, where such types of third party interventions tend not to be involved.  It is a good idea to have counselling but it should be from bodies that do not have a conflict of interest in providing the service.  It needs to be for donors, too, and there needs to be a neutral body that understands the significance of the long-term complexities that result, in order to provide informed consent.  The only way they can do that is by being in contact with adults around the world who are affected by these practices.  How could we otherwise know what are the long-term implications?

There are balances to be achieved in the area of costs but the State should contribute at some level if it is regulating for the general area.</p> <p>  The need to carry out studies in addition to those carried out on people up to age 14 was mentioned.  This is a longitudinal study on children from birth onwards.  The longitudinal commitment is necessary to enable us to get to know about the situation in Ireland and to identify the difficulties, as well as the positives.  The longitudinal study was recommended by the commission on assisted human reproduction.  It is very important that our research looks at everything, both the things that are positive and those that have been negative or stressful.  The more research we have, the greater understanding we will have.</p> <p>  I have no objection to rigorous, deep research which takes account of the work of the witnesses here today and that of other bodies but the issue is to get it onto the agenda via this Bill.  We are seeking evidence from people contributing to the Bill and that is wonderful.  In my experience, research that reveals areas of distress, identity difficulties and questions of belonging points to the absence of openness in the broader context.  More research can give us insight and the more we have the better.  There is not a huge field for this but where research has been done with surrogate mothers it indicates no psychopathology.  As Professor Madden pointed out, instances of bonding issues are also very rare.</p></speech>

I hope we can take on some of their recommendations as they are experts in this field.  It is easy for those of us who have children not to take into account people who get married in a same-sex relationship, or otherwise cannot have children.  There is a certain amount of ignorance in this area but, as one reads more about it and meets people who have used surrogacy services abroad, one learns more about the issues.  I recently met a gentleman who is married to another man who has a couple of children through a surrogate and I was struck by how lucky the children were to be brought up in the environment they were in.  I consider myself a rampant liberal but my inherent bias sometimes kicks in.  However, when I listen to experts such as those before us today, I become more personally comfortable with the issue.</p><p>It is a new area.</p><p> On Professor Hayes's point, it is so important that we have longitudinal data based on the views of experts, be they on the top or the bottom.  It does not matter where they are.  Their position is irrelevant to me but I firmly believe in using proper scientific evidence, not anecdotal evidence, when making decisions.</p><p> When late to the table, as with most things in Ireland, we have the benefit of knowing what occurs in other jurisdictions.  I am a community pharmacist by profession.  I have dealt with many families in the past 15 years.  The trend has really kicked off in Ireland.  I have noted the desperation, the travel to Greece and the complexities associated with getting and translating prescriptions from other countries and getting relevant drugs.  There is considerable work done by the medical profession and pharmacists to assist people on their journey.  I agree with Professor Madden that if the activity is not regulated, it will go underground and cause problems in the future.</p><p> Senator Warfield said that when one parent in a same-sex marriage is the only one with a legal connection to the offspring, it is of great concern to the parent who is not genetically related to the child if something happens to the legally connected individual.  Could the witnesses elaborate on some of their experiences in that regard?</p><p> I do not believe I would ever be able to have a child for somebody who just could not do so.  It is the greatest gift.  With regard to the 1% who do not want to give the baby to the genetic parents, does that happen in the regulated sphere of the unregulated sphere?  Could that be clarified?  If it is in the unregulated sphere, it should be possible to make improvements.</p><p> It is very interesting to learn that the evidence indicates no psychopathology.  That is really important.  This is the kind of point about which normal people are concerned.  I refer to the knock-on effects for children in the future.  Could some of these points be addressed?  As a member of the Government party, I will take all the experts' information on board and feed it back to the Minister so we can hopefully introduce a Bill that is fit for purpose and leaves people with legal certainty.</p><p> This is a very personal and private matter for couples.  I thank those who have come here to tell their stories because they are of great value to the likes of me, who is fairly ignorant about this whole area.</p></speech>

The Deputy gave the example of a same-sex couple where one is genetically the father of the child and the other does not have any legal relationship to the child.  This also happens with heterosexual couples; it is not just with same-sex couples.  If a couple goes abroad for surrogacy, the genetic father can come back and apply to be recognised as the legal guardian of the child but his wife, who is raising the child as her own, does not have that right even though she is the genetic mother.  The father, as genetic father, has the right to be a legal guardian but his wife does not have the right, as genetic mother, to be legal guardian.  Under the Children and Family Relationships Act, she can, after two years and having lived with the guardian, apply for recognition of her role.  During the two-year period, one must ask whether she could sign a medical consent form for the child?  Could she apply for a passport for the child?  If the couple were to separate or divorce, would she have any right of access to the child, whom she would have raised as her own?  It is not just in respect of same-sex couples that the problem arises.  It is crucial that we address that issue.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell mentioned the 1% statistic that I raised.  This figure is from the United States.  The other statistic I have is from the United Kingdom, where the surrogate mother changes her mind in about 4% of cases.  That statistic is from a study in 1998 by Professor Margaret Brazier, who was commissioned by the UK Parliament at that point to consider the issue of payments to surrogates.  As part of that study, she came up with a figure of approximately 4%.  That is probably out of date at this point.  I could certainly draw on expertise in the United Kingdom to find out the current figure but it is difficult.  The only way it can be ascertained is by examining the number of cases that have involved litigation and so on.  We can get some estimate but the circumstances in question are exceptionally rare.</p></speech>

We all want that.  I am not an expert, a professor or a doctor and may have only two years of medical training but I have enough of an understanding of embryology.  I come from a medical family dating back three generations.  Over the past three years, after my master's degree in psychology, I have been listening more than anything.  I note the sentiment of wanting others to be happy.  That is what Ireland is now working towards, thank goodness.  I, too, am supposedly a rampant liberal and want everybody to have equality and rights, including the right to be happy and the right to choose whoever one wants to love.  We are improving in all these areas, thankfully.  However, standing back, I see that all of us adults express the great sentiment of wanting everybody to have everything that will make them happy.  Among these sentiments are those concerning the really emotive subject of not being able to have a child.  I have been in a position where I believed I would never have a child.  It is the deepest pain one can possibly imagine.  It is probably not the deepest as other people have other pains but it is a profound pain.  One will do anything to solve the problem.  One will try to find a child to pick up off the street or from a bush; it is painful.  We can all relate to that emotion so I can therefore be very sympathetic to this cause.</p> <p>  The same applies to same-sex couples.  Who does not want the same for them?  Gay people have suffered horrifically, not only in Ireland.  Again, that arouses emotion in us because we want them to have happiness, equality and children, the most valuable thing.  All of that emotion can blur everything, however, and prevent us from moving our attention.  It is all very positive and we are not seeing with foresight, much further down the line, the group of children who may be happy living with somebody who is not related to them, because he or she is a very good and loving person, but who are still suffering.  Statistically, there will always be a large number who will be very happy with that situation but a substantial number will say that, no matter how loving their family is or how right their circumstances are ideologically, they are still suffering.  All of us adults who want the best for each other have to consider the group of children who are part of our ideology.  We should separate them out and listen to them.</p> <p>  For the past two years, I have been listening to adults talk.  I have been listening to clinics, which I cannot help regarding as very marketing oriented and commercially oriented.  There are many instances of it.  When the Deputy talks about listening to the experts, she should note that in our submission we refer to thousands of people have experienced what I describe.  We cannot discredit their views as evidence.  They are not professors or doctors but human beings who have lived a life.  This is not to say a gay parent could not be the best parent in the world, or the worst, because we are all human.  Whether gay or straight, one is not better than the other.  There are good parents in all situations.  In life, unfortunately, we cannot solve all these inequalities and difficulties.  I cannot say to someone that because that person is wonderful, kind and loving person, I will give him or her a child by going to find a donor.  A donor is a human being.  I cannot say I will find a woman to sacrifice her connection with the child so my partner can fulfil a longing.  I do not see an answer that will fulfil that longing and let us all be equal in the way described because, unfortunately, nature has not given us that ability.</p></speech>

Children can often have very positive experiences and while I have seen the witnesses' submissions and am aware of where they are coming from, I believe, and I think the scientific community understands, that the longitudinal study is the only way we can get hard data on this.  When Ms O'Friel talks about the effects of illegal surrogacy or <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements, they are in the unregulated environment.  Surely if it all happened in a cloak and dagger way, if someone went to America to get a donor egg or sperm, of course there would be collateral damage but in a regulated environment it seems logical that the outcomes will be better.  There will not be this vacuum-----</p></speech>

The only longitudinal studies that are really appropriate to making informed decisions are from adoption, from kinship groups that have been separated from their genetic families. <b></b>Otherwise, if there is no precautionary principle, a situation is set up where anything can be done to the next generation and scientific evidence of harm has to be accumulated after the event.  There is no precautionary principle in place with that type of logic.  I am arguing for a different approach based on the understanding of the best interests rather than the welfare of the child and on the research we already have, one where it is not just left it to the industry and its users to do whatever they want and then collect scientific collateral damage over the following decades.  Legislators have a duty of care to the most vulnerable people, namely, the children.  If the committee wants to bring in scientific evidence, it should bring in people like Pauline Ley.  There are professionals who have worked in the field of adoption, such as Alexina McWhinnie MBE, and Pauline Ley who was awarded an Order of Australia, particularly for transferring knowledge from adoption to donor conception.  The problem with the framework that is going ahead is that it does not transfer knowledge from adoption to donor conception.  It pretends to be a new and wonderful treatment and that we have to assess harm after the event.  I do not believe that is responsible. </p></speech>

It is important that we take a very honest look at whatever the research shows.  That is the principle that must always guide us.  We have to be conscious of issues of objectivity and test for it, understand what research is capable of showing us and its limitations because research does not always cover all of reality.  We need to know that.  It is an imperfect world.  My point was that there are things research cannot answer.  This raises a separate question as to whether there are breaches of rights involved here?  A person may be upset because his or her rights have been breached.  It may not be demonstrable that he or she has suffered harm but that does not mean that we should allow his or her rights to be breached.  That is why my question to Dr. Madden on whether she thinks surrogacy should be discouraged was important.  Is there something wrong at the heart of it that should be acknowledged?  Her answer to that question will determine an awful lot more of what she thinks about whether this area should be regulated in a way that permits surrogacy.We can also talk about regulation that actually bans surrogacy.  I made the point that I understand Sweden is moving in another direction which suggests that it knows something.  We often cite the Nordic countries as being very enlightened.  This is far from settled territory.  There are some very serious considerations to be reflected on.</p><p>To move away from surrogacy, as I said I would, an article in the <i>Law Society Ireland Gazette</i>, in discussing this scheme, referred to us sleepwalking into the possibility of large-scale human tragedy and emotional devastation as the Government legislates for birth certificate legal fictions in cases of assisted human reproduction.  I am in the hands of the experts here but do I understand that it is proposed that birth certificates will effectively be falsified to hide assisted human reproduction realities in that it will not be knowable from the birth certificate whether parents are natural genetic parents or donor parents?  I ask this in a neutral way but it seems that the answer to that question would raise many other questions.</p><p>In everything we do, we proceed on the basis of fact and truth.  This is related to the issue of whether people should be encouraged or required to be open with their children.  If we are talking about birth certificates in any way occluding reality, we have to be honest and say that while this process is intended to help some adults, it involves children either being confronted with very complicated realities, such as a birth certificate that refers to genetic parents, legal parents and birth mother, or being lied to by omission, by not being told something which they might have an interest in knowing.  I would be grateful for some clarification on what exactly is proposed in all of this but it seems to me on first principles that anything that hides or obscures should be considered a problem.  My thinking has evolved on this.  I hate the idea of children being confronted with complicated realities.  However, maybe we need to reflect on the complicated realities we are proposing to legalise and regulate because it seems there is no way of knowing what a child has an interest in knowing and when.</p><p>The parents may have a particular view, but if it deviates from what the truth actually is, there are many problematic issues.  Do people consider that it ought not to be a matter of telling their child what they think he or she needs to know when they think he or she needs to know it?  If this process is to be legally permitted, it implies a certain conferral of social approval on it.  That process may need to require that information is shared, by all means in an appropriate way, but that anything else is engaging in an untruthfulness that snowballs over time.  Having the aspiration that parents would be open with their children, as Professor Hayes mentioned, is a long way from securing children's rights in this area.  I am open to correction on the facts or a different opinion being offered.</p><p> In all this, people constantly talk about the well-being of the child.  Concern for the child's welfare always seems to be fundamentally predicated on adults getting what they want and that needs to be interrogated.</p><p> I refer to the requirement on donors to keep the register updated with relevant information, for example, if they are diagnosed with health conditions.  Is it respecting a child's right that the donor would be the one with this responsibility?  Is it possible that that would be more honoured in the breach than in the observance?  If we are to regulate this area of activity, the requirement ought to be on the providers of the service to maintain contact with donors and secure that information.  Those providers who make money out of this process should be responsible to the children, either in the present or the future, for gathering such information.  I wonder about the mentality behind this.  I do not think there is any reality to placing the onus on donors.  I think it is a joke.</p></speech>

I do not believe it should be.  I take issue with the notion - this is not the Senator's language but language used by somebody else in the room this morning - that infertile people are desperate people picking up children from under a bush.  That is not how I would depict people who have difficulties with childlessness.  I would depict people who enter into surrogacy arrangements as responsible, committed, caring adults who want to have a child of their own and who would be fit and loving parents if given the opportunity.  I would rather see them in that light rather than as desperate and willing to go to extraordinary lengths to have a child.  I do not believe surrogacy needs to be discouraged.  It should be properly regularised and protected.</p> <p>  In some ways we must acknowledge that birth certificates are already legal fictions.  We do not test every child born in this jurisdiction to find out whether the father is really his or her father before his name is entered on a birth certificate.</p></speech>

The language of the Bill needs to be more cognisant of the rights of the child.  In that way we should limit the extent to which we create procedures and processes marking them out as different.  Births now happen in a variety of ways, with a complexity of opportunities.</p> <p>  On the proposal of a surrogacy certificate, I did not have a difficulty with giving the information about surrogacy.  My problem was that it was not a birth certificate.  The proposal was that it should be a birth certificate by surrogacy or a birth certificate by donor with access to available information on the complexity of the parentage of a child in whatever way it happens.  While the field is new, the research that is accumulating indicates that hiding or obscuring information about identity complicates the developmental trajectory later in life.  For children, it increases the likelihood of difficulties and distress.  I would certainly propose that as much information as possible be made available to children.  Parents should be encouraged and the process and procedures may actually feed into that encouragement by their openness.</p> <p>  I pick the Senator up on one word he used.  He spoke about child well-being.  It is important to note that the Bill refers to welfare and not to well-being, which is a much more complex concept.  Many of us are trying to present the evidence of how we can maximise the child's well-being.</p> <p>  The Senator proposed a question on surrogacy to Professor Madden and he originally proposed it openly.  In information that is being made generally and not just for intending parents and potential surrogates we need to discuss the complexities of it.  We need to make the information available.  From the point of view of the action we are proposing, I do not think there is sufficient evidence to categorically discourage surrogacy.  I am certainly not against the research by experts of experience, who have much to contribute.</p></speech>

In the case of donor-assisted human reproduction there is a sundering of the relationship with the genetic parent.  I think many people will see the injustice of that one much more clearly.  There is so much focus these days on people knowing who they are through genetic research and all of that.  We do not need research to know there is controversy about that.  Arguably it is not a matter of what evidence shows but a matter of the value we, as a community, ascribe to the maintenance of the genetic and birth link.  If the community agrees that, all things considered, it is not a great idea to have a deprivation of the child's rights regardless of whether he or she suffers harm or suffers demonstrable harm which is a different consideration, there is an issue here.  Would Professor Hayes agree that at the very least there is a view that is legitimately held in society that there may be an injustice to the child here and that this is something that is put to people?  We need to accept that what the law says influences people.  There is a very statable case that there is a legal injustice here.</p><p>Therefore, I do not see how it can be reasonably excluded from any counselling setting.</p></speech>

Maybe I should wait until Professor Madden returns, depending on who wants to answer.  I asked some very specific questions about whether it should be that donors are required to keep the register updated or whether that obligation should be placed on providers of this service.</p></speech>

I am friends with a donor offspring in Denmark who is desperately trying to track down 64 families who have all used a donor who, after the event, has developed a fatal disease to which all those children are predisposed.  There is nothing that requires the clinics to inform those families of that situation and that donor offspring has spent ten years trying to track down those families.  Another friend in Australia has discovered that she has a predisposition to breast cancer, about which her donor informed the clinic.  She and her half-sister through donor conception developed breast cancer but they were never informed of this predisposition by the clinic, despite the donor having returned to the clinic and asked it to inform those affected.  It is very important that there be legal obligations.  The Bill says they "may provide" medical information and may update, but it is not mandatory.  Something is required in law which means that those people are accountable.  Where people such as my friend, Narelle, die of preventable genetic diseases because of someone's negligence, people should be held to account.</p></speech>

This is a very emotionally charged subject, as we know from previous discussions, from what we have read and what we see from the legal cases that have taken place.  Professor Madden made an interesting comment regarding judicial oversight at the initial stages, and it is something that is probably vital.  I am not so sure how it will operate smoothly and without too much administrative delay.  Like everyone else here, I have met and dealt with adoptive parents and adoptees, as well as donor families.</p> <p>  The question of health and the transmission of certain genetic weaknesses is something which the surrogate parent and the proposed parent should know about.  That is something that comes under the legal area.  I am not a legal practitioner, but we must recognise that we cannot legislate for everything.  It is not possible.  Neither should we put our own bias on legislation in any form.  We must do our best and do so impartially with all due regard for ethical, medical, and moral issues and try to arrive at the best decision.  It will take considerable time, we cannot achieve it overnight, but we need to do everything we can to get it right.  We are not infallible and neither is anyone else here or elsewhere, even though some might pretend they are.  We need to try our best to eliminate the possible obstacles, having regard to the many things that have happened in the past, and come to a conclusion as to the best way to proceed.  We must also consider two issues.  First is those who yearn and long for a child and who cannot have one for whatever reason.  Among them there are those who can and cannot afford different options.  Under the Constitution, we are expected to legislate in a way that evens that imbalance insofar as we can, without the deprivation of entitlements or rights on any side.  The information we have been given this morning is very important and we need to use it in drawing up or amending of the legislation, whatever the case may be.  There are many more opinions which must also be borne in mind, but as legislators we must take on board the information presented to us.  We do not know what expertise may emerge in 20 years.</p></speech>

The medical technology is changing all the time, as is our legislative process.  For instance, how does the same-sex marriage legislation affect our proposed legislation for assisted human reproduction?  There are much more complex marriage relationships which can lead to much more complex assisted human reproduction procedures which would be legal in Ireland.  Is it possible for one piece of legislation to cover all of this or should the legislation be broken up into different sections?  For instance, should there be legislation on surrogacy and one on other elements of assisted human reproduction rather than trying to put everything into the one Bill?</p></speech>

Therefore, there is no need to revisit that issue in terms of making the legislation compatible with same-sex marriage.</p> <p>  On the surrogacy legislation I already mentioned, I do not believe that it is necessary to have separate legislation on surrogacy.  I would rather see it in the same framework as other forms of assisted reproduction.  It is different in some respects but, in most cases and as this Bill envisages, it would be done by use of IVF because the surrogate mother is required not to use her own eggs and therefore it must be done by embryo transfer.  That IVF transfer will be permitted to be done only through IVF clinics which it is proposed to regulate through this Bill.  It makes more sense for it all to be done to ensure adherence to best international standards, best practice and so on, and subject to the supervision of the proposed regulatory authority.  The part on surrogacy needs to be revisited.  I have said many times that it is crucial that we get that right.  I do not imagine that floods of people will avail of surrogacy.  This is a small country and hundreds of thousands will not avail of surrogacy.  I believe that, currently in Ireland, between 50 and 100 couples have gone through surrogacy internationally and are trying to regularise their relationships with their children.  I may be incorrect about this figure as I am not in practice as a solicitor and that information might be available from family law practitioners.</p> <p>  The screening and health issues of surrogate mothers, intended parents and every adult involved in this process is necessary.  That is where the oversight of a regulator and the drafting of a code of practice and best standards will come into place.  That is how it is linked to a licence given to a clinic and it is ensured that they adhere to best practice and standards.  I think I have answered all the points.</p></speech>

I never mentioned anything about making people happy.  There was a suggestion that some of the recent referendums were based on providing happiness for adults.  I fundamentally believe in children being reared in a loving environment, however that family is made up.  People who adopt children or who have children are fundamental to our society.  As a medical professional for women and men who have undergone <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation and dealt with the heartbreak of multiple miscarriages and time ticking by, I would not like it to be put out as a view of the committee that anybody would abduct a child to satisfy his or her inner need.</p><p>It is about children's welfare, the family unit and protecting children in the future.  It is interesting that we have had a history of eldest daughters' children being passed off as the mother's, and various people who have purported to lead celibate lives having children and their identity not being known.  We have a long, hard history of hiding the identity of children within the family unit with no records.  As Professor Madden said, approximately one in ten children in the marital environment are not the child of the father in the relationship.  It is high time, as it often seems to be in the committee, that we stood back and accepted the reality of what is going on.  Our job is not to legislate for happiness but rather to legislate to ensure people, that is, children and families, are protected.  We should have sympathy for people's situations that some of us, thank God, have never had to witness personally.</p></speech>

I did not intend to say people would abduct children.  It was just an effort to explain the desperation.  If it is not desperation, I do not know what the word is.  There is something that leads to problems about not being able to have a child but procuring somebody else's child.  If I am not fertile and a woman beside me gives me her egg, that is her child.  From the child's point of view, that does not change.</p></speech>

We are supposed to ask all questions, even questions the answer to which we might not agree with ourselves.  We must ask the questions because the legislation will be based on those questions and their answers.  We must not sidestep it and hope we will get an answer.</p> <p>  I have never heard of the presumption of truth in relation to a birth certificate.  I have looked at quite a few birth certificates where there is only one name, and I am sure many other people in the room have done so.  We also know about the figure of 10% that was referred to.  Let us be honest with ourselves and deal with a situation that prevails in our society, warts and all, of which there are many examples.

When I say people on the street, I mean people's lived experience - people in Donor Offspring Europe, Anonymous Us in America, Spenderkinder, Tangled Webs and many other organisations around the world.

We have people living in emergency accommodation who are not being treated properly and we have a situation in our child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, where there are waiting lists for children to be seen to have their unhappiness assessed.  In the context of unhappiness in children, one must look at this as a component of it but there are so many other components of children's unhappiness in Ireland that are not being addressed by our State.  Of course there may be unhappiness in relation to finding out that one was a product of assisted human reproduction but there are so many other social reasons for being unhappy in Ireland that it is probably not a priority issue.</p></speech>

As that is the inability to produce one's own genetic child, washed sperm, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ICSI, and all these different State-funded mechanisms are provided to help people to have their own genetic child but there is no prioritising of that child to have or know his or her genetic parent.  I do not understand why one generation's happiness is seen as so important in this context while the other one's genetic continuity and happiness is expendable.

Donna Lyons in the school of law in Trinity College Dublin has had a paper published in the<i>International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family</i>.  She is Irish and she explicitly refers to Ireland in that paper.  She details how the Irish State justifies the development of telling children at the age of 18, which means telling adults about their parents, as wishing to meet its obligations under the convention.  She wrote &quot;it is essential that States Parties appropriately translate the requirements of the Convention into domestic law, thereby recognizing the right of the donor-conceived <i>child</i>.&quot;  Her point is that if Ireland is following the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, not the rights of the child when he or she becomes an adult, then children need to know who their parents are.  That was published in 2018.</p></speech>

I will make a statement and an observation and I invite a response.  In my 63rd year, it is my view that the yearning women have to have a child is very significant, to put it mildly.  When that does not happen it is a cause of deep distress.  That is my view of it and I did not get it from a book.</p> <p>  I want to make an observation on Professor Hayes's opening statement.  She spoke about the welfare of the child and stated "Relationships are the primary mode through which children develop and the effect of the relational process is often more powerful than that of the context within which it occurs."  Then she went on to say that "Stressors in early childhood can disrupt neurologic, metabolic and immunologic systems leading to poorer developmental outcomes."  She went on to note that "Where parents experience stress through uncertainty or lack of clarity around the security of their role as parents, the environment within the children are developing may be unnecessarily stressful."  I am stopping my observation at that point.</p> <p>  The question of happiness has come up and that is a nice philosophical conundrum which has been thought about in relation to democracies and all sorts of state systems.  Does Professor Hayes wish to make a comment about the discussion we have had around the distressing nature and the point that is being made here about stressors?  They may or may not fit together but it just struck me when I read back what she said in the context of what we have been listening to for the past half an hour or so.</p></speech>

The observation was that we may be unintentionally adding to a stressful situation.  The uncertainties around parenthood that will exist in that space could be very stressful for parents and I propose that this stressful environment is less than conducive to positive early child development.  That is the point that I was making specifically in relation to the length of time and the suggestion that certainty around parenthood could be had before the child is born and we had some lengthy discussion about that earlier.  I suggest that it is an optimal position, because it is recognised that the intended parents are intended to be the parents and the whole process is geared towards that.  Consequently, I was simply suggesting that inadvertently, the Bill may be contributing to stressful situations for children.</p></speech>

It is necessary to talk to people on the ground about what they go through and there are many legal people who represent those people and understand what they have to do on a day-to-day basis.  On what was mentioned in terms of putting more of a negative focus on surrogacy, if we are talking about an open society in which we then turn around to say there is a situation that is happening, there are people out there who were born from surrogates and who know their situation.  In the event of a public campaign stating it really is not an advisable thing to do, how will those people feel about their situation?</p><p>They will be in a situation where they will not mention how they were born and do not want it to appear.  It automatically puts the shutters up.  One has to deal with the situation there.  I do not think we are in a society that is leading to a situation where we have non-disclosure.  We talked about Sweden banning surrogacy, and it would be interesting to understand why it is banning it and the rationale behind it.  An all-round view of why it is doing it is needed because, as the Senator said, their laws are usually quite liberal.  How does it deal with people who go beyond the country for surrogacy?  Does it leave the people in legal limbo?</p><p> A number of countries in Europe legislate for this, including the UK and Spain.  The medical situation has to be addressed.  I do not know if Spain has up-to-date registers of donors and if it always keeps up-to-date information on their medical condition or if it is a situation where, if a situation arises with a particular child where the person has obviously used a donor from Spain, can that person ring a clinic and find out?  Is there access to that information or is it provided?  I do not know whether we need to look at those situations.  I do not know how long it has been legislated for in Spain, but it must deal with those situations all the time.  How does it deal with them?  I think the Senator is right that people need to have access to their medical information, particularly where something is preventable, and if somebody knows about an issue, he or she can have treatment.  That is important and needs to be considered.  If somebody goes into a hospital in Ireland, he or she needs to be able to say that his or her child has been donor-conceived.  The doctor may say that the hospital needs specific information.  Can the person go back to the clinic, or how does he or she get the information?  That needs to be looked at.  Other regions may have more information.</p></speech>

I have been involved in NISIG for approximately 20 years.  When I first started, the reproductive technology we now have did not exist.  That has leapt on, so to speak, and we have no legislation to protect us as patients.  It is not just about making us happy but us making our families happy.  They are the core of our society.  All we want is the best for children.  With good practice and good legislation, we can have happy children as a result of assisted reproduction of all types.</p></speech>

When people come in who contribute to the best of their ability based on the facts as they know them, whether from professional or academic experience, anecdotal evidence or the fruit of research of many people, and it is not their full-time job, they deserve significant credit.  I would not like to see a culture in the Oireachtas where people are challenged immediately and told what they have said is offensive.  If they are not setting out to be offensive and are trying to depict certain realities which involve reflection on people's lived experience, then we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should be slow to jump down anybody's throat.  I say that regardless of what point of view is being expressed.  I have equal thanks to all the witnesses for what they have had to say here today.</p> <p>  With regard to other breaches of children's rights and their welfare in our society, the Chairman is right to point it out.  Whether it is a priority issue is a matter of judgment.  It is a separate question as to whether one allows another wrong, notwithstanding that there are already many wrongs in our society.  I do not hold with whataboutery.  That can always be used to divert from the discussion of an issue on its individual merits.  That is what we have to do here.  There is a prior question here of whether, as said earlier, an injustice relating to the sundering of relationships is involved in any of these procedures.  If we are honest about that, we can then proceed to the next question.  There may be an honest disagreement.  Some may say there is an injustice and others may say there is not.  There is a third point of view which is that there is an injustice but a person believes we should tolerate it.  I would value such honesty.</p> <p>  I believe there are injustices here which are so significant that they do not justify permitting certain procedures.  Other people would agree that there is an injustice towards the child but they still think the desire of the parent to receive treatment outweighs that.  I understand that and at least we are having a debate on truthful terms.  I hope that is how we can shape it going forward.  In light of today's discussion and what our previous speaker said, there is a real need to interact at various levels.  I have already mentioned how we need to hear, examine and interrogate what research is telling us and what it can and cannot tell us.  Equally, we need to do so with people who have been through that experience, regardless of people's point of view, just as it is important to hear from children conceived through these processes who feel they have been wronged and that is not being acknowledged.  We should also look at this comparatively so that it is not just me saying that I think Sweden is going in the other direction or that there was a decision in the Spanish constitutional court.  Let us look at what is happening internationally.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell and others have talked about how it will happen anyway if it goes underground.  This committee issued a unanimous report advocating prohibition of medicinal cannabis due to unintended consequences and the fact that it would undermine other legislation on patient safety.  An argument here is that it will go underground anyway.  That is not, in and of itself, an argument against prohibitive legislation.  I do not want to put words in Professor Madden's mouth but there was an acknowledgement that while it might be the case that anonymous donation is prohibited under Irish law and within the Irish jurisdiction, there is nothing to prevent people from travelling to avail of assisted human reproduction involving an anonymous donation.  That is an example of it happening underground.  We need to acknowledge that the fact that things happen underground or outside our control is no reason for us not to legislate one way or the other.  It raises my question, which goes back to what Ms Keegan responded to, which is whether we should at least discourage that much.  If we have an architecture allowing assisted human reproduction, including surrogacy, although it has not gone through the Oireachtas yet and I hope other arguments will prevail, would people agree that going abroad to avail of surrogacy through anonymous donation should be discouraged?  What do people think of that?</p> <p>  Professor Madden may have left the room when I pointed to my dissatisfaction with the obligation being on donors to keep the register updated with relevant information, for example, if they are diagnosed with health conditions.  I think that will be honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  Surely the obligation should be on clinics and providers to be legally responsible for having all relevant information?  It could be set out in legislation or a statutory instrument that they would be legally responsible to maintain contact with donors for the purposes of securing important relevant information, including information on health issues and so on.  I would appreciate the witnesses' view on that and the related question.  I understand there is nothing in the scheme to allow donor-conceived children to trace their genetic parents or half-siblings easily.  Should there be something in the scheme that makes it easier for donor-conceived children to trace their genetic kin, whether in Ireland or overseas?</p> <p>  I do not think this is an issue we will get to today but it may be an issue for another day's reflection.  All of this presumes activity which is destructive of human embryos in one way or another, with how assisted human reproduction is practised.  I and others have problems with that.  I think many people would have problems with the "save your sibling" concept which has been present in Britain for many years, where embryos are created for the purposes of treating an illness or condition.  I think Baroness O'Cathain spoke very critically of that in the British House of Lords.</p><p>It is probably an area at which we will need to look on another day.  It is a very controversial aspect of the whole issue of human endeavour.  While it is not covered by the Bill, it is something about which we need to have a debate.</p></speech>

Obviously, there may be situations where, despite their best efforts, they are unable to maintain contact with donors, but there should certainly be an obligation on them to do so insofar as they can.  It is important that children born through donor-conception and their parents have access to that information, as required, to help them to deal with medical issues that might arise.  Therefore, I agree with the Senator in that regard.</p> <p>  Was there a second question?</p></speech>

The limit would be imposed by the regulator.  Whether the number would be, say, three or five would depend on the number who would be expected to use the service, the geographical spread and so on.  There should be the possibility that children born through donor-conception, at whatever age was considered appropriate under the legislation, whether it be childhood or adulthood - I do not have a particular view on it - would be able, through the registration system, to have contact with genetic siblings if, of course, the other siblings were in favour of such contact.</p> <p>  Was there another question?</p></speech>

After my court case, part of the settlement was the provision of a retrospective gene library and support service.  Obviously, with Narelle's law and the new legislation in Germany, the overturning of anonymity retrospectively is what is happening.  This needs to be looked at, in particular in the context of funding for counselling for those who have gone through these experiences, including persons who have been used as donors.  Not everybody knows what the impact has been on his wife and family, but it is unravelling over time and not always simple.  Some people went into this thinking it was like blood donation, but they then meet children or adults who look just like themselves, or their own mother.  As it can have a huge impact on them and their families, we need to have appropriate support services available.  There are infertility counsellors who understand these scenarios, as in the case of adoption.</p></speech>

Although I am at pains not to put words into somebody's mouth, I would not want the committee's mouth to be loaded either.  To clarify the point, it did deal with a cannabis Bill and we came to conclusions based on medical evidence which had been strongly presented and on the basis that it was a gateway drug, the taking of which required medical supervision.  The point about the need for medical supervision was emphasised from the outset.  As it was not going to be available, it was not accepted.  There have been several precedents in this country which clearly point to the fact that once there is medical approval, with the committee's approval, automatically, the State becomes liable for anything that comes along afterwards.

There is no way we can prevent people from travelling outside the country for whatever purpose, nor should we do so, for the simple reason that it has already been determined in a constitutional referendum, despite the efforts of some to suggest we could, which was an appalling conclusion to have reached, even in those days.</p></speech>
