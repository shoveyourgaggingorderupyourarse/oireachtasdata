Deputy Carroll MacNeill has informed me that she is at another committee meeting next door, but she will try to get in to us at some stage.  I welcome everyone to the meeting.  In accordance with public health guidelines, the wearing of face coverings is optional for members and witnesses.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Brian Hill, audit manager.</p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The committee has advised the HBFI that it may also wish to examine the issuance of bonds and unfinished estates during the engagement.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from HBFI: Ms Dara Deering, chief executive officer; Mr. Sean Alger, head of credit and risk; and Ms Denise Donovan, head of operations and finance.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either in silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of the Parliament, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It operates as a commercial State entity, providing finance at market rates for commercially-viable residential developments.</p> <p>  HBFI was incorporated as a designated activity company in December 2018 and the company&rsquo;s share capital is owned solely by the Minister for Finance.  A group entity, Home Building Finance Ireland (Lending) Designated Activity Company, was subsequently incorporated in early January 2019 and it is a 100%-owned subsidiary of HBFI.  The operations of HBFI commenced on 28 January 2019, with access to an initial loan fund of &euro;730 million to be made available by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, on the direction of the Minister for Finance.  At the time of its launch, HBFI&rsquo;s initial loan product was targeted at small- and medium-sized builders and was limited to providing senior debt funding for residential projects of ten units or more, up to a maximum of &euro;35 million per project.</p> <p>  During 2020, HBFI significantly expanded the scope of its lending.  It now offers funding for projects to build apartments where lending of up to &euro;75 million can be provided; for small residential development projects of fewer than ten units; for social housing projects contracted for sale to a local authority or an approved housing body, AHB; and a &euro;300 million momentum fund, which was launched as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic to provide funding to established developers for larger-scale developments in prime locations. </p> <p>  Naturally, HBFI was still in the initial stages of scaling up its operation in 2020.  From the date of inception up until the end of 2020, HBFI had approved offers of loans totalling &euro;395 million, but significantly less funding had been drawn down by borrowers.  As the statement of financial position discloses, HBFI had loans in issue by the end of 2020 to developers of just under &euro;37 million, and HBFI had borrowed a total of &euro;37.3 million from the ISIF to facilitate this lending.</p> <p>  HBFI&rsquo;s operating expenses in 2020 amounted to almost &euro;5.7 million, of which &euro;2.6 million was paid in respect of salaries to HBFI staff.  Members may wish to note that HBFI staff are employees of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, seconded to HBFI.  The NTMA also provides administration supports to HBFI, including premises, HR functions, procurement and financial management services.  Income earned by HBFI in 2020 amounted to &euro;864,000.  This included net interest income of &euro;544,000 and other income of &euro;320,000.  HBFI incurred a loss of just under &euro;4.8 million for 2020.</p> <p>  I issued unqualified audit opinions on the 2020 financial statements of the HBFI group, and of the subsidiary company. </p></speech>

As detailed in the letter of invitation, she has five minutes to read her statement, which is fairly concise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dara Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#A00800"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear today.  I am joined by my colleagues, whom the Chair has already introduced.</p> <p>  HBFI is a Government initiative to increase the supply of new homes, for owner-occupiers, renters and social housing, by providing loans on commercial terms to small, medium and large housebuilders for commercially-viable developments throughout Ireland.</p> <p>  Last month, we published a performance update that showed we had grown total loan approvals to &euro;835 million as at the end of December 2021.  The funding we have approved can deliver 3,729 new homes in 71 developments in 18 counties.  Drawdowns have already taken place in respect of 57% of the facilities we had approved at the end of December.  This shows that the houses and apartments being built with HBFI funding are being completed quickly, thereby meeting some of the immense demand for housing.  Furthermore, I am pleased to say that our strong progress has continued into 2022, with the result that, as of the end February, our total loan approvals have grown to more than &euro;1 billion.  These will support the potential delivery of over 4,400 new homes across 20 counties.</p> <p>  HBFI funding has been effective for several reasons.  By listening to our stakeholders and focusing on developments where housebuilders experience difficulty raising funding from traditional sources, HBFI addresses the gaps in the traditional marketplace and provides a rigorous but fast loan approval process.  Our focus on supporting incremental housing supply gives us a flexibility that may not always be available from mainstream banks.  Equally, while mainstream banks often gravitate towards urban areas, we have a national remit to try to support new home supply in every county and not just the big cities.</p><p>Our product range will take into account the market reality that some housing schemes will simply be too small for other lenders to support.  Through our strong stakeholder engagement across the public and private sectors, the HBFI can identify trends and gaps in the funding market from the ground up.</p><p> However, not all the challenges can be predicted, as the Covid pandemic has demonstrated.  The HBFI&rsquo;s ability to respond to the risk that there may be further, albeit temporary, challenges as a result of Covid-19 impacting on the timing of future supply brought about the creation of the momentum fund.  As the initial &euro;200 million was fully committed within three months, the strength of demand resulted in the HBFI adding a further &euro;100 million to the fund.  The success of the fund has continued to the extent that it is now more than 90% utilised and the time is right to close it to new applications.  The momentum fund is just one example of how the HBFI&rsquo;s agile business model can respond to disruptions to residential development finance and tailor its offerings to the areas where demand exists the most.</p><p> In reality, the HBFI is just one part of the solution to the supply-demand imbalance that exists, which is causing so much difficulty for owner-occupiers, renters and those in need of social housing.  We feel strongly that increasing supply across the market is beneficial for everyone.  By funding developments aimed at owner-occupiers, we are helping these people move out of the rental sector and freeing up homes for other renters, thereby increasing the supply in that sector.  By funding new homes for rental, we build on that progress, increase the choice available to renters and try to help alleviate some of the pricing pressure existing in that market.</p><p> Access to development finance for all types of housing remains a key issue for homebuilders and is vital to support the continued delivery of housing throughout the State.  Through the strategies I have outlined today, the HBFI seeks to address the financing challenge and ensure that finance is available where the level of demand makes a development viable.  We take great pride in being part of each of the developments we finance and in seeing foundations being dug and diggers at work.  That is what the HBFI is all about; turning the finance we have available into homes.</p><p> This concludes my opening remarks.  I hope this has given the committee a better understanding of the work of the HBFI.  My colleagues and I will do our best to answer any questions members may have. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00300"><p>I thank Ms Deering for her statement and the Comptroller and Auditor General for his reports.  I do not want to paraphrase what Ms Deering said, but I will focus on one line where she said the HBFI identified gaps in the existing fund available to creditors and did so in an efficient and rigorous way.  I am thinking back to the development of the HBFI.  In many ways, many of the new policy tools that have come in, such as Housing for All and so on, have increased the number of policy tools available to tackle the housing market.  While all homes built are very important and help to solve the housing crisis - as Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage I am very conscious of that - the role of members of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hold the HBFI to account for the policy area under its remit.</p> <p>  I will focus on the idea of small and medium-sized builders and the access they have to credit.  Would the representatives say that was the core origin of the creation of the HBFI?  It certainly seems to have comprised much of the early work of the organisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dara Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00400"><p>The Deputy is absolutely right.  When the HBFI was established, the initial assumption was that finance would be more concerned with small and medium-sized developers or housebuilders, especially outside urban areas.  We see that as a real gap.  In fact, 65% of all the homes we have funded are in schemes that are being built with fewer than 50 homes.  That is a reality.  Some 63% of all the homes we have funded are outside the Dublin area.  Both those factors are clear evidence that there is less availability of finance and, therefore, more demand outside the main areas.</p> <p>  One of the things we did very early was a strategic review and a large piece of market research.  We identified gaps even beyond that.  If we look at small housing schemes, when the HBFI was initially set up, the assumption was the demand would be in units greater than ten.  Actually, 14% of all housing supply in Ireland over the past number of years is in schemes of fewer than ten units.  We brought out a product specifically to support housebuilders who want to build between five and ten units to try to fill that gap further.  Equally, on the other side of the spectrum, we saw real challenges with apartment delivery and the financing of apartment delivery schemes so we brought out a product specifically for that.  That was the message I was trying to get across in my opening statement.  There is not one housing market; there are multiple markets.  There are multiple challenges facing those markets and we have tried to respond to the gaps as they emerge. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00500"><p>I want to focus on the HBFI's move away from focusing on that idea of small to medium sized towards the momentum fund, which I will discuss.  Does Ms Deering regard that as mission creep or as identifying another gap in the market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dara Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00600"><p>First, I do not see it as a move away.  I see it as an add-on to what we were doing because those gaps very much existed in small and medium-sized scheme funding.  As I said, 65% of all the schemes are fewer than 50 units.  That is a very important focus for us.  We went a step further than the original offering by bringing out a product for those smaller schemes.  It is very important for us.</p> <p>  I believe that in our role as a funder, and our mandate is to increase supply, we have to recognise that the gaps will be at different parts of the market and sometimes that will be timebound.  The Deputy may want to reference the momentum fund, which is a prime example of something that was created as a result of the pandemic.  Our role was to step in and respond to that factor. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00700"><p>Okay.  I will come back to that.  Clearly, the HBFI has not seen the success in drawdowns for those smaller projects that it might have.  Of almost &euro;395 million approved facilities, the drawdown has just been approximately &euro;37 million, which is 10%.  I am trying to get to the bottom of why that is happening in the market so I can understand it from a policy perspective.  I can also see, from the HBFI's perspective, that it is not getting as much money drawn down as it wants from a much larger fund.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dara Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00800"><p>I will take the drawdown point.  The Deputy is right that there is obviously a gap between the &euro;395 million that was there to the end of 2020 and the drawdowns at that point.  That is the same irrespective of any housing scheme we fund because it will take a period of time.  First, from the time we approve the fund, it takes about three to six months on average before funding is drawn down.  The whole nature of development finance is we only lend the money as the activity is happening.  It will take a further 21 months on average before the full amount of money we propose for a scheme is drawn down.</p></speech>

We look at whether we are making the funding available and, when we do so, whether we are supporting the people for whom we make funding available in getting building happening as quickly as possible.

For example, does planning permission need to be in place in advance of applications being made?</p></speech>

However, before they draw down funding with the HBFI, and in the vast majority of cases before we approve the funds, they must have the planning in place.  The reason for that is exactly what the Deputy said.  We do not want to have funding approved if it cannot work through the process because it is still waiting for planning.  That is not the quickest or most efficient use of the funding we have available.  The reality is that from the time we approve a facility, a number of things have to happen.  First, there is a due diligence process to make sure all the checks and balances are in place because we are lending State money but on the other side of it, the housebuilders have to mobilise the resources available, including the labour and materials, to get on site.  Sometimes they will be concluding a site purchase as part of that transaction.</p></speech>

We are speaking in very general terms.  I am trying to get to the bottom of what those delays in drawdown are.  I accept that Covid was an issue, although less so on the social housing side, and I hear what Ms Deering is saying about issues in legal transfers and so on.  Have the witnesses examined why they have not been able to release more money into the market?</p></speech>

There are multiples reasons.  From the time a loan is approved, such as for a &euro;5 million facility, for example, there is a due diligence process that has to go through from both sides.  That is for both the customer that is borrowing the money and us as a lender.  That is the same for any financial institution.  It is not specific to the HBFI.  We would then be ready to draw down the funds but the housebuilder would be getting construction ready in parallel.  Sometimes they could be on another site so there is not one reason.

She mentioned the figure of 57%.  From the perspective of value for money for the taxpayer, I am looking at a cost base in 2020 of &euro;5.7 million and drawdowns of &euro;37 million.  Those numbers do not make for a good ratio.  I want to see a pipeline of more rapid draw down.</p></speech>

For any start-up business, it is expected to start covering its own costs in about a three-year period.  We expect to reach that in 2022, which is just over three years from inception.  The costs to which the Deputy is referring would be covered by the income we earn on the loans that are drawn down.  We have already seen further increases.  As I mentioned, 57% of the facilities are now drawing down.  That drawdown amount will increase month by month to get to a stage where we are covering our costs in 2022.  That was the milestone we had originally-----</p></speech>

There is a fisherman on a lake and it is very hard getting the fish.  He has to cover his costs.  He is there all day and is not getting the rewards he wants so he develops a new tool called the momentum fund that lets him fish in a barrel.  My worry about the momentum fund is that is a huge allocation - 40% of the overall fund, if I am right - is going to very large developers, so it may not be filling the gap left by other lenders that has been identified.  I can see how an organisation that is struggling to get the volume it wants can very easily come up with a new tool, allocate more than 40% of the funds and start to then reach volumes that could be met by other financial institutions.</p></speech>

The momentum fund was introduced in May 2020.  We were in the first part of Covid-19, sites had been closed and there was a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace.  We believed that an appropriate response for the HBFI was to look at whether there could be further disruptions to housing supply due to the lack of availability of finance.  We launched the momentum fund and we saw real demand for it.  Some 90% of the fund was allocated in the first few months.</p></speech>

That was our market analysis at the time, evidenced by the level of applications we saw.  Our motivation was to avoid a scenario where, in a crisis situation where there was reduced supply and increased demand, the supply would be further constrained because finance was not available.  We were very clear in allocating the momentum fund that it would in no way constrain the amount of funding we would have available for small and medium-sized projects.  It was not a case of or but of and; it was adding temporarily to the market.</p></speech>

More than 90% of the applications to the fund were made in the first three months and the initial &euro;200 million was oversubscribed.  We added a further &euro;100 million.</p></speech>

We do a benchmarking exercise externally because we are subject to state aid rules, so we have to make sure that what we offer does not distort competition in the marketplace.  We would have done a benchmarking exercise at the time to make sure this temporary fund would not distort competition.  That is all it was.  It was a response to Covid-19 and it is closed now.  It would have been be like for like in terms of the marketplace.</p></speech>

That seems to go beyond the initial idea of identifying small to medium-sized projects.  We are short on time but I want to get to the issue of performance-related pay.  I am sure it is a matter that the HBFI wants to address too.  There have not been allocations in these accounts.  Is that something Ms Deering envisages happening this year or next year?</p></speech>

It is very important that we do not stifle creativity and so on.

An exception was sought for the momentum fund in respect of the legislation.  The HBFI approached the Minister in this regard.  Was an approach made to the organisation to indicate that there was a gap, as it has been described?  I refer to a situation where the HBFI lobbied for moneys to be made available from this fund.</p></speech>

In the context of the legislation that governs the HBFI, our mandate is to support all housing schemes where there is a gap in finance, provided they are commercially viable.  Additionally, and as part of fulfilling that mandate, we are constantly trying to identify if gaps have emerged.  Given what happened in the context of the impact of Covid-19 and the banks having to focus on putting payment breaks in place for consumers and SMEs, it was obvious that finance for construction would be a constraint.  We saw that as well after the last global financial crisis.</p></speech>

We saw first-hand what was happening in respect of banks having to focus on SMEs and personal customers, as I said.  Therefore, we sought to put funding in place in advance of there being a significant increase in demand.  We launched it to the marketplace-----</p></speech>

This fund is a significant difference from the expectation when the HBFI was first established.  Why could institutional investors not source funding in a market where there was cheap money and negative interest rates?  In a scenario where there is significant unmet demand, that is not going to change.  Where is this approach coming from?  I do not see where it is coming from.</p></speech>

In making the decision to support and launch the momentum fund, we were very clear that we would still have sufficient finance available to fund small- and medium-sized schemes, and that is still the case today.  It did not compromise, sacrifice or take away from our ability to fund these.  That is why I said at the outset that 65% of all of the homes we have funded are on schemes with fewer than 50 homes.  We are delivering to that original mandate.</p></speech>

It is our strong view that this needs to be in the owner-occupier market, which is 43% of what we funded.  It includes the rental sector, which is 30%, social housing, which is 23%, and Part V housing, which is 4%.  We were not set up for a particular segment.  We were absolutely set up to support the increase in supply.  That means that, at times, we have to flex our offering to where the gaps are the greatest.  Not doing that would not be doing what-----</p></speech>

The initial expectation was that the supply of finance, or the availability of finance, was likely to be more constrained in small- and medium-sized projects, which may be where the Deputy is going with her question.  It is still the fact today that small- and medium-sized builders outside of the main urban areas struggle the most to get finance because the main banks have less appetite for outside of Dublin and, therefore, we have to and do play a role in supporting that.</p></speech>

In giving that money over, it seems to me the equivalent of the local enterprise office helping out Pfizer.  On top of that, there are not going to be any owner-occupier homes out of it and it is just going to be apartments sold on to cuckoo funds so they can exploit the out-of-control rental market here.  Does Ms Deering have any view as to the rent that might be charged when doing that?</p></speech>

To help the committee, the reality that we faced in 2020 was that we had schemes shovel-ready and ready to start building homes.  I appreciate those homes would be for the rental market but our view is that as part of increasing the overall supply, we must see an increase in the supply of rental properties.  They were shovel-ready and, on the basis of our market analysis right then, they could not keep going because they typically borrowed from the domestic sector, and the domestic sector was rightly, to my mind, focused on supporting families and small businesses who needed payment breaks.  That is why we did the momentum fund.  I will let my colleague give the Deputy a flavour of what rents may be achieved, recognising that these apartments will come to the rental stock in a number of years.</p></speech>

I am sure they were rubbing their hands when they got the funding so easy, given the exorbitant rental charge and the profits they are going to make.  The remit of the HBFI was not to distort the market.  Of the &euro;300 million, some &euro;190 million of that went to those cuckoo funds or developers that had the forward purchase agreements.  It does not seem to add up.  What were the checks and balances when they came for funding, particularly for those that had the backing of cuckoo funds?  What were the checks and balances that the HBFI requested, for example, in order to see they had been refused funding by bank after bank before they came to it?</p></speech>

The reality is that since the HBFI was established, the affordability aspect has been reduced for people of that age from 16% down to 12%, which would suggest that the HBFI is not effective.  There is an issue here with the affordability aspect.  The HBFI is there to fund developers who Ms Deering says cannot access funds elsewhere albeit we do not know what the due diligence is because she just told Deputy Munster that the HBFI does not actually require any kind of a letter saying that they cannot get funds from the bank.  She is saying that the HBFI's percentage rates are comparable with the banks.  However, the effect of having the HBFI set up is that the affordability aspect for people in that age group has reduced by four percentage points.  How does that market research sit with Ms Deering?</p></speech>

We have an affordability issue, which is clear if the average price is &euro;319,000 in the context of our mortgage rules.  There is a big gap that Ms Deering does not seem to be identifying with.  The HBFI was set up to make housing more affordable by building more.  If the supply issue is cured, houses become cheaper.  What has actually happened is that the affordability aspect has been reduced by 4 percentage points.  Does Ms Deering expect that to change and if so, how?</p></speech>

Does Ms Deering hear what we are saying?  This is about public moneys and where they are going.  I am telling Ms Deering that affordability has decreased by 4% since the HBFI was set up.  Does Ms Deering propose to change that and make it a positive as opposed to a negative?  Does she think the HBFI can do that?</p></speech>

There has been a lot of focus on the drawdown of funding.  I am interested in the structure to protect the organisation with regard to securities, etc.  What checks and balances are in place to make sure there is adequate security?  We had a problem with the banks in the past.  Representatives from the National Asset Management Agency were before the committee and outlined a case where a solicitor's undertaking in relation to property to the tune of approximately &euro;1 billion meant the banks could not do anything about it because it was totally insufficient.  In terms of securities where moneys are released, what checks and balances are in place?</p></speech>

When we approve a loan, we appoint a firm of solicitors to act specifically on our behalf and those solicitors are responsible for doing a title investigation and registering our security.  Before we do our initial drawdown, that security must be in place and confirmed by our panel solicitors.</p></speech>

In some cases, the borrower already owns the site.  In those circumstances, our solicitor would still do an investigation of the title and register our security.  In other cases, our borrower is also purchasing the site so the borrower's solicitor would be doing a title investigation and then our solicitor would be responsible for registering our security.</p></speech>

Have any particular problems been highlighted in that regard?  Have alarm bells been set off because of issues that occurred previously?</p></speech>

Very often, there were defects in how that security was registered.  We do not rely on the borrower's solicitor to certify title and register our security.  We have our own independent panel of solicitors to do title investigations and register our security.</p></speech>

For every loan we approve, there is an expected date for the development to be launched to the market.  There are also specific timings around when sales are expected to complete.  We monitor that in conjunction with our borrower.  Let us take the example of a 20-unit development.  As soon as each house sells, we get the sale proceeds, which reduces the borrowers loan to us.  Typically for a 20-unit development, we might be repaid after the 16th house is sold.  That is the source of our repayment as each unit gets sold.</p></speech>

We have had to do some extensions to loan terms but those have been relatively modest.  Developers in many cases made up for some of the time lost as a result of lockdowns.  From a risk perspective, nothing in our developments has caused us concern to date.</p></speech>

What is the difficulty about the financial institutions providing lending at this stage?  Never before has there been so much money on deposit in the main banks in this country.  Why is there a reluctance in the financial sector to provide funding?</p></speech>

Why do builders or developers come to the HBFI for funding and not go to the main banks?  I think that is the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

We have a national remit, which means we are here to fund schemes in every county.  Sometimes the mainstream banks focus more on urban areas and high population centres.  We will try to support demand in every county, if that is viable, and we have so far supported schemes in 20 counties.  The more fundamental point is that at times a builder or developer will not have the required level of equity that meets the risk criteria for a bank.  What do I mean by that?  The main banks will typically lend approximately 65% of the cost of building a new development.  We can lend more than that.  We can go up to approximately 80% to try to make more schemes viable.  That is the second reason.</p> <p>  The third reason is that some of the schemes will simply be too small for the main banks.  That is why we brought out-----</p></speech>

The State has a shareholding in the main banks.  Is Ms Deering saying that an entity in which the State has a shareholding is refusing to talk to developers unless they are building 50 houses?</p></speech>

There can be a range of reasons why the funding is not available.</p></speech>

Those banks have adequate moneys on deposit.  In fact, they are now penalising people for having moneys on deposit.  Surely some effort must be made to deal with this issue.</p></speech>

That is not a small loan.  Where a builder is already putting &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 into a development, the risk to the bank is very small.  Is it not now time that the banks came back to the market and helped deal with the housing shortage?</p></speech>

It has indicated that while there is a risk, it does not see that as a major challenge.  If it does not see it as a major challenge, what is the problem with the main financial institutions?

If we approve a scheme, whether for owner-occupiers or anything else, that does not compromise our ability to approve a scheme for social housing. Equally, if we approve a scheme for rental, it does not compromise our ability to approve a scheme for the private or owner-occupier market.</p> <p>  We have sufficient funding available to meet the demand for all the commercially viable schemes coming our way because the funding we have can be recycled and, second, we have an ability to borrow more if needs be.  In our strong view, to tackle this challenging environment we are in where supply is well beneath demand, we need to see homes being built for owner-occupiers, renters, social housing and Part V.  That is how we are trying to play a small part in helping to address the challenges that are there today.</p></speech>

Does it ensure fair rents are charged?  At the end of the day, this is taxpayers' money and the HBFI is funding developers to build developments that, in some instances, are rented on the private market.  Does it have measures to ensure it is not participating in a mechanism that penalises people for being in a position whereby they have to rent?</p></speech>

At the end of that period, in the case of the private rental market, those units may be sold in totality and rented out to the market.  In the same way as we fund a home to be sold to the private market, we fund construction only.  We fund the house builders and, at the end of that, the property makes its way into one of the segments I mentioned.  Obviously, one of the mechanisms to alleviate costs, whether in the context of the affordability point that one of the Deputy's colleagues mentioned earlier in regard to people trying to buy a home or in the context of the price point for rental, relates to bringing forward more supply, and that has to be our focus and use.  We believe, given our mandate, we should use the finance we have available to bring forward supply across the board.  We do not differentiate as to what the purpose of that supply is.  We believe we should support all supply where finance is a barrier.</p></speech>

Moreover, some of the schemes we have funded for the private rental sector were under the momentum fund, but that fund is now closed.

They were ready to get going with workers who needed to have construction activity.  That is why we were very keen to keep it going.  To come back to the Deputy's original point, I totally agree that we need more building outside the main urban areas.  That is one of our objectives and motivations and that is why we have a team of people trying to support schemes in those areas.  We do not get bundles of applications from all the counties.  We would like to see more and we have the capacity to fund more but finance is obviously just one of the challenges in trying to bring forward that supply.</p></speech>

Has there been any analysis of the actual cost of building these three-bed apartments?  The cost of building something is made up of the cost of land - and apartments are stacked higher so you do not need as much land - and then labour and materials.  There are ancillary costs, such as legal, technical, design and other costs, but those are the three big ones.  The HBFI is making credit available for these developments but has it done any analysis of what it actually costs to provide them?  I do not claim to have all the wisdom on this but I know from people in the construction industry that apartments can be provided at a very reasonable price.  Are there any figures on that?</p></speech>

That is why most of the apartments for which we receive funding applications are for the rental sector.  When you try to sell them on a unit-by-unit basis, the cost of those units is beyond the reach of an awful lot of people in the marketplace.

Ms Deering mentioned a figure of more than &euro;400,000 for an apartment.  The cost per unit as of 31 December 2020, based on the HBFI's section 24 review, shows the average cost per home for those developments with more than ten units.  This is approved funding.  I understand that does not take into account the full fund, but covers more than 80%.  It works out at &euro;169,505 per unit for developments of more than ten units.  That indicates to me that the figure is far less than &euro;400,000.  It is &euro;202,000 for construction sites with fewer than ten units.  The cost of more than &euro;400,000 to build an apartment over the period of those loans is out of kilter with the cost on the ground.</p></speech>

The Chairman is talking about section 24 figures.  He is right that we lend that much money per unit, as opposed to the homes being built.  I will take the Chair's example of the more-than-ten-unit and fewer-than-ten-unit projects.  They are houses.  The construction cost of a house is lower than &euro;435,000.  The cost of construction for a house, per the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, is &euro;185,000.  As I mentioned earlier, there is also the cost of land and other factors.  That is the comparison.</p></speech>

He is right that the cost of construction for houses is less than apartments, but the cost of construction for houses takes into consideration the construction itself and other factors, such as land.  I accept that land prices will be different in other places.  It also includes other soft costs, such as the cost of finance that has to be in place.  That is why our average house price is &euro;319,000.  It reflects the construction costs.</p></speech>

I have a copy of what was said at the time.  There is a table from the HBFI from 31 December 2020.  Looking at developments of more than ten units, &euro;185 million was made available.  There was &euro;8.3 million for developments of fewer than ten units, or just 41 homes.  Those two figures show that the intended aim of the HBFI just did not work out.  Only 41 homes were provided by way of small builders building fewer than ten units.  According to the Government at the time, the goal was to fund small and medium-sized developers and builders to build outside the main urban areas.  I do not mean to be disparaging.  That indicates to me that there was complete failure in matching the actual figures to the intention.</p><p>That would indicate to me, and I do not mean to be disparaging, a complete failure in matching up the intention with the actual figures in that only 41 homes were provided by builders who were building ten or fewer units.</p></speech>

Therefore, the first product as per the table was the one regarding which we expected to see the greatest level of demand.  One of the first things we did was a review of the marketplace.  We actually felt there would also be demand for the smaller schemes, those with fewer than ten units.  The Chairman is absolutely right in that, at the time, at the end of 2020, these accounted for six facilities.  However, if I consider what constitutes small and medium under a scheme, I note it is not just fewer than ten units.  That criterion did not even exist when we launched.  Of the schemes we have approved, more than 65% have fewer than 50 units.  Those are more akin to those associated with the demand we see outside Dublin.</p></speech>

That is clear from this.

I am aware that Ms Deering made the case earlier that she was trying to help that sector as well.  However, are we sure that sector was really struggling to get finance?  For example, if a constituent went to the local authority tomorrow to get money under the local authority loan scheme or, previously, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, two letters from private financial institutions would have to be produced stating he or she could not get a loan.  There would also be other rigorous checks.  Ms Deering clarified that the developers who finished up with 80% of the public money did not have to produce any of that documentation.  Does she not find that odd?  She mentioned that her organisation did not want to put the applicants through the rigorous process of going around the houses looking for money before coming back to it, but that does not take long.  One can get the information from a bank or other financial institution in a day.  If a developer or builder presents balanced books to a bank or financial institution and shows evidence of the asset, secured land, planning permission and a preliminary design that has been done, he or she will get a fairly quick answer within a week; it does not take months.</p> <p>  A weakness in the momentum fund and the overall scheme is that critical check is not in place.  What happened is simply that, in the case of the fund, more than 80% of it ended up funding apartments in Dublin that finished up in the hands of private developers charging a rent of &euro;3,100 per month.  That is crazy money by comparison with rents in other European cities.  Before the crash, we finished up with the most expensive site in the world in Ballsbridge.  We all remember that and what happened.  Some of the people involved wound up in America.  We remember the madness of all that.  Are we not driving ourselves into a crazy situation again using taxpayers&rsquo; money to build apartments that are to be rented out for completely crazy prices from the point of view of Joe Public and citizens?  If people rent these apartments, they will never be able to save to buy a home and they will end up as pensioners in them.  I realise this is not for Ms Deering to figure out but policymakers must figure out how they will fund the system when these people reach pension age.  What kind of pension or wage will someone need to pay &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week in rent?</p> <p>  Based on the figures given, I am more concerned than I was after reading all this material yesterday.  We need to help small builders to provide affordable homes.  I contend that it does not cost &euro;400,000 to build or produce a home, regardless of the land cost and anything else.  There are things HBFI cannot do about the land costs that the Oireachtas should be doing, but I would like to go a lot further.  We have not acted on the Kenny report of the 1970s.  There are things we can do regarding vacant sites, CPOs, etc.  I just think we are finishing up in a worse situation than we were in given where things are heading.  I know people on relatively good incomes who are paying &euro;1,600 per month in rent.  They are absolutely crucified.  They are young couples who will never be able to buy.</p> <p>  I will allow in the second batch of speakers.  There are a few members who have not shown up yet.  I will allow each member who indicates a desire to contribute to do so.  However, they should bear in mind that if some of the others arrive, I will have to allow them their ten minutes.  The best thing to do is to give each member who indicates five minutes to contribute, and I will do so in the order in which members indicate.  We will then go around the houses again.  The first person to indicate is Deputy Munster, who has five minutes.</p></speech>

Ms Deering said it was set up in case funding from the mainstream banks would be constrained during Covid.  At the same time, HBFI had no checks and balances when the big developers were applying for funding.  It did not ask for a single sheet of paper that would show they had already been refused or had any difficulty whatsoever in getting the funding through the normal channels.</p> <p>  Ms Deering said HBFI had decided to set up the momentum fund and then brought the proposal to the Minister.  In this regard, I have a question on which I want a very clear response on the record.  In bringing about the setting up of the fund, was there any lobbying of any description from anybody?</p></speech>

The figures given are staggering, with rents of &euro;3,100 for a three-bedroom apartment.  Just think about that for a second - &euro;3,100 for a three-bedroom apartment or &euro;1,800 for a one-bedroom apartment.

I appreciate that we are talking about large quantums of money but the other big consideration for us, and maybe I am not getting this across to the committee today, in parallel to that consideration, is the need to make sure that we have finance available for those small and medium-sized schemes.  We want to see more applications across every county for homes in every county.  One was not to sacrifice the building of another.</p></speech>

That is a very short period to introduce a fund or to make that assessment of need.  Where is the evidence?  I am not convinced that I have heard evidence to support the conclusion reached that the introduction of that fund was necessary.</p></speech>

If we go back to when the lockdown announcement was made, construction sites closed.  All construction activity finished during the first lockdown.  Our assessment was based on our experience of lending into the marketplace.  Unfortunately we saw during the previous global financial crisis that banks had to focus on other things, which meant that the availability finance for construction was constrained-----</p></speech>

In response to some of the earlier points made and the Deputy's own point, we are absolutely committed to funding small and medium-sized developments wherever there is viability.  Obviously, we would like to see more homes in some of the locations the Deputy spoke about.  That is why we have teams out in those locations trying to generate awareness that we exist and to fund those homes.  The momentum fund is time-bound.  We have closed it because we believe there is now sufficient funding available in the marketplace for these schemes.  It is no longer needed to step in.</p></speech>

That is my experience from having sat at local authority meetings.  We have huge issues in that regard.  The bulk of HBFI funding seems to be for Dublin and the delivery seems to be in Dublin.  I appreciate there are developments in 18 counties.  One question I did not get an answer to earlier, whether I framed it incorrectly or not I do not know, is that fundamental to how this scheme is successful has to be construction cost and the viability after construction cost.  Ms Deering gave me a figure of &euro;319,000, which really does not mean anything.  If a one-bed apartment is being built in Dublin and one is being constructed in Wexford, for a start the one in Wexford will not be very saleable.  That is why one-bed apartments are not being built there.  Nobody wants one-bed apartments in Wexford.  I asked Ms Deering for a construction figure.  If a developer in Wexford is prepared to build a development of five to ten houses, does HBFI ascertain the construction cost of that development before giving the loan?</p></speech>

I am taking notes as this develops.  There is no requirement of proof in respect of the inability of a developer to access credit from a bank or other financial institution.  I accept that everything takes time.  Ms Deering will recall that I mentioned the very famous site in Ballsbridge.  As I recall, a party was actually held by the bank on the day that the loan was granted in principle because it had secured such a big deal.  The financial institution was over the moon that it had actually been granted that loan.  Banks are very interested in lending money for what is called real estate, or bricks and mortar, particularly in Ireland, because it is less risky than other ventures, such as manufacturing or whatever.  The asset is there and they have the deeds.  We know how it works and why it works.  For example, the deeds to my house are with somebody else because I have a mortgage on it at the moment.  No proof of the inability of a developer to access credit is required.</p> <p>  We have also ascertained today that there is no problem in providing funding to institutional investors.  We have established that more than 80% of the money in the momentum fund has gone into large-scale apartment development in Dublin.  Is it for institutional investors, which are sometimes referred to as cuckoo funds?  There is no barrier to the money from the HBFI going to such funds that rent out the apartments.  Ms Deering has elaborated on and explained the logic from their point of view that it is about increasing supply.  However, it is increasing the supply of overpriced houses.  We have also established that the largest loan granted was &euro;94 million, and a further loan of &euro;74 million was granted for the aptly-named Greenacres development in south Dublin for the construction of apartments.  Those two loans together are worth &euro;168 million, which is a fair chunk of the cash that is available.  We have also established that up to that point at the end of 2020, loans had only been granted for up to 41 homes to be provided by small builders in developments of ten or less.  The points I wish to emphasise are no requirement of proof of inability to access credit, no barrier to cuckoo funds, large loans are being granted to institutional developers and the affordability issue.  Local authorities build very high-quality homes.  I refer to &Oacute; Cualann housing association.  Granted, it has free land.  I understand that, but the land still does not make up that fraction, where we are heading towards nearly three times the cost from the figures HBFI provided.  The loans, particularly from the momentum fund, are being granted to large developers in Dublin that provide overpriced apartment blocks to let.  </p> <p>  I thank HBFI for the briefing it submitted to the committee in advance of the meeting.  It contains good information that is set out in a very concise way.  When I read the briefing, I was shocked to learn about the bond situation.  I refer to the case where a developer goes to a local authority to build 100 houses or apartments.  The local authority will look for a bond, typically so much per unit, to ensure the development is finished, and the roads are put in and the sewerage water, public lighting, footpaths and everything else is finished off to a proper standard.  I am referring to everything within the public domain, out past the front door to where the development meets a public road.  In the HBFI briefing, with regard to bonds failing, it is stated: "The report noted that although difficulties have been highlighted on specific developments it was not considered to be a widespread practice."  I was a county councillor before I became a Deputy.  Like those who came behind me, I am still following up on estates that I was chasing up more than 20 years ago with developers in relation to bonds failing, bonds not being renewed, bonds not being rolled over and bonds that were not worth the paper they were written on.  Some local authorities are now only accepting cash bonds.  To my mind, it should always have been that way.  I have stood on estates, as I am sure other public representatives have, that have been left in disastrous state.  They looked like Syria.  I have seen manholes and sewers left open, no public lighting, no footpaths and no surfaces on the roads.  On one estate, the developer did not even bother to put in the road.  I am talking about awful outcomes.  Local authorities had to go in and finish these estates.  We had to argue in the D&aacute;il for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to provide money just to address the safety issues on estates following the crash, which, in fairness, it did.  That is still a problem.  We had the insanity of the Celtic tiger, the hangover from it and the mopping-up exercise that followed.  That mopping-up exercise continues today.  A little more care has been taken with recent developments.  However, I am concerned about the assertion that it is not considered to be a widespread practice.  I am concerned about the fact that we are providing public money to entities, including investors, small and large developers, with no guarantee that when the estates they are developing or the projects they are working on are finished, the local authorities will not have to find money or go begging to the Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications, or that we will have to stand up and argue in the House with the Minister for Finance, looking for money for them.  The State has had to intervene a lot.  Local authorities have had to intervene.  They have had to use of money that was designated for other purposes.  Local authorities are not cash-rich generally.  I ask HBFI to review that.  </p> <p>  Ms Deering mentioned earlier that the fund has been closed.  If there is going to be any future funding for anything like this, the bonds issue has to be nailed down.  We had a discussion on it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I raised the issue, in particular, but other Deputies are interested in it as well, in fairness.  We are concerned about the failure to have proper bonds in place.  I am not just referring to pieces of paper; I am talking about putting proper bonds in place, so that if the developer fails, the local authority can get its hands on the cash.  It is the enforcement authority.  It is left to deal with the issue.  County councillors around the country have to take the flack from the public.  The public ask them why permission for developments was granted and why bonds were not adequate.  I can take the witnesses to estates in Mountmellick, Portlaoise and Borris-in-Ossory.   There are estates all over the place.  Members can rattle off examples of estates that were not finished properly and where there are still issues to be addressed.  For example, the sewerage pumping station in Woodgrove, Portlaoise, close to where I live, is still not adequate.  In the real world, beyond the gates of this place, the issue of bonds has to be nailed down if any further finance is going to be provided or before any other loan is granted using public money.  I would say the same thing about granting private money, but I make the point particularly in respect of granting public money.  Through the issues that we have fleshed out this morning, we know that there is no requirement of proof of the inability to access credit.  If I apply for a local authority loan, I have to be able to show that I cannot get the finance elsewhere.  This money is available to institutional investors, which are sometimes referred to as cuckoo funds.  The stated aim in the first place of providing finance to small builders has not worked out.  Now we find that the bond issue is not watertight.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

I totally agree with the points the Chairman has made.  In fact, our experience is that in the vast majority of cases, the local authorities are insisting on cash bonds being put in place.  What we were trying to get at here is that we do not have historic experience of this because we have only been lending since 2019.</p></speech>

What we see is exactly to the Chairman's point in that, in the vast majority of cases, the local authorities are insisting that a cash bond be provided.  What can we do as a lender?  We can, as part of the assessment, make sure our builders and developers can get access to the cash to provide the cash bond.  That is what we were trying to clarify in the note in question.  We understand there is an historical aspect but we have obviously been funding new developments only from 2019, with the vast majority having cash bonds in place.</p> <p>  On the point on small developments, I would love to see more applications for small developments because we have adequate funding available to support small and medium-sized builders in every county in Ireland.  I would love to see more developments.  We will try to do our bit to ensure there is awareness that we have the funding available.</p></speech>

I am not sure about the communication.  While I am sure HBFI has made some efforts, has the communication been adequate in order to reach the small builders?  They complain about not being able to get finance to get projects up and running.</p></speech>

We have a team out on the road going to local events.  We have our own events.  We were at two events in Tipperary in the past couple of weeks.  We will be in Galway next week.  Now, with the restrictions lifted, we can do more face-to-face work, which is more effective for some.  We also engage with the industry, through the representative body the Irish Home Builders Association, to make sure there is awareness, but I have no doubt that our job is not done if we do not have applications for funding from every county.  There is more we need to do to raise awareness.  If any builder or developer who is listening in any of the locations in question needs finance, we would love to hear from them.  That is what we are here to do.  We are here to try to help to alleviate the pressures that exist.</p></speech>

Silverwood estate in Mountmellick has a remaining bond of &euro;15,000.  That would not even open the ground to do what needs to be done.  Where does the money come from?  I could rattle off examples, including  Rushall in Mountrath.  Everybody else could give examples as well.  It is important that we do not keep recreating the same problems.</p></speech>

I will focus first on where a home is being built for sale to an owner-occupier.  In this regard, we consider two questions.  First, we ask whether the unit can be built for what the builder tells us it can be built for and whether it is reasonable for the given area.  The Deputy's colleague referred to construction costs.  Second, we ask whether there is proven demand in a location for units sold at the expected sale price.  That is how we assess it.</p></speech>

First, I want to put something in context for the committee so members will draw the right conclusions.  With regard to the sale price, there will be a contract in place meaning somebody will purchase the apartments we have funded through the three schemes we are talking about, under the momentum fund.  The person purchasing them is making an assumption that, in three years, the homes will be rented, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

I wanted to put the &euro;3,100 in context for the Deputy just in case.  This is not to say that the numbers are not high &mdash; they are &mdash; but, of the apartments for which funding has been provided, 27 are to have three bedrooms.  However, the figure is still very high for two bedrooms.  The figure we quoted earlier, &euro;2,100, which is the figure for the majority, is of course high, but-----</p></speech>

My understanding of HBFI's role was that it was to add to the market, be it through sales to local authorities directly or purchases by owner-occupiers.  I understood the aim was to release a flotilla of builders around the country who would add to the housing stock.  We are seeing a very different scenario.  In many ways, people feel the build-to-let sector is distorting the market in that the properties are not released for purchase.  Therefore, since the supply side is so constrained, people have no option but to rent even if they do not want to do so.  Many people want to rent but affordability is a big issue for them.</p> <p>  Does Ms Deering not accept that the momentum fund has, to a degree, distorted the market by targeting available money at an area in which HBFI's original purpose, which was to extend available funding to entities that could not get funding from traditional sources, was not being realised?</p></speech>

That is our objective and what we were set up to do.  That is why 70% of the funding we have provided to date is for owner-occupied properties, social housing or Part V housing.  Thirty percent of the homes are for private rental.  I appreciate that this is what we have spent a lot of our time discussing.</p></speech>

It should not matter where they are; it is a matter of having affordable housing available for people to buy or rent.  Looking at the map that HBFI provided that shows the locations of homes funded, I note there were 71 schemes altogether.  Of the 71, 45 were in Leinster.  Thirty of those were in the greater Dublin area.  I define that as Dublin and the three counties surrounding it.  You could add in Louth, which is equally in the commuter belt.  Adding it increases the number even further.  We are looking at four schemes in Galway and five in Mayo.  I would like to see the actual numbers &mdash; Deputy Verona Murphy might have asked about this &mdash; because circumstances change quite dramatically if there are 20 in one of the schemes as opposed to 150.</p></speech>

As I said to the Deputy's colleague, we will give a breakdown.  I have one but if I were to give it now, I would have to read out the figures on a county-by-county basis and I am sure the Deputy does not want me to use up time.  We will send the information to the committee.  I will also show the Deputy the number of applications we have received per county.  This relates to one of the challenges.  To get them to approval, we need to see more applications.</p><p>To get more applications, we have a role to play of course, as the Chairman said, in making sure there is awareness that we exist.  We want to fund schemes in every county.  The second challenge, however, which I cannot solve, in HBFI relates to viability.  Some of the reason for that housebuilding not happening cannot be solved by finance.  Of course, we would love to see more applications but we are seeing limited applications in the counties in which we have not funded.  Part of our role is to ensure people know we exist if building can happen in those areas and finance is constrained.</p></speech>

It keeps the rent up.  There is a large percentage of empty apartments at the rate of rents we are discussing here and yet we are funding that type of apartment.  Is that not strange?</p></speech>

If there are empty one-bedroom apartments at that level of rent, how can it be said there is a requirement for more?  Really, what is being done is ensuring rent stays up rather than reducing the rent and making the apartments available.  That level of corporate rent is being maintained and the related entities in business.  Mr. Alger should feel free if he wishes to comment on that point.</p> <p>  I find this extraordinary.  I have family living in Dublin who can tell me there are loads of empty apartments that should be rented.  We have problems with homelessness and a housing crisis but we have given the momentum fund over to the building of extraordinary one-bedroom apartments that will have an astronomical rent.  What will happen?  The witnesses cannot guarantee that these will be rented.</p></speech>

The institutes of technology end of year is 31 August.  The audit was only completed on 20 December 2021, which was 15 months after the end of the period of account.  The audit for Dublin City University was certified on 16 December for the period ending September 2020.  These are quite late being done.  In the case of Dublin City University, it has a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset and that is standard procedure for universities.</p> <p>  No. 3 is from the Royal Irish Academy of Music for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  No. 4 is from Grangegorman Development Agency for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  No. 5 is the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland for 2020.  It has a qualified audit opinion on a specific point.  The accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable, and that is standard procedure for many health bodies at the direction of the Minister.  No. 6 is from the Judicial Council.  This is the first set of financial statements for this new body.  The period of account is 17 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.  That has a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, are from subsidiaries of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  The first is from Greyhound Racing Operations Ireland Limited for 2020, for which there was a clear audit opinion.  No. 8 is from Abergrove Limited for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  No. 9 is from Shelbourne Greyhound Stadium Limited for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The final set is from the Residential Tenancies Board for 2020.  The Members will recall that there was an omission from the accounts that were previously submitted.  As the board said it would do last week, it has immediately resubmitted.</p></speech>

Do we agree to note the accounts?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of the minutes.</p> <p>  Moving to correspondence, as previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.</p> <p>  No. 1079 PAC33 is correspondence from the Government accounting unit, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 16 February 2022.  It encloses the minute of the Minister in relation to the committee&rsquo;s reports on our examination of the 2019 appropriation accounts of the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  These are important items of correspondence as they are the formal responses to the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item and to hold it over for further consideration today.  It has been flagged for discussion by Deputy Carthy.</p> <p>  This correspondence relates to the independent building standards regulator about which we made a recommendation.  Our recommendation related to the impact the pyrite remediation scheme and defective concrete blocks grant scheme would have on the Exchequer.  On page 3 of the response, it states, "However, it should be noted that any decision regarding the establishment of an independent building standards regulator will be a matter for Government and is likely to require primary legislation".  I believe we should be getting something more concrete - pardon the pun - than that.  It is either does or it does not.  What would be the timeline for that?  We could have done with a building standards regulator 50 year ago, never mind in recent times.  One can see the significant exposure that exists by not dealing with those kinds of issues and preventing them from occurring.  It becomes financially very expensive.  This is very important and we should follow up on it.</p> <p>  Page 4 states, "As part of the Building Control Reform Agenda the National Building Control Management Project was created to provide oversight".  I am not entirely sure what the purpose of that role is.  Is it responsible for the regulation of building and construction products?  Can we establish what the full remit of that project is?  This may be a matter we can come back to.  The first page states, "current expenditure on HAP and RAS is demand led".  That may well be an matter we will come back to in the context of budgets.</p><p>If we are going to have a sizeable influx of people from Ukraine, I imagine those budgets will need some additional funds.  </p></speech>

It states that contracts have been issued to the successful tenderer and that installation will now begin.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster has flagged this matter for comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#HH00400"><p>The correspondence we have received from the IHRB differs greatly from the previous correspondence we got from the same body in November 2021.  In that communication, it was stated that the installation of CCTV would have been completed at all the racecourses prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  The correspondence we have received now, however, states that an estimated date cannot be given to the committee.  It is ridiculous.</p> <p>  Can we write to the IHRB again and highlight that in prior correspondence it was able specify the start of this year, January 2022, as the date for commencement, while this most recent letter from it states that it is now not possible to estimate a date or timeframe.  I do not know what to make of this.  For some reason, the IHRB does not seem to be enthusiastic to roll out this CCTV system as fast as possible.  That is a concern.  Perhaps we could send the organisation copies of these two items of correspondence.  I refer to the one from November that stated this installation would be complete by the start of this year's season and this most recent communication stating a timeframe cannot now be given for this to be done.   </p></speech>

I have noted that no timeline was provided.  Could I also suggest that we ask, because we must clarify this aspect as well, whether this installation of CCTV involves all 25 racecourses.  My understanding is that it is installed at two racecourses now.  It was confirmed that one was completed, and another was under way some time back.  As far as I am aware, then, that leaves the remainder to be done.  If we are asking for a timeline in this regard and sending a copy of the previous correspondence we received in November, we should also clarify the number of racecourses involved and whether all 25 racecourses will have CCTV installed.</p></speech>

Okay.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1092B from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 21 February 2022 providing information requested by the committee regarding payments under the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The Secretary General states that the legislation provides that while the Department funds the schemes, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners administers it.  As the Minister for Finance brought forward the legislation, any policy decisions in relation to it are a matter for the Minister and the board of the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  We have also received related correspondence from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, R1096 PAC33, and from the Department of Finance, R1105 PAC33.  Revenue states that companies making distributions, including but not exclusive to dividends to shareholders, have obligations to deduct and return dividend withholding tax, DWT.  Regarding analysis, Revenue states that DWT returns filed by companies claiming EWSS, in respect of distributions made in 2021, showed that 641 employers filed DWT returns, out of a total of 51,900 who received EWSS payments.</p> <p>  The Department of Finance has provided a detailed response outlining some of the difficulties in legislating to link and prevent the payment of any dividends to shareholders that might be based on State supports.  For example, a dividend could be deferred until the company is no longer in receipt of such supports.  The Department also refers to an interdepartmental review of Covid-19 emergency income supports, and I would propose that we request a copy of the findings of that review. </p> <p>  I propose to note and publish this item, request a copy of that review, and also to forward copies of the three items of correspondence to Deputy Nash, who raised this matter with the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  These items are flagged for discussion by Deputy Imelda Munster, but she is not with us.  The concern was about where State money being paid out in emergency supports and subsidies would wind up.  We will do what I have just set out.  We will also forward a copy of the correspondence to Deputy Nash.  </p> <p>  The next item is-----</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I flagged this correspondence for discussion.  We must question a few points with the Department.  The letter we received stated that Ireland had set an ambitious target to have 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030.  I suggest that we need to reply and ask how that figure was arrived at.  Judging by the number of EVs on the road now, which is a fraction of that target figure, we are looking at a requirement to add well over 100,000 EVs every year until 2030, but the total number of new cars sold each year hardly reaches that figure.  Considering that EVs are also much more expensive, how realistic is that target of having 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030?   I suggest we should raise this aspect with the Secretary General, Mr. Spratt, to see where that figure is coming from and what it is based on.  </p> <p>  Another issue, and one I have raised before, is that approved battery electric vehicles, BEVs, with a listed price of less than &euro;14,000 will not receive a grant.  There is also a cap of &euro;60,000 on the purchase price of all vehicles.  We should perhaps raise a concern about the cap being so high.  While EVs are more expensive, it is possible to buy them for &euro;40,000 or less.  I note that the correspondence we received in response contained a list of the type of vehicles being bought under the grant scheme.</p><p>BMWs loom very large in it and there are some Jaguars and Land Rovers which are hugely heavy vehicles.  There are also loads of Mercedes.  In corresponding with the Department we must ask, in the context of the use of public money, if any consideration has been given to reducing that subsidy.  I do not wish to sound in any way anti those people within the commuter belt, but from the figures we have seen previously it appears that a lot of these cars are bought within the general Dublin area.  People who live further away are, by and large, not buying into electric vehicles because of range anxiety.  Do we have a situation here where people in rural areas are perhaps subsidising huge electric vehicles in the greater Dublin area?  Has the Department given, or is it giving, any consideration to reducing that subsidy limit to under &euro;60,000?  It seems very high.  Would any other member wish to come in on this?  No.</p><p> No. 1098B from Mr. John Dollard, Chief Superintendent, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dated 18 February 2022 provides information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement, including steps being taken to ensure that the operational needs on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are met within procurement rules and guidelines.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Members will be aware that we are scheduled to examine An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s appropriation account on 31 March so please let the clerk know if there are any specific issues or areas of interest on which members wish to receive briefing information in advance of the meeting.  This was flagged for discussion by Deputy Matt Carthy.  Does Deputy Carthy wish to come in?  No.  I take it he is okay with this.  The correspondence sets out the reasons, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s point of view, why there was some non-compliant expenditure during Covid.  We will have an opportunity to examine that further when the representatives are before the committee on 31 March.</p><p> No. 1099B from Ms Anne Graham, chief executive of the National Transport Authority, dated 22 February 2022 provides information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the NTA on 27 January 2022.  It runs to 22 pages and includes answers to 16 issues raised across a range of areas under the NTA&rsquo;s remit.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  It was flagged for discussion by Deputies Catherine Murphy, Matt Carthy and Imelda Munster.</p></speech>

The railway order for DART+ is for the Maynooth line and the Kildare line.  They are in a process.  One of the issues I raised with the NTA was the prospect of a parallel process for some additional extensions.  The argument made by the NTA is that if we were to go back to the beginning the process would be delayed.  There is no reason, however, that there could not be a separate process to add on some additional projects.  The DART+ south west project, for example, stops at Hazelhatch.  There is absolutely no reason why it could not go to Sallins or even to Newbridge, whether or not they have done any work in advancing that.  On the other line, it could go from Maynooth to Kilcock, at the very least.  The Dart+ West project is going to include the construction of eight large railway sheds in Kilcock.  Essentially, the Dart will be going to Kilcock and the only problem is that people would not be able to get on.  It seems like a daft idea that we would not be picking that low-hanging fruit.  There is not a whole lot in the way between Hazelhatch and Sallins and perhaps this could be asked for.  Since Covid, if one is listening to the traffic reports in the morning one is far more likely to hear about congestion on the periphery.  There has been a more dramatic change there with regard to delays.  It strikes me that these are projects that could be bolted onto those two DART+ projects.  We should be asking the NTA what work it has done to advance them so they could happen in parallel, albeit with a separate process.  We were speaking about electric cars.  The best way to move people around is on public transport, if that could be made available with more frequent services and so on, which would go with the DART+ projects.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.589" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022030300002#A00900"><p>I move amendment No. 2:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 8, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:  	&quot;(5) Within 12 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas that examines the establishment of a statutory skills register for the construction sector and sets out recommendations for reform in this area.&quot;.  </blockquote> <p>I welcome this Bill.  The amendments I have tabled seek only to strengthen and improve it.  A statutory skills register for the construction sector is important.  A register of builders is welcome, but the key reasons for this register are the difficulties we have had, which are well known, in terms of mica, pyrite, fire safety defects and construction defects, which have caused not only significant untold financial costs but human costs for people.  There are different reasons for this, including weaknesses in building controls and regulations, inspection of materials and, at times, deficits in terms of skills.  As part of the register of builders, we need a statutory skills register for the construction sector.  The Bill as drafted does not provide for that.</p><p>On Second Stage, the Minister legitimately made the point that it is necessary to have regard to experience as well as skills in terms of people that can access the existing register and that if we insisted only on skills it would have the effect of some people who have decades of experience and can do very good construction works and play a very important role not being able to register.  I understand that.  As of now, however, we are allowing only experience and not qualifications and certified skills to stand.  We need to move to having a statutory skills register of the professionalisation and qualifications that are needed.  Why would not that be done?</p><p>The amendment seeks that the Minister would lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 12 months of enactment.  That is very reasonable.  It is not a huge obligation, but it would provide us with a path forward on this issue.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022030300002#B00100"><p>As the Minister of State may or may not be aware, the idea of a statutory register is older than he is.  It started its life in a Law Reform Commission report recommending its creation in the 1970s.  The proposition was strongly resisted by the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and not only by its equivalent at the time but also by architects, engineers and chartered surveyors.  It died a slow death between the 1970s and 1980s and was revived only by the Minister of State's party colleague the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, when he produced his building control reform proposals after the Priory Hall issue arose.  It is an important proposal that would place all construction industry professionals on a statutory register and having a set of requirements to be able to trade and be a professional.  Having a formal complaints procedure for where people have been deemed to be in breach of the code and those criteria is important.</p> <p>  Two issues that relate to the amendments before us are very important.  There are many areas of construction where formalised skills are still not where most people in the industry would like them to be.  In the case of plastering, for example, there is a fairly mobile labour force from a variety of countries.  In many cases, on a building site where people come onto the site for work, they will not have to show a formal qualification but rather just demonstrate they can carry out the relevant plastering work and that may or may not suffice for the foreman or the contractor.  The difficulty, of course, is that creates the possibility for inadequate standards and workmanship.  I strongly agree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that the point is not to create a regime from the start that locks out people but instead is about moving towards circumstances in which there is a clear skills register in order that, when the registration body, which we will come to in the next amendment, is trying to determine whether the person is a qualified skilled professional to carry out that work, there will be a proper, statutory register against which those skills can be marked.</p> <p>  The other example that is important to mention relates to fire stopping.  The Minister of State will be aware from his knowledge of Celtic tiger-era building defects, particularly in apartments and duplexes, that fire stopping is one of the most common defects.  Currently, there is no skills requirement to place fire stopping in properties.  There is no course that has to be completed or qualification that has to be achieved, and that is one of the reasons, although not the only one, that fire stopping continues to blight the lives of thousands of homeowners and tenants in properties that were built without adequate fire stopping.  </p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment is eminently sensible and it will probably be easier for the Minister of State to support his amendment or a version thereof than it will be to support mine, given mine seeks to insert in the Bill a requirement for a statutory skills register.  Even if he will not accept either amendment, this is something that makes eminent sense.  I suspect both industry and the unions think it is a good idea and, therefore, I am keen to hear his response.  Without such a register complementing the construction industry register, the Bill will be much weaker.  Accordingly, I strongly support both my amendment and that of Deputy O'Callaghan.</p></speech>

I must oppose amendment No. 2, which would provide that the Minister shall provide a report examining the establishment of a statutory skills register.  The Bill provides for a register of providers of building works.  The competence criteria for registration in each division of the register are determined by the board and approved by the Minister and will be published on a website.  Section 29 provides that the Minister shall prescribe the required qualifications or experience or the combination of both that shall be required to be registered in a division.  These shall be set out in secondary legislation for each division of registration.</p> <p>  I must also oppose amendment No. 13, which seeks to insert the establishment of a skills register in the criteria to be included in a code of practice for registrants.  This is not relevant to this Part of the Bill and the competence criteria for each division of registration will be set out in legislation, as I described.</p></speech>

We are only at about 15% of the 2004 levels, or perhaps a little higher because the number has increased in the past year.  Even so, we are far off the apprenticeship levels there used to be in areas such as bricklaying, stonecutting, tiling and plastering, that is, the key wet trades in construction.  There are many issues with that but in particular, there is simply no requirement to have a qualification in plastering to work as a plasterer on a building site.  Some employers may look for it but in general, there is no requirement.  There is no incentive, therefore, for people to get the qualification given it is not required.</p> <p>  This has implications, not least in respect of defects, as was mentioned in the context of people not having the proper skills and qualifications, but also for productivity in building and for having enough people who are well trained and qualified.  While qualified people can achieve a better wage and income, they also are more productive and it will be better for efficiency.  As the Minister of State will be aware, we have a good distance to go in terms of productivity and efficiency in our construction sector.  I acknowledge that work is being done in that regard.</p> <p>  The Minister of State indicated that in a matter of time, that is, within the next few years, there will be skills requirements in these various trades such that in order for people to register, they will have to have these skills.  If someone comes to work from another jurisdiction, he or she will have to show evidence of those skills, as will be the case if someone comes from the Irish apprenticeship system.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The idea of a skills register is that it makes clear what the skills requirements are, and the register will be public and transparent, which is helpful both for employers and for contracting parties, whether they are large contractors, public agencies or individuals getting various kinds of construction work done.</p> <p>  My understanding is that within the construction sector working group, located in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and including representation from the Minister of State's Department, this is a matter under discussion.  While we did not expect him to warmly embrace our amendments, I would be somewhat comforted if he could give some indication as to whether the Department, in conjunction with the relevant other Departments through the construction sector working group, is actively considering such a skills register.  Is it something that is in the pipeline, to the Minister of State&rsquo;s knowledge?  The industry needs such a register, and creating it in parallel with the construction industry register would be complementary and would strengthen it.  I will not ask him to reiterate what he said about the amendments, given I acknowledge he will not accept them, but is anything else going on in the background with respect to this issue that he can share with us?</p></speech>

Section 8 is quite a bizarre section in the sense that it sets down the criteria that an organisation may meet to be designated as a registration body.  We all know who the registration body will be because that has already been decided and is a matter of public record.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has the non-statutory register.  At first take, it is almost like rather than just saying we are giving it to the CIF, we set down in law a set of criteria the CIF can meet and only an organisation such as it can meet, which strikes me as odd.</p><p>However, that is not the central problem here.  The CIF is not the right place for this register.  Any of us who have lived through or who have worked with families affected by defective buildings know that in particular for that industry, the very last place to put a register of this kind is within the lobby organisation for those same organisations and individual contractors that this register will cover.</p><p>There is a long-standing tradition here, in Britain and elsewhere that we have these almost Victorian gentlemen's self-regulatory bodies.  We have it with architects, surveyors, engineers, etc.  That is a fundamentally flawed model and one can see that, for example, when one looks at the level of complaints and sanctions against members registered in some of those bodies but particularly with construction and particularly because one of the great values of a statutory register is that it will give the public confidence that we should not have a return to the same levels of defective workpersonship as we have in the past.  Locating this in the lobby organisation, albeit with some Chinese walls and some issues around governance and the board, makes no sense to me.</p><p>It is also very hard to understand given that the Minister of State's predecessor created a body which is much better suited to be the location of this, which is the National Building Control Office, NBCO.  For those members of the committee who do not know its good work, it was set up specifically to try to support, enhance and improve building control functions in local authorities.  If one were to take a longer-term view, the NBCO authority is exactly the kind of body that one would progressively build into a much larger and more effective building control and consumer protection agency, not unlike the Food Safety Authority, the Environmental Protection Agency, etc.</p><p>Therefore, my amendment, inelegant as it is, and I am sure the Minister of State will tell me all about the technical inadequacies of my drafting, and that is okay, is more to make a crucial point here, which is this should not be located in the CIF.  That is not disrespect to the good people of the CIF.  Its job is to represent, lobby for and advocate on behalf of its members.  However, if we want the public to have absolute confidence that this register is fully independent of industry and that it would be administered without fear or favour, then the right place is the NBCO.  That will place challenges, as the NBCO only has a small number of staff and has only been recently established.  However, given that it exists, I see no reason that this function would not be given to it and that is why I am pressing this amendment.</p></speech>

Of the whole Bill, this is the area that I have the biggest issues with.  My amendment is slightly different in that it looks to remove a number of the potential non-State bodies that this could be applied to.  It as not as specific as Deputy &Oacute; Broin's amendment is, although his suggestion that this would be a function for the NBCO is a very good one.  The NBCO needs to be beefed up into a national building control authority, like the Food Safety Authority, and given similar powers.  I do not see any reason that this would not be done straightaway.  This is no disrespect to the CIF, but it is very specifically a lobby group for the industry.  Therefore, if we want to have public confidence in this registration body, it is very important that it is not, as this legislation allows, run by industry lobby groups.  That is flaw in the legislation.  It should be a State agency.</p> <p>  Huge distress has been caused by building defects and I know we all have these issues in our own constituencies.  Priory Hall is in mine, and the family of Fiachra Daly is in my area and I know them well.  For us not to do this as well as we possibly could do it, in terms of establishing independence, does not make sense.  I would strongly urge the Minister of State to accept our amendments on this.  The NBCO would be the right place for this and it needs to be beefed up into a national building control authority.  That is the other piece of the jigsaw that would go well with register, that is, if we had a statutory national building control authority.  The Minister has indicated that he is working on legislation on that, which is positive.  This definitely should be a function of that agency.</p></speech>

I will address amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  Section 8 of the Bill provides that the Government may make an order appointing a body to perform the functions of the registration body.  It sets out that the body can be a public body or otherwise and it provides that the body must be capable of performing the functions conferred.</p> <p>  I must oppose amendment No. 3, which seeks to provide that the NBCO will be appointed as the registration body.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the Bill should not name the body that is to be appointed as the registration body in the Bill.  Where a body appointed is not performing the functions required, another entity may be appointed to perform the functions of the registration body under the Bill without any amendment being required to the primary legislation. </p> <p>  I must also oppose amendment No. 4, which seeks to only allow a public body to perform the functions of the registration body.  It is preferable that a body with experience and expertise in the construction industry performs this function, similarly to how the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, operate statutory registers for architects and surveyors.</p> <p>  It is envisaged that the CIF will be appointed as the registration body.  There are a number of safeguards in place to ensure and maintain the independence of the registration body.  The registration body will have delegated responsibility for the day-to-day maintenance of the register within the confines of the specific and limited parameters set out in the Bill.  The board of the registration body will be completely independent of the body in the performance of its functions.  The independence of the registration body will be maintained through the following measures: all powers of the registration body will be prescribed in legislation; all competency requirements for registration will be recommended by the board and prescribed by the Minister; the board will make decisions in relation to all sanctions, including removal from the register; removal from the register must be confirmed by the High Court; all prosecutions under the Act will be taken by the board or the director of public prosecutions; all members of the appeals committee will be independent from the board and the registration body; and the Bill allows the functions of the registration body to be transferred if the body is not performing its functions satisfactorily.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022030300002#D00100"><p>I like that word "envisaged".  If the Deputy had said "decided", it would have been more accurate because we know it has been decided but I will not quibble over that word.  The problem is this register will be located in the same building as the Construction Industry Federation.  It will be staffed in the main by staff from the CIF.  If people have to make telephone calls to the registration body or go to meet it, that will be channelled through the infrastructure of the CIF.</p> <p>  A crucial point is that in order to restore absolute confidence that we are never going back to the bad old days of the Celtic tiger the legislation not only has to ensure it is fully independent and competent to its functions but the public has to be able to have confidence in it.  The perception is as important as the reality.  Have any cases been taken against any contractors under the voluntary register?  I do not think they have.  Have any sanctions been applied to remove people from the voluntary register?  I do not think they have.  If the Minister of State has figures in that regard, I would be very keen for him to share them.  Basing it on the same model we have for the Society of Chartered Surveyors, for example, or the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, is a flawed approach.  That approach has all sorts of problems.</p> <p>  The Government has a programme for Government commitment to actively examine the recommendations of the previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report on building control and consumer protection, Safe as Houses?.  One of the things that report strongly recommended was a stand-alone building control and consumer protection agency which would be the location for, among other things, the construction industry register.  A review was recently undertaken of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I know the report has not yet been published but it has been so widely leaked I think most of us have read it at this stage.  That report makes some sensible recommendations for how to transform that agency from a function of the Department through a number of phases to, at some point in the future, become a fully independent body.  That is the report's recommendation and I support it fully.  This Bill would have been the ideal opportunity to do that with the NBCO.  </p> <p>  I have a two-part question for the Minister of State and I will not repeat the questions which prompted the technical answer he has given us.  Why does he believe the CIF is the right place to locate this register?  If it is about skills and competence in the building industry, the officials in the NBCO have just as many skills and as much knowledge of the good, bad and ugly of the industry.  Likewise, why does the Minister of State not believe the NBCO would be the right place?  It just makes eminent sense.  It is fine that the Attorney General has advised that the legislation should not name the organisation.  I am sure there are ways of doing it.  I am at a loss to understand why this is the proposition but I will hazard a guess.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State or his officials but given the long history of opposition to a statutory register by the construction industry, in particular, the CIF, I suspect that at a time long before the Minister of State and I were elected to this House, a compromise was reached in order to get the CIF on board with the proposition of a register that it would be located with the federation.  That was likely the trade-off to allow the proposal to progress.  If I am correct in that, and one day we will get the documents under freedom of information to establish whether that is true, it is a very bad proposition.  This register should be independent and should be seen to be independent and, therefore, I think the spirit of my amendment, if not the technical quality of it, stands.  That is why I will continue to press it.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin's amendment is very good but my amendment comes at this from a different point of view.  It does not name the public agency that would be involved but it would confine it to a public agency, which I think makes sense.  We have not heard the rationale from the Minister of State as to why he thinks it is necessary to include in the legislation the possibility that the registration body could be an organisation such as the CIF.  In fact, the specific lines in the Bill are written in such a way as to ensure the CIF meets the criteria but another body may not.  Those lines are quite specific in that regard.  Why, for instance, must the body to be designated the registration body have been in existence for a continuous period of not less than ten years?  That certainly rules the CIF in.  What is the rationale for this legislation barring a body that has only existed for five years but is totally competent?  What is the rationale for that?  Why does it have to be a body corporate which is not a company but has not fewer than 300 members?  It is quite detailed and seems to specifically set out criteria that the CIF happens to fit.  Why is that necessary?  Given that my amendment does not name a specific public body but would mean that it must be a public body, why is there an objection to my amendment?  Certainly the Attorney General's advice about not naming a particular body does not cover that.  I would like to believe that what Deputy &Oacute; Broin was saying is not the case and no such deal on this issue was done years ago.  It would be useful for us to get confirmation, if possible, that is not the case.  We need an explanation as to why this wide approach is being taken when there is a really good public body that could be doing this job.</p> <p>  The NBCO has considerable expertise.  It comprises a small group of people and that needs to be increased and beefed up.  However, it is playing a very valuable role.  It plays a value-added role in what it does in terms of building control and the knowledge and expertise it is helping to spread between local authorities and building control authorities.  I am at a loss as to why that is not the route being taken or earmarked in this legislation.</p></speech>

In the main, it would obviously be compliant members who registered on the voluntary register.  It is unfair to make some of the suggestions that have been made.  The reason infringements are lower and cases are not taken against members is that it is a voluntary register.</p> <p>  The Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors are known to have views on public policy.  There is nothing wrong with any organisation or entity putting its views across on public policy.  The CIF already has an established register.  It has the required skills and competence to undertake the role.  It is going to be underpinned by strong and robust legislation, with an independent board to ensure it is operated correctly.</p> <p>  As I outlined, there are safeguards if the registration body is not performing to the criteria set out in legislation.  The independent building standards regulator is being worked upon by the Government as well.  It has advanced under the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  In all these various areas, we have, and will have, a strengthened approach to protect citizens.  My rationale is clear.  There is precedent there with other bodies which have views on public policy.  There is an independent board with strong safeguards to ensure citizens will be protected.  Under the legislation, there are parameters to change the position if the registration body is not carrying out its function appropriately.</p></speech>

I am not at all casting aspersions on any contractor but we simply do not know.  The number of complaints and strike-offs on the registers of architects and chartered surveyors is tiny.  In fact, when we did pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill in 2017 or 2018, the committee was surprised when we brought in representatives of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and others to show us the extent to which the complaints procedure had operated.</p> <p>  There is also another big difference, and I think this a fair point to make.  In the main, architects and surveyors did not leave the trail of destruction in our cities, towns and villages that a section of the construction industry did in the 1990s and 2000s.  That is a fair point to make and we know that to be the case.  There is a particular problem in sections of the CIF.</p><p>A lot of good work has been done, including by party colleagues of the Minister of State, in trying to clean up that industry and to improve the regulatory framework.  Credit where credit is due.  We are at a point where there are currently two working groups in the Department, one looking at a revised defective concrete blocks scheme, which is a slightly separate issue to this, but the other is looking at building defects, which is directly related to the Bill.  There is a significant question mark over whether the industry should be allowed to regulate itself.  First, that point must be made.  I still have not heard the Minister of State say why he thinks this organisation is the right one.  I hear him say the organisation needs to be competent, experienced and knowledgeable and I accept all of those points, but I have yet to hear somebody explain to me why the Construction Industry Federation itself would oversee it.</p><p> CIF does have a slightly different function in public policy from the two institutes the Minister of State mentioned; they are not primarily lobby organisations, they are primarily professional bodies that provide a host of supports and services to their members.  In fact, they are often very reluctant to give their views on matters and are much more circumspect.  We know, in particular under previous Governments but not under the current or previous Administration, the Construction Industry Federation was a semi-political body that in fact spent most of its time in direct political lobbying not the affairs of a professional body in the same way that those two other institutes are.  I will not speak beyond this contribution, but I invite the Minister of State to say why in his opinion CIF is the best body and why the National Building Control Office is not an appropriate body for this purpose.</p></speech>

Second, it is unfair to cast aspersions on the voluntary register in terms of infringements because of its voluntary nature and the fact that people are mostly compliant.  Third, as I also pointed out, it has the skill sets and reference.  Fourth, and critically, it is underpinned by an independent board, which is carrying out the administration functions.  The Government is clearly setting the policy and parameters by which the register would work, and the criteria are set down strongly in primary and secondary legislation, as I set out in my initial response.</p></speech>

There is a bit of a contradiction here.  We are being told that the Construction Industry Federation is the appropriate body to run the statutory register because of its experience of running the voluntary register.  That is valid.  At the same time, we are being told that we cannot read anything into the fact that nobody has been struck off, because it is a voluntary register and most of the people who apply to be on it are more likely to be compliant.  By its very nature and the explanation the Minister of State has given us of the voluntary register, he has explained to us how the experience of enforcing compliance is lacking in a body running a voluntary register.  He has clearly made the case therefore as to why running a voluntary register does not give a body a lot of experience with enforcement and compliance issues.  As we know, the National Building Control Office has significant experience relating to building control, enforcement, and compliance because that is its skill set.  That is what it does.  The case for the National Building Control Office rather than the Construction Industry Federation is incredibly clear.  The Minister of State has helped to make that case as well in his comments.</p></speech>

As I have said, I looked and all I could find was that debate from almost 100 years ago in 1928 where various Deputies were not happy that it was a properly defined term.  They were quite clear, even 100 years ago, that they felt it was quite a loose definition, and that the concepts of what is public morality and what is not can shift and can be open to different interpretations.  If there is another basis for that definition I would like to hear it.  I really just want to know, in a legislative context, what exactly does this mean and what the definition is based on.  I will not push this very heavily but I am trying to find out what the Bill is trying to achieve with this.</p></speech>

I am told that in other pieces of legislation this is a standard clause, in line with the Charities Act 2009 for example.  That is my advice here.</p></speech>

All I could find was references in a 1928 D&aacute;il debate where it was used in legislation back then, I believe for the first time.  There was a lot of objection to the use of the term, with people saying that it was a very loose definition.  In those D&aacute;il debates there was really no definition settled on or given to it at all.</p></speech>

They all relate to appointments by the Minister.  In the first instance, it is the person under section 9 who would be appointed by the Minister to carry out periodic inspections, reviews, audits, etc.  It relates to the appointments of the chair of the board, the chairperson of the appeals committee and the ordinary members of the appeals committee.</p><p>We have had this discussion probably every time we have had legislation.  My strong view is the legislation should require the use of the Public Appointments Service, PAS.</p><p> To the credit of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, every time he has made an appointment, he has made it through the Public Appointments Service.  The issue is not that this Minister has an issue with it.  The problem is he has colleagues in the Government who have not done that and have chosen people outside the Public Appointments Service.</p><p> There are two reasons it is important to stipulate it in the legislation.  The first is that is what should be done.  The second is that the people who are ultimately appointed will be protected, from a public perception point of view, if they have gone through the more rigorous process of PAS rather than being a direct ministerial appointee.</p><p> I can guess the Minister's response that this is standard language, there is a protocol and Ministers use the Public Appointments Service.  Of course, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, does but, very recently, one of his colleagues did not and that is why I am still of the view the standard formula in legislation should change and should specify the Public Appointments Service.  I see no reason not to do this given that is what Government is meant to do anyway.  On that basis, I press all four amendments.</p></speech>

I must oppose amendment No. 6.  This section of the Bill allows the Minister to appoint a person to carry out periodic inspections, reviews and audits with regard to the performance of the registration body and to furnish a report.  The "person" in this instance is likely to be a professional body or a professional auditing body and, therefore, it is not appropriate that they are appointed through the Public Appointments Service.  All such appointments will be in line with public procurement procedures.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 18 seeks to have the chairperson of the board appointed through the Public Appointments Service.  Amendment No. 24 seeks to have the chairperson of the appeals committee appointed through the Public Appointments Service.  Amendment No. 25 seeks to have the members of the appeals committee appointed through the Public Appointments Service.</p> <p>  At this stage, I cannot accept these amendments.  However, I am minded to review the proposals that the appointments will be made through the Public Appointments Service.  I am also minded to review the proposal contained in amendment No. 24 that the chairperson of the board should have specific knowledge and experience relevant to construction and building regulations.</p> <p>  However, at this stage, I must oppose amendments Nos. 6, 18, 24 and 25 but I will bring fresh proposals back on this section on Report Stage.</p></speech>

It seeks that where inspections, reviews or audits and reports are furnished to the Minister by a person who is appointed by the Minister to carry out the reviews of the registration body, that report be furnished to this committee, as well as the Minister.  If it is furnished directly to this committee, that will ensure an extra level of accountability.  If there are issues in that report that need to be discussed by this committee, we are given a greater opportunity to do so, in terms of transparency and accountability.  Given a new statutory body is being set up and its importance, that extra layer of accountability makes sense.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 10 relates to section 17 of the Bill which is about the annual report.  It calls for the annual report to be furnished directly to this committee.  I appreciate that it would probably be available in any event, but there is a difference.  If it is sent directly, in a practical sense, it means it comes to everybody's attention.  It is in the correspondence list.  People are more likely to read it, scrutinise it and, if issues arise from it, they are more likely to be captured and given appropriate attention.  I will not oppose the Bill, if the Minister does not accept these amendments, but this is good practice and I ask him to accept them.</p></speech>

In addition to responding to the amendments, I will ask the Minister of State to clarify some aspects of that section for my benefit, if not for the benefit of anybody else.  It states: "The registration body may arrange with any person to assist it, the Board or a committee of the Board, in the proper discharge of its functions."  Obviously, the drafters of the legislation have something relatively specific in mind.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on the kinds of persons, organisations or assistance?</p> <p>  My amendment, amendment No. 9, relates to section 18(3).  The nature of the provision struck me as very broad.  It states: "The registration body may make rules for facilitating and discharging its functions and the functions of the Board or a committee of the Board."  I would have thought the making of the rules would have been more appropriate for the Minister, Government or some such body.  Maybe it is the nature of these rules are of a different order and, therefore, they do not require an outside individual such as the Minister of State or Government.</p><p>However, I would prefer to see some level of requirement for engagement with the Minister and the Oireachtas on the setting of rules.</p><p> Amendment No. 12 relates to how there are still significant question marks in the public arena over sections of the construction industry.  Therefore, I am sure that part of the Minister of State's response will be that there is nothing to stop the Oireachtas committee from asking the industry to attend and speak to it.  Having a statutory requirement increases the significance of that, though.  While my amendment No. 9 is much more significant, having a formal requirement to engage with the committee would be appropriate.</p></speech>

It is appropriate that this report, which is a review of the performance of the registration body, should be provided to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I can accept amendment No 8.</p> <p>  I must oppose amendment No. 9, which proposes that the registration body may only make rules following consultation with the Minister and the Oireachtas.  The Bill provides that the board and the appeals committee will be independent of the registration body.  Schedule 2 sets out detailed procedures and rules for the operation of the board and appeals committee and these cannot be amended by the registration body.  Parts 2, 5 and 6 of the Bill set out rules and procedures for the operation of the registration body.  Again, these cannot be amended by the registration body.  The registration body cannot make rules that are contrary to the statutory functions as outlined in the Bill.  The only rules that the registration body can make are procedural and administrative in nature and as I have outlined.  They cannot be outside the statutory provisions of the Bill.  This amendment seeks to have the registration body consult with the Minister and the Oireachtas on the making of such administrative rules.  This is not required, as the registration body is circumscribed by the provisions of the Bill.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 10 seeks to require the body to furnish its annual report to the Oireachtas committee and amendment No. 12 requires the registration body to seek the views of the relevant Oireachtas committee on that annual report.  The report is required to be laid before the Oireachtas and published on a website.  As such, it will be available to the committee.  Any Oireachtas committee can provide its views on such a report as it requires.</p> <p>  Regarding the query on section 18(1), this relates to the normal administrative procedures if the body needs assistance in preparing its annual report or the like.</p></speech>

So that we are clear on the procedural rules, perhaps it would be helpful if the Minister of State gave a practical example.  The example he gave in respect of section 18(1) was clear - the board may require certain kinds of professional supports - but what types of procedural rules are we discussing?  I presume the officials have a specific understanding.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State has not hit his head against a hard object and decided to support our amendment, then he might at least consider discussing the matter with his colleagues and others at a later stage, given that this is a real issue.</p><p>When we speak to construction industry professionals, one of the points they make to us is that there need to be more opportunities for upskilling, retraining and diversifying.  One of the weaknesses of our construction sector is that there are not enough career progression opportunities, particularly to attract young men and women into the sector with clear career pathways that allow them to build and grow their skill sets and, therefore, their terms and conditions of employment, rates of pay etc.  Therefore, the need for greater access to the National Training Fund for upskilling construction sector workers is important.</p><p>If the register is at its very core about ensuring best practice and improving standards, then the broad principle of this amendment, which is about accessing the fund in the first instance, but, more importantly, upskilling construction sector workers currently in the profession and those we would like to see enter into it, is quite important.  This amendment was really to give me an opportunity to raise that with the Minister of State but also perhaps for him to provide an update, if he can, on any work his Department is doing with other Departments and the construction sector working group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is obviously discussing this issue as well.</p></speech>

We will, however, provide an update to Deputy &Oacute; Broin in the form of a note on the work that is ongoing with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p> <p>  Amendment 15 suggests including the phrase &ldquo;adherence to the requirements of the Building Regulations&rdquo; in the code of practice.  The code of practice is for the purpose of the continued improvement in the professional development and conduct of builders on building works.  The amendment suggested by the Deputies is not appropriate in this section.  Part 4 of the Bill outlines the competence criteria which will determine eligibility for registration.  These include adherence to the building regulations in section 28.  This has already been provided for in the Bill.</p></speech>

I have spoken to a number of medium-sized contractors in different parts of the country.  One of the concerning things they told me was that they are beginning to notice a drop-off in the number of young people who are entering into a variety of construction industry professions.  When I asked them the reason, because they are talking to people and trying to recruit them into the industry, they said the nature of the work and additional stress of, for example, travel times and insecurity between jobs compared with the lack of career progression and new opportunities to upskill and develop, is a real problem.  We might look at countries that do this really well.  Scotland, for example, has made great strides in recent years in providing good-quality career progression and upskilling.  Germany is probably one of the best in terms of its career path progression.  It is really important.  I look forward to reading the note.</p> <p>  With respect to the code of practice, I must say that I do not agree with the argument against it insofar as building regulations are changing quite a lot.  They change all the time, which is a good thing, and they will continue to change.  In terms of the code of practice, I would have thought it made eminent sense to have it here.  I have tabled amendments elsewhere in which I would like building regulations inserted as well but I can see no reason why not to put it here.  If this register is to be of real value, continued improvement has to mean continued improvement in adherence to the requirements of building regulations.  I will go back, for example, to the areas in which we had some of the most significant fire safety defects.  In some of those areas, there are no requirements to have any training or continued improvement because there is no skills requirement at all.  Fire stopping and fire safety works is one clear example.</p> <p>  This is one amendment I would really ask the Minister of State to reconsider.  Again, perhaps my wording is not elegant enough or there is a better way to do it but it would be remiss not to have some reference to building regulations in the code of practice.</p></speech>

The officials are of the view that this is not the appropriate place considering what is in section 28 and also section 39 in reference to continuous professional development.</p></speech>

I have a question which will determine whether I press the amendment, which is just to clarify two elements of section 21.  I first want to clarify the function of the inspectors for the purposes of the meeting.  Second, where it says &ldquo;such members of its staff&rdquo;, am I right in saying that means the staff of the registration body, which, as we know, is the Construction Industry Federation?  I might get the Minister of State to answer those two questions and, with the indulgence of the Chair, I will respond.  I think I know the answer but I would like the Minister of State to put it on the record.</p></speech>

It is  appropriate that an inspector would operate independently while performing these functions and that they have the experience and competence to perform these functions.  However, I wish to review the proposed wording in further detail and, following input from our legal drafters, we will bring forward a revised amendment that will reflect the policy outlined in this proposal.</p></speech>

This again goes back to that point about the need for an independent process.  I would find it completely unacceptable that staff members of the Construction Industry Federation - who, and we made the point strongly earlier, are also lobbyists for the industry - would also have the role of inspectors, whether it is to comply with the terms of the register or in any other areas.  This is one area where I really would impress upon the Minister of State to come back and ensure they would be fully independent and not staff members.  If that was the case, it would be a very positive development.</p></speech>

The key issue for me here is the independence of the inspectors.  I am coming at it from a slightly different angle to Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I am taking a broader view.  Obviously, people who have the competence, the expertise and the skills in this area presumably will have been employed in the industry before, and will have done previous work with people who will then be getting inspected, so that independence in their role is very important.  We want them to have that expertise and experience and we also want them to have that independence, but that can be somewhat contradictory.  It is not automatic to have both of those because people will gain a lot of experience and skills from working in the industry, and that is going to mean working for commercial bodies and everything else.  However, while they are in this role, they have to be independent and it is very important that this is explicit in the legislation in order that it is achieved.  I very much welcome the Minister of State's commitment in this regard.</p></speech>

It is another part of the legislation where I have a lot of concern.

I think that should be by appointments.  If it continues to be the Construction Industry Federation, for example, I would have a problem with half of the board coming from that quarter and it would be better if they were ministerial appointments.  The previous amendments from Deputy &Oacute; Broin proposing that this goes through the Public Appointments Service are very important.  It is also important to say that the pre-legislative scrutiny report on this made recommendations and while there was some movement towards those in the drafting of the Bill, I do not think they were fully taken on board.  I think this is a better structure for the board and it means half of its members will not come from the Construction Industry Federation side.  It is important that other skills and interests are reflected on the board and this lays out the structure for those.</p></speech>

It has a representative role for people working in the sector but it is also very important that the interests of homeowners are reflected.  As a representative body of union members, it reflects the interests of homeowners as well as people working in the industry, in that broader policy context as a social partner.  That is a useful way of ensuring there is some structured representation on the board.  The amendments from Deputy &Oacute; Broin on this are very good and I would be happy with those proposals as well.</p></speech>

I will outline my objections to the section and then propose my alternative.  I see no reason the chair of the board should exclusively be any of the four categories stated, namely, a former judge, a practising solicitor, a practising barrister or a registered construction professional.  I do not think a registered construction professional should be the chair of the board full stop.  That makes no sense whatsoever and would create the perception, at best, that the board does not have the level of independence required if the chair is a registered construction professional who is practising in the industry.  With regard to being a practising solicitor or barrister, it is a bit like the list of people on a passport form who were deemed to be of sufficient good standing in the community to be able to sign the form.  I do not know if those lists are still on the forms but barristers and solicitors were on them.  These could be solicitors or barristers who have no knowledge of the areas in question.  It is likewise for a judge.  I do not understand why, given the particular functions of the chair of a board, it would be restricted to that group of people.  That is the first problem I have with this section.</p> <p>  Second, 15 is a large board for a register.  This is not a corporation or a body that has huge functions.  It has very limited and narrow scope and that is one of the weaknesses of the register.  Fifteen is too large a number.  Ten would seem much more appropriate for it to conduct its functions very efficiently.  There are five appointees by the Minister and five persons who are nominated for such appointment by the registration body, of whom at least two are registered construction professionals.  Why should the registration body be able to appoint a third of the board and why should two be practising professionals?</p> <p>  What I am proposing is basically a complete replacement of this section.  We have already dealt with my alternative amendment for the chair of the board so I will not return to that but I think ten is an appropriate number.  I know the Minister of State will not accept this proposal but I ask him to deliberate a little on it.  In order to ensure we have the right range of people with the right skills, we need a combination of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and nominating bodies.  It would be a little like what happens currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There would be ten nominating bodies, which could nominate one, two, three four or five people as they saw fit.  Those people would then have to go through the Public Appointments Service to be interviewed and approved in that manner.</p> <p>  The reason I have listed the organisations here is that there is clearly a strong argument for the inclusion of the relevant Departments, including those of the Minister of State and his counterparts.  It is logical for the National Building Control Office to nominate a person or persons who would then go through the PAS.  It is reasonable for both the employers and the trade unions to have nominating rights.  There is also a role for the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland and the Irish Planning Institute, and I have also included the Construction Defects Alliance, which is the representative body for homeowners affected by Celtic tiger era defects.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has appointed that organisation to the working group on building defects, which was a very positive move.  That was not done for the previous working group on defective blocks or pyrite.  This amendment does two things.  It makes sure that Departments, professional bodies and affected homeowners have a pathway to membership on the board but there is also the robust mechanism of the Public Appointments Service to ensure they are fully qualified and are the best people for the job.  The board would then have the merit of being a more representative, more qualified and more skilled body, as verified by PAS.  It would also be slightly smaller and streamlined.  In the current section 22, there is an in-built majority on the board, whereas this would have a much more independent flavour to it.  The Government is saying it wants to achieve that independence and my amendments facilitate that.</p></speech>

I and the Labour Party support his amendments.  We did not have the opportunity to table any amendments in this area ourselves but we may table some on Report Stage.  I want to notify the committee of that.  I am particularly interested in whether the Minister of State believes there should be a form of statutory entitlement for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to be represented on the board, for the reasons Deputy O'Callaghan pointed out.  It is Ireland's largest civil society organisation North and South and is organised on a 32-county basis.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is very active, especially in the last few years, on the question of housing and the right to housing.  I know from my own work over the years, including legislative and representational work, and my involvement with the trade union movement, that nobody is more skilled at identifying issues than those who actually work in the sector professionally, such as skilled craftspeople, general operatives and others.  There is genuinely a function here for that expertise in the first instance.  Given how significant housing is to our society more broadly and the construction sector more generally, there is also a function here for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I hope the Minister of State will concede that.  We can assume he will not support the amendment but I would be interested in a clarification as to where he stands on that idea of an entitlement for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to be represented, for all the reasons we have pointed out.</p></speech>

Given the complex nature of the work that will be carried out here, the chair will need significant legal and other skill sets because the gravity of the decisions this body will be making in terms of limiting an individual's right to work is very significant.</p> <p>  I must, unfortunately, oppose all of these proposed amendments, Nos. 19 to 23, inclusive.  However, I am minded to review the proposals that the appointments be made through the Public Appointments Service.  I am also minded to review the proposals that certain skills and expertise should be a prerequisite for membership of the board.  On amendment No. 22, I agree with the policy intention that specialist expertise is required and that certain bodies, including the registration body, should nominate persons to be members of the board.  In light of this and the discussion we have had, we will review section 22 of the Bill and bring forward amendments on Report Stage.</p></speech>

That is genuinely a positive thing.  We would be more than open to some alternative formulation of this amendment.  I agree with Deputies O'Callaghan and Nash about the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  There is a whole set of concerns for workers working for registered companies but there is also the very significant issue of bogus self-employment.  There are many people who, even though they do not want to be registered and would like to be PAYE workers, will essentially be forced to register because they are forced to operate as sole traders.  Their voice is a very different voice and their interests are very different interests from those of actual registered construction industry professionals.</p><p>As a result, I think the ICTU representative, in particular, would be important.</p><p> I take this opportunity to re-emphasise, and know the Minister hears the point I am making, the importance of the National Building Control Office and the building control regulations being a much more public part of this process.  That is really key.  I hope that those two elements come are placed in the foreground in the Minister of State's deliberations between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

It also relates to the discussion we just had.  The purpose of the amendment is to delete the provision whereby half of the members of the appeals committee would be appointed by the registration body.  It is the same principle.  The legislation sets out that if the register continues to be run by the CIF, then half the members of the appeals committee will be appointed by the federation.  For public confidence in the entire process, including appeals, it would be far preferable that half the nominees to the appeals committee could not potentially come from an industry lobby group.  I see no reason why half need to come from the registration body, which, I presume, will continue to be the CIF.</p></speech>

It may be that I do not understand the intention.  I hope that the Minister of State can clarify the position.  Section 24(12) refers to an appeal being considered in public unless the chairperson of the appeals committee, a division of the committee or whatever "determines that, due to the existence of special circumstances, the appeal (or part of it) should be conducted otherwise than in public".  I do not see where special circumstances is listed or prescribed.  Who gets to decide what those special circumstances are?  Given that we are talking about what are potentially very significant allegations against somebody's professional conduct or compliance with the terms of the register, I would have thought that these appeals always being in public would have been the most obvious thing for both parties.  Say someone was appealing in good faith because they thought that they had been wrongly determined initially, I would have thought that they would want the opportunity to do so in public.  While it is not completely comparable, I am thinking of the Residential Tenancies Board in terms of appeals and the publication of information.  The more transparency here, the better.  I may have misunderstood the provision.  Perhaps if the Minister of State clarifies it more, I can reconsider the amendment.  At this time, however, I think that any appeal should be considered in public.</p></speech>

In general, appeals shall be held in public.  However, special circumstances may exist, through the determination of the chairperson and the board, on issues that may be contractual or may have sensitive information attached to them.  That would have to be adjudicated by the board.  I am advised by our officials that it is needed for issues that are potentially sensitive.</p></speech>

Some of what the Minister of State said could sound eminently reasonable.  Unless the circumstances are prescribed somewhere else and not here, however, I think that it gives too wide a latitude.  Is there an intention to prescribe this by way of regulations?  Is it somewhere else in the Bill that I have missed?  If not, how much latitude will the appeal board or division of the board have in terms of determining the special circumstances may be?</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State not think that there should be some way of providing a framework or guide to the board in making those decisions.  It seems to be too broad.  The Minister of State and I can have a nice conversation here about what we interpret it as being.  He is confirming that nowhere in legislation or regulations will there be a definition or an attempt to provide at least the outer limits of what that definition may be.  That then gives the board a pretty wide berth of what may or may not be applicable.  For example, and we all know this from experience of freedom of information, commercial sensitivity could be a special circumstance, but should commercial sensitivity trump public transparency about a decision about a construction industry?  In many cases these could be large companies.  There could be all sorts of questions around potential defects or defective practices, non-compliance with the register, etc.  I am not saying that I do not accept that there may be special circumstances but I would like a clear idea of what they are and for the board to have some limits on how they determine those.</p></speech>

My view is that when you have an independent board that has the skill set, it will be acting in the public interest, especially when they are being appointed and we have committed to the board having the required skills and experience to enable it to discharge its functions.  It provides a significant safeguard with regard to how the decision will be adjudicated in an independent manner and it will be in the public interest.  That would be my view.  It is very difficult to try and frame in legislation exactly what should and should not happen regarding a contract or a sensitive issue.  It is almost like asking "How long is a piece of string?"</p></speech>

Obviously, a lot of what the register is about is ensuring that those people who are engaged in that process are properly qualified and meet all of the relevant criteria.  The poor relation of building control, with building control itself being the poor relation in our planning system, is the area of construction product regulations.  The most glaring evidence of that is what we are seeing now with defective blocks used along the western seaboard and also the pyrite scandal of which Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, I and others have a fair bit of experience.  It would be appropriate to include in this section a reference to construction product regulations.  We have a series of other relevant provisions here but just naming those regulations and highlighting them would be very valuable.  It is on that basis that I have tabled this amendment.</p></speech>

There is a list of different items that applicants have to furnish and this amendment seeks to include in the section that refers to indemnity, which reads &quot;evidence that the applicant holds minimum levels of indemnity specified under <i>section 43</i>,&quot; that the applicant would have to have latent defects insurance.  One of the big issues with all of the problems we have had with building defects has been the lack latent defects insurance.  It is not the entire solution to the problems but is one of them.  It is part of the solution because if builders or contractors are doing shoddy work and are getting into difficulties, they are not going to be able to get latent defects insurance.  No one will insure them if they keep making mistakes for which they have to pay out.  It is quite an effective method of getting some of the people who have been causing havoc out of the system altogether, as they should be.  It is not the entire solution but it is certainly part of it.  If we adopted this as part of the criteria for registration, it would help us to get some of the way we need to go in terms of sorting all of these problems out.</p></speech>

It seeks to require an applicant for registration to possess latent defects insurance.  Latent defects insurance is taken out on a project-by-project basis and it is not practical that registration could be conditioned on the possession of such insurance.  In addition, while a builder of residential or non-residential buildings should possess such insurance, other categories of providers of building works, for example, bricklayers or plasterers, do not require this insurance.</p><p>It is worth noting that while latent defects insurance is not a mandatory requirement, lending institutions and consumers are likely to demand it. <font color="#004080"> </font>I recognise that this is a very important consumer product, particularly in the residential market.  I will review how this is further promoted and encouraged so that consumers are aware of this product.  This would also have the effect of encouraging the take-up of latent defects insurance.</p></speech>

The first part of the response is fair enough but I have a different view of the latter part.  I do not think people who are looking to buy a home at the moment are necessarily aware of these issues.  I know the Minister of State is saying we need to create an awareness but if those looking to buy a home, particularly now, manage to get mortgage approval and find somewhere suitable to live that they can afford within their mortgage approval, with everything falling into place, they are not likely to then turn around and ask if there is latent defects insurance in place and, if not, to pull out of buying.  An awful lot of providers simply do not have latent defects insurance and potential buyers are not in a position of sufficient power to be able to insist on it.</p> <p>  I accept that my amendment may not be the correct way of dealing with this but we need to get to a position where latent defects insurance is required.  Unfortunately, it has not been driven from consumer or lending institution quarters.  I wish it had been and I wish it was commonplace as a result.  One would think that after everything that has happened, it would be commonplace but it is not.  In that context, a legislative solution is required.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on the general point.</p></speech>

Specifically on the amendment, such insurance is not attached to the entity but to the project.  That is why we cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

When we raised this at our sessions with the Construction Industry Federation it said that there was no need to make such insurance mandatory because developers are all using it anyway but that is not the case.  There are other jurisdictions where it is a legal requirement and it provides a great degree of security for good quality builders and tradespeople as well as for the purchasers.  I am talking liberties here in the sense that I am not speaking specifically to the amendment but I am speaking to the substance of it.  Mandatory latent defects insurance is the way to go.  Anything short of that means it will be a pick-and-mix in terms of who takes it and who does not.</p></speech>

I have two issues with the wording of the Bill as it stands.  I am not satisfied with and want to hear the rationale for the ten-year cut-off point.</p><p>I am doubly unsatisfied with the wording, "or since the establishment of the register, whichever is the shorter period".  In terms of the establishment of the register, the Minister of State might clarify if we are talking about the establishment of the statutory register as provided for in this Bill and that, therefore, a person applying for registration with the board has to provide only information about any conviction in the State.  It is worth pointing out that these are not general convictions but convictions specified in the Bill in regard to building controls, building regulations and fire safety, which are particularly relevant in the context of whether someone is suitable to be on the register.  As I said, these people have only to provide the information.  The fact that they have these convictions, which are potentially very serious convictions, does not mean they are barred from going on the register.  </p><p> My reading of the current wording is that as this provision will apply only since the establishment of the register, a person with serious convictions that are highly relevant to building control and fire safety but which date from two years ago will not have to provide that information with an application for registration.  Ten years after the establishment of the register on a statutory basis, the person will have a ten-year window to do that.  I understand the idea of cut-off points but this is highly relevant information.  Bearing in mind that as convictions under the Building Control Acts are very rare, it is highly relevant information.  If there have been convictions under these Acts, I do not see why there would be any time cut-off.  If the Minister of State is strongly of the view that it needs to be ten years, it should, at least, be ten years and not "or since the establishment of the register" given that will mean from day one a zero time period.  </p><p> As I said, there have been very few convictions under these Acts in any event.  I would welcome an indication of the Minister of State's view on this.</p></speech>

This section requires an applicant to confirm any convictions for certain relevant offences or orders under the Building Control Act 1990 within the previous ten years or since the establishment of the register, whichever is the shorter period.  The legal advice is that any amendment would need to consider the relevant provisions and the legal position on retrospectivity in regard to this case.

In the Minister of State's deliberations on the matter between now and Report Stage there are two issues to consider.  In planning law, planning authorities can take into account certain forms of past behaviour, whether it is a failure to comply with terms of planning permissions or a failure to complete planning conditions.  It does not apply to building control - we have separate legislation to achieve that - but there is an element of retrospectivity in making future planning decisions.  Likewise with procurement law there has been an interesting discussion in another committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine whether past breaches of building controls or of planning could be worked into conditions for future tendering in regard to procurement for public contracts.  It was suggested by a Minister in the previous Government that this might not be legally possible but other European jurisdictions do it.  As long as the rules apply to everybody in the same way, there is no legal question.  These types of provisions, when crafted properly, in certain circumstances can be applied retrospectively.  I urge the Minister of State to look at those examples, as well as what has been said by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 seek to shorten from 90 days to 20 days the period within which the board must make a decision on any application for registration or renewal.  A meeting of the board is required to make a decision on an application for registration or renewal and so 20 days is not sufficient.  However, I am minded to review the timeframe and to examine if it can be shortened, on which I will revert to the Deputy on Report Stage.  I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 33 and 34.</p></speech>

It makes sense to me for the board to do that in partnership with the existing bodies that are involved in the provision of training for construction industry professionals, such as SOLAS or the National Training Fund.  I accept my list might be too short or too prescriptive, but requiring the board to have some kind of a relationship with other providers of what is in many instances continuing professional development makes sense.  There might be a more elegant way of wording this amendment but I think members get the principle of what I am trying to do.</p></speech>

Sections 28 and 29 of the Bill, in relation to competence criteria and eligibility for registration, provide that the Minister or the board may consult with SOLAS, among other bodies, when determining the qualifications, experience or combination of both that confer eligibility for registration.  Training courses supported by SOLAS, the National Training Fund and a large body of training providers will be eligible for approval by the board to demonstrate evidence of CPD.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.842" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022030300002#S00900"><p>I move amendment No. 36:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 45, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:  	&ldquo;(i) failure to comply with building control regulations.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>Section 44 deals with complaints and this specific provision details the grounds upon which complaints can be made by complainants.  I understand the intention of the Bill, and the complaints section deals with complaints with respect to the specific requirements of the registration process and register.  The officials very helpfully explained some of that to me after Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, for which I thank them.  However, I want to make the case that the grounds upon which a complaint can be made should extend beyond the pure formalities of the registration requirements.</p><p>It seems that in the drafting of the Bill, there was an attempt to separate the registration process and the criteria required to comply with that and building control.  The argument could be made that if somebody has a problem with a failure to comply with building regulations, he or she should raise the matter with the building control authority, which is the local authority or the National Building Control Office, or take the matter to the courts.  The problem, which we know from extensive experience, is that neither of those options provide any meaningful remedy for which a person who is affected by, for example, a failure to comply with building control regulations, as per my first amendment, or failure to comply with planning permission, can seek adequate redress even in the limited form of having somebody struck off the register.  It is virtually impossible for a homeowner affected by building defects to take a case to court and win.  Both Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and I have a significant amount of experience of working with homeowners who have been in that situation.  Unless a person has very deep pockets and a significant taste for gambling, the courts do not provide an effective remedy.</p><p>Likewise, for the building control authority to seek a remedy through building control enforcement is equally as lengthy and cumbersome.  Somebody might say why do we not reform those two processes and that is the way to do it.  I fully agree with that but when it comes to defective buildings, a belt and braces approach is the right approach.  Therefore, if a company, individual contractor or professional is on this register and is in clear breach of building control regulations, the person affected by that should be able to make a formal complaint on the grounds of breaches of building control regulations.  The consequence of that, were the person successful through the various processes provided for, would be to have somebody struck off the register.  For example, the developer who was responsible for Priory Hall is back in the building game, albeit in the North of our country.  There is nothing stopping that individual from coming to the South, setting up a new company and engaging in construction work activities.  There is nothing in the Building Control Acts that ensures the individual is prevented from practising as a construction industry professional.  They can be struck off a company's board of directors or placed in insolvency or all sorts of other things.</p><p>We need to send out a clear signal that the value of this register is not only that individuals have to comply with the terms and conditions of the register but that they could be struck off and prevented from ever practising again if they are in breach of building control regulations and if the complaints process finds that to be the case.  That would be a powerful signal to the industry.  This is not just about complying with the paperwork.  This is not just about complying with the registration requirements; it is about complying with the law.  Today, there is nothing that allows any court in this country, as far as I am aware, to strike a construction industry professional off the register and put him or her out of business.  We have an opportunity to do so and I urge the Minister of State to consider widening the scope of the Bill.  I realise what I am proposing is outside the scope of what was originally intended.  I understand that better now following the conversation I had with the officials.  However, if we let this opportunity pass, we as an Oireachtas will not be forgiven for not having a very effective remedy to ensure a person or company that has built defective buildings in the past can be prevented from building another building or construction project in the future.  That is a deterrent that would start to clean up those elements of the industry that have been in the past and, unfortunately, in small instances in the present, responsible for shoddy work.</p></speech>

This would be very effective and would have knock-on effects.  This morning in the D&aacute;il, we raised a different issue on exploitative practices that affect some renters with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Minister indicated that he would bring in measures whereby landlords engaged in such abhorrent behaviour could be struck off the register for landlords and, therefore, would not be able to practise as a landlord anymore.  That is one of the measures under consideration.  This is very different but it is also a serious issue.  Building defects have caused absolute devastation in people's lives, as well as the significant cost borne publicly as a result.  It is entirely appropriate that there should be a fallout from that.  We are not talking about minor mistakes or where there are learnings to be made.  That is quite different.  However, for very serious building defects that have devastating consequences, of course, a fallout from that should be that the individual responsible should not be able to build again and repeat those mistakes.</p> <p>  It is important for the homeowners to get a sense of justice, while they have gone through the stress of seeing their homes fall apart or have been worried about their kids falling asleep in a building that is not fire-safety compliant, there is the possibility of individuals or contractors not being able to build again because they cannot get on this register, if they are found to have failed to comply with building control regulations.  As we all know, the threshold to achieve that can be quite high and difficult for residents and homeowners to get to.</p><p>It is worthy of very serious consideration.  I urge the Minister of State to include this as it would make things considerably different.  The case for it is overwhelming.  I can see no reason not to do it.</p></speech>
