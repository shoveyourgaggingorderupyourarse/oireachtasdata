Deputy Carroll MacNeill has informed me that she is at another committee meeting next door, but she will try to get in to us at some stage.  I welcome everyone to the meeting.  In accordance with public health guidelines, the wearing of face coverings is optional for members and witnesses.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Brian Hill, audit manager.</p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The committee has advised the HBFI that it may also wish to examine the issuance of bonds and unfinished estates during the engagement.  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from HBFI: Ms Dara Deering, chief executive officer; Mr. Sean Alger, head of credit and risk; and Ms Denise Donovan, head of operations and finance.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either in silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of the Parliament, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It operates as a commercial State entity, providing finance at market rates for commercially-viable residential developments.</p> <p>  HBFI was incorporated as a designated activity company in December 2018 and the company&rsquo;s share capital is owned solely by the Minister for Finance.  A group entity, Home Building Finance Ireland (Lending) Designated Activity Company, was subsequently incorporated in early January 2019 and it is a 100%-owned subsidiary of HBFI.  The operations of HBFI commenced on 28 January 2019, with access to an initial loan fund of &euro;730 million to be made available by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, on the direction of the Minister for Finance.  At the time of its launch, HBFI&rsquo;s initial loan product was targeted at small- and medium-sized builders and was limited to providing senior debt funding for residential projects of ten units or more, up to a maximum of &euro;35 million per project.</p> <p>  During 2020, HBFI significantly expanded the scope of its lending.  It now offers funding for projects to build apartments where lending of up to &euro;75 million can be provided; for small residential development projects of fewer than ten units; for social housing projects contracted for sale to a local authority or an approved housing body, AHB; and a &euro;300 million momentum fund, which was launched as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic to provide funding to established developers for larger-scale developments in prime locations. </p> <p>  Naturally, HBFI was still in the initial stages of scaling up its operation in 2020.  From the date of inception up until the end of 2020, HBFI had approved offers of loans totalling &euro;395 million, but significantly less funding had been drawn down by borrowers.  As the statement of financial position discloses, HBFI had loans in issue by the end of 2020 to developers of just under &euro;37 million, and HBFI had borrowed a total of &euro;37.3 million from the ISIF to facilitate this lending.</p> <p>  HBFI&rsquo;s operating expenses in 2020 amounted to almost &euro;5.7 million, of which &euro;2.6 million was paid in respect of salaries to HBFI staff.  Members may wish to note that HBFI staff are employees of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, seconded to HBFI.  The NTMA also provides administration supports to HBFI, including premises, HR functions, procurement and financial management services.  Income earned by HBFI in 2020 amounted to &euro;864,000.  This included net interest income of &euro;544,000 and other income of &euro;320,000.  HBFI incurred a loss of just under &euro;4.8 million for 2020.</p> <p>  I issued unqualified audit opinions on the 2020 financial statements of the HBFI group, and of the subsidiary company. </p></speech>

As detailed in the letter of invitation, she has five minutes to read her statement, which is fairly concise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dara Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#A00800"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear today.  I am joined by my colleagues, whom the Chair has already introduced.</p> <p>  HBFI is a Government initiative to increase the supply of new homes, for owner-occupiers, renters and social housing, by providing loans on commercial terms to small, medium and large housebuilders for commercially-viable developments throughout Ireland.</p> <p>  Last month, we published a performance update that showed we had grown total loan approvals to &euro;835 million as at the end of December 2021.  The funding we have approved can deliver 3,729 new homes in 71 developments in 18 counties.  Drawdowns have already taken place in respect of 57% of the facilities we had approved at the end of December.  This shows that the houses and apartments being built with HBFI funding are being completed quickly, thereby meeting some of the immense demand for housing.  Furthermore, I am pleased to say that our strong progress has continued into 2022, with the result that, as of the end February, our total loan approvals have grown to more than &euro;1 billion.  These will support the potential delivery of over 4,400 new homes across 20 counties.</p> <p>  HBFI funding has been effective for several reasons.  By listening to our stakeholders and focusing on developments where housebuilders experience difficulty raising funding from traditional sources, HBFI addresses the gaps in the traditional marketplace and provides a rigorous but fast loan approval process.  Our focus on supporting incremental housing supply gives us a flexibility that may not always be available from mainstream banks.  Equally, while mainstream banks often gravitate towards urban areas, we have a national remit to try to support new home supply in every county and not just the big cities.</p><p>Our product range will take into account the market reality that some housing schemes will simply be too small for other lenders to support.  Through our strong stakeholder engagement across the public and private sectors, the HBFI can identify trends and gaps in the funding market from the ground up.</p><p> However, not all the challenges can be predicted, as the Covid pandemic has demonstrated.  The HBFI&rsquo;s ability to respond to the risk that there may be further, albeit temporary, challenges as a result of Covid-19 impacting on the timing of future supply brought about the creation of the momentum fund.  As the initial &euro;200 million was fully committed within three months, the strength of demand resulted in the HBFI adding a further &euro;100 million to the fund.  The success of the fund has continued to the extent that it is now more than 90% utilised and the time is right to close it to new applications.  The momentum fund is just one example of how the HBFI&rsquo;s agile business model can respond to disruptions to residential development finance and tailor its offerings to the areas where demand exists the most.</p><p> In reality, the HBFI is just one part of the solution to the supply-demand imbalance that exists, which is causing so much difficulty for owner-occupiers, renters and those in need of social housing.  We feel strongly that increasing supply across the market is beneficial for everyone.  By funding developments aimed at owner-occupiers, we are helping these people move out of the rental sector and freeing up homes for other renters, thereby increasing the supply in that sector.  By funding new homes for rental, we build on that progress, increase the choice available to renters and try to help alleviate some of the pricing pressure existing in that market.</p><p> Access to development finance for all types of housing remains a key issue for homebuilders and is vital to support the continued delivery of housing throughout the State.  Through the strategies I have outlined today, the HBFI seeks to address the financing challenge and ensure that finance is available where the level of demand makes a development viable.  We take great pride in being part of each of the developments we finance and in seeing foundations being dug and diggers at work.  That is what the HBFI is all about; turning the finance we have available into homes.</p><p> This concludes my opening remarks.  I hope this has given the committee a better understanding of the work of the HBFI.  My colleagues and I will do our best to answer any questions members may have. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00300"><p>I thank Ms Deering for her statement and the Comptroller and Auditor General for his reports.  I do not want to paraphrase what Ms Deering said, but I will focus on one line where she said the HBFI identified gaps in the existing fund available to creditors and did so in an efficient and rigorous way.  I am thinking back to the development of the HBFI.  In many ways, many of the new policy tools that have come in, such as Housing for All and so on, have increased the number of policy tools available to tackle the housing market.  While all homes built are very important and help to solve the housing crisis - as Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage I am very conscious of that - the role of members of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hold the HBFI to account for the policy area under its remit.</p> <p>  I will focus on the idea of small and medium-sized builders and the access they have to credit.  Would the representatives say that was the core origin of the creation of the HBFI?  It certainly seems to have comprised much of the early work of the organisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dara Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00400"><p>The Deputy is absolutely right.  When the HBFI was established, the initial assumption was that finance would be more concerned with small and medium-sized developers or housebuilders, especially outside urban areas.  We see that as a real gap.  In fact, 65% of all the homes we have funded are in schemes that are being built with fewer than 50 homes.  That is a reality.  Some 63% of all the homes we have funded are outside the Dublin area.  Both those factors are clear evidence that there is less availability of finance and, therefore, more demand outside the main areas.</p> <p>  One of the things we did very early was a strategic review and a large piece of market research.  We identified gaps even beyond that.  If we look at small housing schemes, when the HBFI was initially set up, the assumption was the demand would be in units greater than ten.  Actually, 14% of all housing supply in Ireland over the past number of years is in schemes of fewer than ten units.  We brought out a product specifically to support housebuilders who want to build between five and ten units to try to fill that gap further.  Equally, on the other side of the spectrum, we saw real challenges with apartment delivery and the financing of apartment delivery schemes so we brought out a product specifically for that.  That was the message I was trying to get across in my opening statement.  There is not one housing market; there are multiple markets.  There are multiple challenges facing those markets and we have tried to respond to the gaps as they emerge. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00500"><p>I want to focus on the HBFI's move away from focusing on that idea of small to medium sized towards the momentum fund, which I will discuss.  Does Ms Deering regard that as mission creep or as identifying another gap in the market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dara Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00600"><p>First, I do not see it as a move away.  I see it as an add-on to what we were doing because those gaps very much existed in small and medium-sized scheme funding.  As I said, 65% of all the schemes are fewer than 50 units.  That is a very important focus for us.  We went a step further than the original offering by bringing out a product for those smaller schemes.  It is very important for us.</p> <p>  I believe that in our role as a funder, and our mandate is to increase supply, we have to recognise that the gaps will be at different parts of the market and sometimes that will be timebound.  The Deputy may want to reference the momentum fund, which is a prime example of something that was created as a result of the pandemic.  Our role was to step in and respond to that factor. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00700"><p>Okay.  I will come back to that.  Clearly, the HBFI has not seen the success in drawdowns for those smaller projects that it might have.  Of almost &euro;395 million approved facilities, the drawdown has just been approximately &euro;37 million, which is 10%.  I am trying to get to the bottom of why that is happening in the market so I can understand it from a policy perspective.  I can also see, from the HBFI's perspective, that it is not getting as much money drawn down as it wants from a much larger fund.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dara Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#B00800"><p>I will take the drawdown point.  The Deputy is right that there is obviously a gap between the &euro;395 million that was there to the end of 2020 and the drawdowns at that point.  That is the same irrespective of any housing scheme we fund because it will take a period of time.  First, from the time we approve the fund, it takes about three to six months on average before funding is drawn down.  The whole nature of development finance is we only lend the money as the activity is happening.  It will take a further 21 months on average before the full amount of money we propose for a scheme is drawn down.</p></speech>

We look at whether we are making the funding available and, when we do so, whether we are supporting the people for whom we make funding available in getting building happening as quickly as possible.

For example, does planning permission need to be in place in advance of applications being made?</p></speech>

However, before they draw down funding with the HBFI, and in the vast majority of cases before we approve the funds, they must have the planning in place.  The reason for that is exactly what the Deputy said.  We do not want to have funding approved if it cannot work through the process because it is still waiting for planning.  That is not the quickest or most efficient use of the funding we have available.  The reality is that from the time we approve a facility, a number of things have to happen.  First, there is a due diligence process to make sure all the checks and balances are in place because we are lending State money but on the other side of it, the housebuilders have to mobilise the resources available, including the labour and materials, to get on site.  Sometimes they will be concluding a site purchase as part of that transaction.</p></speech>

We are speaking in very general terms.  I am trying to get to the bottom of what those delays in drawdown are.  I accept that Covid was an issue, although less so on the social housing side, and I hear what Ms Deering is saying about issues in legal transfers and so on.  Have the witnesses examined why they have not been able to release more money into the market?</p></speech>

There are multiples reasons.  From the time a loan is approved, such as for a &euro;5 million facility, for example, there is a due diligence process that has to go through from both sides.  That is for both the customer that is borrowing the money and us as a lender.  That is the same for any financial institution.  It is not specific to the HBFI.  We would then be ready to draw down the funds but the housebuilder would be getting construction ready in parallel.  Sometimes they could be on another site so there is not one reason.

She mentioned the figure of 57%.  From the perspective of value for money for the taxpayer, I am looking at a cost base in 2020 of &euro;5.7 million and drawdowns of &euro;37 million.  Those numbers do not make for a good ratio.  I want to see a pipeline of more rapid draw down.</p></speech>

For any start-up business, it is expected to start covering its own costs in about a three-year period.  We expect to reach that in 2022, which is just over three years from inception.  The costs to which the Deputy is referring would be covered by the income we earn on the loans that are drawn down.  We have already seen further increases.  As I mentioned, 57% of the facilities are now drawing down.  That drawdown amount will increase month by month to get to a stage where we are covering our costs in 2022.  That was the milestone we had originally-----</p></speech>

There is a fisherman on a lake and it is very hard getting the fish.  He has to cover his costs.  He is there all day and is not getting the rewards he wants so he develops a new tool called the momentum fund that lets him fish in a barrel.  My worry about the momentum fund is that is a huge allocation - 40% of the overall fund, if I am right - is going to very large developers, so it may not be filling the gap left by other lenders that has been identified.  I can see how an organisation that is struggling to get the volume it wants can very easily come up with a new tool, allocate more than 40% of the funds and start to then reach volumes that could be met by other financial institutions.</p></speech>

The momentum fund was introduced in May 2020.  We were in the first part of Covid-19, sites had been closed and there was a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace.  We believed that an appropriate response for the HBFI was to look at whether there could be further disruptions to housing supply due to the lack of availability of finance.  We launched the momentum fund and we saw real demand for it.  Some 90% of the fund was allocated in the first few months.</p></speech>

That was our market analysis at the time, evidenced by the level of applications we saw.  Our motivation was to avoid a scenario where, in a crisis situation where there was reduced supply and increased demand, the supply would be further constrained because finance was not available.  We were very clear in allocating the momentum fund that it would in no way constrain the amount of funding we would have available for small and medium-sized projects.  It was not a case of or but of and; it was adding temporarily to the market.</p></speech>

More than 90% of the applications to the fund were made in the first three months and the initial &euro;200 million was oversubscribed.  We added a further &euro;100 million.</p></speech>

We do a benchmarking exercise externally because we are subject to state aid rules, so we have to make sure that what we offer does not distort competition in the marketplace.  We would have done a benchmarking exercise at the time to make sure this temporary fund would not distort competition.  That is all it was.  It was a response to Covid-19 and it is closed now.  It would have been be like for like in terms of the marketplace.</p></speech>

That seems to go beyond the initial idea of identifying small to medium-sized projects.  We are short on time but I want to get to the issue of performance-related pay.  I am sure it is a matter that the HBFI wants to address too.  There have not been allocations in these accounts.  Is that something Ms Deering envisages happening this year or next year?</p></speech>

It is very important that we do not stifle creativity and so on.

An exception was sought for the momentum fund in respect of the legislation.  The HBFI approached the Minister in this regard.  Was an approach made to the organisation to indicate that there was a gap, as it has been described?  I refer to a situation where the HBFI lobbied for moneys to be made available from this fund.</p></speech>

In the context of the legislation that governs the HBFI, our mandate is to support all housing schemes where there is a gap in finance, provided they are commercially viable.  Additionally, and as part of fulfilling that mandate, we are constantly trying to identify if gaps have emerged.  Given what happened in the context of the impact of Covid-19 and the banks having to focus on putting payment breaks in place for consumers and SMEs, it was obvious that finance for construction would be a constraint.  We saw that as well after the last global financial crisis.</p></speech>

We saw first-hand what was happening in respect of banks having to focus on SMEs and personal customers, as I said.  Therefore, we sought to put funding in place in advance of there being a significant increase in demand.  We launched it to the marketplace-----</p></speech>

This fund is a significant difference from the expectation when the HBFI was first established.  Why could institutional investors not source funding in a market where there was cheap money and negative interest rates?  In a scenario where there is significant unmet demand, that is not going to change.  Where is this approach coming from?  I do not see where it is coming from.</p></speech>

In making the decision to support and launch the momentum fund, we were very clear that we would still have sufficient finance available to fund small- and medium-sized schemes, and that is still the case today.  It did not compromise, sacrifice or take away from our ability to fund these.  That is why I said at the outset that 65% of all of the homes we have funded are on schemes with fewer than 50 homes.  We are delivering to that original mandate.</p></speech>

It is our strong view that this needs to be in the owner-occupier market, which is 43% of what we funded.  It includes the rental sector, which is 30%, social housing, which is 23%, and Part V housing, which is 4%.  We were not set up for a particular segment.  We were absolutely set up to support the increase in supply.  That means that, at times, we have to flex our offering to where the gaps are the greatest.  Not doing that would not be doing what-----</p></speech>

The initial expectation was that the supply of finance, or the availability of finance, was likely to be more constrained in small- and medium-sized projects, which may be where the Deputy is going with her question.  It is still the fact today that small- and medium-sized builders outside of the main urban areas struggle the most to get finance because the main banks have less appetite for outside of Dublin and, therefore, we have to and do play a role in supporting that.</p></speech>

In giving that money over, it seems to me the equivalent of the local enterprise office helping out Pfizer.  On top of that, there are not going to be any owner-occupier homes out of it and it is just going to be apartments sold on to cuckoo funds so they can exploit the out-of-control rental market here.  Does Ms Deering have any view as to the rent that might be charged when doing that?</p></speech>

To help the committee, the reality that we faced in 2020 was that we had schemes shovel-ready and ready to start building homes.  I appreciate those homes would be for the rental market but our view is that as part of increasing the overall supply, we must see an increase in the supply of rental properties.  They were shovel-ready and, on the basis of our market analysis right then, they could not keep going because they typically borrowed from the domestic sector, and the domestic sector was rightly, to my mind, focused on supporting families and small businesses who needed payment breaks.  That is why we did the momentum fund.  I will let my colleague give the Deputy a flavour of what rents may be achieved, recognising that these apartments will come to the rental stock in a number of years.</p></speech>

I am sure they were rubbing their hands when they got the funding so easy, given the exorbitant rental charge and the profits they are going to make.  The remit of the HBFI was not to distort the market.  Of the &euro;300 million, some &euro;190 million of that went to those cuckoo funds or developers that had the forward purchase agreements.  It does not seem to add up.  What were the checks and balances when they came for funding, particularly for those that had the backing of cuckoo funds?  What were the checks and balances that the HBFI requested, for example, in order to see they had been refused funding by bank after bank before they came to it?</p></speech>

The reality is that since the HBFI was established, the affordability aspect has been reduced for people of that age from 16% down to 12%, which would suggest that the HBFI is not effective.  There is an issue here with the affordability aspect.  The HBFI is there to fund developers who Ms Deering says cannot access funds elsewhere albeit we do not know what the due diligence is because she just told Deputy Munster that the HBFI does not actually require any kind of a letter saying that they cannot get funds from the bank.  She is saying that the HBFI's percentage rates are comparable with the banks.  However, the effect of having the HBFI set up is that the affordability aspect for people in that age group has reduced by four percentage points.  How does that market research sit with Ms Deering?</p></speech>

We have an affordability issue, which is clear if the average price is &euro;319,000 in the context of our mortgage rules.  There is a big gap that Ms Deering does not seem to be identifying with.  The HBFI was set up to make housing more affordable by building more.  If the supply issue is cured, houses become cheaper.  What has actually happened is that the affordability aspect has been reduced by 4 percentage points.  Does Ms Deering expect that to change and if so, how?</p></speech>

Does Ms Deering hear what we are saying?  This is about public moneys and where they are going.  I am telling Ms Deering that affordability has decreased by 4% since the HBFI was set up.  Does Ms Deering propose to change that and make it a positive as opposed to a negative?  Does she think the HBFI can do that?</p></speech>

There has been a lot of focus on the drawdown of funding.  I am interested in the structure to protect the organisation with regard to securities, etc.  What checks and balances are in place to make sure there is adequate security?  We had a problem with the banks in the past.  Representatives from the National Asset Management Agency were before the committee and outlined a case where a solicitor's undertaking in relation to property to the tune of approximately &euro;1 billion meant the banks could not do anything about it because it was totally insufficient.  In terms of securities where moneys are released, what checks and balances are in place?</p></speech>

When we approve a loan, we appoint a firm of solicitors to act specifically on our behalf and those solicitors are responsible for doing a title investigation and registering our security.  Before we do our initial drawdown, that security must be in place and confirmed by our panel solicitors.</p></speech>

In some cases, the borrower already owns the site.  In those circumstances, our solicitor would still do an investigation of the title and register our security.  In other cases, our borrower is also purchasing the site so the borrower's solicitor would be doing a title investigation and then our solicitor would be responsible for registering our security.</p></speech>

Have any particular problems been highlighted in that regard?  Have alarm bells been set off because of issues that occurred previously?</p></speech>

Very often, there were defects in how that security was registered.  We do not rely on the borrower's solicitor to certify title and register our security.  We have our own independent panel of solicitors to do title investigations and register our security.</p></speech>

For every loan we approve, there is an expected date for the development to be launched to the market.  There are also specific timings around when sales are expected to complete.  We monitor that in conjunction with our borrower.  Let us take the example of a 20-unit development.  As soon as each house sells, we get the sale proceeds, which reduces the borrowers loan to us.  Typically for a 20-unit development, we might be repaid after the 16th house is sold.  That is the source of our repayment as each unit gets sold.</p></speech>

We have had to do some extensions to loan terms but those have been relatively modest.  Developers in many cases made up for some of the time lost as a result of lockdowns.  From a risk perspective, nothing in our developments has caused us concern to date.</p></speech>

What is the difficulty about the financial institutions providing lending at this stage?  Never before has there been so much money on deposit in the main banks in this country.  Why is there a reluctance in the financial sector to provide funding?</p></speech>

Why do builders or developers come to the HBFI for funding and not go to the main banks?  I think that is the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

We have a national remit, which means we are here to fund schemes in every county.  Sometimes the mainstream banks focus more on urban areas and high population centres.  We will try to support demand in every county, if that is viable, and we have so far supported schemes in 20 counties.  The more fundamental point is that at times a builder or developer will not have the required level of equity that meets the risk criteria for a bank.  What do I mean by that?  The main banks will typically lend approximately 65% of the cost of building a new development.  We can lend more than that.  We can go up to approximately 80% to try to make more schemes viable.  That is the second reason.</p> <p>  The third reason is that some of the schemes will simply be too small for the main banks.  That is why we brought out-----</p></speech>

The State has a shareholding in the main banks.  Is Ms Deering saying that an entity in which the State has a shareholding is refusing to talk to developers unless they are building 50 houses?</p></speech>

There can be a range of reasons why the funding is not available.</p></speech>

Those banks have adequate moneys on deposit.  In fact, they are now penalising people for having moneys on deposit.  Surely some effort must be made to deal with this issue.</p></speech>

That is not a small loan.  Where a builder is already putting &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000 into a development, the risk to the bank is very small.  Is it not now time that the banks came back to the market and helped deal with the housing shortage?</p></speech>

It has indicated that while there is a risk, it does not see that as a major challenge.  If it does not see it as a major challenge, what is the problem with the main financial institutions?

If we approve a scheme, whether for owner-occupiers or anything else, that does not compromise our ability to approve a scheme for social housing. Equally, if we approve a scheme for rental, it does not compromise our ability to approve a scheme for the private or owner-occupier market.</p> <p>  We have sufficient funding available to meet the demand for all the commercially viable schemes coming our way because the funding we have can be recycled and, second, we have an ability to borrow more if needs be.  In our strong view, to tackle this challenging environment we are in where supply is well beneath demand, we need to see homes being built for owner-occupiers, renters, social housing and Part V.  That is how we are trying to play a small part in helping to address the challenges that are there today.</p></speech>

Does it ensure fair rents are charged?  At the end of the day, this is taxpayers' money and the HBFI is funding developers to build developments that, in some instances, are rented on the private market.  Does it have measures to ensure it is not participating in a mechanism that penalises people for being in a position whereby they have to rent?</p></speech>

At the end of that period, in the case of the private rental market, those units may be sold in totality and rented out to the market.  In the same way as we fund a home to be sold to the private market, we fund construction only.  We fund the house builders and, at the end of that, the property makes its way into one of the segments I mentioned.  Obviously, one of the mechanisms to alleviate costs, whether in the context of the affordability point that one of the Deputy's colleagues mentioned earlier in regard to people trying to buy a home or in the context of the price point for rental, relates to bringing forward more supply, and that has to be our focus and use.  We believe, given our mandate, we should use the finance we have available to bring forward supply across the board.  We do not differentiate as to what the purpose of that supply is.  We believe we should support all supply where finance is a barrier.</p></speech>

Moreover, some of the schemes we have funded for the private rental sector were under the momentum fund, but that fund is now closed.

They were ready to get going with workers who needed to have construction activity.  That is why we were very keen to keep it going.  To come back to the Deputy's original point, I totally agree that we need more building outside the main urban areas.  That is one of our objectives and motivations and that is why we have a team of people trying to support schemes in those areas.  We do not get bundles of applications from all the counties.  We would like to see more and we have the capacity to fund more but finance is obviously just one of the challenges in trying to bring forward that supply.</p></speech>

Has there been any analysis of the actual cost of building these three-bed apartments?  The cost of building something is made up of the cost of land - and apartments are stacked higher so you do not need as much land - and then labour and materials.  There are ancillary costs, such as legal, technical, design and other costs, but those are the three big ones.  The HBFI is making credit available for these developments but has it done any analysis of what it actually costs to provide them?  I do not claim to have all the wisdom on this but I know from people in the construction industry that apartments can be provided at a very reasonable price.  Are there any figures on that?</p></speech>

That is why most of the apartments for which we receive funding applications are for the rental sector.  When you try to sell them on a unit-by-unit basis, the cost of those units is beyond the reach of an awful lot of people in the marketplace.

Ms Deering mentioned a figure of more than &euro;400,000 for an apartment.  The cost per unit as of 31 December 2020, based on the HBFI's section 24 review, shows the average cost per home for those developments with more than ten units.  This is approved funding.  I understand that does not take into account the full fund, but covers more than 80%.  It works out at &euro;169,505 per unit for developments of more than ten units.  That indicates to me that the figure is far less than &euro;400,000.  It is &euro;202,000 for construction sites with fewer than ten units.  The cost of more than &euro;400,000 to build an apartment over the period of those loans is out of kilter with the cost on the ground.</p></speech>

The Chairman is talking about section 24 figures.  He is right that we lend that much money per unit, as opposed to the homes being built.  I will take the Chair's example of the more-than-ten-unit and fewer-than-ten-unit projects.  They are houses.  The construction cost of a house is lower than &euro;435,000.  The cost of construction for a house, per the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, is &euro;185,000.  As I mentioned earlier, there is also the cost of land and other factors.  That is the comparison.</p></speech>

He is right that the cost of construction for houses is less than apartments, but the cost of construction for houses takes into consideration the construction itself and other factors, such as land.  I accept that land prices will be different in other places.  It also includes other soft costs, such as the cost of finance that has to be in place.  That is why our average house price is &euro;319,000.  It reflects the construction costs.</p></speech>

I have a copy of what was said at the time.  There is a table from the HBFI from 31 December 2020.  Looking at developments of more than ten units, &euro;185 million was made available.  There was &euro;8.3 million for developments of fewer than ten units, or just 41 homes.  Those two figures show that the intended aim of the HBFI just did not work out.  Only 41 homes were provided by way of small builders building fewer than ten units.  According to the Government at the time, the goal was to fund small and medium-sized developers and builders to build outside the main urban areas.  I do not mean to be disparaging.  That indicates to me that there was complete failure in matching the actual figures to the intention.</p><p>That would indicate to me, and I do not mean to be disparaging, a complete failure in matching up the intention with the actual figures in that only 41 homes were provided by builders who were building ten or fewer units.</p></speech>

Therefore, the first product as per the table was the one regarding which we expected to see the greatest level of demand.  One of the first things we did was a review of the marketplace.  We actually felt there would also be demand for the smaller schemes, those with fewer than ten units.  The Chairman is absolutely right in that, at the time, at the end of 2020, these accounted for six facilities.  However, if I consider what constitutes small and medium under a scheme, I note it is not just fewer than ten units.  That criterion did not even exist when we launched.  Of the schemes we have approved, more than 65% have fewer than 50 units.  Those are more akin to those associated with the demand we see outside Dublin.</p></speech>

That is clear from this.

I am aware that Ms Deering made the case earlier that she was trying to help that sector as well.  However, are we sure that sector was really struggling to get finance?  For example, if a constituent went to the local authority tomorrow to get money under the local authority loan scheme or, previously, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, two letters from private financial institutions would have to be produced stating he or she could not get a loan.  There would also be other rigorous checks.  Ms Deering clarified that the developers who finished up with 80% of the public money did not have to produce any of that documentation.  Does she not find that odd?  She mentioned that her organisation did not want to put the applicants through the rigorous process of going around the houses looking for money before coming back to it, but that does not take long.  One can get the information from a bank or other financial institution in a day.  If a developer or builder presents balanced books to a bank or financial institution and shows evidence of the asset, secured land, planning permission and a preliminary design that has been done, he or she will get a fairly quick answer within a week; it does not take months.</p> <p>  A weakness in the momentum fund and the overall scheme is that critical check is not in place.  What happened is simply that, in the case of the fund, more than 80% of it ended up funding apartments in Dublin that finished up in the hands of private developers charging a rent of &euro;3,100 per month.  That is crazy money by comparison with rents in other European cities.  Before the crash, we finished up with the most expensive site in the world in Ballsbridge.  We all remember that and what happened.  Some of the people involved wound up in America.  We remember the madness of all that.  Are we not driving ourselves into a crazy situation again using taxpayers&rsquo; money to build apartments that are to be rented out for completely crazy prices from the point of view of Joe Public and citizens?  If people rent these apartments, they will never be able to save to buy a home and they will end up as pensioners in them.  I realise this is not for Ms Deering to figure out but policymakers must figure out how they will fund the system when these people reach pension age.  What kind of pension or wage will someone need to pay &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week in rent?</p> <p>  Based on the figures given, I am more concerned than I was after reading all this material yesterday.  We need to help small builders to provide affordable homes.  I contend that it does not cost &euro;400,000 to build or produce a home, regardless of the land cost and anything else.  There are things HBFI cannot do about the land costs that the Oireachtas should be doing, but I would like to go a lot further.  We have not acted on the Kenny report of the 1970s.  There are things we can do regarding vacant sites, CPOs, etc.  I just think we are finishing up in a worse situation than we were in given where things are heading.  I know people on relatively good incomes who are paying &euro;1,600 per month in rent.  They are absolutely crucified.  They are young couples who will never be able to buy.</p> <p>  I will allow in the second batch of speakers.  There are a few members who have not shown up yet.  I will allow each member who indicates a desire to contribute to do so.  However, they should bear in mind that if some of the others arrive, I will have to allow them their ten minutes.  The best thing to do is to give each member who indicates five minutes to contribute, and I will do so in the order in which members indicate.  We will then go around the houses again.  The first person to indicate is Deputy Munster, who has five minutes.</p></speech>

Ms Deering said it was set up in case funding from the mainstream banks would be constrained during Covid.  At the same time, HBFI had no checks and balances when the big developers were applying for funding.  It did not ask for a single sheet of paper that would show they had already been refused or had any difficulty whatsoever in getting the funding through the normal channels.</p> <p>  Ms Deering said HBFI had decided to set up the momentum fund and then brought the proposal to the Minister.  In this regard, I have a question on which I want a very clear response on the record.  In bringing about the setting up of the fund, was there any lobbying of any description from anybody?</p></speech>

The figures given are staggering, with rents of &euro;3,100 for a three-bedroom apartment.  Just think about that for a second - &euro;3,100 for a three-bedroom apartment or &euro;1,800 for a one-bedroom apartment.

I appreciate that we are talking about large quantums of money but the other big consideration for us, and maybe I am not getting this across to the committee today, in parallel to that consideration, is the need to make sure that we have finance available for those small and medium-sized schemes.  We want to see more applications across every county for homes in every county.  One was not to sacrifice the building of another.</p></speech>

That is a very short period to introduce a fund or to make that assessment of need.  Where is the evidence?  I am not convinced that I have heard evidence to support the conclusion reached that the introduction of that fund was necessary.</p></speech>

If we go back to when the lockdown announcement was made, construction sites closed.  All construction activity finished during the first lockdown.  Our assessment was based on our experience of lending into the marketplace.  Unfortunately we saw during the previous global financial crisis that banks had to focus on other things, which meant that the availability finance for construction was constrained-----</p></speech>

In response to some of the earlier points made and the Deputy's own point, we are absolutely committed to funding small and medium-sized developments wherever there is viability.  Obviously, we would like to see more homes in some of the locations the Deputy spoke about.  That is why we have teams out in those locations trying to generate awareness that we exist and to fund those homes.  The momentum fund is time-bound.  We have closed it because we believe there is now sufficient funding available in the marketplace for these schemes.  It is no longer needed to step in.</p></speech>

That is my experience from having sat at local authority meetings.  We have huge issues in that regard.  The bulk of HBFI funding seems to be for Dublin and the delivery seems to be in Dublin.  I appreciate there are developments in 18 counties.  One question I did not get an answer to earlier, whether I framed it incorrectly or not I do not know, is that fundamental to how this scheme is successful has to be construction cost and the viability after construction cost.  Ms Deering gave me a figure of &euro;319,000, which really does not mean anything.  If a one-bed apartment is being built in Dublin and one is being constructed in Wexford, for a start the one in Wexford will not be very saleable.  That is why one-bed apartments are not being built there.  Nobody wants one-bed apartments in Wexford.  I asked Ms Deering for a construction figure.  If a developer in Wexford is prepared to build a development of five to ten houses, does HBFI ascertain the construction cost of that development before giving the loan?</p></speech>

I am taking notes as this develops.  There is no requirement of proof in respect of the inability of a developer to access credit from a bank or other financial institution.  I accept that everything takes time.  Ms Deering will recall that I mentioned the very famous site in Ballsbridge.  As I recall, a party was actually held by the bank on the day that the loan was granted in principle because it had secured such a big deal.  The financial institution was over the moon that it had actually been granted that loan.  Banks are very interested in lending money for what is called real estate, or bricks and mortar, particularly in Ireland, because it is less risky than other ventures, such as manufacturing or whatever.  The asset is there and they have the deeds.  We know how it works and why it works.  For example, the deeds to my house are with somebody else because I have a mortgage on it at the moment.  No proof of the inability of a developer to access credit is required.</p> <p>  We have also ascertained today that there is no problem in providing funding to institutional investors.  We have established that more than 80% of the money in the momentum fund has gone into large-scale apartment development in Dublin.  Is it for institutional investors, which are sometimes referred to as cuckoo funds?  There is no barrier to the money from the HBFI going to such funds that rent out the apartments.  Ms Deering has elaborated on and explained the logic from their point of view that it is about increasing supply.  However, it is increasing the supply of overpriced houses.  We have also established that the largest loan granted was &euro;94 million, and a further loan of &euro;74 million was granted for the aptly-named Greenacres development in south Dublin for the construction of apartments.  Those two loans together are worth &euro;168 million, which is a fair chunk of the cash that is available.  We have also established that up to that point at the end of 2020, loans had only been granted for up to 41 homes to be provided by small builders in developments of ten or less.  The points I wish to emphasise are no requirement of proof of inability to access credit, no barrier to cuckoo funds, large loans are being granted to institutional developers and the affordability issue.  Local authorities build very high-quality homes.  I refer to &Oacute; Cualann housing association.  Granted, it has free land.  I understand that, but the land still does not make up that fraction, where we are heading towards nearly three times the cost from the figures HBFI provided.  The loans, particularly from the momentum fund, are being granted to large developers in Dublin that provide overpriced apartment blocks to let.  </p> <p>  I thank HBFI for the briefing it submitted to the committee in advance of the meeting.  It contains good information that is set out in a very concise way.  When I read the briefing, I was shocked to learn about the bond situation.  I refer to the case where a developer goes to a local authority to build 100 houses or apartments.  The local authority will look for a bond, typically so much per unit, to ensure the development is finished, and the roads are put in and the sewerage water, public lighting, footpaths and everything else is finished off to a proper standard.  I am referring to everything within the public domain, out past the front door to where the development meets a public road.  In the HBFI briefing, with regard to bonds failing, it is stated: "The report noted that although difficulties have been highlighted on specific developments it was not considered to be a widespread practice."  I was a county councillor before I became a Deputy.  Like those who came behind me, I am still following up on estates that I was chasing up more than 20 years ago with developers in relation to bonds failing, bonds not being renewed, bonds not being rolled over and bonds that were not worth the paper they were written on.  Some local authorities are now only accepting cash bonds.  To my mind, it should always have been that way.  I have stood on estates, as I am sure other public representatives have, that have been left in disastrous state.  They looked like Syria.  I have seen manholes and sewers left open, no public lighting, no footpaths and no surfaces on the roads.  On one estate, the developer did not even bother to put in the road.  I am talking about awful outcomes.  Local authorities had to go in and finish these estates.  We had to argue in the D&aacute;il for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to provide money just to address the safety issues on estates following the crash, which, in fairness, it did.  That is still a problem.  We had the insanity of the Celtic tiger, the hangover from it and the mopping-up exercise that followed.  That mopping-up exercise continues today.  A little more care has been taken with recent developments.  However, I am concerned about the assertion that it is not considered to be a widespread practice.  I am concerned about the fact that we are providing public money to entities, including investors, small and large developers, with no guarantee that when the estates they are developing or the projects they are working on are finished, the local authorities will not have to find money or go begging to the Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications, or that we will have to stand up and argue in the House with the Minister for Finance, looking for money for them.  The State has had to intervene a lot.  Local authorities have had to intervene.  They have had to use of money that was designated for other purposes.  Local authorities are not cash-rich generally.  I ask HBFI to review that.  </p> <p>  Ms Deering mentioned earlier that the fund has been closed.  If there is going to be any future funding for anything like this, the bonds issue has to be nailed down.  We had a discussion on it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I raised the issue, in particular, but other Deputies are interested in it as well, in fairness.  We are concerned about the failure to have proper bonds in place.  I am not just referring to pieces of paper; I am talking about putting proper bonds in place, so that if the developer fails, the local authority can get its hands on the cash.  It is the enforcement authority.  It is left to deal with the issue.  County councillors around the country have to take the flack from the public.  The public ask them why permission for developments was granted and why bonds were not adequate.  I can take the witnesses to estates in Mountmellick, Portlaoise and Borris-in-Ossory.   There are estates all over the place.  Members can rattle off examples of estates that were not finished properly and where there are still issues to be addressed.  For example, the sewerage pumping station in Woodgrove, Portlaoise, close to where I live, is still not adequate.  In the real world, beyond the gates of this place, the issue of bonds has to be nailed down if any further finance is going to be provided or before any other loan is granted using public money.  I would say the same thing about granting private money, but I make the point particularly in respect of granting public money.  Through the issues that we have fleshed out this morning, we know that there is no requirement of proof of the inability to access credit.  If I apply for a local authority loan, I have to be able to show that I cannot get the finance elsewhere.  This money is available to institutional investors, which are sometimes referred to as cuckoo funds.  The stated aim in the first place of providing finance to small builders has not worked out.  Now we find that the bond issue is not watertight.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

I totally agree with the points the Chairman has made.  In fact, our experience is that in the vast majority of cases, the local authorities are insisting on cash bonds being put in place.  What we were trying to get at here is that we do not have historic experience of this because we have only been lending since 2019.</p></speech>

What we see is exactly to the Chairman's point in that, in the vast majority of cases, the local authorities are insisting that a cash bond be provided.  What can we do as a lender?  We can, as part of the assessment, make sure our builders and developers can get access to the cash to provide the cash bond.  That is what we were trying to clarify in the note in question.  We understand there is an historical aspect but we have obviously been funding new developments only from 2019, with the vast majority having cash bonds in place.</p> <p>  On the point on small developments, I would love to see more applications for small developments because we have adequate funding available to support small and medium-sized builders in every county in Ireland.  I would love to see more developments.  We will try to do our bit to ensure there is awareness that we have the funding available.</p></speech>

I am not sure about the communication.  While I am sure HBFI has made some efforts, has the communication been adequate in order to reach the small builders?  They complain about not being able to get finance to get projects up and running.</p></speech>

We have a team out on the road going to local events.  We have our own events.  We were at two events in Tipperary in the past couple of weeks.  We will be in Galway next week.  Now, with the restrictions lifted, we can do more face-to-face work, which is more effective for some.  We also engage with the industry, through the representative body the Irish Home Builders Association, to make sure there is awareness, but I have no doubt that our job is not done if we do not have applications for funding from every county.  There is more we need to do to raise awareness.  If any builder or developer who is listening in any of the locations in question needs finance, we would love to hear from them.  That is what we are here to do.  We are here to try to help to alleviate the pressures that exist.</p></speech>

Silverwood estate in Mountmellick has a remaining bond of &euro;15,000.  That would not even open the ground to do what needs to be done.  Where does the money come from?  I could rattle off examples, including  Rushall in Mountrath.  Everybody else could give examples as well.  It is important that we do not keep recreating the same problems.</p></speech>

I will focus first on where a home is being built for sale to an owner-occupier.  In this regard, we consider two questions.  First, we ask whether the unit can be built for what the builder tells us it can be built for and whether it is reasonable for the given area.  The Deputy's colleague referred to construction costs.  Second, we ask whether there is proven demand in a location for units sold at the expected sale price.  That is how we assess it.</p></speech>

First, I want to put something in context for the committee so members will draw the right conclusions.  With regard to the sale price, there will be a contract in place meaning somebody will purchase the apartments we have funded through the three schemes we are talking about, under the momentum fund.  The person purchasing them is making an assumption that, in three years, the homes will be rented, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

I wanted to put the &euro;3,100 in context for the Deputy just in case.  This is not to say that the numbers are not high &mdash; they are &mdash; but, of the apartments for which funding has been provided, 27 are to have three bedrooms.  However, the figure is still very high for two bedrooms.  The figure we quoted earlier, &euro;2,100, which is the figure for the majority, is of course high, but-----</p></speech>

My understanding of HBFI's role was that it was to add to the market, be it through sales to local authorities directly or purchases by owner-occupiers.  I understood the aim was to release a flotilla of builders around the country who would add to the housing stock.  We are seeing a very different scenario.  In many ways, people feel the build-to-let sector is distorting the market in that the properties are not released for purchase.  Therefore, since the supply side is so constrained, people have no option but to rent even if they do not want to do so.  Many people want to rent but affordability is a big issue for them.</p> <p>  Does Ms Deering not accept that the momentum fund has, to a degree, distorted the market by targeting available money at an area in which HBFI's original purpose, which was to extend available funding to entities that could not get funding from traditional sources, was not being realised?</p></speech>

That is our objective and what we were set up to do.  That is why 70% of the funding we have provided to date is for owner-occupied properties, social housing or Part V housing.  Thirty percent of the homes are for private rental.  I appreciate that this is what we have spent a lot of our time discussing.</p></speech>

It should not matter where they are; it is a matter of having affordable housing available for people to buy or rent.  Looking at the map that HBFI provided that shows the locations of homes funded, I note there were 71 schemes altogether.  Of the 71, 45 were in Leinster.  Thirty of those were in the greater Dublin area.  I define that as Dublin and the three counties surrounding it.  You could add in Louth, which is equally in the commuter belt.  Adding it increases the number even further.  We are looking at four schemes in Galway and five in Mayo.  I would like to see the actual numbers &mdash; Deputy Verona Murphy might have asked about this &mdash; because circumstances change quite dramatically if there are 20 in one of the schemes as opposed to 150.</p></speech>

As I said to the Deputy's colleague, we will give a breakdown.  I have one but if I were to give it now, I would have to read out the figures on a county-by-county basis and I am sure the Deputy does not want me to use up time.  We will send the information to the committee.  I will also show the Deputy the number of applications we have received per county.  This relates to one of the challenges.  To get them to approval, we need to see more applications.</p><p>To get more applications, we have a role to play of course, as the Chairman said, in making sure there is awareness that we exist.  We want to fund schemes in every county.  The second challenge, however, which I cannot solve, in HBFI relates to viability.  Some of the reason for that housebuilding not happening cannot be solved by finance.  Of course, we would love to see more applications but we are seeing limited applications in the counties in which we have not funded.  Part of our role is to ensure people know we exist if building can happen in those areas and finance is constrained.</p></speech>

It keeps the rent up.  There is a large percentage of empty apartments at the rate of rents we are discussing here and yet we are funding that type of apartment.  Is that not strange?</p></speech>

If there are empty one-bedroom apartments at that level of rent, how can it be said there is a requirement for more?  Really, what is being done is ensuring rent stays up rather than reducing the rent and making the apartments available.  That level of corporate rent is being maintained and the related entities in business.  Mr. Alger should feel free if he wishes to comment on that point.</p> <p>  I find this extraordinary.  I have family living in Dublin who can tell me there are loads of empty apartments that should be rented.  We have problems with homelessness and a housing crisis but we have given the momentum fund over to the building of extraordinary one-bedroom apartments that will have an astronomical rent.  What will happen?  The witnesses cannot guarantee that these will be rented.</p></speech>

The institutes of technology end of year is 31 August.  The audit was only completed on 20 December 2021, which was 15 months after the end of the period of account.  The audit for Dublin City University was certified on 16 December for the period ending September 2020.  These are quite late being done.  In the case of Dublin City University, it has a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset and that is standard procedure for universities.</p> <p>  No. 3 is from the Royal Irish Academy of Music for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  No. 4 is from Grangegorman Development Agency for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  No. 5 is the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland for 2020.  It has a qualified audit opinion on a specific point.  The accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements of staff only as they become payable, and that is standard procedure for many health bodies at the direction of the Minister.  No. 6 is from the Judicial Council.  This is the first set of financial statements for this new body.  The period of account is 17 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.  That has a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, are from subsidiaries of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  The first is from Greyhound Racing Operations Ireland Limited for 2020, for which there was a clear audit opinion.  No. 8 is from Abergrove Limited for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  No. 9 is from Shelbourne Greyhound Stadium Limited for 2020, for which there is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The final set is from the Residential Tenancies Board for 2020.  The Members will recall that there was an omission from the accounts that were previously submitted.  As the board said it would do last week, it has immediately resubmitted.</p></speech>

Do we agree to note the accounts?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of the minutes.</p> <p>  Moving to correspondence, as previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.</p> <p>  No. 1079 PAC33 is correspondence from the Government accounting unit, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 16 February 2022.  It encloses the minute of the Minister in relation to the committee&rsquo;s reports on our examination of the 2019 appropriation accounts of the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  These are important items of correspondence as they are the formal responses to the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item and to hold it over for further consideration today.  It has been flagged for discussion by Deputy Carthy.</p> <p>  This correspondence relates to the independent building standards regulator about which we made a recommendation.  Our recommendation related to the impact the pyrite remediation scheme and defective concrete blocks grant scheme would have on the Exchequer.  On page 3 of the response, it states, "However, it should be noted that any decision regarding the establishment of an independent building standards regulator will be a matter for Government and is likely to require primary legislation".  I believe we should be getting something more concrete - pardon the pun - than that.  It is either does or it does not.  What would be the timeline for that?  We could have done with a building standards regulator 50 year ago, never mind in recent times.  One can see the significant exposure that exists by not dealing with those kinds of issues and preventing them from occurring.  It becomes financially very expensive.  This is very important and we should follow up on it.</p> <p>  Page 4 states, "As part of the Building Control Reform Agenda the National Building Control Management Project was created to provide oversight".  I am not entirely sure what the purpose of that role is.  Is it responsible for the regulation of building and construction products?  Can we establish what the full remit of that project is?  This may be a matter we can come back to.  The first page states, "current expenditure on HAP and RAS is demand led".  That may well be an matter we will come back to in the context of budgets.</p><p>If we are going to have a sizeable influx of people from Ukraine, I imagine those budgets will need some additional funds.  </p></speech>

It states that contracts have been issued to the successful tenderer and that installation will now begin.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster has flagged this matter for comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-03a.556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022030300002#HH00400"><p>The correspondence we have received from the IHRB differs greatly from the previous correspondence we got from the same body in November 2021.  In that communication, it was stated that the installation of CCTV would have been completed at all the racecourses prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  The correspondence we have received now, however, states that an estimated date cannot be given to the committee.  It is ridiculous.</p> <p>  Can we write to the IHRB again and highlight that in prior correspondence it was able specify the start of this year, January 2022, as the date for commencement, while this most recent letter from it states that it is now not possible to estimate a date or timeframe.  I do not know what to make of this.  For some reason, the IHRB does not seem to be enthusiastic to roll out this CCTV system as fast as possible.  That is a concern.  Perhaps we could send the organisation copies of these two items of correspondence.  I refer to the one from November that stated this installation would be complete by the start of this year's season and this most recent communication stating a timeframe cannot now be given for this to be done.   </p></speech>

I have noted that no timeline was provided.  Could I also suggest that we ask, because we must clarify this aspect as well, whether this installation of CCTV involves all 25 racecourses.  My understanding is that it is installed at two racecourses now.  It was confirmed that one was completed, and another was under way some time back.  As far as I am aware, then, that leaves the remainder to be done.  If we are asking for a timeline in this regard and sending a copy of the previous correspondence we received in November, we should also clarify the number of racecourses involved and whether all 25 racecourses will have CCTV installed.</p></speech>

Okay.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1092B from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 21 February 2022 providing information requested by the committee regarding payments under the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The Secretary General states that the legislation provides that while the Department funds the schemes, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners administers it.  As the Minister for Finance brought forward the legislation, any policy decisions in relation to it are a matter for the Minister and the board of the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  We have also received related correspondence from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, R1096 PAC33, and from the Department of Finance, R1105 PAC33.  Revenue states that companies making distributions, including but not exclusive to dividends to shareholders, have obligations to deduct and return dividend withholding tax, DWT.  Regarding analysis, Revenue states that DWT returns filed by companies claiming EWSS, in respect of distributions made in 2021, showed that 641 employers filed DWT returns, out of a total of 51,900 who received EWSS payments.</p> <p>  The Department of Finance has provided a detailed response outlining some of the difficulties in legislating to link and prevent the payment of any dividends to shareholders that might be based on State supports.  For example, a dividend could be deferred until the company is no longer in receipt of such supports.  The Department also refers to an interdepartmental review of Covid-19 emergency income supports, and I would propose that we request a copy of the findings of that review. </p> <p>  I propose to note and publish this item, request a copy of that review, and also to forward copies of the three items of correspondence to Deputy Nash, who raised this matter with the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  These items are flagged for discussion by Deputy Imelda Munster, but she is not with us.  The concern was about where State money being paid out in emergency supports and subsidies would wind up.  We will do what I have just set out.  We will also forward a copy of the correspondence to Deputy Nash.  </p> <p>  The next item is-----</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I flagged this correspondence for discussion.  We must question a few points with the Department.  The letter we received stated that Ireland had set an ambitious target to have 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030.  I suggest that we need to reply and ask how that figure was arrived at.  Judging by the number of EVs on the road now, which is a fraction of that target figure, we are looking at a requirement to add well over 100,000 EVs every year until 2030, but the total number of new cars sold each year hardly reaches that figure.  Considering that EVs are also much more expensive, how realistic is that target of having 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030?   I suggest we should raise this aspect with the Secretary General, Mr. Spratt, to see where that figure is coming from and what it is based on.  </p> <p>  Another issue, and one I have raised before, is that approved battery electric vehicles, BEVs, with a listed price of less than &euro;14,000 will not receive a grant.  There is also a cap of &euro;60,000 on the purchase price of all vehicles.  We should perhaps raise a concern about the cap being so high.  While EVs are more expensive, it is possible to buy them for &euro;40,000 or less.  I note that the correspondence we received in response contained a list of the type of vehicles being bought under the grant scheme.</p><p>BMWs loom very large in it and there are some Jaguars and Land Rovers which are hugely heavy vehicles.  There are also loads of Mercedes.  In corresponding with the Department we must ask, in the context of the use of public money, if any consideration has been given to reducing that subsidy.  I do not wish to sound in any way anti those people within the commuter belt, but from the figures we have seen previously it appears that a lot of these cars are bought within the general Dublin area.  People who live further away are, by and large, not buying into electric vehicles because of range anxiety.  Do we have a situation here where people in rural areas are perhaps subsidising huge electric vehicles in the greater Dublin area?  Has the Department given, or is it giving, any consideration to reducing that subsidy limit to under &euro;60,000?  It seems very high.  Would any other member wish to come in on this?  No.</p><p> No. 1098B from Mr. John Dollard, Chief Superintendent, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dated 18 February 2022 provides information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement, including steps being taken to ensure that the operational needs on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are met within procurement rules and guidelines.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Members will be aware that we are scheduled to examine An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s appropriation account on 31 March so please let the clerk know if there are any specific issues or areas of interest on which members wish to receive briefing information in advance of the meeting.  This was flagged for discussion by Deputy Matt Carthy.  Does Deputy Carthy wish to come in?  No.  I take it he is okay with this.  The correspondence sets out the reasons, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s point of view, why there was some non-compliant expenditure during Covid.  We will have an opportunity to examine that further when the representatives are before the committee on 31 March.</p><p> No. 1099B from Ms Anne Graham, chief executive of the National Transport Authority, dated 22 February 2022 provides information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the NTA on 27 January 2022.  It runs to 22 pages and includes answers to 16 issues raised across a range of areas under the NTA&rsquo;s remit.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  It was flagged for discussion by Deputies Catherine Murphy, Matt Carthy and Imelda Munster.</p></speech>

The railway order for DART+ is for the Maynooth line and the Kildare line.  They are in a process.  One of the issues I raised with the NTA was the prospect of a parallel process for some additional extensions.  The argument made by the NTA is that if we were to go back to the beginning the process would be delayed.  There is no reason, however, that there could not be a separate process to add on some additional projects.  The DART+ south west project, for example, stops at Hazelhatch.  There is absolutely no reason why it could not go to Sallins or even to Newbridge, whether or not they have done any work in advancing that.  On the other line, it could go from Maynooth to Kilcock, at the very least.  The Dart+ West project is going to include the construction of eight large railway sheds in Kilcock.  Essentially, the Dart will be going to Kilcock and the only problem is that people would not be able to get on.  It seems like a daft idea that we would not be picking that low-hanging fruit.  There is not a whole lot in the way between Hazelhatch and Sallins and perhaps this could be asked for.  Since Covid, if one is listening to the traffic reports in the morning one is far more likely to hear about congestion on the periphery.  There has been a more dramatic change there with regard to delays.  It strikes me that these are projects that could be bolted onto those two DART+ projects.  We should be asking the NTA what work it has done to advance them so they could happen in parallel, albeit with a separate process.  We were speaking about electric cars.  The best way to move people around is on public transport, if that could be made available with more frequent services and so on, which would go with the DART+ projects.</p></speech>

I do not see anything in the correspondence on that.  Perhaps the secretariat can flag this with them in our next correspondence.  This concerns the old N7 route, the Borris-in-Ossory route and the N78, which is Crettyard and Crettyard-Ballylynan.</p> <p>  We will move on to correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 1091C is from Deputy Alan Dillon, dated 21 February 2022, and is a request to the committee to consider scheduling a meeting with Eir.  I would open the floor to Deputy Dillon first but I do not believe he is present.  It was flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

No other correspondence has been flagged for consideration today</p> <p>  I will move on to our work programme.  On 10 March, we will engage with the HSE regarding expenditure on mental health services, with a particular focus on CAMHS expenditure.  Last week we agreed to request a detailed breakdown of HSE expenditure on mental health services as well as associated governance and oversight arrangements.</p> <p>  The HSE has also been advised that members might wish to examine expenditure in relation to the Owenacurra Centre in Cork, and we agreed to request that a representative from the estates management division in the HSE attend the meeting as well.</p> <p>  The HSE is aware that the committee might also wish to discuss HSE recruitment targets, budgeting, delivery and departmental oversight in the context of its expenditure on mental health services.  This is in the context of some issues that have been raised recently.</p> <p>  The week after that, 17 March, is a non-sitting week.</p> <p>  We have requested confirmation from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland that it will appear before the committee on 24 March.  This has been confirmed.</p> <p>  On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings.  The following engagements have been confirmed: An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission for the morning of 7 April; and the Policing Authority for the afternoon of 7 April.</p> <p>  There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter which means the next meeting will be on 27 April with the Department of Justice.</p><p>That is our last confirmed meeting.  We then look to engage with University of Limerick, UL, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after Easter.  We may also schedule a meeting with the Department of Health and HSE to address a number of issues that are in the public domain and which we may want to discuss with them.</p><p> Are there any other matters related to our work programme that members wish to raise?</p></speech>

As I said, we will look to engage with the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform after Easter.  There are other issues flagged up by members as well that we do not have dates set for.  Then there is the Department of Health and the HSE.  Apart from that, that is it.  There is nothing else members wish to raise.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.  Our meeting next week will be an engagement with the HSE on its 2020 financial statement.</p></speech>
