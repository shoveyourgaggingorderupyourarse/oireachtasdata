    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#C00500"><p>We have a quorum and are now in public session.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We will take the business of the committee as normal on Thursday next.  Today we will be dealing with the 2016 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts, Vote 1 - President's Establishment.  We will also have an update on the 2017 position.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach who is the Accounting Officer for the Vote relating to the President's Establishment.  I thank him making himself available, especially as I understand he had an accident.  His arm is in a sling and he is somewhat incapacitated.  We wish him a speedy recovery.</p><p>I draw the committee's attention to some distinctions relating to Vote 1.  First, while Mr. Fraser is the Accounting Officer for Vote 1, he does not have operational responsibility for the Office of the President.  Second, our examination will be carried out in a way that respects the constitutional independence of the Office of the President, as per Article 13.8.1 of the Constitution which states, &quot;The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas or to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.&quot;  I know members appreciate this point.</p><p>As Chairman, I want to put the purpose and timing of this particular meeting in context.  An Taoiseach discusses the Estimates and related information for Vote 1 before a select committee of the D&aacute;il every year.  The related appropriation account is voted on in the D&aacute;il at the end of each year.  The actual appropriation accounts for 2017, which include Vote 1, the President's Establishment will be published by the Comptroller and Auditor General on Friday next, 28 September.  The Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform will publish the 2019 abridged Estimates for Vote 1, the President's Establishment, as part of his Budget Statement on 9 October.  Our role as the Committee of Public Accounts is to complete the cycle by examining the allocation of moneys to the President's Establishment and how they were spent and to look at the governance and oversight measures adopted by the Accounting Officer relating to that expenditure.</p><p>Regarding the timing of this meeting, certain questions regarding the President's Establishment were raised over the summer months.  The first opportunity this committee had to discuss these was on Thursday last.  As already stated, this committee has a clear role in respect of the examination of all voted expenditure.  However, I was concerned that we would do so in a way that is respectful of the upcoming election process.  As a result, I proposed - and the committee agreed - that this examination should take place at the earliest opportunity and in advance of the closing date for nominations, which is tomorrow.  Unfortunately, it was not feasible to hold this meeting any earlier and I wanted to put that on the record.</p><p>Before we begin, I want to summarise guidance for members because of the unique nature of this particular Vote.  Objective questions relating to oversight and control of moneys allocated to or for the benefit of the President's Establishment are obviously in order.  Detailed questions relating to expenditure that would, of their nature, potentially concern decisions or actions of the President are not in order.  For other matters, I will carefully weigh up the question asked before deciding whether a particular matter is in order.  We expect to get answers to all of our questions today.  However, any matters that are not clarified will be dealt with at a later date.  I ask for full co-operation from all members in this regard.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off.  I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.9" nospeaker="true" time="10:00:00" ><p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect the witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to make the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement.</p></speech>

The 2016 Appropriation Account for Vote 1, President's Establishment, shows gross expenditure of &euro;3.6 million.  Expenditure in relation to the centenarian's bounty scheme accounted for &euro;1.15 million, with the balance relating to other expenses of the President's Establishment.  The amount provided in the Estimate for 2016 was &euro;3.9 million.  After receipts for the year of &euro;84,000 were taken into account, a surplus of &euro;287,000 was surrendered.  There were no matters arising from the audit of the Vote for the President's Establishment that I considered warranted reporting.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. Fraser to make his opening remarks and note that he has not sent a pre-scripted opening statement.</p></speech>

I apologise for that.  I do not have much to add to what the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.  The spend of &euro;3.6 million in 2016 is set out in the account in a lot of detail.  There is only one non-office expenditure, the centenarian's bounty, which is the amount paid to people on reaching 100 years, in the country each year.  My position is a little bit different in respect of Vote 1 in that I do not have any executive authority over the Office of the President, for obvious reasons.</p> <p>  Broadly speaking, in 2017 the spend is again approximately &euro;3.7 million and that was again within budget, but the account has not been published yet.  As I stated in my letter, I rely in the main on the Comptroller and Auditor General for assurance on the accounts, and he has found no problems.  That is all I have to say in the way of an opening statement.</p></speech>

He will be free to answer questions in so far as the Constitution permits.  As it is a special meeting members have indicated the sequence in which they wish to speak.  It has been agreed that each member will have a ten-minute slot and if people want to come back a second time they can do so.  Members have indicated in the following sequence: Deputies Bobby Aylward, Alan Farrell, Catherine Connolly, Shane Cassells, David Cullinane and Catherine Murphy.  Deputy Alan Kelly is next and we will see what happens after that.  Deputy Aylward has ten minutes and because of the nature of the meeting I ask members to strictly adhere to the ten minute time slot.</p></speech>

When there is a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General our remit is to scrutinise the Vote and to make sure there is value for money for the taxpayers of this country who pay to keep the system in place.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said &euro;3.6 million was the overall amount spent in 2016.  In one of last Sunday's newspapers I read there had been a cost of &euro;50 million.  I do not know where that amount came from.  That would be &euro;7 million a year.  Where did such a figure come from or how did anyone come up with the amount?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#D00700"><p>Could the Deputy clarify the figure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#D00800"><p>I read in a newspaper that since 2011 a total of &euro;50 million was spent on the Presidency.  I am just asking Mr. Fraser or Mr. McCarthy to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#D00900"><p>I did not see the article on Sunday.  I imagine the calculation is based on aggregating the figures from the operating costs statement of the account.  That statement tries to get the full costs associated with a service and so it brings in expenses that are borne on other Votes for which other Accounting Officers are responsible and includes them in the operating costs statement.  If we go to page 7 of the Appropriation Account we will see a figure in 2016 of &euro;8.2 million, and at the bottom of the page there is a breakdown.  The net allied services figure is &euro;4.6 million and the breakdown of it is given there.</p><p>It indicates the other Votes and the Central Fund as being the sources.</p></speech>

There are other costs from the Garda, security, the Army and so forth.</p></speech>

It was &euro;2.4 million in 2016.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#E00600"><p>Is the &euro;3.6 million a true reflection, therefore, of the costs of having the Presidency in place, or could it be more than &euro;7 million?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#E00700"><p>The point of the operating costs statement is to try to get the full costs of the service.  The Vote is specifically for office expenses and the centenarian bounty, as I have said.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Fraser happy with the procedure and the governance of the moneys that are spent?  He is the Accounting Officer and he must stand over this each year.  Is he happy with the way it is spent and distributed?  Is he happy with all the procedures that are in place?</p></speech>

If the Deputy is asking whether I am happy with the financial management, controls and oversight, I am.  My main assurance comes from the clean audit reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

If Mr. Fraser believed there was an overspend or money was being spent unnecessarily, if there was extravagance or whatever else one might call it, who has control or the authority to check that and call it in?  Can that happen and is it scrutinised to keep it under control in order that there is value for money in what is spent?</p></speech>

If there was any sense that the proper procedures were not being followed in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, that would be picked up either under internal audit in the future or by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

Who decides who goes where?  Who in the President's office decides who goes where, what hotels are used and what travel arrangements there are?</p></speech>

I can help somewhat.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade makes most of the travel arrangements but I cannot get into who in the President's office makes decisions.</p></speech>

I am following the money, which is our job.  I am asking a straight question and I do not want to overstep any mark or make any accusation.  All I am asking is whether we are getting value for money on all aspects of the spend on Vote 1, the President's Establishment.  That is what I am trying to get at.

If there was a state visit, and I am not talking about the incumbent but rather any President here, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would make the travel arrangements in the host country.  While it has its own procedures, broadly speaking it is interested in logistics, security, location, whether a venue is suitable and so on.  Regarding the Deputy's general point, it is the responsibility of the people in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, and to a lesser extent in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I get assurance from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If he saw anywhere where procedure was not being followed, he would highlight it.</p></speech>

One thing about an appropriation account is that there must be no overspending.  That is the priority.  One is always aiming to come in under the budget provided.  The 10% underspend is about what is usual on the President's Establishment Vote and it is not out of line with spending for similar small offices or Departments.</p></speech>

Let me put it as follows.  If I received an internal audit report or management letter or audit report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which gave rise to concern, I would have to take it up with staff in the Office of the President because that is my responsibility.  However, I would not seek to intervene in the operations of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  As I am sure people understand, the relationships between the Government and the President and the Oireachtas and the President are very delicate.  As such, it would be with the greatest reluctance that I would intervene in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  However, if a financial issue of the kind which would interest the committee arose, I would have to ask questions of the people in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and hope to have it fixed.

The third point was that there is a very profound constitutional issue which everyone accepts here.  The fourth point was that I was worried about political impartiality in the context of an election campaign, as I am in any other situation.  Finally, I made the point that the President is, of course, open to scrutiny and will be in the election campaign.  I felt they were important points to make.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Fraser.  I will comment briefly on the decision to hold this meeting.  I was not present at the previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts when the decision was made to have this hearing.  Had I been present, I would have said that it stinks for us to make a decision to look at presidential expenditure the day before the closing date for nominations for the Presidency and the election.  That said, the decision has been made democratically and I respect that.</p> <p>  From a procedural perspective, I note the references to the audit committee's chair being absent in 2016 and for a period of 22 weeks from the date on which the accounts were to be filed to the actual date of the filing of the accounts.  Will Mr. McCarthy comment on those two issues?</p></speech>

I did get what the Accounting Officer was required to do.</p></speech>

I get management letters from the Comptroller and Auditor General at quite a level of detail.  I am obviously an Accounting Officer for the Taoiseach's Department, another small enough organisation.  Nonetheless, I am very familiar with the procedures.  I was a finance officer and set up the audit committee in the Taoiseach's Department, as well as in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  I am very familiar with all of these themes.  In fact I wrote a thesis on value for money if the Deputy really wants to get bored.</p> <p>  I was happy that I was getting clean audit reports and reasonable management letters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's team in the &Aacute;ras.  That gave me the assurance.  Indeed, the committee has the same assurance from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There were particular circumstances, which were not ideal but, I am afraid, were rather sensitive.  I just felt it is not appropriate to go into them.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McCarthy.  As has already been acknowledged, I acknowledge that opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General is that the Appropriation Account properly presents the receipts and expenditure of 2016, with adequate accounting records and so on.  I accept that.  I am looking at the controls and processes in place.  That is all we are looking at in this committee.  Let us look at the audit committee which Mr. Fraser set up in spring 2014 for the first time ever.  Talk to me a little bit about an internal audit.</p></speech>

I have to mention something positive.  When I look back on the appropriation accounts for all of the years, there was very little information prior to Mr. Fraser's time, so it gradually improved in terms of what is written down.  On 23 March 2016, he talks about periodic reviews and states that the internal audit function and its programme are subject to periodic reviews.  The previous year he said exactly the same thing.  Did he carry out periodic reviews?</p></speech>

I want to touch on expanding on the net programme costs of the Presidency and the true reflection of the course born.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's short opening statement refers to the appropriation accounts and gross expenditure of &euro;3.6 million but, as has been pointed out by Mr. McCarthy himself, when one goes to page 7 of the appropriation accounts, the net programme cost is &euro;8.1 million.  We therefore have this direct expenditure of &euro;3.5 million and then these net allied services at a cost of over &euro;4.5 million.  This reminds me a little of when we were trying to get to the bottom of the accounts for local government.  Obviously, the net allied costs are quite significant, even more so when one discounts what is paid in terms of the centenary and the bounty.  Then the President's Establishment is only &euro;2.4 million, yet the net allied costs are &euro;4.6 million.  In order that I understand this, how does the Office of the President make those demands, whether it be the office of the Minister for Justice and Equality, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW or the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for defence?  There are half a dozen different departments there.  As has been pointed out, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW went from &euro;2 million in the 2015 accounts to nearly &euro;2.5 million in 2016.</p><p>In the overall context of these accounts, that was a significant amount.  The OPW's figure is now as much as that relating to the President's Establishment, which comes in at &euro;2.4 million.  Expenditure under Vote 36 - Defence went from &euro;408,000 to &euro;431,000.  How does this work?  Are demands made by the Office of the President for X, Y and Z needs to be met and various Departments then make the requisite appropriations to meet them?</p></speech>

The Constitution actually requires the President to live in an official residence.  The &Aacute;ras does not place a demand for the accommodation to be provided.  Rather, the Constitution makes the demand.</p></speech>

Cumulative expenses of &euro;4.6 million are not falling directly under the Office of the President but are being spent on that office.

Is it the case that the Garda Commissioner would, for example, consider last week's situation of someone going straight through the gates and saying "Hello" to the President and decide that the security arrangements at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in need to be reviewed and allowances need to be made for increasing the security detail?

There is &euro;4.6 million being spent on the President's Establishment by other Departments and it is not coming from its Vote.  In order to examine it, we would have to spend days in having the individual Accounting Officers come and asking them what they are doing in terms of spending on the President's Establishment.  By the way, if they are accountable, that is what we will end up doing.  People can answer these questions because the money is coming from different Departments.  It does not come under the auspices of the President's Establishment at all.  For example, the Department of Defence went from spending a sum of &euro;408,000 to &euro;431,000.  What was the purpose of the additional expenditure?  Was the increase initiated by the Department of Defence or the Office of the President?  I think I have put that question in a compact fashion.</p></speech>

That goes to the root of the issue in this interaction.  Moneys are being spent on the President's Establishment that do not come within the remit of the supposed Accounting Officer but cumulatively the cost is very big.  As Deputy Bobby Aylward said, they give a proper and true reflection of the cost of the Office of the President.  Perhaps I might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General about this in the light of his role in dealing with all of these Accounting Officers.  Is it the case that they are coming up with it themselves?  Are they saying they anticipate additional expenditure in these areas?  If there is to be some big event in a particular year and a Department has to allocate expenditure for it, I am sure the Office of the President has to alert the Department concerned to the need for additional expenditure, expenditure which does not come within the remit of the office but which it thinks the Department needs to put aside to cater for the event.  Does Mr. McCarthy understand the question?</p></speech>

In 2016 there were seven State visits approved by the Office of the President, although I think the number came in at nine in the end.  How does that work?  Is it the Office of the President that sets down the expenditure figure and how it will work or is it the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  I am trying to find out which Department is actually running the show.</p></speech>

Like every other office and Vote, there is an estimate of the cost for the year which is published in the Estimates.  As the Chairman pointed out, it is reviewed by the relevant committee of the House.  The Estimate is voted through and it is then for the Office of the President to expend the money granted to it.  It is very clear from the appropriation account - some things are self-evident - that it does it in conjunction with the OPW for the reasons I have outlined; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of security; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, mainly in respect of foreign travel; and the Department of Defence because there are five Defence Forces personnel stationed in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.</p></speech>

I am trying to get a feel for whether it is the individual Departments that make adjudications on the Office of the President or whether it is the office that makes requests of the individual Departments in terms of how the figure for expenditure anticipated for a coming year is arrived at.  Who is making the judgment call on how much it should cost and how much it will cost?</p></speech>

That is interesting.  I understand the constitutional position, but with regard to scrutiny or accountability of the spend, there is a block, or certainly a practice, that Mr. Fraser does not respond to freedom of information, FOI, requests from people outside the Oireachtas.  In the letter that Mr. Fraser sent to this committee he quite rightly pointed out that the President is not accountable to either House of the Oireachtas, which is fine.  What is the logic or the reason there is no response to FOI requests or a refusal to engage in that regard?  Is that something Mr. Fraser would respond to or is it something the &Aacute;ras would respond to?</p></speech>

I believe that government has felt the President should be separate to the normal run, and that is the policy.  There is also a fundamental constitutional issue, which is the article I mentioned in my letter, in that the President cannot be answerable to the Oireachtas or to the courts.  The freedom of information legislation ultimately leads to the courts.  That is the constitutional-----</p></speech>

I want to put on record that I think all public moneys should be subject to scrutiny.  I do think, however, that the timing of this is very unfortunate, to put a benign interpretation on it.  Once the writ was moved, I think we should have delayed this until after the presidential election.  So be it.  The committee has decided to have this hearing today.</p> <p>  There is quite a substantial difference between the Committee of Public Accounts and the freedom of information provisions in terms of the information that is forthcoming.  There may be an expectation that we are going to see a big box of receipts or something here today which, of course, is never the case.  There may be an expectation that we are going to be trawling through travel, accommodation and all that kind of stuff.  That expectation was never going to be realised.  That would never be the case with any organisation that we look at here.  We have a difficulty in portraying what the role of the Committee of Public Accounts is when we fall into that kind of situation.</p><p> I would like to explore slightly further the line of questioning Deputy Cullinane opened up regarding the Freedom of Information Act.  My memory of what happened with that Act is that most of the real focus related to whether freedom of information requests should be paid for as opposed to an emphasis on the various aspects that were excluded from the process, although some attention was paid to those.  Was Mr. Fraser asked for his opinion on whether the Office of the President should be excluded from the freedom of information process?  I presume all Departments would have been asked for an input.  Does Mr. Fraser recall being specifically asked about that and, if so, what was his response?</p></speech>

If one does not get it, one can appeal to the Information Commissioner and, ultimately, to the courts.  In that context, putting the Office of the President under the freedom of information legislation would include it in a process that could lead to the courts.  That would be, in my opinion, the difficulty.  I think it is a policy matter and that it should not arise in respect of the accounts.  I do not want to be unhelpful to the Deputy but I think that is a serious point.</p></speech>

I do not think that it is in respect of the general headings that possible concerns arise.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General had most of the responsibility for this in the absence of the audit committee.  I recognise that the audit committee was put in place on his insistence that it would happen, albeit that it did not function as it should.  In terms of his engagement with the &Aacute;ras, his office would have had full sight all of all of the documentation.  Would he have examined matters such as value for money or was the purpose just to reinforce that the audit was clear?  Has there been any issue highlighted over the years - whether during this or a previous Presidency - which has caused the Comptroller and Auditor General a difficulty?</p></speech>

It would not have mattered would was President at the time but the incumbent played a central role.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General aware whether the difference for 2016 relating to the Office of Public Works involved physical changes to the &Aacute;ras or would that all have been accounted for by virtue of the various additional activities in that year?</p></speech>

That is something the Deputy would have to get from the Accounting Officer for the Office of Public Works.  One thing the Deputy should bear in mind is that the expenditure is on a cash basis so if, for example, there were significant building works or adjustments made within a year, the full cost of that would be charged here.  We would not be looking at the depreciation figure or whatever.  There can be lumpy patterns in the spending because it is cash.  I know that a substantial part of that is the maintenance and upkeep of the buildings and the grounds of the &Aacute;ras.</p></speech>

There was a change from 2015 to 2016 in respect of expenditure by the National Shared Services Office.  Obviously, this is related to salaries.  Given that many, although not all, Departments and State organisations are covered by the National Shared Services Office, payroll is obviously the big ticket item.

I am not interested in whether the person was on holidays.  Deputy Connolly made the point very clearly earlier.  The fact is, when the chairman was missing the committee did not do anything for nearly three years.  Against the backdrop of the letter Mr. Fraser sent to the committee last week, that is a problem.  Like Deputy Murphy I take the view that, leaving aside the Constitution, all public money should be subject to scrutiny.</p> <p>  In terms of the expertise of the people on the audit committee, are they accountants?</p></speech>

Perhaps it is something the audit committee set up in 2016 can look at once it gets around to it in 2018 or 2019.  What procedures govern the expenditure or use of the sum of &euro;317,000?  Perhaps we could have an indication, staying within the bounds of the constitutional position, of what it has been used for in the last seven or, for that matter, ten or 20 years.  It seems bizarre that &euro;317,000 of public money is given to whomever on an annual basis, with no oversight or responsibility by anybody, while Mr. Fraser, as Accounting Officer, states to me that he presumes there are procedures in place that govern it in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and the Comptroller and Auditor General confirms that he does not audit it.

What statutory instrument it is, I do not care about.  The bottom line is that we have established that &euro;317,000 per year is paid to somebody and nobody has any interest in and oversight of what it is spent on.  That is significant.</p></speech>

Whoever was responsible at the time, we do not know on what the money was spent per year and still do not.  We want to get the procedures, albeit we know that the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach does not know and that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not responsible and does not know.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance also does not know or have a role in auditing that amount of money.  That is significant and if it is all we find out today, it is good work.</p></speech>

I mentioned the Office of Public Works, OPW, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all the people in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who incur costs in their Departments, borne by their Departments, but it is for the benefit of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  That is it in a nutshell.  The Comptroller and Auditor General records that in note 1.1 in his accounts.  That is in the Government accounting rules.  A memorandum the witnesses would have received relating to net allied services states, "Departments are required to include actual figures where possible rather than the previous practice of estimated expenditure."  It continues, "However, in addition, both the providers and receivers of allied services are reminded to ensure that for the 2017 account the allied services are still relevant and that the breakdown across Departments is provided using an up to date and reasonable method of calculation/apportionment."  What kind of assurances has Mr. Fraser received from, for example, the OPW, such that he is satisfied what it has listed under this &euro;2.4 million in 2016 was fair and reasonable?  What assurances has Mr. Fraser received from those Accounting Officers?  What is the system?</p></speech>

I looked at the &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in website last night.  It provides useful information about the items we are discussing.  There was a discussion about the shared services provided by the Office of Public Works.  It lists on its website the costs for last year of &euro;2.5 million.  It is on the website and I am sure that Mr. McCarthy will publish the figures on Friday with his appropriation account.  The OPW staff costs are listed as &euro;800,000.  The building work going on in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in cost &euro;261,000.  Electricity and gas cost &euro;182,000.  Property maintenance cost &euro;1.283 million.  &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in puts that information up itself.  It is a big figure and we do not have a breakdown here.  I want to be helpful to people who are watching by giving that breakdown which was received.  One other item is mentioned on the website.  It says the Central Fund of &euro;894,000 includes:</p><blockquote>- Costs not covered elsewhere in the Vote for the Presidential Establishment (eg. hospitality for 20,000 visitors, State Dinners, community events, etc.)<br /><br />- Pensions for former Presidents<br /><br />- President's salary</blockquote> <p>Mr. Fraser cannot answer this because he is not the Accounting Officer for the Central Fund.  Has Mr. McCarthy any information about how much of the &euro;894,000 related to pensions or hospitality?  Has he looked at that as part of the audit of the Central Fund?</p></speech>

On the allowance which was mentioned earlier and which is referred to under emoluments and allowances as part of the Central Fund payment, the &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in website states that there is - from the Central Fund - a payment in respect of hospitality for 20,000 visitors.  Perhaps there is a relationship, although I do not know.  Does Mr. Fraser know?  It might be helpful if someone knew.</p></speech>

That Central Fund figure of &euro;894,000 in the accounts includes the allowance and various other things, such as pensions and the President's salary.  I think some of that is used for entertainment for, as the &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in website says, 20,000 visitors a year, State dinners and so on.  However, the OPW also employs household staff.  This is because there are permanent staff in the &Aacute;ras who deal with catering and so on.  The OPW also probably meets expenses like equipment costs, etc.</p></speech>

Obviously, transparency is critical and there may be some information that has come out today that helps in regard to that.  I understand that this is the first time we have ever done this.  As regards future transparency, are there issues in respect of which Mr. Fraser feels improvements could be made?  We have many priorities on this committee across a range of issues and, obviously, if we want to discuss this Vote, we will make the decision to do so.  I am not saying that we will not do so.  From a transparency point of view, are there more changes or inclusions that can happen in regard to how this Vote is brought out to the public that would ensure we have more information so that, when it comes to looking at our priorities as a committee, we will be able to leverage that and use it to identify whether this is a priority?  It is up to every committee to decide.  Are there changes that could be made or better platforms for providing information that would help?</p></speech>

It was certainly very appropriate to hold this meeting and I do not agree with any comments about it stinking or being inappropriate timing.  If this Committee of Public Accounts cannot look at the appropriation account for the President's Establishment, we are in serious trouble as a committee.  I fully support the Chairman in holding this meeting.  It is very important that we look at processes.  I have not mentioned a single President.  I have looked at processes, and Mr. Fraser has admitted that the processes leave something to be desired.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

That is great.  Today we have looked at the matter and we have seen that no audit committee sat.  I do not want to hammer Mr. Fraser as we have been through the matter, but it concerns me that when I look back at the previous years, I do not see where it was highlighted that there was no audit committee.  I would have thought the lack of an audit committee would be a basic thing to highlight.  If I go back, to 2013 or 2014, Mr. Fraser continually talks about the office having an internal audit function with appropriately trained personnel which operates in accordance with a charter and so on, but actually it was never operating.  Is that correct, or am I wrong?</p></speech>

I am thinking in the context of the Garda, the education and training boards and the other organisations we have had before us.  We were very hard on them in respect of processes and procedures.  The first time I see anything about an audit committee is in Mr. Fraser's 2016 appropriation account.  Does he see where I am coming from?  There is not an open and accountable system.  One thing is being said on paper but the operation of that is not happening on the ground.  Is that not right?  If this is happening with the President's Establishment, regardless of who the President is, we are not giving out a proper message here on accountability, are we?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General seems to be the main person responsible even though his role is only as auditor.  Mr. Fraser has tried to pass the buck to him a few times.  There is also the audit committee in the &Aacute;ras.  The question of who is responsible needs to be established.  With other audits, the Comptroller and Auditor General makes a report and we ask questions based on what he lays before us, but there seems to be some crisscrossing today.  That is something that we should take from our meeting.</p> <p>  I looked up the reason the Committee of Public Accounts exists, that being, the three Es and two Ps.  We investigate whether something has been done economically, efficiently and effectively in line with procedures and privileges.  No one seems to have answered Deputy MacSharry's question on the &euro;317,000 that seems to have appeared from out of the blue.  I knew nothing about it until he mentioned it, but no one present is responsible for it or even able to throw any light on why it was paid.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that it was not paid out of the Vote, but under a 1997 Act.  That and what the money is for need to be clarified.  It is &euro;317,000 of taxpayers' money.  The question on why and how it was spent must be answered within a short time.  Let us know why it was spent so that the public in general and the presidential candidates - the nomination process closes tomorrow - can know what the &euro;317,000 entailed and on what grounds it was spent.  This question needs to be answered sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

It is not about what it is spent on or about the amount of money.  Indeed, this allowance or whatever it is - about which none of us know anything and which is not taxable - could be &euro;1 million.  That is not the point.  The point is that we, as the public, are entitled to know that Mr. McCarthy, as Comptroller and Auditor General, is auditing and having a look at this and that it is being done in the right way.  Even the perception of it being some kind of a slush fund is damaging.  I wonder could Mr. McCarthy give us any information other than suggesting that he presumes that there are procedures to govern that fund in the &Aacute;ras.  We look forward to getting that information as early as possible.</p> <p>  Again, I concur 100% with Deputy Connolly.  It was remiss of previous Committees of Public Accounts not to do this, rather than mischievous of this committee to do so.  I hope it is done every year in the future.  This meeting is timely and has been informative.  I can certainly think of 317,000 reasons it was a good exchange today.</p></speech>

Commissioner Hogan presented this draft directive to the EU Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, COMAGRI, for the first time in April this year.  It is one of a range of initiatives aimed at strengthening the power of the primary producer in the food supply chain and improving transparency and predictability.  In addition to the proposed directive, these initiatives include measures aimed at improving price transparency, support for producer organisations and co-operation between farmers, to improve their collective bargaining power and the possibility for them to make complaints regarding unfair trading practices.</p> <p>  The draft directive has since been discussed in detail at four meetings of a working group, and at four meetings of the Special Committee on Agriculture, SCA, to date.  The Austrian Presidency has proposed a number of amendments to the Commission text on key issues based on these discussions, and today we received a further Presidency draft following the latest SCA discussion on 17 September.</p> <p>  When a general position is agreed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it will form the basis for a mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament.  The European Parliament, meanwhile, will bring forward its own proposed changes to the draft directive.  Mr. Paolo de Castro, MEP, has been appointed as the rapporteur for the proposal to COMAGRI in the European Parliament.  We understand that a plenary vote on the European Parliament&rsquo;s proposals is planned for late October.  Members may have seen the interesting debate on the proposal at COMAGRI yesterday afternoon in the European Parliament.</p> <p>  When an agreed approach is in place on the Council side and the Parliament side, trilogues will begin between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to seek agreement on a final version of the directive.  The objective is to have the directive enacted before European Parliament elections next May.  While this timescale is ambitious, all sides have made every effort to expedite the process.</p> <p>  I now turn to the unfair trading practices that are covered in the proposal.  The proposed directive does not ban all potential unfair trading practices, UTPs, but instead establishes a shortlist of prohibited UTPs in the food supply chain.  Article 43 of the draft directive classifies these UTPs into two groups.  The first group are practices that are simply unfair; the second are practices that may be acceptable if clearly agreed by the parties, and would become unfair only when applied without agreement.</p><p>In terms of the first group, the four trading practices that would be prohibited outright are as follows: </p><blockquote>A buyer pays a supplier for perishable food products as follows: in cases where the supplier presents the invoice, later than 30 calendar days after the receipt of the supplier's invoice, provided that delivery has been made; or in cases where the buyer presents the invoice, later than 30 calendar days after the date of delivery of the perishable food products, or where products are delivered on a regular basis under a supply agreement, later than 30 calendar days after the end of each month in which deliveries have been made;<b></b>a buyer cancels orders of perishable food products at such short notice that a supplier cannot reasonably be expected to find an alternative to commercialise or use these products; a buyer unilaterally and retroactively changes the terms of the supply agreement concerning the frequency, method, place, timing or volume of the supply or delivery of the agrifood products or the quality standards or prices of the agrifood products; and, a buyer requests a supplier to pay for the deterioration or loss of agrifood products, or both, that occurs on the buyer's premises and is not caused by the negligence or fault of the supplier.</blockquote><p>The four trading practices that fall into the second group would be prohibited, unless they are agreed in clear and unambiguous terms at the conclusion of the supply agreement.  They are as follows: a buyer returns unsold agrifood products to a supplier; a buyer charges a supplier payment as a condition for the stocking, displaying or listing agrifood products of the supplier; a buyer requests a supplier to pay for the promotion of agrifood products sold by the buyer - prior to a promotion, and if that promotion is initiated by the buyer, the buyer shall specify the period of the promotion and the expected quantity of the agrifood products to be ordered; and, a buyer requests a supplier to pay for the marketing of agrifood products by the buyer. <br/><br/>I should note that I am citing the latest Presidency text dated 17 September.  As I have explained, the text was updated today and has not yet been agreed as the Council position.<br/><br/>One important point to note is that Ireland has suggested that a clause be added to the section on payments within 30 days, which now reads as follows: &quot;where products are delivered on a regular basis under a supply agreement, later than 30 calendar days after the end of each month in which deliveries have been made&quot;.  Without this extra provision, the existing milk cheque payment system in Ireland might potentially have had to change, with significant additional administrative costs.<br/><br/><b></b>I shall now discuss the scope of the draft directive.  In presenting the draft directive to the Agriculture Council in April, Commissioner Hogan emphasised that his aim was to provide a minimum common standard on unfair trading practices in the food supply chain across the EU.  Many member states, but not all, already have specific national rules that protect suppliers against unfair trading practices occurring in business to business relationships in the agrifood supply chain.  However, member states' unfair trading practices rules, where they exist, are divergent.  This directive proposes to allow member states to integrate the relevant rules into their national legislation in such a way as to bring about a cohesive regime.  Member states will not be precluded from maintaining, introducing, adopting or applying stricter national rules provided such rules do not interfere with the proper functioning of the Single Market.<br/><br/>The draft directive proposes the prohibition of certain unfair trading practices, UTPs, as I have outlined, which occur in terms of the sales of food products by a small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, supplier, including farmers, and to a buyer, that is a large entity and larger than an SME.  The EU defines SMEs as <i>&quot;</i>Enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding &euro;50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding &euro;43 million<i>&quot;.</i>In setting out the directive in this way it seeks to contribute to ensuring a fair standard of living for those producers who are particularly vulnerable to UTPs, have the least bargaining power, and are least able to address UTPs without negative effects on their economic viability, particularly as agricultural products are perishable and seasonable, and subject to adverse weather conditions. <br/><br/>The issue of the scope of the proposed directive, in terms of the size of the entities concerned, has been a key issue for debate at the working groups and at the Special Committee on Agriculture, SCA.  Some member states have suggested that, rather than being confined to small sellers and large buyers only, the scope should be extended to also provide protection to large sellers, and that the directive should also apply to small SME buyers.  However, both the Council and Commission Legal Services have advised that the legal basis of Article 43.2 of the EU treaty, which is being used for the proposed directive, would be open to a legal challenge if the scope of the directive was extended.  Article 43.2 allows for the Council to establish the common market for Agriculture and Fisheries to pursue the objective of Article 39b, which is as follows: &quot;to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture&quot;.<i></i>Thus UTPs that threaten the profitability of farmers fall under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and therefore the legal basis of Article 43.2, which contributes to the achievement of fair living standards for farmers, is an appropriate legal basis.<br/><br/>The Commission and Council Legal Services have indicated that if the scope is opened to all buyers and sellers, it will be protecting large companies against each other and Article 43.2 could not, therefore, be an appropriate legal basis.  It is on the basis of this legal advice that Ireland, while recognising the desirability of extending the scope of the directive to address the issue of unfair practices, irrespective of the size of the entity, has acknowledged at the recent SCA meetings the concerns of the legal services about the legal basis for further extending the scope.  Ireland also recognised the possibility, set out in Article 8 of the draft directive, for member states to lay down or maintain stricter rules to extend the scope to other types of buyers and suppliers and to prohibit other UTPs in national legislation.  We have just received a revised Presidency text and there will be further discussion on this in the weeks ahead.  <br/><br/><b></b>In terms of Irish legislation<b>, </b>at present in Ireland UTPs are addressed under our national legislation entitled the Consumer Protection Act 2007 (Grocery Goods Undertakings) Regulations 2016.  Article 3 relates to &quot;any food or drink that is intended to be sold for human consumption by a grocery goods undertaking engaged in the retail or wholesale of grocery goods in the State that has, or is a member of a group of related undertakings that has, an annual worldwide turnover of more than &euro;50 million so the entity covered is larger than an SME.&quot;  Therefore in Irish law, the regulatory burden falls on large non-SME retailers and wholesalers only.  A similar approach is in place in the UK where we export over 40% of our agrifood exports.<br/><br/>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, DBEI, is the lead Department in the area of UTPs at retail level in Ireland.  Recently the Department completed a public consultation process on the draft directive.  DBEI has been consulted by my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on each draft, while my Department has met stakeholders and kept them informed of developments. <br/><br/>Under the proposed directive, member states are required to designate a competent authority for enforcement of the agreed directive.  At present in Ireland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, is the competent authority for the implementation of the existing Grocery Goods Undertakings Regulations 2016.  The definition of buyer in the proposed UTP directive is considerably broader than in our grocery regulations.  While likewise confined to large non-SME entities, a buyer is defined as an entity that &quot;buys agrifood products by way of trade&quot;, so that, unlike the grocery regulations, it is not confined to retailers and wholesalers only.  This considerably increases the number of entities that will require to be regulated under the directive.  This will require that domestic legislation be amended to bring the directive into operation, and would also have significant resource implications and requirements for the enforcement authority envisaged in the draft directive.<br/><br/>So far Ireland has been successful in negotiations in suggesting additions to the draft Presidency text in ensuring that the milk cheque system that we currently have is not inadvertently affected by the 30-day payment rule, and also in addressing text that has raised constitutional issues for Ireland in terms of, for example, the issue of fines and the burden of proof.</p><p>In conclusion, I acknowledge, as has Commissioner Hogan, that this is very much a first step in tackling unfair trading practices across the EU.  However, given Ireland&lsquo;s export focus, having that minimum common standard to protect smaller suppliers against larger buyers of food products across the Single Market would in itself represent significant progress in terms of transparency and predictability of supply arrangements, with benefits for the consumer as well as farmer.</p><p> I very much welcome the opportunity to hear the committee's input and answer the questions of members.</p></speech>

Before I open the session to questions from members, I acknowledge that Ms McPhillips stated this is an important first step on the issue.  Is the directive very restrictive?

As I stated, four UTPs are prohibited outright and a further four practices may only be agreed with the consent of the supplier and the buyer.  It does not extend to all trading practices that might be characterised as unfair.  The legal basis for that, as the Commission and Council legal services have explained, is that contract law differs greatly between member states, so trying to capture all possible practices would significantly extend the scope of the directive into areas of national legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.698" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018092500002#J00400"><p>Approximately three, four or five years ago, a previous committee compiled a report on unfair trading practices.  One of its recommendations was the establishment of an independent arbitrator, such as that provided for under the British system.  Is the directive a stepping stone towards the provision of such a role in Ireland?  The United Kingdom has its own independent system but Ireland did not go down that road at the time.</p></speech>

It has a system for dealing with these matters and is very much at the forefront of educating suppliers and buyers on what practices are acceptable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.700" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018092500002#J00600"><p>I am a little disappointed by the lack of range in the directive.  It seems tokenistic compared with what I hoped for.  From my reading of it - correct me if I am wrong - it basically legalises the policing of contracts.  The measures proposed by the directive already exist for suppliers, producers and retailers under contracts of supply.  Breach of contract is addressed by European, Irish and international law.  The directive seems to be a duplication of contract policing.  I would like to hear Ms McPhillips's comments on those observations.</p> <p>  All members present are from a farming background.  I was hoping for something that would police and break down cartel buying but this document contains nothing to address that.  It addresses contracts with existing customers and farmers who supply produce but we will still have the situation whereby a farmer selling to a multinational will be a price taker.  While there is no such thing as an official cartel, multinationals have cartel-like buying power.  That was the kernel I wanted to see addressed in this legislation.  Farming organisations and the farming public hoped that this directive would give the small-time farmer supplier some rights and power in negotiating contracts and price with the larger multinationals.  I do not see any of that provided for in the directive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.701" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad McPhillips" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018092500002#J00700"><p>I accept that it is a modest proposal.  It is one of a range of proposals that the Commission has brought forward to address issues in the food supply chain.  Another of the proposals which I probably only mentioned in passing is an initiative aimed at strengthening the role of producer organisations and trying to extend them to other sectors.  The dairy sector is probably the best example of the co-operative movement and the power it gives to farmers who work together in a co-op.  Other initiatives brought forward by Commissioner Hogan include measures aimed at improving price transparency along the chain.  We have seen the success of that to some extent in the dairy market observatory, which gives a good overview of prices at EU level and by EU member state.  It probably does not drill down to the extent we would like but it is better than what was there previously.  On the meat side, we have seen the development of price apps nationally and better dashboards at EU level.</p> <p>  In regard to the Senator's point on policing contracts, the point is that some member states do not have any minimal level of unfair trading practice legislation.  It would be a very big step for Irish suppliers going into those markets to try to enforce their contract rights under international contract law.  Having a directive in place which provides a common EU standard is better than the existing situation for such suppliers.</p></speech>

If a supplier had 30-day contracts, those could become 60-day contracts because under the directive if one sells something on the 1st of a month the buyer is not obliged to make payment until 30 days after the month of supply.  That could double the period of credit from one to two months if the product is supplied at the start of a month.</p></speech>

Payments must be made within the 30-day period.  Under our existing national legislation, there is provision for the 30-day rule but if a contract is in place that may be extended for up to 60 days.  The directive will considerably tighten that to a 30-day rule.  As Ms McPhillips stated, there is a slight exception to that in regard to regular deliveries, such as in the dairy sector, where one would have up to 20 deliveries in a given month.  In such cases, the price is agreed the following month, possibly at the beginning thereof, and then paid within, for example, 15 days of the following month.  That is the only current exception to that rule.  The directive considerably tightens up what is in place under our existing national rules.</p></speech>

Under the provision stipulating that a buyer must pay no later than 30 days after the month of supply and contrary to the current situation whereby one may supply on the 1st of a month and get paid within 30 days, a smart alec in a multinational may think there is a loophole and that the multinational is permitted under EU legislation not to pay a supplier for 60 days.</p></speech>

Will the proposal deal with that matter in the detail required?  For example, some multinationals are not currently required to outline their profit margins for the year.  There is also the issue which was dealt with previously of products being used as loss leaders.  We saw that a couple of Christmases ago when carrots were more or less given away to encourage customers to shop in certain supermarkets.  On a regular basis, we see milk being used as a loss leader.  One could go to four different multiples without finding the same price for the same litre of milk.  Are those issues being dealt with in detail?</p></speech>

As to wider initiatives by Commissioner Hogan in relation to the food supply chain, there is a definite move towards increased price transparency.  While a lot of that is at aggregate level, it gives us a great deal more information.  For example, it allows us to compare the position between one EU member state and another.  Initiatives like that are progressing and the possibility is that big data can be harvested using the Internet and the block chain.  Those are the possibilities we see in the years ahead to improve information along the supply chain.</p></speech>

If there were a situation where that arose, the complainant seller or supplier could go to the enforcement authority and bring that case.  If a complainant did not wish to bring that directly to the enforcement authority but was in a producer group, that producer group would be allowed to bring a complaint also to ensure there was some level of anonymity on the part of the complainant if there were concerns in that regard.</p></speech>

Television coverage and web streaming are also adversely affected.</p><p>We now move to No. 4 on our agenda today.  The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with stakeholders on the operation of the school transport scheme, including any provisions stipulating that the service provider is required to have measures in place to ensure that customers are provided with adequate customer service, including easy and timely access to information.  We also intend to discuss specific arrangements regarding the provision of this service to children and students with special needs.  We had the opportunity last year to have a discussion on this, at which the Minister was present and we were given an assurance that everything would be sorted for this year and we would not need to return to this topic.  Just as the students were returning to school, however, indeed when we had our own education committee summer school, the calls came in fast and furious about blips in the service.  Some of these, thankfully, have been resolved; some have still not been resolved almost a month later.  We want to give an opportunity to the witnesses here from both Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education and Skills to discuss some of these issues and then an opportunity to the members of the committee to question the witnesses.  We may be joined by other Members.  We have Deputy Breathnach here from Louth.</p><p>On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Stephen Kent, who is the acting CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Ms Miriam Flynn, the chief schools officer for Bus &Eacute;ireann, Mr. Richard Dolan, a principal officer from the Department of Education and Skills, and Ms Shirley Kearney, an assistant principal officer from the Department.  We know Bus &Eacute;ireann has the contract from the Department but that equally Bus &Eacute;ireann must have its own contracts.  I think about 90% of the work Bus &Eacute;ireann does is contracted out to subcontractors, so we appreciate the complexity of the work that is done.</p><p>The format of this part of the meeting is that I will invite the witnesses to make brief opening statements of about three minutes each, which will be followed by engagement with members of the committee.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by me as Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise them that any opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>I remind members of the same long-standing parliamentary practice.</p><p>Without further ado, I call on Mr. Stephen Kent from Bus &Eacute;ireann to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We are here at the invitation of the committee to address matters relating to the operation of the scheme and to provide an overview of the customer service and information specifically on the provision of our service to children with special needs.</p> <p>  I should say at the outset that we administer the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills and only in accordance with the scheme's rules and guidelines.  It is also subject to the policy and the instruction of the Department in all cases.  We do not exercise discretion in respect of the policy, and all applications are simply dealt with in accordance with the rules and guidelines.  It is also important to note that the operation of the scheme at present is for us highly complex and the scheme is administered only on a cost recovery basis.  That is how we do it.</p> <p>  The operation of a safe school transport service, provided in an efficient and effective manner, is the highest priority for Bus &Eacute;ireann in its management of the school transport scheme.  In respect of ensuring the highest standards of safety, we always work with all the relevant stakeholders, including the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, to ensure we improve the safety standards across all the national public service vehicle fleet.  We apply very strict compliance criteria to all the contractors who operate on our behalf throughout the scheme.</p> <p>  Over the past decade in particular, the scheme has expanded dramatically in terms of vehicle numbers as the amount of services provided under the scheme has increased from 1,700 contractor vehicles in 1998 to almost 4,500 vehicles today.  This year in the region of 300 new services were introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The vast majority of these are implemented to cater for children with special educational needs.  All the newly sanctioned services are opened to public tender.  We must do it that way.  In this respect, procurement of contractors can sometimes prove difficult in certain catchment areas, primarily as the economy recovers and alternative employment is made available.  This factor has impacted our ability to deliver a very small number of services on time this year.</p> <p>  We manage the scheme impartially and uniformly on behalf of the Department nationally and do not have unilateral discretion to make local decisions that may be inconsistent with national policy.  The eligibility criteria that must be satisfied by students who wish to avail of the service are set out under the guidelines of the scheme and implemented accordingly as required by the Department.  A key focus of the recent media attention has been pupils who were ineligible not being accommodated on a service.  The rules state that pupils who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time must be and are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  We have confirmed that there is no shortage of places for these eligible children who have completed the application process and paid on time.  Children who are not eligible for school transport but who completed the application process on time are considered for spare seats that may exist after the eligible children have been facilitated.  These seats have been referred to as concessionary seats.  Where the number of these applications for school transport exceeds the number of seats available, tickets are allocated using a random selection process.  Under the terms of the scheme, the availability of transport for children who are not eligible varies from year to year, but this can only be based on the capacity of the buses operating on all the various routes.  Capacity requirements are calculated according to the number of eligible children who qualify for the service.  This is not expanded for concessionaries as this is not within the scheme's remit.  We always prioritise the provision of places for eligible children, but sometimes there can be an excess of demand over supply for non-eligible places.  It is worth noting that 27,500 tickets of this kind have already been issued this year.</p> <p>  Regarding special needs requirements, the principle of this scheme is applied not only where children in wheelchairs are concerned but to the transport needs of children attending the wide range of special schools and classes we serve in conjunction with the Department.  We currently utilise over 2,500 vehicles every day to provide services for 12,700 children with special educational needs.  The vast majority of these vehicles provide services door to door.  This year has been different because we have received almost 2,800 new special educational needs, SEN, applications or requests for amendments to school services and this increase has certainly proved challenging in certain instances for the team at Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> There is a significant amount of work involved in many new special needs applications as the route must be newly established, tendered out, an award made and then an escort provided, in some cases by the school.  Our staff are hugely committed to ensuring that any sanctioned service is provided as quickly as possible, but at times it has been a challenge to organise the combined availability of a suitable vehicle, a suitable driver and an escort, who must also meet the vetting criteria, for a specific case in a specific location.  I assure the committee that we persist on this front and our dedicated staff always strive to ensure that the needs of every child sanctioned by the Department are met as soon as practicably possible.</p><p> This year we set up in conjunction with the Department a full programme of communications to try to improve our customer service provision.  This included a dedicated call centre to assist parents with queries.  An email was sent to all Deputies and Senators with information on the scheme addressing many of their frequently asked questions.  This also included mobile numbers for all our regional school transport managers and our chief schools officer.  We put in place a dedicated email, reps@buseireann.ie, monitored daily to ensure we get back to the public representatives.  This year we have set up four email reminders to all the applicants to remind them of the closing date for payments.  A fifth email was also sent to all eligible applicants who had not paid by the closing date.  In addition, we deployed social media channels and a website to provide additional reminders, trying to ensure we got all the applications in on time.</p><p> We have been operating this scheme and carrying the children of the State for over 50 years now.  We are passionately committed to providing the service and want to do so for many years to come.  We welcome the expansion of the special needs scheme in recent years but we must also continue to refine strategically our own resources, processes, procedures and technology to ensure we support the growing needs of the scheme in close liaison with the Department of Education and Skills.  I thank all the members for the opportunity to address the committee.  We are happy to deal with any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Dolan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018092500002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to address it on the subject of school transport.  The school transport scheme is an administrative scheme established in 1968, as the committee is aware.  It was created to facilitate access to primary and post-primary education for those children who, because of where they reside, might otherwise have difficulty in attending school regularly.  School transport is a significant national operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  During the 2017-18 school year more than 117,000 children, including more than 12,700 children with special educational needs, were transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  This involved over 4,500 vehicles covering over 100 million km.  Growth in the numbers of children with special educational needs seeking school transport is a notable development in recent years.  In 2017, the total cost of providing school transport amounted to almost &euro;190 million.  This includes direct transport services and grant payments.  It also includes funding schools for the employment of school transport escorts to accompany children with special educational needs whose care and safety needs require this support.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Department's scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from the nearest school.  The key eligibility criterion for the school transport scheme is attendance at the nearest school, subject also to meeting the requisite distance criteria.  Families of eligible children living in areas where it is uneconomic to provide a transport service are eligible for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.  A number of non-eligible children are also transported in those circumstances in which bus places are available after all eligible children are catered for.  This transport is provided in the interests of maximising the utilisation of the existing fleet and providing a service to families where the capacity exists to do so.  Since the number of spare places available is dependent on the number of eligible children requiring transport, there can be no guarantee from year to year of a place for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria.</p> <p>  Changes to the mainstream school transport scheme were announced in budget 2011.  These were based on the recommendations of a comprehensive value-for-money review of the scheme.  The changes announced included the cessation of the closed or central school rule at primary level, the cessation of the catchment boundary area system to determine eligibility at post-primary level and an increase from seven to ten in the minimum number of eligible children required to establish or retain a service.  Cognisant of the fact that an immediate application of the changes would result in withdrawal of service from a significant number of children, a number of ministerially approved policy measures were put in place to mitigate the effect on children for the duration of their school cycle.  The effect of these measures has been to facilitate significant numbers of ineligible children availing of school transport over recent years.  The provision of such transport comes at a cost as it means we have not restructured the fleet to cater more optimally for eligible children.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Department's school transport scheme for children with special educational needs is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  In general, such children are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school or unit that is or can be resourced to meet their special educational needs under the Department's criteria.  Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of special educational needs organisers.  Decisions on transport eligibility are based on the prevailing circumstances at the time of first enrolment.  The Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for children with special educational needs.  This is reflected in the standard of service provided and by Bus &Eacute;ireann's factoring the individual requirements of the child concerned into the planning of these services, which generally operate on a door-to-door basis.  Eligible children are exempt from school transport charges on this scheme.  A special transport grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided in certain situations, such as where Bus &Eacute;ireann is not in a position to provide a transport service; a child's age, behavioural difficulties or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impracticable; or an escort is considered necessary and the provision of such support is not feasible.</p> <p>  As indicated earlier, the scheme has grown significantly in recent years.  The number of children availing of the special educational needs scheme has increased by 3,512 from more than 9,000 in 2013-14 to almost 13,000 in 2017-18, and the overall cost of the scheme, including grants, payments to contractors and funding in respect of school transport escorts, has risen by over &euro;27 million from &euro;64 million to over &euro;91 million over the same period.</p> <p>  At a current cost of &euro;190 million, school transport represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money.  The scheme is under financial pressure from increasing demographics at primary and post-primary level and from the increase in the numbers of children with special educational needs being transported.  As reflected in the 2011 value-for-money review and consequent 2012 rule changes, current policy is to move to a more optimal structure of the transport fleet in order to deliver value for money while ensuring that demographic pressures among the growing cohort of eligible children are catered for.  The policy and the available Exchequer allocation do not support the provision of additional transport services for ineligible children.  At an operational level, the Department is currently engaged with Bus &Eacute;ireann in examining existing route provision to ensure that eligible children are as well served as possible in respect of their transport needs.  Similarly, the Department is engaged with Bus &Eacute;ireann in looking at how the entire process of ticketing and seat allocation can be streamlined such that parents and children know on a timely basis the availability of places on school transport.</p></speech>

I am certainly very interested in the answers to the questions.  I have some very specific ones, as do many of my colleagues here.  Are there exceptions in practice to the ten-pupil rule?  Is it fixed or are there exceptions here, there and everywhere?</p><p>Are some late applications accepted?  These questions may be for Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department because it seems that some are accepted.  Perhaps the delegates might confirm if that is the case.  </p><p> I wish the Minister was here because I have some serious criticisms which I would not like to direct at the officials.  They are really directed at the Minister, but, unfortunately, the officials have to answer them.  </p><p> There is language used with regard to children with special needs to the effect that the numbers are growing and that the cost is rising, which is a problem.  I find the use of such language disturbing.  It describes the scheme as being under financial pressure, yet nobody says the State pension scheme or the carers' allowance scheme is under financial pressure.  Why is this service deemed to be under financial pressure?</p><p> My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues will speak about the issues surrounding eligibility and catchment areas.  I want to ask the delegates about the transport service provided for children with special needs, about which many excuses are given.  Some of them are that it takes a long time to organise the tender documents, escorts and so on.  Is it also the case that a huge number of applications were not even sanctioned at the beginning of the school year?  I received an email from a constituent on 13 September stating she had just received notification that the provision of school transport had been approved.  This puts the school principal in a position where they have to seek to hire an escort and Garda clearance.  I tabled a parliamentary question about the number of applications for school transport that had not been dealt with for children with special needs.  At the start of the year there were 500 cases.  Will the delegates confirm if there were still applications in the system?</p><p> It has been put to me by parents who were told by Bus &Eacute;ireann staff that some individuals within Bus &Eacute;ireann who dealt with the provision of transport for children with special needs had been seconded for the Papal visit.  Will the delegates indicate if the answer is "Yes" or "No"?  If it is "No", I absolutely accept it, but more than one parent was told that they had, which is why they was such frustration.</p><p> I pay tribute to the Bus &Eacute;ireann staff with whom we deal in seeking answers to representations.  It seems they are few in number.  We receive emails at all hours of the day and night and it concerns me whether Bus &Eacute;ireann has the necessary resources to deal with queries and issue responses.  There is a particular individual from whom I receive emails even on a Sunday morning.  This is a tribute to her, but it is also an indictment of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department that there are not enough staff to deal with these issues.  Perhaps the officials might tell us how many staff in the Department deal with school transport issues.</p></speech>

As the delegates said, I appreciate that the delivery of the school transport service can be highly complex,, but it is also very frustrating for parents.  In his presentation Mr. Kent referred to the call line, but when I received telephone calls from parents in August, my office contacted the call centre and the average waiting time on hold on the line was 20 minutes.  Sometimes one was was left on hold for 30 or 35 minutes.  When we eventually got through, we were told by the operator that we needed to be put through to the central office, to which they had no direct line; rather, we had to hang up and they got back to us when they had got through to the central office.  I do not believe that is the way it should operate.  Two days later, having been called back, we managed to get a telephone number for head office.  We rang it 15 times over two days, but the number rang out every time without going to voicemail.  One can imagine the frustration experienced by a parent.  I am present as a representative, not as a parent with only days to go before his or her child goes to school.  Something needs to change before next year.</p> <p>  I shall give as examples two schools in my area to demonstrate the frustration felt by parents.  Mr. Richard Dolan has been exceptionally helpful in getting one of the issues deservedly over the line, for which I thank him.  Finally there was someone in the Department to whom we could talk.  One could not make it up.  One case turned into a two-year saga.  There was a Gaelscoil that had every right to a bus service.  Two years ago I met the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, and departmental officials to discuss the matter, but a different Gaelscoil in the area which had not applied for a bus service received one.  We started from square one again earlier this year and were told that the school would definitely receive a bus service.  Come August, however, there was no bus service.  We found out that Bus &Eacute;ireann had a bus, but it appeared that the school had been confused with the other Gaelscoil.  I had parents crying on the telephone to me because for two years the two Gaelscoileanna had been confused.  It was a strange scenario.  A parent who had been crying on the telephone had a next door neighbour who had said to her "Guess what?  We got a bus for we had not even asked.  It is amazing."  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.  The same mistake was made twice within two years.  Something needs to be done.</p> <p>  The second case involves the Ballinteer Educate Together school which is temporarily co-located with a second level school in Dundrum.  It moved last year to a different campus in Churchtown and meets the distance criteria and so on.  There is a need for greater communication between Departments when schools move as they await planning permission for a permanent home.  They should automatically receive a school bus service if they move to an area more than 4 km away.  The school applied, backed up with a spreadsheet listing some 100 physical applications and containing information on all of the applicants and the distances involved to support its claim.  The Department confirmed receipt of the application and confirmed that it had relayed it and the supporting spreadsheet to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The school then received notification that its application had been deemed to be unsuccessful.  The letter stated: "Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that a total of 19 children are eligible for school transport, but of the 19 eligible children, only eight have actually applied for school transport".  The school has still not been able to get to the bottom of the matter and  has no idea what happened.  Because of data protection regulations there is no way to find out who applied.  There is utter confusion.  </p> <p>  The school applied again for a bus service in the 2018-19 school year and encouraged parents to apply again through the online application service.  More than ten were told on the site that they had been deemed to be eligible to apply.  However, they all received rejection notices.  One parent appealed the decision and was awarded the remote travel grant.  Parents have reached the stage where they are so frustrated that they do not even feel like appealing the decisions made.  How can we have trust that Bus &Eacute;ireann will have the resources in place to deal properly with the allocation of school transport services for all?  More importantly, how can we justify having a system in place that seems to just chip away at everybody who engages with it, to the point where parents just give up and the Department does not have to deal with them anymore?  That has been the way in cases with which I have dealt in my constituency in the past few years.  </p> <p>  In the case of the Gaelscoil, had it not been for the persistence of five mothers who just would not give up, who were in tears on the telephone in describing their personal circumstances and indicating why they needed a service, they got their applications over the line.  In the case of the other school, however, the parents are beyond exhausted.  They have other circumstances with which to deal in having to move to a temporary location and do not know if there will ever be a permanent school building.  Given the mess that has been made in dealing with applications, how can the Department restore faith in the system?</p></speech>

In the areas of Gowran, Paulstown, Ballyhale, Thomastown and Inistioge there are about 30 children who currently have no way of getting to school.  Deputy Aylward will back me up on this.  I am really disappointed that the Minister is not here himself.</p><p> There is a major issue with the fact that the two Ministers with responsibility in this are are city based.  They have no idea what it is like to be from a rural area.  They have absolutely no sympathy with kids in rural communities trying to get to school and parents who have taken leave from work or are trying to get to their own jobs and get their kids to school.  The parents have done a huge amount of research and in a lot of cases there are spaces on the buses that are passing by these children in the morning.  It is not a case of needing an additional bus.  I understand Ballyhale does need an additional bus but there are between ten and 12 children affected in that area.  It is not a case of one or two kids, and even if it was, they would need to be accommodated.  There are huge numbers of children unable to get to school.  Parents cannot get answers.  The Minister did a disappearing act and nobody could get him - he went down to his constituency office.  I sent these details in to the Department and got onto the Minister directly and I still have not heard anything back.  I sent all the details, the names, addresses and PPS numbers of all the individual children and we are still waiting on information as to what exactly is going to happen.  It seems to be okay with the Department if these kids just drop out at fourth and fifth class because obviously nobody has any interest in providing transport for them.</p><p> It is so unacceptable it is hard to find the words for it.  If parents were not sending their children to school through some fault of their own, we would be down on them like a tonne of bricks.  However, when parents are saying they want to send their kids to school and that they want to try to go to work themselves, there is absolutely no support.  They cannot even get a human on the end of the phone line or responding to emails to answer any of their questions.  Are the witnesses aware of those situations?  I would be shocked if they were not.  What is being done for those kids and when will they have school transport?  Please do not say it cannot be done because we have just heard that the Department has provided 300 additional spaces this year.  Common sense has to prevail at some point.  Somebody has to say it is not acceptable for at least 30 children in a county not to have access to school transport.  It is just not acceptable.</p><p> The other issue I want to raise is the lady who had to go to the media with her story.  She had to spread her whole life and that of her family and her son over the airwaves to get any sort of support or help.  I met with her last week and she was saying that during the whole process there was no single contact person for her.  She was ringing up and telling her story again and again from the start, repeating all the information to a new person each time.  When the transport was sanctioned, the home support was taken away from the child yet the bus was not provided.  He went the best part of a year without any schooling.  Something needs to be done there.  While the bus might be sanctioned, the home school support should not be taken away until the bus is provided.  I want to know how come there was a miracle in that case and the very next morning they were able to provide a bus.  That seems like someone dropped the ball somewhere and the bus had been available long before the lady was told about it.  There is no way something happens at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday and by 9 a.m. on a Wednesday there is a bus, a bus escort and everything ready to go.  It is just unbelievable.  That child will have suffered from not being able to attend school.  There are all the effects it has on a child's mental health.  Is there any follow-up service with the Department for that child to get the additional supports he is going to need for having missed out on the social aspect of school and the knock-on effect of that?</p></speech>

I regret if somebody has not got through.  It is not for lack of trying and we will have to do better. That is all I can say, and we commit to trying to review it every year.  We looked at this last year.  We do not want to find ourselves on this side of the fence having to defend this position, that is the reality.  Last year we listened to a number of issues that arose to see if we could improve on it.  We tried to put in place a system that we thought could address a lot of the queries that were going to come in.  It is compressed into such a short time and we end up experiencing a huge volume.  In trying to predict what that volume would be, given the situation, we obviously did not clear the hurdle.</p> <p>  We took 35,000 calls into our centre and put in 15 extra people to be able to receive the calls.  Their job was to liaise within the individual functions, deal with the cases and ensure a response was issued.  That was happening and in addition to that we had our own call centre.  In the last few weeks coming up into August they were taking 1,200 calls a day.  We were trying to deal with it also in our central office, where we dealt with about 10,000 emails on individual cases.  I could give the committee all the statistics it wants but I know it would not provide the answer.  The reality is that it was hugely compressed into a two to three week period when we had to deal with that volume.  It was not for lack of resource; we just obviously believed that the resource we were putting in place might have been adequate.  In this instance, we have obviously fallen short.  We will just have to take that as a learning for next year and see if we can improve on it.  </p> <p>  On the close-off date for mainstream, we made huge efforts to get all of those applications in by 27 July.  That allows us a brief window to get our services and the routes set up and, if necessary, tendered.  It is a very brief window to try to deal with all the queries that come in.  They do not come in sequentially but all in different places with different schools.  We are still charged with a responsibility to the State and to the scheme to make sure that we are not doing it inefficiently so we are trying to load those buses and make sure there are sufficient people on every bus and we are utilising the vehicle and driver to the best of our ability.  There is always juggling in respect of trying to load up, maximise the capacity of eligible children on those buses and make sure we deploy them efficiently and then, where we can, find out what we have to deal with on a concessionary basis.</p> <p>  I can only say that I regret the Deputy had certain instances where she had to call 15 times.  That is certainly not what our provision is set up to do.  We thought we would be in a much better place in that regard and I ask the Deputy to bear in mind that we were, because we know how many are after being put on it.  At the moment we have 101,000 people deployed.  Out there travelling today are 115,000 children who were put on the buses by our staff and the people who were deployed to put in the customer service provision.  We are charged with trying to get up in the morning to try to make sure that no child is left by the side of the road and we were successful in that for 115,000, which is about 98% to 99% of what came at us.  Always, the game will be about trying to close that 1% and I think that is what we will strive to do better with next year.</p></speech>

If Bus &Eacute;ireann took on 15 extra people and it was 1,200 calls a day or an extra 35,000 calls, is there an official review stating the demand in August 2018 and that 100 extra people will be needed next year?  Who makes that call?  When will the decision be made?  I presume it is in the coming months.</p></speech>

We were significantly ahead of where we had been.  On certain days we were 30% up on last year.  We actually closed in as we were coming towards the end of August; we regarded ourselves as being in the best position we have ever been in in the delivery of the scheme.  That would not be just our view but the view of the Department as well.  We were getting ourselves in a good position.  In reality at the moment it is about discovering where we are.  We will have a day by day tracker.</p><p>Those metrics have been put in place for next year to see if we are tracking ahead of or behind that.  This is information that we did not have in place in previous years.  We were always scrambling around, trying to figure out what days, when it would arrive and when the peak two days would come.  We know what happens when we trigger four or five emails and what it will take.  One would hope that it would not take that many, but it does.  We may end up having to trigger six or seven emails through next year, take the learning away and then deploy it.  Will we need 15 or 20 next year?  That is possibly where we may have to gear ourselves up to.  We were doing well up to that particular point.  There will be a learning because the learning was built in this year, to try to do it and we were much better.  We will have to build on that for next year.</p></speech>

Members posed a number of questions and I will do my best to cover them all.  If I miss some, I ask the Chairman to remind me.  Deputy Byrne asked a few specific questions related to minimum numbers.  We do not establish a new service for ten or fewer users but because of ministerial decisions not to reduce the size of the fleet in recent years, there are some services around the country with fewer than ten children using them.  I am sure committee members are aware of the overall Special Educational Needs, SEN, process but I will summarise it now.  Applications come to the Department through the Special Education Needs Officer, SENO, and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  We have a role in approving or refusing the application.  Once approved, we pass the application through to Bus &Eacute;ireann which looks at current transport services in operation and determines the most effective method of transporting the child.  That can be done in a number of ways.  If there is an existing service with spare capacity that is suitable for the child, it will be used.  In some cases, however, Bus &Eacute;ireann will come back to us for approval to establish a new service at X cost.  At that point, Bus &Eacute;ireann must go through all of the regular procurement processes.  The SEN service is very much based around the child who is applying and the service may be individualised so the process can be different in some cases.  In response to the Deputy's other direct question, the number of staff within the Department working on school transport is ten.</p> <p>  Deputy Funchion asked about the supports available to a child within a school.  To be honest, I am not aware of the individual circumstances.  The Department has a range of supports available to children within schools but I would not know about the specific supports available to any individual child within the system.  I am sure that supports within the school will be made available to the child.</p> <p>  The number of children who are still not on transport services relates to the concessionary issue.  All children who are eligible for school transport are either on services or are in receipt of the remote area grant.  The children who are not on services are concessionary passengers.  They are ineligible-----</p></speech>

In terms of the children who are not eligible, the challenge for us is that we cannot incur additional costs on a scheme for people who are not eligible for that scheme.  Concessionary passengers are in a different position but if the children to whom the Deputy refers are eligible, we will look into that and get back to her as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The level of queries around the school transport system indicates that there is something radically wrong.  It appears that there is insufficient information on the Department's website and that parents are not sure if their child has a place on a service.  While I accept that steps were taken after the difficulties last year, there is obviously still something wrong with communication, given the number of queries submitted again this year.</p></speech>

That is something we can always improve.  There is a challenge with any scheme involving 117,000 children.  I am not quite sure how many families that translates into but the entire communication effort is compressed into a very tight timeframe.  We have to try to run as effective and efficient a service as possible but that means that we have to ramp up our communications to a very high level for a very short period of time.  We then have to let it calm down again.  We cannot have a huge call centre on site all year round when we are only really dealing with a large volume of queries for four to five weeks of the year.

There were 100 applications submitted but no one knows what happened to them.  The follow on is that for 2018-19, people applied online and they were all deemed to be eligible but every single one of them received a rejection notice.  The parents do not know what is going on.  They believe theirs is a hopeless cause but I do not think they should give up because something went wrong with the process.  How can more than ten people apply online and be deemed eligible only to then receive a rejection notice?</p></speech>

It is very hard to give a definitive number because we have received 270 applications since 1 September.  In total, it is about 470 but we can supply more detailed statistics if required.  The figure effectively changes on a daily basis.  There was a time when we tried to have a cut-off point for the special needs scheme around 1 May to enable us to ensure that children had transport on 1 September but we are very conscious of the pressures that families are under and will now accept a special needs application at any time of the year and will try to get the child onto a service as soon as possible.</p></speech>

This issue must be viewed from the perspective of the Department in terms of how the scheme is drawn up and administered and also from the perspective of Bus &Eacute;ireann which is responsible for actually transporting children to school.  I will start with the Department.  In my view, the scheme as it is currently designed is simply not working.  That is not a criticism of Mr. Dolan and indeed, it is unfortunate that the Minister is not here today.  The main problems seem to have arisen after 2011.  The changes that were introduced at that time seem to have caused a lot of the problems that we are discussing today and which we also discussed last year and in 2016.  A review was promised two years ago.  What is the status of that review?  Why has its implementation been delayed?</p><p>I would go as far as to say that the design of the school transport scheme is anti-rural Ireland.  From my experience of dealing with this issue in recent years, it is anti rural Ireland.  There does not seem to be an understanding of what living in rural Ireland is all about.</p><p> I am dealing with a small school, Scoil Mhuire, Latton, County Monaghan, which is the only school in the parish.  There is one GAA club and one school and life is centred on the parish.  In some cases, even though they are all going to the one school in the parish, because of the current school transport rules, some pupils are not eligible because there might be a school in a neighbouring parish with which they have no association but which is closer to where they live.  That does not make sense.  As a starting point, any child from a rural parish should be accommodated in the school in the parish.  It is unfortunate that the witnesses are in the firing line for decisions that were not taken by them.</p><p> I look forward to the witnesses' response on the status of the review.  We need to start again because the scheme is clearly not working.  We could have been here this time last year having the same conversation on school transport because the problems are the same but are now in different parishes.</p><p> I have a number of points on the implementation of the school transport scheme.  From my experience of dealing with the staff on this issue, they seem to be completely overwhelmed by the process.  I know there is a very tight timeframe.  The staff have my sympathy because they seem to be stressed out ,as my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne, outlined earlier.  Emails are sent out late on Saturday night or on Sunday.  Deputy Catherine Martin referred to ringing Bus &Eacute;ireann and getting no response.  It reminds me of a girlfriend I used to have many years ago, whom I used to keep ringing and leaving messages, but she never returned my call.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.773" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018092500002#K00300"><p>I was beginning to think in recent times that she had taken up employment with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  On a more serious note, there is a problem which needs to be addressed.  I acknowledge that Mr. Kent is taking this on board.  If we were looking at  this problem from a business perspective, this should not be happening.  If there were problems last year that are being repeated this year, that is not good enough.  It is not down to the staff working in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is down to the workload.</p> <p>  In regard to the problem in Scoil Mhuire in Latton, we met the inspector and she was very helpful, but her hands were tied in that the way the school transport scheme is designed seems to be very rigid.  Three buses carry students from different parts of the parish to the school.  What is very annoying and frustrating is that there is capacity available on all three buses, yet the buses pass by children who are waiting on the roadside.  On the first day back at school, a Bus &Eacute;ireann inspector refused children access to the bus and they were left standing on the side of the road.  These same children were accommodated last year.   They had paid their money and contacted Bus &Eacute;ireann and yet they were refused access.  Imagine the effect of that on a child who sees his or her pals on the bus but him or her left on the side of the road?  That is very insensitive.  It never should have got to that position.</p> <p>  There are serious problems with the scheme.  We need to be honest and admit that the scheme as designed is not working and we need to fix it.  That is why I will be looking forward to the response to the review.</p> <p>  On the question of the transport of children with special needs, surely it is desirable that all children, where possible and practical if they are going to a  mainstream school, should be accommodated on the bus.  Surely it is better for a child with special educational needs and his or her school friends to be on the same bus?  Will the witnesses share their opinion on that?  We raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, last year and he promised to look into it.  Unfortunately, we are now having the same conversation.  I attended a meeting where the parents from the school in Latton gave an outline of how they felt when their child was left on the side of the road.  It was heartbreaking to listen to them.  These people are trying to do their best, but with both parents working, they are dependent on school transport and they could do without the stress and trauma of their child not being accommodated on the bus.</p> <p>  We can discuss the issue of school transport until the cows come home.  The scheme is not working and we need to admit that to ourselves.  We need to design the scheme so that every single child in rural Ireland who wants to go to school is accommodated on school buses.  That is our starting point.  If we make that our starting point, we will not be back here next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.774" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1384" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018092500002#K00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I, too, am frustrated by the school transport scheme.  I know Ms Flynn is aware of the issues in the Caherconlish, Donoughmore, Ballyneety and Fedamore area, where there is 500 m of a difference between the distance from that area to the local school of John The Baptist community school in Hospital and the distance from that area to the GPO in Limerick, yet if one goes to the GPO in Limerick, one still has another 2 km to 3 km to get to some of the schools that are claimed to be nearer to where the students live.  I know that 20 students are without a bus in that area, ten of whom travelled on the bus last year under concessionary terms, but this year all 20 students have no place.  It is a big inconvenience.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher referred to rural versus urban services.  Most of these students would have come from small rural primary schools.</p> <p>  In Limerick city, there is a common application system for secondary education and it is very difficult to get the school of choice.  Admission is subject to meeting the criteria of the different categories, for example, brothers and sisters in a higher class.  Sometimes students end up with a place in the school that is their ninth choice.  The school transport scheme does not work when a common application system is applied.  Will the witnesses respond to this problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.775" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018092500002#K00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  The figure of 450 children with special needs waiting for school transport is shocking.  That speaks to a failure of the system.  I take on board the point that Mr. Dolan made that a number of applications came in after 1 September 2018.  Even so, we are nearly a month into the school year.  We have come across one case in County Tipperary of a child with autism who was used to getting the school bus, but because there is a new autistic unit set up in Birdhill, he does not have a place on the bus.  The child suffers the trauma of no longer having this routine.  When Bus &Eacute;ireann was asked what the issue was, their response was that the tender had not been sorted and there was a problem with the tender.  That should not be happening at this stage of the year.  The issues should have been dealt with.</p> <p>  I agree with my colleague, Senator Gallagher, that the system is clearly broken.  I would not want to allocate blame to any of the individuals who are appearing today.  I accept what the Chair said in terms of the Minister, but there are policy problems at the heart of this issue.  It is another aspect of this piecemeal education system that we have had since independence, which fails on so many levels when it comes to access and equality.</p> <p>  I wish to share one other brief point.  Senator  Byrne mentioned Caherconlish.  What is even more bizarre is the matter my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, raised about the accident involving a school bus in Caherconlish last year.</p><p>Thankfully, there were no fatalities.  However, one of the children on that bus has been denied a place on the bus this year.  She has been offered a place on another bus and asked to get on the other bus at the exact point where the accident took place.  One really could not make this up.  Let us think about the amount of trauma that these children suffered at the time.  The girl had to be encouraged to get back on the bus afterwards and now the system has asked her to not get that bus with her school friends, wait for a separate bus and access the bus at the point where the accident took place.  When the issue was raised with the authorities they said there was nothing they could do.  The line beyond common sense has been breached in this instance.  I appreciate that it is not fair, in one respect, to use this example but I must do so because it shows that the system is fundamentally broken.  It strikes me that the resources must not be right.  It strikes me that a unit in the Department comprising ten people is not enough but beyond that there is an issue of common sense.  I accept that the witnesses may not be aware of the inverse situations.  I ask them to take these away because there are real people waiting for real solutions and it is unacceptable for this situation to continue.</p><p> I will finish by asking a couple of broad questions.  We have spoken about a review of the school transport system.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Halligan, has committed to conduct a review of school transport in parts of Donegal.  Does the Department believe that the entire system and seat allocation needs to be reviewed in order to make the scheme more equitable?</p><p> Last year, the Minister of State addressed the issue of children with medical cards and said that the scheme needs to be examined.  Has the issue been examined yet?  He also mentioned the unacceptable journeys that people and children with special needs must undertake or the excess journey time.  I know that the matter is still an issue.  Has the Department conducted a review of excessive journey times for teenagers and children with special needs and produced additional guidelines?</p></speech>

I hope that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will turn up for the Topical Issue debate.</p> <p>  I believe that the scheme is broken, as other members have said.  The scheme cost &euro;190 million and there has been an increase of &euro;27 million.  Is this a demand-led scheme or not?  I would like clarification on that matter.  Did the introduction of transition year generate opportunities? </p> <p>  Finally, but not least, is the issue of demographics and special needs.  Like the Chair, I was a schoolteacher and I taught for 35 years.  The Chair has said that there is a communication problem and everybody seated around this table has said the same.  It must be possible to plan long in advance, particularly the transition from primary to secondary school in terms of where parents send their children, and it should not be a stop-go situation.  What degree of planning takes place?  We all know which children will need special needs assistance.  As a primary schoolteacher, I knew who needed special needs assistance, certainly years before the bus transport scheme would come onstream.  Is there a planning issue in terms of readjusting the dates?  I am sorry that like Deputy Thomas Byrne I cannot wait for the answers.  I came here to listen to what others had to say.  I hope that the Minister will get the necessary resources, particularly if they are required, because it is clear the sum of &euro;190 million is not sufficient to run the scheme.    </p></speech>

As Senator Gallagher has expressed, school transport is a greater problem for rural areas than urban areas because most towns and urban areas have two or three schools within walking distance for students.  School transport is a problem in rural Ireland and that is one of the reasons we are here.  The system and the way it is rolled out are not fit for purpose anymore.  I firmly believe that the scheme must be reviewed because the system is broken and I urge the Minister to wake up to this issue.  School transport has had ongoing problems since I returned to the D&aacute;il in 2015.  For the past three years at this time of year I have argued with him about school transport.  The situation has worsened every year.  The demographics have changed in country areas because of the good times enjoyed in the 2000s and people built more homes in these areas as a result.  The number of people who seek places on buses that travel via towns and villages have increased and we must take that fact on board.</p> <p>  Funding amounting to &euro;190 million is a lot of money.  Today, we have talked about the number of children who have concessionary tickets.  Prior to the 2016 election my party conducted research that revealed it would cost &euro;3.2 million to cover the cost of concessionary tickets.  This week my party conducted research that revealed it would cost &euro;4 million to cover all of the concessionary tickets, and tickets for all of the students who have been left out of the scheme.  A sum of &euro;4 million sounds like a lot of money but it is small when compared with the overall budget.  We need &euro;4 million to fix the problem.  I ask the Department officials to comment on the matter.  I ask them and the relevant Minister to consider providing &euro;4 million.  My party's research produced a figure of &euro;4 million.  We did not have the full information but we have been told that a sum of &euro;4 million will suffice, and includes the cost of concessionary tickets. </p> <p>  In modern society both parents must work.  In the past it was possible for one parent to go out to paid work while the other parent stayed at home to mind their children and  afford to keep a family car but those days are gone.  All parents must now go out to work in order to pay a mortgage and earn a living.  Unfortunately, children are left without anyone to put them on a bus and no bus to transport them.  This is a serious issue.  As my colleague, Deputy Kathleen Funchion, has said here, there are a lot of problems in Kilkenny.  In my parish alone there are 11 students without bus transport but the area has had school transport, when their parents and grandparents attended school, since 1969 until a change was made in 2011 and the students were categorised as concessionary.  People in the area received a bus ticket without an issue for a period that spanned three generations.  Unfortunately, people have been told that students must travel to a neighbouring parish.  Access is fierce important in country areas.  People in these areas are very parochial and will not travel to neighbouring parishes.  That situation has got to do with hurling, in our case, sport and religion.  One's parish defines where one comes from and what one stands for.  To tell people that they must travel to a neighbouring parish and attend a school that their parents or grandparents never went near is not on and will not work.  That is why I think the system is broken.  We need a new bus service rolled out in country areas and the sooner that happens the better.  My party following research believes that &euro;4 million will resolve the issue.  If the Minister is worth his salt he will approach the Cabinet table and demand &euro;4 million extra to sort out this problem.  The overall roll-out of the system should be considered over the next couple of years.</p> <p>  Like my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, I want to know whether the system is demand-led.  If so, then the Government is obliged to provide the service just like it does with social welfare.  If the school bus system is demand-led then every student should have their transport needs looked after, particularly in a good, open society and democracy like we have.  </p> <p>  I wish to outline statistics on appeals that I received following a D&aacute;il question.  Since 2015, 558 appeals have been submitted at a cost of almost &euro;60,000 and not one of them was upheld.  How come not one of the 558 appeals was upheld by the Department?  That sounds crazy to me.  There must be one or two appeals at least that could have been accepted.  To me, the appeals system is not fit for purpose and has not solved the problems.  </p> <p>  I apologise for speaking so fast.  I wish to mention the hoarding of seats.  A month ago parents of students in Kilkenny conducted a survey on one bus for a week and I shall not name the area.  The survey showed that one third of the seats on the bus were not availed of in the morning and evening.  In other words, parents had applied for tickets but their children did not avail of them so a third of the bus was left empty.</p><p>Buses are passing by 11 or 12 children who are left on the side of the road. but one third of the seats are empty.  That is ludicrous.  A bus should not be making a journey with one third of the seats empty because they have been allocated to children who are not using them.  Something must be done about this.</p></speech>

A total of 117,000 children are transported twice a day, at a cost of &euro;190 million, as has been said.  It is certainly working for these children.  Some of the issues raised by members about rural issues at a local level such as GAA clubs, religion and so on highlight the challenges in designing a national scheme with set criteria that apply in all local areas.  We certainly accept that designing such a scheme that will work in every parish in the country is a significant challenge.</p> <p>  Several members asked if the scheme was demand led.  Yes, it is.  Everybody who is eligible for school transport should either have a place on a school transport service or be in receipt of the remote area grant.  From that point of view, it is certainly demand led.</p> <p>  The issue of special needs children travelling on buses was raised.  Where possible, we encourage special needs children to travel on a mainstream school bus with their siblings.  In fact, the special needs scheme stipulates that one should only apply  if one cannot avail of mainstream school transport.  Therefore, we are in agreement on that point.</p> <p>  I think the review mentioned is the concessionary review which was published in the summer of 2016 by the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan.  It is on our website, but we can distribute it to members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.798" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Dolan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018092500002#M00600"><p>I acknowledge that it did not result in the rules of the scheme been changed.</p> <p>  On planning for special needs children and journey times, the special needs scheme is an individual service.  We are very conscious of this and that what works for one child may not work for the next.  On journey times and so on, if we become aware of excessive journey times, we work with the NCSE and its special needs adviser to ensure a service is within guidelines and suitable for the child.  If there is a specific case or detail about which the Deputy is concerned, he can come back to us and we will look into it.</p> <p>  On the appeals process, I acknowledge the point about the number of appeals not granted.  However, as part of the appeals process, we write to parents and ask if there is any new information between the point of application, which could have been some weeks previously and the point of the decision, particularly in the case of special needs children.  If parents do have new information, we take it on board and the appeals board may refer the case back to us on that basis.  We will consider it as a different application if new information has come in.  Although the appeals board may not allow the appeal, it is referred back to us because there is new information and we might want to make a different decision.  The appeals board plays a very valuable role in the area of school transport.</p> <p>  I think I have addressed most of the issues raised.  Mr. Kent or Ms Flynn may wish to contribute.  I apologise if I have missed anything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.799" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Miriam Flynn" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018092500002#M00700"><p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to address the matter.  Senator Maria Byrne referred to the bus crash in Caherconlish.  I attended the scene on the day of the accident and we are very grateful that no one was seriously injured.  In the aftermath of the incident, the Department of Education and Skills, Bus &Eacute;ireann staff on the ground and the principal of the school tried to provide whatever support and services were needed by the children.</p> <p>  With regard to concessionary pupils who have not been facilitated this year, a significant number of such pupils have been facilitated in travelling to school.  There is a large number of concessionary pupils overall.  It came down to the demand for places being greater than the number of places available.  As I stated, that is the issue at several of the locations throughout the country mentioned by Deputies and Senators.  From the perspective of Bus &Eacute;ireann, our obligation is to ensure we apply the rules of the scheme uniformly across the country.  That is the issue.  We made as many concessionary places as possible available.  Our staff on the ground try to make arrangements such that if one service is not available, they try to offer another or accommodate as many children as they can.  That is always the case.</p> <p>  On the hoarding of seats, safety is the number one priority in our school transport and road passenger operations.  We must ensure we only issue the number of seats corresponding to the capacity of a vehicle on any route.  A parent may decide that his or her child will only use the bus two days per week or in the morning but not in the evening.  However, from a safety and management perspective, we must ensure the capacity of the bus reflects the number of tickets issued.  Although I accept that parents may note five or six empty seats on a bus in the morning and the evening over a period of time, in managing the overall system and from a safety perspective we must ensure the number of tickets corresponds with the capacity of the bus.</p> <p>  Several members referred to the timeframe and volume of work involved in trying to process applications.  That issue was addressed by Mr. Kent and Mr. Dolan.  We provide school transport for 115,000 children.  The closing date for the receipt of applications and payment is 27 July.  There is a huge volume of work involved in getting pupils scheduled and services up and running by the time the new school year commences on 28 August.  The fact that our staff are trying to respond to as many queries as possible and answering emails on Saturdays and Sundays when they get some time to try to clear the backlog is indicative of the dedication of our team who are trying to provide these services.  In an effort to improve on overall communication from last year, we provided mobile numbers for our school transport managers and my direct contact details for all Deputies and Senators.  That was intended to open communication channels such that queries received by Oireachtas Members could be dealt with.  In general, it has worked well.  We have within a short period received more than 10,000 emails related to locations throughout the country.  We have 11 area offices that administer the school transport service.  It is a short timeframe and a sizeable and complex scheme.</p> <p>  Mr. Kent and Mr. Dolan referred to the special educational needs scheme.  We would love to say all of the approximately 2,900 applicants this year have transport.  More than 900 of the applications were received since 1 July, which highlights the fact that we continually accept applications.  We recognise the specialised nature of the scheme and do whatever we can to try to facilitate children on a 12 month basis in conjunction with the Department.  There is a time period involved.  We try to work through it as best we can, but there is a time lag involved related to the procurement of services and processes we are obliged to go through under EU legislation.  The processing of so many applications puts us under pressure, but we will continue to review the position with the Department ahead of next year to see if we can alleviate the concerns of parents.</p></speech>

Most of the emails that come to me relate to transport for special education rather than mainstream transport issues.  I was supporting a couple of mothers in connection with the former issue.  It was very difficult to understand who was responsible for Garda vetting.  I was told there was a gap of four months following the allocation of a place for a child in a special school and the child being allocated a space on a bus, but then the parents were told that because there were no escorts in place there would have to be a Garda vetting process.  The delay lasted months.  Whose responsibility is Garda vetting and why does it take so long?  I am aware there is a process involved but I am interested in hearing whether there is planning for the year ahead and the reason a child would have to miss four months of school because there is no escort.  What provisions are put in place to ensure that escorts are Garda vetted?</p> <p>  Another thing I do not understand relates to eligibility.  Some children will be eligible every year so why does the issue come up annually?  Why is there not a multi-annual system of admission for school transport rather than having a 12-month cycle?  The situation of children with special needs who are attending a special school is definitely not going to change and I do not understand why they are not given a three-year pass, for example, rather than dealing with the same applications over and over again and then the system could pick up on the more problematic issues that fall through the cracks.</p> <p>  My other concern relates to customer service.  Is it only in place for a certain part of the year?  Given that children with special needs must sometimes wait until January, for example, before they are given a place in a special school is a customer service process in place to deal with late applications?</p></speech>

Senator Gavan referred to the 450 children with special needs who are currently waiting.  How long are they waiting?  I accept it was said that some came in late, but if the system is used to year-round applications why are children waiting and what is the biggest barrier to them getting a place on a bus?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.803" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018092500002#N00400"><p>I have a few questions.  I am sorry that I had to pop out earlier.  I have been focusing on school transport since 2009 when the then Minister, Mary Coughlan, carried out a review of the school transport system.  The problems commenced thereafter.  I have seen families split - in that siblings are not taken on the same bus - and the splitting of communities.  The schools have not moved and the homes have not moved but the rule has been introduced that one must attend one's nearest school.  Traditionally, one half of the Ballycroy parish went to school in Belmullet and the other half went to Achill.  Suddenly, people were told they could not do that and siblings have been separated.</p><p>I have a question about repeat leaving certificate students.  It is not possible for them to make applications until after 15 August.  Could provision be made for them?  They should not be called eligible late applicants, particularly as it is not their fault that they must apply late.</p><p>What legislation is needed to bring some common sense to the situation?  We get replies from Bus &Eacute;ireann which indicate that there is nothing it can do about the situation because it is given direction by the Department of Education and Skills.  What legislation is needed to allow for flexibility in the system?  I refer, for example, to issues concerning the nearest school route or the other common problems.  It is the same across the country.  There is a commonality with many of the problems.  I do not want to come back before the committee time and again presenting the same problems and when we leave people are still left dealing with the problems.</p><p>Do the witnesses sincerely think that the school transport system is designed for working parents?  Why are working parents excluded from it in the main?  Their children are considered for concessionary places.  Working parents are not eligible for a medical card in many cases due to the threshold being so low.  We are saying to working parents that the school transport system is not for them unless they can pay.</p><p>I raised a matter in a Commencement debate last week on school transport.  There has been a refusal to put on a bigger bus on a route even though there are a number of concessionary tickets involved.  I hate categorising children in such a way.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, indicated:</p><blockquote>Routes cannot be altered under the scheme and nor will additional vehicles will be introduced.  Neither larger vehicles nor extra trips using existing vehicles will be provided to cater for children who are not eligible, as additional State costs would be incurred by covering the cost of providing school transport for children who are eligible for it.</blockquote> <p>It comes down to cost.  I cannot understand the approach when the company can provide a bigger bus.  Is it legislation that we need or a combination of legislation and resources that would allow children, in particular from working families, who would have to pay between &euro;300 and &euro;600 anyway, to be provided with a school transport service?  They are not asking for the service for free.  I know families that paid &euro;600 in June for their children to get on the bus, only to be told the week before they went back to school that a seat was not available on the bus.  Last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, promised that there would be a seat on the bus for everybody and he has not fulfilled his promise.  I am not sorry that he is not here because he had no answers whatsoever.  Perhaps the people who are dealing with the matter could help us to solve the problems so that we are not coming back time and time again with the same issues across the board.</p></speech>

To be fair to the witnesses who are present, they are implementing the existing policy and they do not put it in place.  That is a political decision for the Government of the day.  I appreciate that the witnesses will be precluded from commenting on policy.  However, we are open to the possibility of hearing about improvements that could be put in place.  Deputy Scanlon is next and I will then go back to the witnesses.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending.  I have many dealings with the staff in Sligo and they are very co-operative and good, particularly the bus inspector who has rung me at 8 o'clock at night or on a Saturday or Sunday.  I wish to acknowledge that fact.</p> <p>  I do not know whether the witnesses are familiar with the N17 road, especially between Tobercurry and Ballynacarrow.  No doubt Mr. Dolan has travelled it.  The road is a single-lane national primary road.  The yellow line along the road is tight up against the grass margin.  Seven children are collected at the Aurivo store and the bus must go 1.5 km past the store in order to turn and come back to collect the children.  The children in question live on the N17 road between the Aurivo store and the Woodside Inn where there is a very safe place for the bus to turn and to safely collect the children and bring them to school.  The problem is that the Woodside Inn is located 500 m inside another school catchment area.  Children's lives are more important than catchment areas.  The road is a death trap.</p><p>It is not safe for an adult to walk on, never mind for seven children.  It may not be seven every day, but certainly it is four or five.  They are walking on the grass verge of this national primary road, which is a single carriageway with the yellow line up against the grass margin.  They are walking on the grass along the ditch.  I note that there was a fatality on that road a number of years ago when a school child died.  For the sake of an extra 2 km each way and the safety of the children, the bus should go the distance.  It has to go 500 m into another school area to turn and because of that, it is reluctant to go that far.  This should be looked at seriously and the children should be picked up on the route.  It is a place the bus could turn more safely in fact and it would stay on the main road all the time.  I ask Bus &Eacute;ireann to look at that situation and revert to me.</p></speech>

My concern, which I raised during the summer months when a report was provided through freedom of information to RT&Eacute;, relates to issues with the roadworthiness of vehicles being used to transport public passengers.  The figures obtained by RT&Eacute; from the Department do not cover school transport exclusively.  They relate to all public transport.  Let us be clear about that.  However, there is an element of the figures which covers school transport.  In the correspondence between the Road Safety Authority and Bus &Eacute;ireann, the chairperson of the former targeted and pointed to concerns albeit she acknowledged that some progress was being made.  However, she said that progress was slow and that concerns remained as to the roadworthiness of certain vehicles being used to transport students.  At the time, I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Ross, who has responsibility for transport, albeit he does not always realise that.  I wrote to him about looking to Bus &Eacute;ireann to carry out a complete assessment of all buses, not only those within its own fleet but also those buses contracted to provide school transport.  If that were done, parents of children could be safe in the knowledge that every bus used has a valid, up-to-date roadworthiness certificate.  Can Mr. Kent confirm that every bus contracted by the State to carry school children has an up-to-date, valid roadworthiness certificate?  Can he also confirm whether in circumstances, for example, in which Robert Troy Coaches Ltd. applied for a contract to provide a service and I supplied a brand new bus for the purposes of obtaining the contract, there is anything to prevent me, having obtained the contract, from using another bus within my fleet which might not be of the same standard at a later stage?  Finally, how is it that there are buses out there that the Road Safety Authority has concerns about regarding their quality and roadworthiness?  It is so concerned that it has taken the time to write directly to the chairperson of Bus &Eacute;ireann about the issue?</p> <p>  I am not sure if the following point was raised earlier.  It is about circumstances where there is spare capacity on a bus servicing a town.  I am talking here about Mullingar and my home village of Ballinacarrigy where some children are attending post-leaving certificate courses in Mullingar Community College but cannot qualify for a discretionary bus pass even though there is ample space on the bus.  Is that something which could be looked at favourably?</p></speech>

We took a lot of the survey extremely seriously.  Actions we took straight away included writing to a number of transport spokespersons to advise them on a lot of the activities, safety regime and protocols we try to put in place and follow and which we also try to ensure apply to our contractors.  We also wrote to all of our individual contractors reminding them of all of the criteria and stipulations within the contract and raising any issues regarding what they have to do.  I will mention a couple of things that were done.  When we put contracts in place, there are strict criteria which have to be met.  We ensure the necessary insurance and certificates of vehicle roadworthiness are in place for every vehicle operating under the scheme.  We ensure that all of the paperwork complies absolutely with what the RSA requires and that there is a valid public licence certificate and evidence of tax clearance.  We try to ensure that everything is in place.  Every contractor is also asked to perform in the same way that Bus &Eacute;ireann operates in relation to its own vehicles.  In other words, we look for maintenance programmes with checking intervals of not greater than six weeks to ensure that those are in place for contractors' vehicles.  The critical point is that every contractor is responsible for the safety and maintenance of their own vehicles.  At any point in time, we are still relying on somebody, as with a car which has gone through its test.  It is tested at a point in time and it comes back after six weeks.</p> <p>  One has to have a culture and regime and the discipline to ensure one's vehicle is safe.  We try to put that in.  However, as a safeguard we undertake a number of independent checks.  We contract an agency to ensure that one in five of those vehicles which are contracted on our behalf are tested.  A quality assurance check is in place to ensure that everything in the contract on the condition and roadworthiness of the vehicle is addressed.  If it is not and a vehicle is found through a test not to comply with the contract, a check is requested immediately.  In fact, we go further and say that if the contractor does not do it, we are prepared to terminate the contract.  We take the safety regime extremely seriously.  In addition, we do a great deal with the drivers.  We ensure that there is a safe delivery of the service under the scheme.  As such, all contractors must have medical checks.</p> <p>  We liaise with the RSA directly on compliance and we have a very good relationship with the authority.  We have engaged with the RSA in the months since the survey to ensure mitigation and an action plan are in place that the authority is also happy with.  By and large, we continue to do that.  It is a combination of ensuring vehicles within our scheme are safe and roadworthy.  Our maintenance programmes adhere to that.  We ensure that protocols are followed for all contractors.  Since that letter, we have written individually to every contractor acting on our behalf to remind them of the safety issues in relation to the survey and of our expectation that they meet the standards.  If a contractor is ever stopped by an RSA inspector, there is an obligation to advise us of any risk of which we should be aware.  In relation to our own supervision, I note that people have referred to road inspectors.  Road inspectors board vehicles on our behalf and perform vehicle checks right throughout the country.  If they become aware of any issue, it is brought to our attention straight away.  We bring that up straight away in the context of the enforcement of the contract to ensure those vehicles are there.</p><p>We are trying to enforce the whole culture of safety awareness, safety enforcement and making sure that everything complies with the legislation in all respects.  That is what we try to do.</p></speech>

He said there are a number of Road Safety Authority, RSA, requirements which have to be met at the time contracts are issued.  Quite clearly, those requirements are not being met.  If they were, there would not be a number of buses that have failed and fallen into the category that they did when they were inspected by the RSA in the past 12 months.  I do not want to tar all private contractors with one sweeping brush but there are some that are failing to adhere to their obligations.  From what Mr. Kent is saying, the contractors need to provide all the necessary documentation at the outset to obtain the contract.  They cannot substitute an inferior bus at a later stage to maintain the contract.  What are the consequences for those who break those guidelines or regulations?</p></speech>

On the issue of eligibility, the Senator is right that it does not change from year to year.  The Department does not reassess eligibility in a given year, and certainly not on the special needs scheme, unless there is some substantive change.  The Department would not look at the child's eligibility once he or she has been assessed.  For instance, the child can change schools and things like that.  Mr. Kent and Ms Flynn can come in on this, but what happens from year to year is that the Department does not reassess eligibility but new children are constantly coming into the scheme.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is tasked with running the most effective network possible.  It will see if the new children can be put on current services.  If there is an influx of eligible children, services might have to be split and things like that.  That is why it changes from year to year.</p></speech>

It would use that database to try to contact families by sending out emails, as Mr. Kent referred to, advising families when payment is due and sending them reminders.  That is how it works, in general.  That is the communication process for existing pupils.  For example, on a post-primary scheme, children's eligibility is determined in their first year.  That would change if they moved house and had a new address or submitted different details.  They would then get reminders from Bus &Eacute;ireann about payment deadlines and any communication that would be sent to them.</p></speech>

The number of applications for that scheme has increased significantly in recent years and that is for a whole host of reasons.  The Department is trying to ramp up its response to meet that increased demand.  In recent years, applications have been coming in all the time.  The Department tries to have a cut-off, but it is sympathetic to these applications, so it will take them all year round.  There have been 270 applications since 1 September and that is a challenge that we need to meet to get those applicants on services as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned the splitting of families and different families.  The rules changed in September 2012 and that did result in all new applicants for school transport being assessed under a new set of criteria.  However, the Minister made a decision at the time that all children registered for transport should retain their eligibility and that is the reason certain families would have different eligibility.  This September is the first September that everybody at post-primary level now is on the new criteria and there will still be an element of that dual eligibility on the primary scheme for another two years or so.</p> <p>  In the case of repeat leaving certificate students, that is a challenge.  The Department works with Bus &Eacute;ireann to make every effort to get repeat leaving certificate students on a transport service.  If there is no place available, there would be significant extra cost for putting an individual on transport because we are effectively putting on a new service at whatever that costs per day.</p> <p>  We spoke earlier about the concessionary issue and eligibility.  Ms Flynn and Mr. Kent dealt with the safety issue, but the Department, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Road Safety Authority meet regularly to discuss road safety.  We are acutely aware that this is something that, while we think it is in a good place, needs to get better and we need to keep working with the RSA, whose input we welcome.</p></speech>

I appreciate the witnesses are not responsible for policy but are merely implementing it.  The people whom I have spoken to in Bus &Eacute;ireann have been very helpful in giving information but they are very much stuck with the rules.  Nonetheless, Mr. Kent and Ms Flynn are here and I have questions to put.</p><p>There is a lot of interest in this throughout the country.  That is reflective of the deep frustration, anger and exasperation of many parents from Donegal to Kerry, to Wexford, and everywhere in between.  My office has been inundated with calls, texts, and messages on Facebook, as has the office of every Deputy and Senator.  The same things come up repeatedly.  For example, in the case of a rural primary school that has 30 children living near it, of those 30, 28 are going to one secondary school but two are told that, because their Eircode has them living 0.3 km closer to another town, they are sent to that town and a school away from all their school friends, even though there is no bus on that route.  That is frustrating not just for the parents but for the children to have that separation forced on them and to have to go to what may be a perfectly good town but one with which they are unfamiliar.  I think of Kiltealy and Ballymurn in the Enniscorthy district, both of which form a triangle, as it were.  The school is at one end but there are people living at the bottom of the triangle who went to the primary school but now have to go in another direction for secondary school.</p><p>It is very worrying and distressing to hear that up to one third of buses have major or dangerous defects.  If the witnesses find that children have been travelling on a bus with a major or dangerous defect, aside from taking the bus off the contract, is that ever reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p><p>Why is there no <i>de minimis </i>rule applied in terms of distance if someone is 0.1 km, 0.2 km or 0.3 km outside the distance outlined?  It is a rule that is applied in regulations in many areas.  Why is it not applied here?</p><p>Where someone who has been going to a school on a concessionary ticket for two or three years suddenly has it taken off him or her, is that purely a policy decision?</p></speech>

It could be construed by some that I have a conflict of interest here because I am a school bus operator, as was my father before me since 1956.  I am proud to provide a service and to transport children safely to schools.  That is what every contractor I know in Kerry does.  I want the witnesses to confirm a few matters.  It was very hurtful to many contractors throughout the county of Kerry, and let every man talk for his own area, to hear that buses being used by private contractors were not up to the required standard.  Will the witnesses confirm that when a contract is issued or when a bus is checked during the year, it has to have an MOT certificate and that the bus is often checked by the Road Safety Authority, RSA?  Bus &Eacute;ireann can then call in the bus to be inspected by FTA Ireland, another outfit employed by Bus &Eacute;ireann to check its bus contractors' buses.  Contractors in Kerry have to go to Cahersiveen or Tralee to get their bus tested.  I want the witnesses to confirm that.</p> <p>  The public service vehicle, PSV, inspector will check a bus before it goes on the road, and the bus dare not travel until one has the PSV licence.  A bus operator also has to have a transport operator's licence.  It is the first thing the operator has to get.  Is it correct that the bus operator and the driver have to do CPC training for one day every year?  That is part of the regime.</p> <p>  Many contractors have an issue with Garda vetting.  It is proper and right that the bus driver has to be Garda vetted, but if, say, Deputy Eamon Scanlon's bus driver, who has been Garda vetted by him and is working for Bus &Eacute;ireann, changes buses for some reason or goes to drive Deputy Charlie McConalogue's bus for a few days, Deputy McConalogue will have to have him Garda vetted as well even though he has already been Garda vetted by Deputy Eamon Scanlon down the road.  That is a big problem because the Garda process takes time.  If Deputy McConalogue's bus driver is sick, he cannot use Deputy Scanlon's bus driver even though he is working for the same company.  That is ridiculous.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses confirm that there is such a thing as a 20 year rule?  Any bus belonging to a private bus operator has to cease operating for school transport once the vehicle is 20 years of age.  That is the position in Kerry.  I do not know whether it is the case in every other county but those are the rules Bus &Eacute;ireann operates in Kerry.  The witnesses can confirm or deny it but there is a rumour going around that Bus &Eacute;ireann is using buses that are older than 20 years.  The rumour is that is the case in different areas of Cork and perhaps parts of Kerry.</p> <p>  I cannot understand how the RSA could write to the Department and say there are buses that are not up to standard because all contractors' buses in Kerry have to comply with all these regulations.  I am sure that is the case throughout the country.  It is very unfair.  There are many good bus contractors who are providing a service but their contracts for the next five years have been cut to the bone.  They are operating fewer services now than in the past five years.  I do not know how they will continue.  Many of them will not because, as the witnesses know, fuel costs and many other costs are escalating every day.  In terms of the price the contractor is getting, I do not know where that will end up.  Their buses may be older and they would get newer buses if they were getting remunerated properly.  Notwithstanding all that, their buses are being tested.  They pass every hurdle in that regard, and I say that without fear or favour.</p> <p>  Many operators are very hurt by this RSA report because if there is a problem with a bus, the RSA demands that it must be sorted out.  With the state of the roads, however, a spring on a bus can break any day and one has to get it repaired.  The bus might leave whichever test centre it is in today, be it the MOT centre, the FTA test centre or the RSA test centre, and something can happen with the vehicle the next day.  Mirrors are being blown off buses travelling up and down country roads, at &euro;1,000 a pop to replace, and no one is doing anything about it.  We highlighted the problem to our so-called Minister.  If a load of hay is being carried down the road and it knocks a branch off a tree, it can easily fall on the bus or car following it.  The wrong message was sent out in the middle of last month about private bus contractors and their operations.  I am very interested to hear what the witnesses have to say about those issues.</p> <p>  Regarding concessionary tickets, every Deputy from every constituency knows there are people in poor financial circumstances and they are unable to pay the concessionary ticket until the last minute.  This year, many of them found that they no longer had a place on the bus.  That was very unfair.</p> <p>  My next question is for the Department.</p></speech>

The Department has gone back on the promise it made, when it closed an outlying school, that the children would be transported to the central school in that parish.  That is not happening in Scartaglen where the people were promised that they would be taken to the school in Cordal parish.  They now have to travel themselves.  It is very important for a person in a parish to retain their identity.  The Department will provide them with a service to Scartaglen school but that is not their parish.  It went back on the promise it made in that regard, and it has happened in every parish and county in Ireland.  That is very unfair because there are so many services being taken from parishes, including post offices, Garda stations and so on.  These people will have to pay someone or take their children to school themselves.  That is what happening.  The Department went back on its promise.  I am not blaming the witnesses personally but the Department.</p></speech>

It is important to raise an issue of which I know the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are aware.</p><p>These are issues affecting the Termon and Kilmacrennan area of Donegal.  Students attending secondary school in the Milford area are without school bus places.  The Minister met Oireachtas Members from County Donegal last week and I discussed this matter with him this morning, so I know the Department is working on the issue.  What is unique to this case, however, is that the vast majority of the 33 students affected are eligible for the scheme.  They are not concessionary students and are, therefore, entitled to school transport.  Some of the parents filled out the application form on the website but because they did not have the students' medical cards to hand at the time, they were unable to submit certain details.  Having reached the end of the online application process, they were informed by the website that they were registered.  They believed, therefore, that the process had been completed and their applications accepted.  As a result, approximately 25 students who are eligible for school transport do not have a seat on the school bus, which is obviously distressing to their parents.  There is capacity in the rules of the school transport scheme to provide for these students and ensure an additional bus is provided promptly to enable these students to travel to school this year on a school bus.</p><p> How promptly can the Department complete its deliberations on this matter and revert to the committee?  The Minister indicated that he hopes to meet Oireachtas Members again to update us on the Department's considerations of this matter.  I emphasise, however, that the case I highlighted is special because up to 25 of the students in question qualify as eligible rather than concessionary, meaning there is a case for providing an additional bus to cater for them in this school year.</p><p> Other members raised the issue of students affected by the nearest school rule.  Deputy Browne noted the lack of logic applied in some circumstances.  I have dealt with a number of cases involving students who were told that if they chose to attend the school attended by all of their neighbours, they would be regarded as concessionary students, which means having to pay a fee and only getting a seat if there is one to spare.  The reason given was that they lived closer to another school, even though the distance involved was less than 100 m.  In many cases, there is no school transport service available to the closer school because there is no tradition in the area of attending that school.  In such cases, the students have to make their own way to school or, as in one case this year in Drumfries in Donegal, travel several miles to join the nearest school bus route, despite another bus passing the top of their lane which they cannot board without paying the fee.  Similar circumstances have arisen in Newtowncunningham, Muff and Glenealy in Donegal and arises in Termon and Kilmacrennan every year.  Dealing with these cases would involve no additional cost as there may already be capacity on the buses in question.  The students are being told, however, that if they want to travel to the school that people in their area have always attended, they must pay a fee.  This is despite the fact that if they opted to go to the other school, they might not be close to the route of the school bus.  In addition, because they would also travel for free on the bus to the closest school, resolving the problem would not impose a net cost on the Department.  These students are missing out because of the lack of logic in the implementation of the rules.</p><p> This matter must be reviewed to bring a degree of common sense to the application of the rules in order that people living in these areas will not face the same problem in each school year.</p></speech>

I live in rural County Leitrim where the issues are very similar to those that have been raised.  Almost every year we have a crisis in some parish or another where children are considered concessionary and cannot get a seat on the bus or families who have sent three of their children to a particular school find there are no seats on the school bus for younger children.  These changes arose from a review of the school transport service in 2009 or 2012.  There has to be an acceptance that, politically, these changes have failed.  Someone needs to recognise this and get to grips with the issue.  The Government is abdicating its responsibility to provide the service that people in rural areas need.</p> <p>  A point was raised about people who are working and do not qualify for a medical card.  People often ask why others are not in employment if there are jobs available.  It does not make sense for a working family in rural Ireland to take up a low-paid job as they will not get anything out of it.  This issue needs to be dealt with and we need to find solutions to all of this.  The big solution is to review the scheme and sort it out.  In the meantime, however, and working within the parameters of the current rules, my experience is that not enough flexibility is given to the Bus &Eacute;ireann organiser on the ground who sorts out the routes.  I often deal with the organiser in my local area and a number of others in other areas and they are prepared to come up with solutions.  When they find a problem with a school bus route they say they would change things around somewhat but they have to get permission first from up the line.  Nine times out of ten they will be shut down and told that they cannot change anything.  Some of these problems would be solved if more flexibility were given.  It would not provide an overall solution but it would certainly go some way towards it.  I stress that this needs to happen as quickly as possible.  </p> <p>  We need to enable people to live in rural areas.  The nearest school bus rule has kicked all of this out.  There needs to be some flexibility on this issue because without it, we will have a serious problem.  To give an example from County Leitrim of the concessionary problem, there is a bus that runs from Greagh Crossroads to Cloone village.  There are six vacant seats on the bus and if it were to take a detour of 4 km, the seats would be filled with children eligible for concessionary school transport.  It does not do that, however, because somebody calculated that such a move would cost a certain amount more per year.  If the fact that these concessionary students would pay for their seats were considered, it would not have cost anything.  For some reason, however, somebody in high office shut down the local organiser on the ground who would have seen the common sense of doing this.  A level of common sense has to applied here and the people employed should be trusted.  It is my experience, and the experience of most elected representatives, that if people are trusted to do their do their jobs, they will do so very adequately and cater very well for the communities they live in.  This needs to happen as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Much of what I have to say has already been said.  At the beginning of September, I was inundated with calls from constituents right across from Bandon to Bantry, from people in Kilcrohane trying to get to school in Schull and from people in Coomhola trying to get into Bantry.  It is terrible when parents who have two children on a bus are told their third child will not to be taken.  That is unacceptable.  While there is a concessionary ticket, people who have to pay for tickets for two or three children are finding it difficult to find that kind of money.  I may be confused in my dates, but I believe the deadline falls on 25 April.  Parents with two or three children might have to pay up to &euro;1,000.  This is extremely difficult for parents and it may be May or June before they can pull together the children's allowance or whatever else to be able to pay for this.  Unfortunately, children are then told they have no place on the bus.</p> <p>  The whole school transport system has to be reviewed.  From what I can gather, some of the bus operators have been asked to provide bigger buses for the same money.  These bus operators are already stretched to the limit, given the expense of running a bus, carrying out repairs and so forth.  In rural communities damage can be done to buses that costs a lot of money to repair.  The whole school transport service must be reviewed.  Many of the agreements made back when certain schools were closed years ago are now being thrown in the bin. </p> <p>  The closest school rule is a very serious issue.</p><p>I would like to think the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann would work with us to find solutions.  We are picking up the pieces in our constituencies over issues for which they have far more answers than we have.  We are pleading with local people on the ground who are being controlled above.  Unfortunately, many of the people who make representations to us are not being catered for.  They are now paying for taxis to get their children to school.  This is incredibly difficult for parents and I pity them.  They are not a priority but they should be.  It would be interesting to hear what the witnesses have to say on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.840" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018092500002#S00200"><p>I will make some points related to national issues and, if members will forgive me, others relating to my constituency of Kildare South.  We have had a robust debate and I certainly agree with the vast majority of what my colleagues have said.  It is certainly the case that these issues are impacting right across the country.  Mr. Kent said he could not exercise discretion in relation to the policy and I understand that.  He said all applications had to be dealt with in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Department.  I know he has to be circumspect in his answers but does he believe it would be better if Bus &Eacute;ireann was in charge of the scheme in its entirety?  It might be more streamlined and it might give us the opportunity to set up a system that operated better.</p> <p>  M. Kent also mentioned cost recovery.  Does this put Bus &Eacute;ireann under financial pressure to administer the scheme?  It obviously has an impact.  He said ten people administered the scheme and that there are times when there is a bubble.  If that is the case, why not stagger applications?  We could do this for some older children or when we are 100% sure which school a child will attend the following September.  Instead of 27 April being a cut-off point, there should be system that can start before Easter.</p> <p>  There are 450 people with special educational needs on a waiting list for the provision of transport.  It was said that eligibility was determined following consultation with special educational needs organisers but this seems to be a cumbersome approach.  Does the Department have any plans to review eligibility or to make the process more efficient?  In one case, a young man I know called Conor, from Rathangan, was in a unit within a mainstream primary school not in his own town, because none was available there.  Bus &Eacute;ireann provided transport to this young man for eight years and everything worked like a dream but when he had to leave the primary school there was a very hard-fought battle to get him a place.  Unfortunately, there was none in a mainstream school so he has gone to another special school in the area.  Three weeks later, even though Bus &Eacute;ireann knew he was in a wheelchair, no transport has been provided for him.  His mother has to put all other responsibilities aside and take a 50 km round trip to ensure Conor has the opportunity to attend education.  It seems ridiculous that he availed of Bus &Eacute;ireann for eight years but the company was not told he needed wheelchair access.  I have sent several emails about this but I will send them directly to the Department to make sure it is dealt with.  This sort of thing causes a lot of frustration for people.</p> <p>  The same issues present this year as presented last year.  I accept some communications provisions were put in place.  I have found the system for Deputies and Senators useful and people have come back to me about my queries in most cases.  There are some cases, one of which is Conor's, on which nobody has come back but generally we have been able to resolve issues.</p> <p>  Parents are not getting responses and Deputy Catherine Martin outlined some of the issues there have been with phone calls.  I have also heard that, when parents are contacted by email or phone, they do not get responses.  These parents pay a lot of money for their children to avail of the transport scheme and a number of them have complained about it.  I believe the cost is quite high, in addition to all the other extra costs involved in going to school.  If they are accepted but then cannot get into the system and are left without a place, there is a problem.  Deputy Troy covered the issues around safety checks.</p> <p>  There are issues in my local areas of Suncroft and Nurney.  In Suncroft two children, who have to travel 9 km to their secondary school, had a place last year but have been told there is no place for them this year.  A father of three daughters in Nurney contacted me.  Two of his daughters were in the secondary school in Kildare last year and had places and a third is starting this year but they have been told there are no places for them.  It is a one-car family.  The dad is, thankfully, working but he needs the car to take his daughters to school.  How are children expected to go to a school 9 km away without transport?  It is good to encourage young people to walk and cycle to school when it is safe to do so but 9 km is quite a distance and it is on busy roads.  A councillor in Kildare has spoken of a system where students have a walking bus, though they do not live too far away.  She is looking further into this.  It is like a cardboard cut-out of a bus but it is actually a safe way for children in urban areas to go to school.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on that.</p> <p>  There are issues around changing bus routes and bus drivers and there is a particular issue on a route into the Gaelscoil.  The bus driver had a very good relationship with everybody but he was changed to a route 20 miles away for no apparent reason.  It is difficult for small children, especially junior and senior infants, to get used to a new driver and, in this instance, the new driver was not given a route map and did not arrive on the first and second days.  The inspector had to come out and the old bus driver had to come back to show the route to the new driver.  Things like this happen but they should not happen and there should be a dummy run a week before the school starts.  Going back to school can be stressful and we should not leave children behind just because there is a new driver.  It is important that all drivers have a good level of fluency and communication skills.  I understand that has not always been the case.  If there is a good reason for a bus route to change, we and the parents should be told.  It is a problem when routes are changed for no apparent reason.</p> <p>  I am aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Halligan, has committed to a review of transport in parts of Donegal.  I wonder if it would be useful in other parts of the country as well.  He spoke to the Seanad in 2017 and was very surprised that children with special needs could be on buses for long periods.  Many of us know of children with complex needs who are on buses for up to two hours.  The Minister said he had not been aware of that and that it was not acceptable.  Has this matter been reviewed?</p><p> Those are the comments I wish to make.  I appreciate that we might have an opportunity to take up individual cases with the witnesses afterwards.  I accept that the witnesses will not be able to respond to every individual case but if they could come back with regard to any of them, we would be delighted to hear from them.  I will hand back to the witnesses for the final round of answers and comments.</p></speech>

I do not even have to be circumspect.  We could not do it without the backing of the Department of Education and Skills.  It is so heavily subsidised that it could not be run as a commercial concern.  The value we deliver to families and the tickets, even on a concessionary basis when it happens, could not be done commercially.  It is a cost recovery from our point of view.  This is how we must operate it and try to provide as many children with as many opportunities as we can under the rules of the scheme.  Accepting some of the points that have been made, there are clearly difficulties in terms of everybody at the margins of the scheme but it is what it is.  Everything we have stated has been about endeavouring to deliver the best we can and to be in compliance with the rules of the scheme.  Much of this requires a significant amount of communication between us and the Department, including in the context of individual needs.  This happens more than twice and three times daily.  We will always strive to make sure that we get back to every individual case.  Our commitment is that we are happy to do that.  We do not want to leave any stones unturned and will see whether we can give everybody, if not the answer they always want, an answer that is in keeping with the scheme.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the cost of buses and whether it should be put in.  Our piece in respect of that is that when we put routes out, and this may have been impacting in certain instances where a driver is reallocated, we may have retendered a route and sometimes another contractor has won that particular route.  Due to the fact that we do everything under EU procurement laws, the prices are essentially set by the market and we try to put it in once all the compliance criteria are met.  We could not administer the scheme without having so many good contractors throughout Ireland that deliver the scheme on our behalf and do an excellent job every day.  It was disheartening to read the RSA findings.  We wrote to the contractors and we know so many contractors are doing a good job and are in compliance with the rules.  We have to continue reminding ourselves as part of the process that compliance happens and checks happen regularly.  We probably cannot say it often enough.  That is the truth.  We have tried to enter into that in the spirit that has come out of the report, take it as being salutary for everybody and say that there is always a way in which we will have to continuously improve and deliver on that.  Apart from that-----</p></speech>

My understanding is that it would march it off to do a full investigation and it does not go any further than that until things are put in order if something was found to be wrong.  It is the same with lorries, even new lorries.  Is that not correct?  How is the RSA allowed to make a statement like this and hurt so many contractors?  I cannot understand it.  Am I correct in stating that the minute something is found to be wrong by the RSA, the bus or lorry goes no further but is directed to the depot or into-----</p></speech>

It is very difficult for us to comment on that because the RSA has powers under legislation to do whatever it deems important.  We are really operating the contract and are trying to make sure all of us under contract, including Bus &Eacute;ireann, are in compliance with the legislation.  That is probably all I can say on that matter.</p></speech>

We take the point that there are other schemes with flexibility around the distance rule but if it is not 3.2, it is 3.21 or 3.23.  There will always be somebody on the edge of the distance rule so for everybody we make happy, there will always be another cohort of people just on the border.</p> <p>  Regarding some of the concessionary non-eligible children who lose places from year to year, places available on any route for non-eligible children are based on the number of eligible pupils so if more eligible pupils come along in a given year, there are fewer places for those who are not eligible.  That would be one reason people might lose places.  We dealt with the rural issue and parishes earlier.  We accept that this is an issue in local areas.  It just highlights the challenges of designing a national scheme that fits every local area.  Deputy McConalogue mentioned a specific case at which we will certainly look</p> <p>..  If ten eligible children are not found, in other words, if we do not have enough to a route put in place, those children are eligible for a remote area grant so there is some assistance for them.</p> <p>  The closed school rule was mentioned.  This rule is not part of the current scheme.  It was part of the 2012 rules.  The value-for-money review dealt with that in some detail.  It was on foot of a recommendation from the review that the closed school rule ceased to operate.  I know the Chairman had a number of issues as well and mentioned some specific issues we can certainly examine.</p> <p>  We are aware of issues around the special needs scheme in particular.  It is something we hear from other people as well where a driver or even the colour of a vehicle changes and it can have an impact on the children in the scheme.  Like Bus &Eacute;ireann, we are bound by EU procurement rules and that is why a driver or vehicle might change.  That is not to say that we cannot continue to work with families and schools to make sure they are at least aware of the change and why it might happen.  We work closely with the NCSE on the special education scheme so if a child is too long on a service or two hours on a service, we would certainly look at that on a case-by-case basis.  In effect, everything we do in the special education needs scheme is on a case-by-case basis.  We look at all those applications specifically because they come through the Department, are assessed by somebody within the Department and are passed on to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We will closely with the NCSE on those.</p></speech>

There has been significant engagement in terms of non-members and I really appreciate their attendance because it is a very important issue.  We talk about the importance of education, the importance of education in our communities and the need to provide free education but as we all know, education is costly in terms of children going back to school, uniforms, books, etc.  Transport is an added cost but it is a cost that parents bear because they want to see their children get the best opportunities as close as possible to their own homes.  There are still families that do not have cars and those where both parents and there is no car available.  In that context, the witnesses can appreciate the stress and distress this causes within such families.</p><p>I thank the delegates.

This year, the report is on the topic of the future of jobs and how technology affects not just them, but also businesses.  Since this topic has been of high interest to the members of this committee and generally in Ireland and the rest of the EU, we believed it to be a good opportunity for us to share some initial views.  In the materials provided, committee members have an overview of the report.  It will be published at the World Bank-International Monetary Fund annual meeting in approximately three weeks' time.  We are meeting today ahead of the publication of the report, so I will share several of its main findings.</p> <p>  The World Bank works not just in Europe, but in 190 or so client countries around the world, making this a truly global report.  Our comparative strength is being able to use a lot of economic analyses from around the world to prove and disprove some of the statements around the future of work.  Much of the popular economics on this topic over the past decade has made two points.  First, new technology - robots, as it were - will rapidly displace workers and, as a result, many economies are heading towards mass unemployment or at least cyclical waves of large unemployment.  Second and associated with that, as a result of robots replacing workers in what are often well-paying jobs, inequality in many countries is rising.</p> <p>  Taking these claims seriously, we applied the data to them and discovered that, at least until now, neither has been correct.  While there are industries, both basic ones like transport and some services and a number of high-skilled sectors like accounting and legal services, where robots - more generally automation - displace workers, technology also creates many more jobs in traditional sectors as well as many new sectors.  As a result, the world gains approximately 30 million net new jobs every year.  Many of these go to emerging markets and - I will speak on this in a moment - countries with high levels of human capital, for example, Ireland.  There is a high correlation between technology and the possibility of creating jobs and how high the average level of human capital in a country is.</p><p> We also looked at the second claim, namely, that due to this disruptive nature of technology, inequality is rising around the world.  We document that at least as of now that is also not the case.  Income inequality during the past ten to 15 years has been falling, not rising.  There are several countries where that is not the case, South Africa being a well-described case.  On average, however, income inequality has been reduced during the past decade.</p><p> In the report we ask what this means.  We found there are two trends that deserve EU attention.  The first trend is that while jobs, on average, are not disappearing due to robots as much as feared, the transitions between jobs are getting longer and the average time workers spend on any given job has been drastically reduced.  We have numbers for many of the European Union countries.  In the past dozen years, data from 2004 until now suggest that the average tenure of workers in any given job has halved from about 14 years on average to about eight years.  Workers stay much less time in any given job.  There is much more movement.  The time workers have between different jobs is increasing quite significantly.  More time is spent either finding jobs or spending time in part-time jobs and more flexible labour arrangements.</p><p> Why is this interesting for the members of this committee?  It is interesting because it may suggest a different way to think about social protection.  While our traditional model, especially in Europe, is one where social protection meaning social insurance and pensions are linked to wages in full-time employment, we may need to rethink that set-up with a view to the many workers who have transitions lasting more than a year, sometimes two or three years, during which time they have part-time and more flexible employment.  Our report suggests the way to think about these changes to social protection.</p><p> What is new about this latest wave of technology is not so much on the worker's side but on the employer's or the firm's side.  We document that new technology in many sectors, not only in retail or traditional sectors but in the banking and financial institutions sector, allows a company in a matter of five to seven years to come to a market with new technology and completely take it over.  That is a different type of industrial organisation and we have many examples of that in the report.  For example, a traditional company such as the Swedish company IKEA took 75 years to become a global force, but now a number of its competitors have taken five to seven years and have become much larger globally.  That implies a different industrial organisation but also a different way to think about taxation, tax policy in particular, and competition policy, including in countries like ours.  The report is available online and the members will be able to read in detail many of the examples to which I have referred.</p><p> I will finish on a personal note.  I was a colleague of the members, so to speak, for a number of years.  At the beginning of the eurozone crisis I became the finance Minister of Bulgaria.  At that time Bulgaria has just adopted what we call the Irish taxation model and our corporate income tax rate decreased dramatically to adopt a flat tax system, a 10% corporate income tax rate and a 10% personal income tax rate, which we have managed to keep to date.  When I entered the government and was a member of ECOFIN, I met some of the members' colleagues, former finance Ministers of Ireland, many times and I had core debates with a number of the other members of ECOFIN on the benefits of this type of taxation model.  As I recall, this was a difficult period for Ireland and a particularly difficult period for their colleagues to explain why the Irish economy was resilient and would persevere in a matter of a few years.  I am very glad to be back here and to see that the Irish economy has persevered and I am sure its income tax system may have improved in some ways but it has persevered with the judgment of time.  I will finish on that note.  I  thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>

I find this exchange very interesting from the perspective that it demonstrates how ill-prepared we are for the future and for the jobs of the future.  To start with education, are we changing curricula fast enough to meet the new jobs of the future and, if we are not, why are we not?  Are there some countries which are changing theirs fast enough from which we could learn?  Dr. Djankov might respond to that question on education.  What are the subjects we need to be doing across the board?</p></speech>

In some senses it goes to the core of this issue in that when people think of technology, typically it is presented, at least in much economic writings and in many business writings, in the frame of machines versus workers.  We found in our report that in a  number of economies - there are not many, the Senator is correct about that - as they upgrade human capital, basically their education systems, and I will speak about the ways they do that, they manage to benefit tremendously from new technology and bring businesses, which previously were not in these economies, both from richer countries and from emerging economies.  Much of this is happening in east Asia.  East Asia includes not only China, but Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Korea.  These are economies we document in the report that are pulling in extra business.</p> <p>  How are they doing this?  It is exactly with respect to what the Senator mentioned.  Their education systems seem to be much more nimble than ours, by which I mean European ones, in terms of reflecting the need for new skills.  What are these new skills?  We have written extensively about this in the World Development Report.  As I mentioned, transitions between enclosed jobs in enclosed sectors are becoming much faster than they were in past.  What does this imply for educational systems?  It implies that what is called the vertical system, where a person decides at the age of 15 to be, for example, an engineer or an economist, like myself, and pursues an engineering or economics degree by taking the right courses in high school and then in university, is not especially responsive to technology because technology is developing quite fast.  Many of the skills we thought were required for sophisticated jobs like, say, high-level engineering and not just for menial jobs will be, in some sense, obsolete by the time children graduate from college.</p> <p>  What can be done about that and what can be done specifically in Ireland?  We observe that many of the countries that are becoming more globally competitive do not even wait until high school to prepare their children for the future of work.  Preschool, in particular, is the area where much investment in human capital is being made.  One answer is that rather than looking at tertiary education, particularly university education and adult learning after that, as the way to prepare for the future, we and US policymakers should look maturely at this area and acknowledge that children are starting to learn technology at a very young age.</p><p>If the Senator has children or even grandchildren, I am sure she will attest to the fact that they understand technology better than she does herself.  Many four year olds have a better understanding of how to use technology than we do because their minds are wired that way.  We have looked at the latest evidence to try to determine the best years in which to learn technology.  Up until now, we thought it was during high school or college, but now we know that the best time is between three and six, which means that even primary school is too late.  We need to think about addressing this in the preschool years.  This is a major focus of the World Bank.  Going forward, we want to work with governments to design programmes for children aged under six or seven.</p><p> On the curricula specifically, we have found that vertical curricula, where one studies only one subject like engineering, do not work.  Curricula need to be much more flexible and multidisciplinary.  Furthermore, the so-called soft skills, including the social and emotional skills that are essential to teamwork, are very important, particularly in circumstances where team members can be located in several different countries.  There is a need for people to use technology to work independently as well as in virtual teams, but the current curricula in Europe do not prepare students for this.  As a result, we have very good technical experts who cannot work at the pace of either American or Asian companies, so to speak.  This is why out of the top 100 platform companies, the most high-tech global companies, only nine are European.  What does this mean?  In summary, we need to see much more focus on the early years, before primary school.  We also need to see more of a focus at high school and university level on multidisciplinary curricula and not just on how we do things, that is, on cognitive knowledge but also on how we use that knowledge in team environments.</p></speech>

I could never understand the focus in our education system on cramming in as much information as possible, only to vomit it back up in examinations.  That has never made sense to me and it definitely makes no sense in the context of this report.  We need to be facilitating a love of learning in our young people and an ability to engage in complex problem solving rather than focusing on rote learning.  We must wake up in that regard.</p> <p>  We must look at the finances of the world or closer to home, at the ECB and at our national Government.  A so-called rainy day fund is being set up here in Ireland.  While there is some merit in that, would it not be better to invest that money in human capital, especially in the context of lifelong learning and early stage education or to address issues like homelessness?  Given that there are thousands of children living in hotels and more than 10,000 people homeless in this country, putting money aside in a rainy day fund instead of investing it in those children and in all of our children does not make sense, even in purely economic terms.</p></speech>

Let us take the example of east Asia, which is a fiscally conservative region.  Many countries in that region, including Malaysia, Singapore and Korea, have the equivalent of a rainy day fund that cannot be used except in the case of natural disasters or education.  These countries make an exception for education because they know that every euro spent today on education will yield multiples tomorrow.  The figures are in our latest report.  I am an economist and a former finance Minister, so I believe in numbers and economic rates of return.  We have calculated that, in a best-case scenario, the rate of return on investment in physical infrastructure like roads, ports, bridges and so on will be 1:6.  By the time the project is fully utilised, we will have gained &euro;6 for every &euro;1 invested.  In the case of primary education, the rate of return on investment is 1:40, and it is even higher for preschool.  A number of studies by the World Bank demonstrate that the rate of return on investing in education for seven to 11 year olds is 1:40.  If we invests &euro;1 now, we will get &euro;40 back in ten years.  The rates of return on education are huge.  The rate of return on education overall, including secondary and tertiary education is between 1:15 and 1:20, which is three times higher than the returns on physical capital.  This is why a number of countries make two exceptions for their rainy day funds, namely, for natural disasters and for education.</p> <p>  Another area which I referred to briefly earlier but which is dealt with in great detail in our report is social inclusion.  To have educated children one must have healthy children.  Being healthy involves not having emotional troubles, being well fed, sleeping well and so on.  In that context, we must look after families as well, and this is an area that is being worsened by technology.  While income inequality is not rising, on average, as I have mentioned, a significant proportion of the population is not captured by the standard social protection system.  People who work part time or who have flexible work arrangements do not have adequate resources to take care of their children properly.  This is an issue in Europe, even though many European countries have relatively expensive social protection systems.  These systems are not ready for the future.</p></speech>

If we take the example of the promissory notes here, we must basically burn &euro;14.5 billion, but another approach is needed.  That money could be invested in our children, in human capital and in social inclusion which would yield a far greater return in the longer term than reconciling numbers on a balance sheet.</p></speech>

It does not yet apply to Europe but perhaps we should have discussions with the European Union and national governments around that.  The bond aims to serve exactly the purpose outlined by the Senator.  Research suggests that most governments and most politicians, if facing a choice between investing in human or physical capital or if their budgets are constrained, will generally give preference to physical capital.  This report and a number of other recent publications and projects of the World Bank make the point that we must change the financial returns.  In some countries, particularly in Africa and south Asia, we have come up with social inclusion bonds whereby the World Bank steps in, together with some member governments, and organises a financial scheme that makes it interesting for the financial markets to take up these bonds.  We have had three or four such experiences this year which have all been very positive.  This can apply to emerging markets as well as to advanced economies like Ireland.</p></speech>

Many regions in this country do not have access to very basic telecommunications infrastructure like broadband.  How important is investment in that area?</p></speech>

It does not cost much.  Technology has developed enough that broadband is available at inexpensive rates.  Without broadband, it is difficult to prepare kids for the future of work and to prepare businesses to operate in the global economy.  In that regard, Europe in general has much to learn from other regions.<br/><br/>I recently visited Vietnam, which is still much poorer than many European countries.  In our report, however, it stands out as being on a par with most of Europe in terms of human capital at high school and primary levels.  We were initially surprised by this.  How could Vietnam with a <i>per capita</i>income of approximately one tenth that found in European countries afford this?  Its system is truly something to consider, though.  Every school has broadband.  Where there is no standard electricity supply, solar panels are used to bring electricity to schools and, through that, broadband.  Every week, every teacher in the country receives a set of scripted lessons.  This is done for reasons of access but also equality.  Every teacher has to use the script as the minimum at least, so every student in the country is taught it.  The approximately 200,000 primary schools and 70,000 secondary schools receive the lesson each week.  As a result, students' scores in Vietnam are similar regardless of whether they are in poor villages or rich cities like Hanoi.  To give the committee an idea of how this system works, the bottom 10% of high school students in Vietnam score better than the top 10% in the US.  Europe in general and Ireland in particular could learn quite a bit from Vietnam's experience.<br/><br/>Broadband can be used for more than just education.  It can also be used in the field of health, as is done in a number of countries to the great benefit of, in particular, populations that live in rural and less well-off areas.</p></speech>

The report is vast and covers the future of work in the World Bank's 190 client countries.  Everywhere is different.</p> <p>  We have a limited amount of time at this meeting.  Dr. Djankov is somewhat familiar with Ireland and our circumstances, having been a member of ECOFIN.  I presume he met former Deputy Brian Lenihan and other Ministers while he himself was a Minister.  Ireland has many technology companies and everyone has electricity, but not everyone has broadband.  That is unlike Vietnam where everyone manages to have broadband despite not having an electricity supply beyond solar power.  There is a digital divide between generations, areas and regions in our country and across the world.  What would Dr. Djankov advise our Government to do in terms of education, investment in ICT infrastructure and so on?  I would regard broadband as being like electricity in that it is essential for everyone to have quality broadband that allows them to do whatever they want to do on the Internet, for example, banking, communicating, emailing, working remotely, desktop publishing etc.  What should Ireland's priority be?</p></speech>

In our report, which covers nearly 200 countries, we document on average the human capital of every country.  Ireland is doing quite well.  It is among the top three countries in Europe, for example.  The report is embargoed, by the way, which is why I am not giving the exact numbers.  It is among the top countries in the world.</p> <p>  Human capital refers to what students must know about the current economy.  As mentioned during the line of inquiry followed by the Senator's colleague, though, that may be different in the technological economy, given that the recent wave of technological innovation, mostly through the Internet, allows companies to become truly global leaders within five or seven years in terms of sales, technology and so on.  As such, every country in Europe needs a different structure so that it can reach new markets.  That is where broadband helps.  A company in a small country can reach many other markets.  Broadband technology is essential for that.  It is not a luxury.  Rather, it is needed if a company is to be competitive globally.</p> <p>  Our report adds to this the issue of social inclusion from a very early age.  The best investment that policymakers can make is in the first three to six years of a child's life.  That is when technology comes most naturally, as do most languages.  The brain is developing.  A nice figure we have - it is nice for someone who is young, but not so nice for someone who is old - suggests that the brain operates best between three and six years of age and that, by 29 years of age, the cost of learning more is greater than the benefit.  Someone should learn more-----</p></speech>

By 29 years of age, one has learned as much as one can.  After that, it is a more labour-intensive exercise.</p> <p>  Until recently, we thought of broadband as only being something that helped people to stay informed, use their bank accounts, do business, buy products over the Internet and so on.  Now there is the concept of it being where we can access learning, especially for young kids.  There is no other learning and there are no textbooks or technology courses, so to speak, for three to six year olds.  The only way to learn is through broadband, accessing the latest thinking and presenting it to kids in a user-friendly way.  Broadband is not just about current business.  It is also about a country's future business and competitiveness.  "Future" in this context does not mean 50 years from now, but five or ten years from now.  These kids are the next generation of people who will determine whether the Irish or European economy will be able to compete with the United States and east Asia.</p> <p>  I have mentioned the statistic that only nine of the 100 largest platform companies, which are companies that have been created in the past ten to 15 years and have global reach, are European.  The rest are US and Chinese companies.  Given that Europe is larger than the United States in terms of market power and larger than China in terms of purchasing power, why is that number so small?  Much of it has to do with embracing technology, but not just for sales.  I mentioned the example of Vietnam.  Technology must be embraced to extend countries' reach to their populations through health and education so that they can prepare early.</p></speech>

He stated that education in technology for three to six year olds in particular was essential.  In respect of planning for increased levels of automation, while my background is as an accountant, I am not sure that we could automate politicians yet.  It is to be hoped it will not happen for a while.  What about driverless trucks, cars, buses, trains and so on?  A year or so ago, I saw a presentation on the future of work.  According to it, the single largest job category in approximately 30 of the 50 states of the US - truck driver - would not exist in the same form in 30 years.  Maybe that was speculation or maybe it will happen.  It is likely that there will be some automation.  What retraining and re-education should our Government be planning?  We will have many people trained in certain skills that will no longer be required and who will not be as capable of learning as three to six year olds.</p><p>They could be in the 30s, 40s or 50s.  What suggestions or advice would Dr. Djankov give our Government to reskill, upskill and keep our people in the workforce?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, this applies not only to menial jobs, which was the case in the past with previous industrial revolutions, such as the development of the steam engine, electricity or even the computer, when one started at the bottom.  We now have some very sophisticated jobs.  The Senator mentioned accounting and there are  legal services and surgical jobs where machines are too expensive to develop and use, but already we have a number of businesses or countries where robots work better than people and are cheaper.  It is a matter of time as to when this change will take place.</p> <p>  Coincidentally, there are two types of work, according to our analytical work where it was found to be nearly 100% the case that robots cannot yet replace people.  One is the job of politicians and that is because the logic of politics is often such that it is not routine, therefore, robots very often cannot figure out politics.  The other job is that of journalists, where one needs to operate with facts but also to put matters together.  At least according to our data, we are safe for now.  </p> <p>  What can one do to prepare not only the next generation, which is what we have discussed so far, but the generation that is already out of school, out of university and at work where sectors are being automated?  This is a much more difficult task.  While we have many positive things to say about the early years of learning, and the Work Bank has vast experience of this from its operations around the world, the returns from adult retraining are basically negative around the world.  There are a few successful programmes on which we comment but if we take the totality of both advanced economies and emerging markets and do a standard returns-to-investment analysis, it will show that for every dollar spent on adult retraining, we get less than a dollar back.  That may sound striking but it does not mean-----</p></speech>

That does not mean we should not try.  Chapter 4 of the report goes into detail on the reason there is such a negative return for such investment.  Some of it we can rapidly change.  Many adult retraining programmes - I am familiar with some of the European programmes as they are applied in my country of Bulgaria - involve bringing in adults and treating them like students, seated at a school desk and giving them courses spanning three, six or nine months.  They take classes as if they are students.  We spoke about young brains being able to learn technology much better but adult or more mature brains operate very differently.  This is the area of neuroscience.  In particular, on average, every 1.7 seconds an adult brain switches to some other gear.  In other words, for adults, their unit of attention is less than two seconds.  For children, it is more like 20 seconds.  We need to organise the course material or teaching methods for adults very differently from the way we organise them for children.  Adults need much shorter learning units, not 45 minutes but 20 minutes and the use of much more technology.  A number of programmes we use that have positive returns literally comprise 15 to 20 minute sessions over the course of an hour and a half or a two-hour training day and texts are sent to the participants during the latter part of the day asking if they remembered a matter and that is covered in just one sentence.  That model works much better.  Lithuania is one such country that uses European Union funds to retrain in that way.  With approximately one and a half hour courses a day over a two-month period, its rates of return are significantly higher than a ten-month course in Germany, provided for exactly the same purpose, for example, to retrain low-level engineering skilled workers.  We can improve adult retraining programmes simply by not treating adults as older students.  Beyond that, the analysis suggests that by the time one is 30 or 40 years old, one's ability to switch to a new sector is fairly limited and, therefore, one tends to switch to a neighbouring sector.  It is not possible, for example, for a truck driver to become a software engineer or a marketing agent.  We need to think step-wise how workers can move from one job, which is under threat of automation, to a closely-related job that has a longer-time horizon.  A few countries have succeeded in that but there are very few.  The Senator is right in that the evidence is not yet optimistic.</p></speech>

There are two elements to this point.   Forty per cent or thereabouts of our corporation tax comes from ten companies.  All of them are US based, or that is the impression we get, and they are nearly all in the technology sector with possibly a few in the pharmaceutical sector.  It is suggested, and the Revenue Commissioners have not confirmed this, that those companies are Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, PayPal, Google and some IT companies or pharma and medical device companies.  Many of those jobs did not exist 20 years ago and many of them will not exist in 20 years time.  For what jobs do we need to be preparing?  Dr. Djankov might address, if he is able to, the fact that we are over-reliant, and I do not use that word lightly, or certainly significantly dependent on them for corporation tax revenues.  For what should we be preparing in the longer term?  We have seen brand new companies appear in space of 15 years and if that can happen, some companies that are here now may not be here in 15 years time.  The loss of any one of those companies would be a big shock to our economy.  How do we need to plan for that and for the new jobs of the future?</p></speech>

We have some striking figures of a company such as Alibaba that did not exist nine years ago as an international company and now it is much larger than Walmart, which previously was the largest company in the world.  Alibaba is now twice as large as Walmart in a matter of nine years.  We document in other sectors also how in three to five years a company can rise and totally obliterate the competition globally.  If those companies are headquartered in Ireland, that is good news.  It creates other issues, as I mentioned, such as the competition policy issue and the way to tax those companies but potentially that can be good for the economy and the country.  The Senator is right to ask if corporate income tax is the way to raise revenue.  Corporate income tax is very footloose.  We document that in the report.  Companies choose where to base their headquarters, research and development facilities and marketing departments.  Much of this choice is not driven by human capital, although we would like it be, but by tax considerations such as the corporate income tax rate.  There are other ways to tax such as more consumption based taxes.  By that I do not only mean VAT but excise taxes, which is another way to think about it.  That becomes increasingly prevalent not by choice but by the nature of taxation.  We suggest in the ultimate chapter of our report, chapter 7, how countries have moved essentially from particular corporate income taxation to consumption based taxation.  This is the way of the future.  High corporate income taxes that were prevalent in the past will remain in the past.</p><p>In the last year, the United States has drastically reduced its corporate income taxation.  France is moving to much lower corporate income taxes from next year.  It is not the way to tax in the future.  At the same time, these companies have shareholders.  By and large we are arguing in this report that shareholders manage to get away globally without paying much tax, if any.  We picked particular companies among the ones the Senator mentioned.  Overall we look at Fortune 500 companies and come to the conclusion that their shareholders essentially do not pay taxes, partly because they are mostly located in the Bahamas and other such tax havens.  Globally, we need to do something about this.  We hope that with this report, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and our institutions will step in and try to be agents for this change.  If a US company does much of its operations in Ireland, it should be paying not just corporate income tax but also the equivalent of dividend taxes here.  That almost never happens now.  There is a great need for social policy and the tax policy that goes with it.  This is a very open area.  The European Union is trying to do some work but it is very early days.  The OECD has some work that is also in the very early stages.  Not so much the companies but their shareholders - sometimes they are one and the same and sometimes not quite - are essentially escaping taxation.</p><p> The Irish economy has a lot of such companies so Ireland has knowledge of them and their shareholders.  It can be one of the countries that create innovative taxation models.  We write about Korea and Brazil, interestingly, middle-income countries that are at the forefront of thinking on how to redesign taxation successfully.  They manage to collect a lot more taxes from these platform companies than European countries do.  </p><p> As a final word on what happens to these companies if a country like Ireland manages to tax them and their shareholders as well at the appropriate level, there we will rely on either regional - as in European Union - or wider co-operation on taxation so that these profits are not just parked in the Caribbean or other such areas.  That is a much longer fight.</p></speech>

At the moment, we are getting these because we are adding the value and having 8,000 or 10,000 people working in Apple, over 2,000 in Microsoft and many in Intel.  People are adding value and creating products.  We are a small, export economy.  That model would be very difficult for us.</p> <p>  I certainly share the concern that there are companies that are avoiding paying tax anywhere.  As far as most of us in this country are concerned, we are not looking for the taxes in respect of the Apple &euro;13 billion because we do not think we are entitled to them.  Somebody is probably entitled to them but we just do not think, if the phone was designed in California, made in China and sold in Singapore, that we should get the share.  If a product is designed, built and manufactured by staff in Ireland, we are entitled to the revenue in the same way, whether it is cola concentrate, pharmaceuticals, medical devices or technology; we have genuinely large companies here.  They are here for many reasons, including tax, but equally because we are an English-speaking country in the eurozone and so on.  </p> <p>  I would certainly have concerns about Mr. Djankov's idea that we would eliminate or reduce corporation taxes.  If we can manage to share a smaller percentage of a much bigger cake and still get the same money, fine, but I would have a very grave concern if we were going to replace corporation tax with consumption taxes on the Irish population.  To try to find &euro;8 billion would be an impossible task and not something we could ask people to do in any climate and particularly in the current one, where people in many situations are still recovering from the crash if they have even begun to recover.  </p> <p>  Mr. Djankov did not touch as much on the new jobs and how we need to be planning.  What should we be looking at in respect of training three to six year olds, upskilling and so on?  I never realised three to six year olds were so important to the future but there we go.  What particular sectors and areas of growth does he think are suitable for Ireland?</p></speech>

My statement was that this is the world trend.  It is not that I am recommending it, I am just saying it is the trend of what is happening.  The reason countries are relying more and more on consumption-based taxes and excise taxes is precisely that they are not able fully to capture the corporate income taxation.  My view and the view of our report is that we should not just look at corporate income taxation as taxing the corporations but we should also look at their shareholders.</p> <p>  There has been this premise in public finance, not just among politicians but also among economists, that while the company may be situated and producing in Ireland, the shareholders can receive their dividends wherever they are.  In other words, there is no link between shareholders and production.  In fact, there is a link, especially in this new wave of companies where the main shareholder is typically also the majority owner, for example Amazon, Google and so on.  It is not that there are 100 million owners with tiny shares; there are two or three owners that have 60% to 80% of the corporation.  Currently, these owners basically do not pay taxes here or anywhere in the world.  They park their money in small island economies, mostly in the Caribbean.  An idea of ours that is lately getting a lot of attention in academic research is that just as countries like Ireland tax the corporation, they should be entitled to tax a share of the money that goes to the shareholders themselves.  Basically, dividend taxes should also be paid here.  It is called "tax on location".  It does not matter where the shareholder is based; what matters is where the money is made, not just for the company but also for themselves.  We calculate that for the 500 largest corporations, if dividend tax was proportionately shared where the money is, in fact, made and not where the shareholder lives, the European Union as a whole annually would have about &euro;2.2 billion additional revenue, just from shareholdings.  That money is significant enough to then ease the burden on consumption taxes but currently we do not have it.  It is just parked somewhere.</p></speech>

Has Dr. Djankov done any estimate as to how much global taxation is potentially out there that is not collected?  If it was taxed even at a medium-sized rate of 15% or so globally - I am not talking about Ireland's entitlement to it - how much is out there?</p></speech>

For example in health services at the high-tech end - how to use new technology to make lives longer but also more comfortable - we estimate that over the next 15 years or so in Europe, the number of people involved in that sector will need to triple.  Some aspects of healthcare are low-tech, for example taking care of the elderly on a personal level, visiting their homes, preparing meals for them and so on, and some of it is very high-tech, such as dealing with people with particular disabilities, mental or otherwise, that are basically disabilities of old age.</p><p>This sector is currently severely under-provided in most of Europe and because of demographic trends it will be more severely under-provided throughout Europe.  Literally every country in Europe needs to think of retraining people in that field.  Also, there are business opportunities in this area.  Given that Ireland has quite many high technical industries in other sectors, such as pharmaceuticals and the Internet and technology companies, high-tech medical care and the whole vertical of preparing new treatments dealing with old age presents a huge business opportunity as well as a social opportunity for Ireland.</p><p> In another sector which is close to Senator Horkan's heart, he mentioned accounting.  As I mentioned technology in principle for accounting, the part which is routine is becoming a lot easier.  Of course, nothing is routine about European taxation and it becomes less and less routine over time.  That also allows the possibility of countries or economies to specialise in providing this type of service.  </p><p> Ireland has a strong tradition of law and justice and upholding commercial law and so on and this is an area in my mind in which Ireland can specialise.  This is a tremendously lucrative area, high in jobs and in an area in which Ireland has a comparative advantage it can build on.  Both sectors have low-tech and high-tech components.  This is not just confined to preparing the upper middle class of the future.  Many of these jobs are jobs where workers can develop their careers.</p><p> The topic of Brexit is also relevant.  There is more uncertainty around what is happening in England and with that uncertainty, especially around the city of London, many global investors are thinking of where these functions will locate.  Dublin, in particular and Ireland overall is the obvious place for this work.</p></speech>

Everybody agrees that investment in human capital is the way forward.  However, the Government has to measure its cloth and has to have a balance between infrastructure, whether it is roads, water, electricity, broadband and so on, and generate the capital before it makes these choices.  It is not as easy as saying we must invest in human capital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.899" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Simeon Djankov" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018092500002#K00700"><p>Indeed, and we are more nuanced in the report.  For different economies one requires different mixes between investments in physical infrastructure and human capital.  New technology, however, sometimes allows us to invest in different new ways in physical capital.  One of the countries that I visited recently was Senegal.  Much of Senegal has not been electrified.  There is no electricity in about 70% of the country.  By the way, Senegal is one of the richest countries in Africa so this is not among the most difficult cases.  They were thinking about physical infrastructure in the following way.  To have electricity, one needs to have the electricity poles and to have that one needs to have roads, so they decided to build roads first and then they will install the electricity poles and then they will bring the electricity to the hospitals and the schools and then they will think of broadband and so on.  I already mentioned the case of Vietnam, where electricity is generated from solar panels and Senegal is blessed with lots of solar energy so that one can at least temporarily short-circuit the process and bring electricity where it is needed in hospitals and schools and so on, and provide the broadband through it so that the next generation can start developing.  In the meantime, they still need the roads for commerce to develop, for people to be able to move.  It is just a question of how to use limited resources and what is the optimal mixture.  Until recently nearly 90% of the Cohesion Funds was used for infrastructure by the Bulgarian Government because Bulgaria needs a great deal of infrastructure.  The new thing we are bringing is to think of the mix, so to prepare the next generation, one does not need huge investment.  The order of magnitude of investment in primary education is 0.5% of GDP on average or 0.7% of GDP.  Infrastructure in the average country is 6% to 7% of GDP.  The mix can be done in such a way that one thinks of current business and commerce but also future business.  That was my point.</p></speech>

I am thinking of Korea, which in terms of income <i>per capita</i>is very similar to Ireland.  Admittedly it is a large economy, but when we have this type of discussion with the policy makers they have thought about how to prepare the next generation for the future of work and also how to work with the current generation of workers for the transition to new jobs, basically how to think of the new economy.<br/><br/>Many countries in east Asia, perhaps because of their centrally planned past and maybe present tend to take a longer view and consider whether it is okay to invest heavily in broadband, which has been discussed in Europe for many years and to consider whether it is a good thing to do or a priority.  At least from what I know in most European countries, broadband is still considered something that is not really so essential - it is good to have but it is not like roads or bridges.  Even in poorer east Asian countries, broadband is a right, so everybody needs to have access to it and governments are spending the money now because they realise that if they do not have broadband lots of people are excluded from business but also from preparing for the future.</p></speech>

That has made some of the global corporations uneasy.</p><p>The companies ask how a country knows how much money they are actually making from that country's market.  Therefore, the legislature in Korea came up with an innovative solution which basically gives two options.  One option is for a company like Google or Amazon to report every year to the Korean state how much money it made from the Korean market, which currently is not done as there is no such regulation at the global level.  Otherwise, if the company does not do that, from January 2017 Korea by law imposed a minimum, which is a percentage of what Korea, based on the analysis of the Korean finance ministry, thinks are the company's sales in Korea.  Therefore, from last year, all of the companies we discussed essentially pay the equivalent of a value added tax.  They complain but the money is quite significant.</p></speech>

About half of that goes directly to private companies of the type the Senator mentioned.  It has to have a development goal and that goal can be social, for example, schools, whether private or public, and health systems, and there is a lot of investment in basic infrastructure, as was mentioned.  We realise that countries must have the ability to carry on commerce, in particular traditional commerce, which requires ports, airports, bridges and so on, and especially across countries.  Our main goal is to develop the economies in order for people to live healthier, easier and more prosperous lives.  Of course, this has to happen through the growth of the economy, trade and services.  Every year we have some 3,000 projects, primarily in emerging markets.  At the same time, we often work with companies, including Irish and European companies, that have global or at least regional presence and, through this presence, use their technology and their human capital in the service of a large part of the world.  We are precisely in that development business.</p></speech>

William Fulbright an cl&aacute;r sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe sa bhliain 1946 agus tugadh go h&Eacute;irinn &eacute; sa bhliain 1957.  Is cl&aacute;r malart&uacute; cult&uacute;rtha agus oideachas&uacute;il at&aacute; i gceist leis seo agus buna&iacute;odh in &Eacute;irinn &eacute; mar chomhaont&uacute; idir rialtais na St&aacute;t Aontaithe agus an t&iacute;r seo.  &Oacute; 2006 ar aghaidh, t&aacute;imid ag seoladh suas go dt&iacute; naon&uacute;r chun an Ghaeilge a theagasc sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe agus b'shin ceann de na f&aacute;thanna a bhfuil m&eacute; libh anseo inniu.  Seolaimid FLTA n&oacute; foreign language teaching assistants ar fud na St&aacute;t Aontaithe ag teagasc na Gaeilge.  I mbliana t&aacute; FLTA againne ag m&uacute;ineadh na teanga in ollscoileanna &oacute; Montana go dt&iacute; Nua Eabhrac.  &Eacute;ir&iacute;onn go hiontach leis an gCoimisi&uacute;n Fulbright <i>pro rata </i>toisc go mb&iacute;onn deis againn suas go dt&iacute; naon&uacute;r a sheoladh ag m&uacute;ineadh na teanga thall.  Seolann Coimisi&uacute;n Fulbright na hIod&aacute;ile suas go dt&iacute; c&uacute;igear ag m&uacute;ineadh na hIod&aacute;ilise ar fud na St&aacute;t Aontaithe go bliant&uacute;il.<br/><br/>Rud eisceacht&uacute;il eile a dh&eacute;anann &aacute;r FLTAanna n&aacute; go dtaca&iacute;onn siad le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; Gaeilge ar an talamh.  Nuair a eagra&iacute;onn gr&uacute;pa deonach de chuid Conradh na Gaeilge n&oacute; Dhaltai na Gaeilge immersion weekend n&oacute; deireadh seachtaine tumoideachais ar an talamh in &aacute;it ar n&oacute;s Kansas n&oacute; cib&eacute; &aacute;it, d&eacute;anaimid iarracht FLTA a chur ann chun tac&uacute; leo chun an Ghaeilge a mh&uacute;ineadh ar an deireadh seachtaine sin.  Tugtar leis seo deis don FLTA &aacute;it sa bhreis sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe a fheice&aacute;il, agus dar nd&oacute;igh is &aacute;is agus an-ch&uacute;namh do na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; Gaeilge ar an talamh &eacute; sin.  T&aacute; cine&aacute;l ciorcail i gceist, mar cuid de na mic l&eacute;inn a bh&iacute;onn sna ranganna sna hollscoileanna ag na FLTAanna, d&eacute;anann siad freastal ar na deiridh seachtaine tumoideachais seo.  Faigheann siad agus bronntar Summer Gaeltacht Award orthu chun teacht chun na Gaeltachta&iacute; in &Eacute;irinn, agus roghna&iacute;onn siad cib&eacute; Gaeltacht gur mian leo chun barr feabhais a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  Chuile bhliain tagann suas go dt&iacute; seachtar chun na Gaeltachta in &Eacute;irinn tr&iacute;d an scol&aacute;ireacht seo.<br/><br/>Go dt&iacute; seo, chuile rud a rinne m&eacute; tr&aacute;cht air sna Summer Gaeltacht Awards, na FLTAanna agus na deiridh seachtaine tumoideachais, is le taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;n Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta a thugaimid faoi seo agus t&aacute;imid iontach bu&iacute;och den Roinn.  Murach iad, n&iacute; bheadh an cl&aacute;r FLTA chomh fairsing sin, agus gach seans nach mbeimis in ann na cl&aacute;ir eile a chur i bhfeidhm.  Dar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute;imid luaite sa phlean Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge tr&iacute;d an bPlean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta d&aacute; cuid.</p> <p>An&iacute;os ar na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; luaite agam, eagr&oacute;imid &oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute; chun an Ghaeilge a chur cinn ar shl&iacute; n&iacute;os ginear&aacute;lta.  Mar shampla, i mbliana, mar chuid de Bhliain na Gaeilge, d'eagra&iacute;omar &oacute;c&aacute;id i dTeach an Ardmh&eacute;ara faoi Bhliain na Gaeilge sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe.  I measc na gcainteoir&iacute; a bh&iacute; linn ar an o&iacute;che labhair Reece Smyth, Charg&eacute; d'Affaires Ambas&aacute;id na St&aacute;t Aontaithe in &Eacute;irinn, mar gheall ar a thaith&iacute; ag foghlaim na Gaeilge anseo in &Eacute;irinn mar Mheirice&aacute;nach.  I measc na gcainteoir&iacute; eile a bh&iacute; linn ar an o&iacute;che bh&iacute; an Dr. M&aacute;iread Nic Giolla Mhich&iacute;l agus an Dr. Teresa Lynn.  Thug an Dr. Nic Giolla Mhich&iacute;l faoi Fulbright TechImpact i Notre Dame.  Mar thoradh ar a cuid taighde le linn an scol&aacute;ireacht Fulbright sin, d'fhill s&iacute; ar an t&iacute;r seo agus t&aacute; s&iacute; tar &eacute;is an ch&eacute;ad ch&uacute;rsa Gaeilge ar l&iacute;ne, Irish 101, a sheoladh.  Rinne an Dr. Teresa Lynn a gradam Fulbright-Enterprise Ireland in Ollscoil Saint Louis i Missouri, &aacute;it ina dhearna s&iacute; taighde ar an nGaeilge maidir leis na me&aacute;in sh&oacute;isialta.  Mar seo, is l&eacute;ir nach stopann baint Fulbright leis an nGaeilge leis na gradaim Ghaeilge faoi leith.  Is f&eacute;idir dul ar ghn&aacute;thscol&aacute;ireacht Fulbright agus tabhairt faoi thaighde sa Ghaeilge.  Mar shampla, rinne m&eacute; f&eacute;in m&aacute;istreacht sa Ghaeilge in UCD.  Bh&iacute; duine ar scol&aacute;ireacht Fulbright i mo rang, Lisa Sladen, ag tabhairt faoi mh&aacute;istreacht sa Ghaeilge.  </p> <p> Rud eile a dh&eacute;anaimid le taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;n Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta n&aacute; go nd&aacute;ileann muid an maoini&uacute; a fhaighimid &oacute;n Roinn le suas le s&eacute; institi&uacute;id tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe chun an Ghaeilge a theagasc.  Iarraimid ar an gcoiste taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&uacute;inn ionas go f&eacute;idir linn tuilleadh maoinithe a chur ar f&aacute;il ionas go bhf&eacute;adfaimis cabhradh le tuilleadh &aacute;iteanna sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe an Ghaeilge a theagasc.  Molaimid go gcuirfimis strait&eacute;is le ch&eacute;ile ionas gur f&eacute;idir linn, mar th&uacute;sphointe, m&eacute;id &aacute;irithe beag airgid a thabhairt do na institi&uacute;id&iacute; nua seo chun cabhradh leo agus ionas go mbeadh tionchar n&iacute;os m&oacute; ag, agus go bhfaighimis n&iacute;os m&oacute; as, an chuid mhaoinithe a chuirfimis ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  </p> <p> Faoi l&aacute;thair m&uacute;intear an Ghaeilge i suas le 60 institi&uacute;id tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe agus Ceanada.  T&aacute; an-&eacute;ileamh ann.  Sampla eile den &eacute;ileamh at&aacute; ann maidir leis an nGaeilge sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe n&aacute; alumnus eile d&aacute;r gcuid, Ois&iacute;n &Oacute; Doinn.  Chuaigh s&eacute; go hollscoil i Minnesota mar Foreign Language Teaching Assistant, FLTA, ag teagasc na Gaeilge.  D'fhill s&eacute; ar an t&iacute;r seo agus ba dhuine de na daoine a d'aistrigh Duolingo &eacute;.  Mar sin, is l&eacute;ir go gcuireann &aacute;r alumni go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r leis an gcaidreamh leis na St&aacute;it Aontaithe agus le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  </p> <p> Tuigim go bhfuil mo chuid ama ag rith amach.  Mar sin, f&aacute;gfaidh m&eacute; an coiste le pointe amh&aacute;in.  D&eacute;anaimid an-chuid comhoibrithe le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; eile, mar shampla, ritheamar an Cult&uacute;r Club in &eacute;ineacht le Conradh na Gaeilge.  Leis an tionscnamh seo, d'&eacute;asca&iacute;omar ocht gceardlann sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe &oacute; Pittsburgh go Knoxville.  Th&oacute;gamar pobal sa cheardlanna seo.  Thaca&iacute;omar leis na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; eile sna St&aacute;it Aontaithe agus chuireamar &aacute;iseanna nua ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh chun an Gaeilge a theagasc.  Chomhoibr&iacute;omar le Conradh na Gaeilge agus na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; eile chun an feachtas Trasna na dTonnta a bhun&uacute;.  B'shin feachtas a bhuna&iacute;omar ar&uacute; anuraidh chun c&iacute;bear-Ghaeltacht a chruth&uacute; ar l&iacute;ne.  C&eacute; n&aacute;r buna&iacute;odh &eacute; go dt&iacute; ar&uacute; anuraidh, t&aacute; s&eacute; ar cheann de na haischlibeanna Gaeilge is m&oacute; &uacute;s&aacute;idte riamh ar Twitter.  Ghlac daoine &oacute; 80 t&iacute;r agus 27 st&aacute;it &eacute;ags&uacute;la de chuid na St&aacute;t Aontaithe p&aacute;irt ann.</p> <p> Chun cr&iacute;och a chur le mo chuid cainte, thar ceann an choimisi&uacute;in ba mhaith linn bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta.  Bh&iacute; dea-chaidreamh againn l&eacute;i i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  Is &iacute; a thacaigh agus a thug an maoini&uacute; d&uacute;inn agus don Chonradh i leith an Chult&uacute;r Club, in &eacute;ineacht leis an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Eachtracha agus Tr&aacute;d&aacute;la.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as ucht a bheith linn inniu agus le Eugene &Oacute; Cruadhla&iacute;och agus an Cathaoirleach, an Teachta Connolly, as ucht cuireadh a thabhairt d&uacute;inn bheith os comhair an choiste inniu.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; go hiontach &eacute; a fheice&aacute;il.  N&iacute;l a fhios ag 99% de mhuintir na t&iacute;re faoin obair sin ar chor ar bith.  N&iacute; bheadh an staitistic sin, go bhfuil 60 institi&uacute;id i dtuaisceart Mheirice&aacute; ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge &aacute; m&uacute;ineadh, ar eolas ag &eacute;inne.  T&aacute; s&eacute; de n&oacute;s sa t&iacute;r seo gan luach a thabhairt ar aon rud go dt&iacute; go dtugann daoine eile luach air.

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag iarraidh saghas ceangal a chruth&uacute; idir &eacute; f&eacute;in agus a athair.  Ba &eacute; an teanga an ceangal a bh&iacute; eatarthu ag an am sin.

Ms Melvin would have said that we have an allocation for nine FLTAs.  Without the support of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, we would not be able to support a programme as big as nine FLTAs.</p></speech>

If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind all attendees to turn off their mobile phones because they can affect the sound system.  I invite the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am genuinely looking forward to a constructive engagement.</p> <p>  It is normal at this time of the year to outline how the Department is performing against its budget allocation.  I will provide the committee with some details on that, especially focusing on the mid-year review position.  My Department has provided the committee with a briefing document on this and I hope everyone has had a chance to peruse it.</p> <p>  I am aware that the committee will also want to have some discussion today on other matters, given that it is only two weeks to budget day.  In particular, the committee has signalled that it would like to engage in a pre-budget discussion, including consideration of the proposals relevant to the committee&rsquo;s very valuable report on lone parents last year.  Of course, I am happy to do that and will come to those issues later, perhaps during the questions.   I am also keen to hear what members see as the key issues for employment affairs and social protection for the months and years ahead.</p> <p>  Members will be aware that the Department&rsquo;s budget represents approximately 36% of gross current Government expenditure.  It is useful, in the preamble, to remind ourselves about the scope and scale of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure and its importance for millions of citizens in the State who completely rely upon it.</p> <p>  An allocation of just over &euro;20 billion was provided for the Department this year.  Expenditure to the end of June was &euro;10 billion and is very close to target for the year to date.  Each week, about 1.3 million people - pensioners, people with disabilities, people on maternity and paternity leave, people who are sick, carers, and jobseekers &ndash; all receive payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  In addition, more than 625,000 families receive child benefit monthly for almost 1.2 million children.</p> <p>  The payments and services provided by the Department are targeted at those most in need and provide significant support to individuals and families who are facing particular challenges in their life, be that unemployment, caring for a very sick child, reaching old age, coping with an illness or disability that impedes their ability to work, or it may be as simple as meeting the costs of heating their home.</p><p>These are daily challenges facing many of our citizens and the development and maintenance of a strong social protection system is genuinely good for all of society, including those people who do not rely on a weekly payment.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the past few years have seen significant decreases in the live register and this trend has continued throughout 2018.  People are finding employment in high numbers and that is one of the good news stories in recent times.  However, our social protection system is not only there to support people who are unemployed.<br/><br/>Our largest block of expenditure will be in 2018 on pensions, which will amount to almost &euro;7.6 billion or 38% of overall expenditure.  This is increasing year on year as our population becomes older and we seek to ensure that people are provided with adequate incomes when they reach their older years.<br/><br/>I was happy to announce earlier this year that the Government decided that the pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands could have their pension entitlement recalculated on the basis of a total contributions approach, including a provision for up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes, who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of contributory State pension.  We had a constructive discussion on this issue at this committee and I thank all of the members for their input.  It is intended that first payments will be made in quarter 1 of next year and, as we agreed in the Oireachtas, the payments will be backdated to March 2018.<br/><br/>Expenditure on working age schemes comprises two programmes called income supports and employment supports which, when combined, amount to about &euro;4.2 billion or 21% of total expenditure.  Income supports, including jobseeker's allowance, one-parent family payment, maternity and paternity supports, accounts for &euro;3.4 billion or 17% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure on employment supports, including community employment, back to education or enterprise and various employment programmes, amounts to just over &euro;823 million or 4% of overall Department spend.  The next biggest area of expenditure is<b></b>illness, disability and carers which amounts to &euro;4.2 billion or 21% of expenditure expected in 2018.  Expenditure on children and families<i></i>accounts for over 13% of expenditure or &euro;2.6 billion, of which &euro;431 million is allocated to the working family payment that is paid to low income working families who work in their towns, villages and cities.  Expenditure on supplementary payments like rent supplement, agencies such as Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Citizens Information Board and other services accounts for &euro;814 million or just under 4% of expenditure.  <br/><br/>The live register, as I mentioned earlier, has continued to decline at an extraordinary rate.  Our improved economic situation and healthy labour market have seen a decline of nearly 40,000 people on the live register since this time last year.  Also, over 80,000 people have left the live register over the past two years.  As of last week, the live register stood at just over 213,000 people and continues to fall.  The ongoing fall in the live register is freeing up resources that we need to meet rising demand in other areas such as pensions, and areas with people with disabilities and people who are carers.<br/><br/>The drop in the live register has been accompanied by a serious increase in employment.  There are now 2.255 million people currently working in Ireland.  To the end of quarter 2 this year, there was an annual increase of more than 74,000 people in employment.  The unemployment rate at the end of quarter 2 stood at 5.8% and long-term unemployment, which is particularly the focus of my Department, has fallen from 3.2% to 2%.  From a peak level of over 30%, the youth unemployment rate has now fallen to 15.4%.  We are making good progress but we do not have the luxury of becoming complacent.  We must continue to ensure that our social protection system and labour market work together to move people into sustainable employment.  We must also ensure that those people who cannot work, and their families, continue to be supported by the State and my Department.  Over the coming weeks my Government colleagues and I will consider ways to build a sustainable budget that will benefit all our people, young and old, rural and urban, in a way that does not spread resources too thinly so in order to make a difference.<br/><br/>In last year's budget I wanted to focus on children and families, particularly lone parents.  We did a number of things in this area as follows: we increased the rate of the qualified child increase by &euro;2, bringing the amount up to &euro;31.80 per child per week, which was the first increase in eight years and, hopefully, will not be the last; we further increased the earnings disregard on the one-parent family payment by &euro;20, bringing the total up to &euro;130 per week; we increased the thresholds for the working family payment by &euro;10 for families with up to three children; and, we increased funding for the school meals programme to include the newly designated Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, schools, as well as supporting all of the schools in the previous year's allocation.  This was alongside a general rate increase in the weekly social welfare payments.<br/><br/>The report on lone parents produced by this committee included a number of recommendations, which I am happy to discuss with members today.  I would stress, however, that we have made significant advances since the report was published.  I also welcome the comments that members of this committee have made heretofore.  I am aware, and I hope that members are aware, that we cannot do everything we want to do in one budget but I want to build on what we achieved last year and further strengthen the position of families on low and fixed incomes in budget 2019.<br/><br/>The annual Christmas bonus was abolished in 2009 by the then Government due to the catastrophic collapse of the country's finances at the time.  Thankfully, as the economy recovered the bonus was reinstated in 2014 at a rate of 25%.  This rate was increased to 75% in 2015 and further increased to 85% in 2016 and 2017.  Despite the fake news headline produced in a newspaper this morning I would like to put at ease the minds of the hundreds of thousands of people who have been absolutely needlessly worried this morning because of that contribution by that particular newspaper, and anybody else who contributed to it, that I have absolutely no intention of discontinuing the Christmas bonus for any social welfare recipient.  It is disingenuous of anybody to try to grab a cheap headline at the expense of people who have no other income, other than their weekly fixed income from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and totally rely on the Christmas bonus.  I can guarantee that whoever did so has never had to live on a fixed income in their life.  <br/><br/>Let us look ahead to the budget that will take place in October.  The programme for Government includes a number of commitments on employment affairs and social protection.  These include increasing payments such as pensions, and carers and disability payments in line with inflation.  Thankfully, in the past few years, we have not only been able to meet but have exceeded this commitment through the increases granted in the weekly rates of payment.<br/><br/>On 20 July, we had a very successful annual pre-budget forum in Dublin Castle.  We held six workshops that were separate to the plenary session and I had an opportunity to sit and listen to the discussions in each and every one of them.  The workshops covered the following themes: retired and older people; supports for the most vulnerable; children and families; people with disabilities and carers; and, employment and pathways to work.  Having read the groups' pre-budget submissions, and listened to the views expressed on the day, it is clear that the range of issues facing non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the people they represent are vast and varied.  In finalising proposals on budget 2019, I am conscious of all of that.  I am also aware that we cannot do everything that we have been asked to do and, therefore, we will need to prioritise.  The forum was extremely useful and gave me and my officials a great insight into the competing priorities for spending on welfare and employment issues.<br/><br/>The summer economic statement indicated that there is likely to be just &euro;800 million of fiscal space available for new tax and spending initiatives across all Departments in budget 2019.  We have to think carefully about where our resources should be directed, consider what will be most effective way to address child poverty, and what will be the most effective way to spend money to aid the position of families on a low income or no income.  As I asked last year, I rely on and would very much welcome hearing what members think the budget priorities should be and the reason for same.  I look forward to hearing their suggestions and comments in the hours ahead.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.1022" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018092500002#D00300"><p>I too thank the Minister for her presentation.  Naturally, I was very happy to hear what she said about the Christmas bonus.  Admittedly, yes, our Government, which originally introduced the Christmas bonus, had to cancel it back in 2009 in view of a catastrophic economic collapse, as she said earlier.  She was pretty strong in her reassurance this morning and I just wonder how the newspaper got a hold of that story in the first place.  In any case, we can now take it that the Christmas bonus will be paid at the same rate as last year at 85%.</p> <p>  As we will have Question Time tomorrow I will confine my questions today to pensions.  I have received a number of queries on the following matter.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was supposed to write a letter to post-2012 pensioners in or about now.  Can the Minister indicate when the letter will be issued?  </p> <p>  I noticed that the opening statement included a number of references to targeting and not spreading benefits too thin, etc., which I understand.</p><p>Targeting is good in principle, but sometimes certain categories of social welfare recipient may not receive any increase or may receive an increase that does not compensate for inflation, leading to a return to regressive budgets.  The Minister will also be aware that the headline inflation rate does not reflect the rate of inflation in the price of food and fuel endured by persons who are living from week to week and buying the bare necessities.  It is important that people at least be compensated for that level of increase in the rate of inflation.</p><p> The Minister has mentioned the fiscal space of &euro;800 million.  I know that in the case of several budgets the figure for the fiscal space was exceeded on budget day.  Of course, &euro;800 million is a standstill figure and presupposes no revenue raising measures which are available to the Government if it wants to increase expenditure.</p><p> I have questions for the Minister on single parents.  I recognise the increase in the earnings disregard last year, but there is a problem with the disregard for lone parents.  It does not take into account the number of children in a family, which seems to be an effective way of combating child poverty.  If people are dependent on social welfare payments, the more children they have, the more likely it is that they are living in poverty.  </p><p> On taking account of maintenance payments as part of the means of lone parents, the Minister will be aware that proposals have been made to establish a statutory maintenance agency.  A real problem I come across on a regular basis is the difficulty people have in going into court and pursuing somebody for maintenance.  If someone obtains a maintenance order, the maintenance payment is immediately counted as part of the individual's means for social welfare purposes, even though the putative party is not actually paying maintenance.  Many take the view that because this is the case, someone risks falling further into poverty if they apply for maintenance.  A partial solution would be establishing a statutory maintenance agency along the lines of that proposed by various parties.</p><p> Financial support is only available to lone parents to pursue full-time education courses.  It should be extended to part-time courses as the cost would be minimal.  That level of flexibility is required, in particular, when one is dealing with lone parents who have to work part time.  One possibly also needs it for lone parents in paying for childcare.</p><p> When is it proposed to update the national carers strategy 2018 to 2022?  How long does it take to process an application for carer's allowance?  The Department told me recently that, on average, it was taking four months.  That means that in some cases it is taking longer than four months.  If one looks for an appeal and an oral hearing, it takes another four months and perhaps as much as six, which is a long time to wait.  Some 73,000 persons are in receipt of carer's allowance, which means that three quarters of the people who provide some care are not receiving any payment.  The payment is only &euro;60 per week over and above jobseeker's allowance, which works out at about 40 cent per hour for somebody who has to work 40 hours a week.  Most of the carers whom I know are working 24/7.  </p><p> The Minister will be aware that in the United Kingdom a commission was set up to examine the extra cost of a disability for an individual.  Do we have any intention of following suit because this issue is the subject of significant debate?</p><p> Will the Minister find out from her colleague when the motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance will be restored?  They were cancelled as the result of a decision of the Ombudsman in 2013 and have not been restored yet.  We read in the newspapers that a memorandum was recently brought to the Cabinet by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, and that it was withdrawn for further consideration.  I know that application processing times have improved, but I bring to the Minister's attention that they are beginning to slip back.  In my experience the application processing time for disability allowance is about five months.  It is startling to think almost 75% of appeals in such cases have been successful.  If someone applies for disability allowance, it can take five months to obtain a decision.  When someone appeals a decision, we are talking about the guts of another six or seven months and the person is likely to be successful.  Some 75% of applicants are wrongfully deprived of disability allowance for all of this period.</p><p> There are a number of schemes operated by the Department for people with disabilities, including the reasonable accommodation grant and the employee retention grant to encourage people with a disability for whom the employment level is very low, at 36 %.  I think only 17 % of people with an intellectual disability are in employment.  Why has the drawdown of the reasonable accommodation grant fallen significantly in the past couple of years?  People do not seem to be aware of it or availing of it.  I understand no application for the employee retention grant has been received from any employer in the past seven years.  These schemes were specifically aimed at people with disabilities and designed to encourage them to stay in work.  They were also designed to encourage their employers to keep them in work.  Unfortunately, they do not appear to be working.</p></speech>

I will start with the anomaly in 2012 rate changes that we fixed earlier this year.  Information letters will issue in the coming weeks to 67,000 Irish residents and 9,000 non-Irish residents.  The numbers are broken down as follows: requests for details of home caring periods and processing home caring period cases in respect of the application of the new T12 recalculations.  We will be notifying people of their reviews that will take place once the letters have been issued.  The basis of the calculation obviously is the new total contributions model with the 20 years caring credit.</p></speech>

What I will be very interested in hearing is where the Deputy suggests we should increase rates of taxation or provide for new increases or new taxation measures.</p></speech>

I hope and expect that there will be more than &euro;800 million to be spread around the 15 Departments.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to lone parents in the context of the earnings disregard which he said was not related to the number of children.  He is correct - it is not.  It is related to the increase in the qualified child payment that we made last year.  The payment is made per child and, as I have mentioned, the increase was the first in eight years and I hope it will not be the last.  The income threshold for family income supplement payments for those who are working will vary considerably and significantly based on the number of children.  </p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that a figure of &euro;95.23 in maintenance payments is disregarded, but only 50% of the remainder of total income is assessed as means.  The positin can be reviewed if maintenance is not being received.  </p> <p>  I receive a great many requests to establish a statutory maintenance agency for all of the reasons described by the Deputy, particularly the difficulties women experience in having to traipse in and out of court.  There is significant merit in the suggestion, but, unfortunately, it does not fall within my responsibility but within that of the Department for Justice and Equality.</p><p>When I have been asked parliamentary questions about this, which is frequently, I have explained, and I continue to explain, why it is not our responsibility and I forward those questions to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who I think has responsibility for equality.  If I could assist in any way in the development of a statutory agency, I would be very keen to do so.</p><p> The Deputy made a very good point about part-time courses.  This is not something we have costed before, so I will certainly look into it in the coming weeks.</p><p> The processing time for carer's allowance applications is 18 weeks.  For carer's benefit, it is 11 weeks.  In fairness, this is because of the complexity of the scheme.  Members have seen other schemes we have, and I refer in particular to domiciliary care allowance, in respect of which the processing time was also up at 18 weeks, which was very high and exceeds our Department's targets.  That has now come right down to five weeks, and in the worst-case scenario to nine weeks, so we have seen huge improvements because we changed the application form.  We made it much easier for people to provide us with the information, and medical assessments that arise from this are far speedier because the information is given.  We are undergoing changes and will propose and discuss any changes to the carer's application form with interested bodies in the coming months to try to do something similar.</p><p> The Deputy is right, however, that it is unacceptable.  It is something we continue to strive to reduce.  The processing time for carer's benefit, at 11 weeks, is under target, and that for carer's allowance is over target at 18 weeks.  We continue to monitor this and to try to work towards reducing it.  In fairness, we had extra staff deployed from one section of our Department to work on carer's allowance to try to alleviate this, particularly over the summer when it happens a lot.</p><p> The cost of disability was raised with me last year.  It was raised again at the pre-budget forum we had this year.  I cannot consider it on my own because our Department offers income supports to people with disabilities and it is the State's responsibility to provide a much wider range of services and supports to people with a very wide range and complex set of needs.  It is on this basis that I am in the process of consulting the other relevant Departments as to how best we ascertain the actual cost of disability.  There have been commissions and initiatives in other countries from which we are learning, but in trying to address this issue we need to learn from other countries' mistakes and recognise that there is not a one size that fits all.  It is not going to be a matter of a certain amount of money for everyone who is on a disability or an illness payment because of the complexity of people's struggles.  We would like to do this comprehensively, and I would like to do it right.  As I said, I am consulting other Departments to ensure we do it right.</p><p> The mobility grant is a Department of Health issue, but I will certainly pass on the Deputy's concerns to the Minister for Health.</p><p> I do not have an answer as to why fewer people have taken up the employment retention grant scheme.  There certainly has not been a reduction in people with varying degrees of ability finding employment.  We have two projects that we started last year that are providing huge supports for people who have disabilities but also have huge ability and want to contribute to the economy or indeed just want to ensure they are providing themselves with interaction and with life.  We have the ability programme that was launched earlier this year, which had an uptake of probably twice what we could afford at the time.  We will look to expand on that in the years to come.  We also have the employability project, which was piloted jointly between us and the HSE last year and which we are now rolling out to every single county in the country.  This is to support people who are suffering from varying degrees of mental ill health.</p><p> The projection of the partial capacity payment is also there, and the flexibilities that were introduced this year are to encourage people to take what they see as a risk of coming off an illness or long-term disability payment and going into the workplace.  We have the fast-track return to the payment they were on if they do go into work and it does not work out.  This is to support people to be secure in the knowledge that if they want to try going back to work for a couple of hours a week or a couple of weeks a month, should it not work out in the short term, the Department will always be there to support them in the long term.  We will continue to work with employers to ensure that the ability programme and the employability programme are as successful as they have been initially.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.1030" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018092500002#F00200"><p>I welcome the Minister's commitment regarding the Christmas bonus.  As a Teachta D&aacute;la, I was contacted by a sizeable number of people this morning on their seeing the headline in one of the newspapers.  People are genuinely concerned and worried, which to me shows how important the Christmas bonus is to people in trying to make plans around Christmas time.  I therefore welcome the Minister's commitment that the bonus will be paid.  I would like to see something a bit more rock solid every year.  She has used the same kind of terminology every year when she has come before the committee in recent years, that there is no provision for a Christmas bonus in the Department's allocation.  I know she says it depends on annual savings within the Department and that if savings can be made in areas, that depends on the allocation of the Christmas bonus.  In future I would like to see a 100% payment, not just the 85% payment.  There has been needless scaremongering, which greatly concerned very many people in the community.</p> <p>  The Minister finished her opening statement by saying what would be the most effective way of addressing child poverty.  I have spoken to the NGOs, the organisations out dealing with children in poverty, and CSO figures show that 25% of children in lone parent families are in poverty or at risk of poverty.  When asked about this, these organisations talk about a targeted increase in the qualified child increase, QCI, from 12 years of age upwards.  There are also real issues with child benefit, on which I would like to get the Minister's views.  What is her view on increasing it for children in full-time school education?  This is putting families in real, serious financial difficulty.  I am not saying it is forcing children out of school, but difficult decisions need to be made.  When it was cut and the age threshold reduced, it had a real impact on families.  What are the Minister's views on this?  The organisations and my party and I certainly advocate this being increased.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of a child maintenance service, I brought forward proposals and I welcome that other parties agreed to them.  The establishment of a child maintenance service was one of the key recommendations to come from the committee report last year.  I hear what the Minister is saying, that it is not the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but rather that of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I know she sees the merit in the service, but has she made representations?  Has she spoken to her Cabinet colleagues about the need for it?  I met Department officials from the office of the Minister for Justice and Equality over the summer and there does not seem to be that sense of importance or urgency.  It is not on the Minister's or the Department's radar whatsoever.</p> <p>  A dedicated child maintenance service would mean so much to so many families.  Forcing them to go through the courts is not the right thing to do.  I genuinely believe there are savings to be made to the State in terms of court sitting time, judges and so on.  It will also be of tangible benefit, especially to the children.  Many lone parents simply will not go to a court sitting because it is not the right area.  We know the implications of maintenance payments in some cases not being paid.</p> <p>  The Minister cited a figure of 15.4% for youth unemployment.  CSO unemployment data for August 2018 have it at 13.9%.  Can we get a little clarity on this?  Which is the correct figure?</p> <p>  I refer to what I see and what many of the organisations dealing with young people see as discriminatory payments to young unemployed people.  Does the Minister see this as discrimination?  I know her predecessor stood over it, and I have questioned her previously and I know what she will probably come back with, that there are many options for young unemployed people to take whereby they get a full payment.  I know that, I hear that, but it is still a discriminatory payment if a person aged between 18 and 24 years is forced to live on &euro;107.70 per week.</p><p>I want to get the Minister's view on that.</p><p> I have spoken to the Minister previously about the fuel allowance, especially fuel poverty, which is an issue that faces more than 400,000 citizens in this State.  There has been an increase in the cost of fuel in recent years.  The fuel allowance is one means by which we can try to tackle fuel poverty.  Will it be increased in this year's budget?  An additional payment was made to recipients this year because of the bad weather.  In other countries such as the UK, an automatic payment kicks in if there is a prolonged cold snap.  What we have is a haphazard measure that only comes into effect when there is political pressure and pressure from NGOs.  The Government only responds when there is uproar.  Could a specific measure be put in place providing for an automatic payment in the event of a prolonged period of cold weather lasting a week or ten days?</p><p> Looking through the document I note that the number of participants on community employment, CE, schemes is 1,244 fewer than at the end of June 2016.  Am I correct in saying there are 32,000 CE positions in total?  Currently, there are 21,578 participants on CE schemes.  A note states that the lower number of recipients reflects a decline in the number of people on the live register and the improved labour market.  That seems to be the stock answer any time questions are asked about CE schemes or difficulties in finding suitable people to avail of CE positions.  Community employment supervisors lay the blame for the low uptake of community employment positions on the establishment of JobPath.  I spoke to many of them over the summer.  I accept some changes have been made to allow people to go on CE schemes.  While welcome, these changes do not go far enough.  We must deal with the difficulties that exist in regard to CE schemes.  I would like to get the Minister's view on that.  There is a problem and CE supervisors say it is due to JobPath.</p><p> How much has been paid to date this year to Turas Nua and Seetec?  I would like the most up-to-date figures.  Are financial penalties built into the contract which can be imposed by the companies if the Department or Intreo offices do not supply them with agreed numbers of jobseekers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.1032" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018092500002#G00200"><p>I thank the Chair and Deputy Brady.  I am grateful for their support and comments on the Christmas bonus.  From dealing with people whose only source of income is the weekly payment they get from the Department of Social Protection, we all know how worried they were made feel today.  I would say there is not a Deputy or Senator in these Houses who did not get countless calls, emails and text messages arising from this morning's inaccurate leak.  I have been called choice names today as people reacted.  I am big enough and ugly enough to look after my own reputation - that is not at issue - but it was extremely mean to needlessly worry old people and those with disabilities to get a cheap headline.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady is looking for some clarity on the issue.  The Christmas bonus is never included in the budget, so when I sit down with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, next week we will not have a line in the budget for next year's Christmas bonus.  That is for two reasons.  Roughly half of the funding for the payment comes from the Social Insurance Fund, to which people contribute annually and which is, thankfully, in surplus at the moment.  We will get into difficulty in this regard in the coming years when the fund will no longer be in surplus.  However, we will make plans to make sure that we have enough money in the future.  The other half of the funding comes from savings and those savings need to be found.  One would want to be incredibly thick or entirely desperate, as the then Government was when it had no choice in the matter, to interfere with a payment on which hundreds of thousands of people rely.  The Christmas bonus will never appear in a Budget Statement.  It always comes from the Social Insurance Fund and other savings we make over the year.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about lone parents and the NGOs that represent them.  The proposal that was made to me last year was to acknowledge and recognise that children over 12 eat more and cost more than children under 12 do.  That point has also been made very clearly this year.  What has also been made very clear to me this year is that the answer is not always to give extra money.  The answer to addressing the very slow decrease in the number of children who are living in consistent poverty must also include services.  It cannot just be about one Department giving extra money to families, even if that money is desperately needed.  It has to be about education, housing, healthcare and justice issues, and we must all collectively work together to deliver on that agenda.  The amount of money my Department would need to address consistent child poverty on its own would amount to billions of euro.  The response has to involve more than raising the qualified child increase, QCI.  It requires the delivery of a whole-of-Government approach.</p> <p>  I do not agree with Deputy Brady's proposal on the children's allowance.  This is a universal payment and for all of the good that brings, it will remain a universal payment.  In terms of the people who have been impacted by the increase in the age of children in secondary schools, any change to child benefit would result in an increased payment to everybody, meaning we would end up giving money to families who do not necessarily need it.  As we discussed, we would have to increase taxes to increase the &euro;800 million that is available this year.  I am not sure we should increase taxes without specifically targeting the most vulnerable in the services or the social transfers we issue.  On that basis, I do not favour change to the universality of child benefit.  If we were to do as Deputy Brady suggested, we would not target the most vulnerable in society.  That is not to say I am unaware of vulnerable families but we have other schemes and supports in place to help them if an 18 year old child is still in full-time education.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady is aware of my views on child maintenance.  I will continue to have conversations on this issue with the Department of Justice and Equality.  I have told the Department that we will support initiatives it leads on in any way we can.  However, this is an issue on which my Department cannot lead.  I can only be responsible for the actions my Department takes in dealing with lone parents and the pursuit of maintenance.  The Deputy is aware that I made changes earlier this year when I was somewhat horrified to find out that we were forcing women to chase errant, abusive partners.  That practice has ceased.  I am also in the process of making considerable changes to the remainder of the liable relatives section in the Department.  I will probably make an announcement later this year in that regard.</p> <p>  On whether I stand over the differential in payment to those aged under 26 and those aged over 26, I do.  I do not see it as discriminatory.  As I said on previous occasions at this committee, there are other options for young adults aged under 26.  We announced the latest option this week and I am grateful that Deputy Brady gave it a cautious welcome.  I look forward to seeing the pilot project bear fruit between now and Christmas so that we can allocate more money to it next year.  I know we will soon face a scenario, hopefully by the end of this year, when the unemployment figure will fall below 200,000.  We are all aware that there is a transient group of 100,000 people, give or take a small number, who are between jobs either for weeks or months.  They are not people who are struggling to find employment.</p><p>That leaves us with a sizeable number of people who face real barriers to finding employment.  Given that we are having job fair after job fair and that employers are telling us they cannot find people to employ, we have to address the real supports that are required to help those 80,000 plus people achieve employment either on a part-time or a full-time basis.  The youth employment support scheme, YESS, programme for under 25s is going to make a significant difference.  I will be back to update the committee on that.  The pilot project is only for three months and I hope we will be back with tangible positive results to be able to extend it to a nationwide roll-out.</p><p> The reason community employment, CE, numbers are down is that the unemployment numbers are down.  If there are more people working, there will be fewer people to do employment activation work.  With the height of respect, I know the Deputy desperately feels it is JobPath and other people are telling him that.  Because the Deputy so often mentioned that people were being stopped from doing CE when they were on the JobPath programme, I made the changes in good faith to allow people to do CE, T&uacute;s and JobPath.  However, doing so did not change the applications for the jobs that are available through community employment programmes one jot.  I know the Deputy genuinely believes there was a cohort of people on JobPath who desperately wanted to be able to avail of CE schemes.  There are some people who have approached me in the past couple of months who are thrilled to have been able to do so, but the numbers are tiny.  That tells me JobPath is not the reason people are not doing CE schemes or taking up employment that is available currently as the economy is recovering and employment is being provided, mostly by small to medium-sized businesses.  It tells me there are other issues, be they social issues, disadvantage issues or training issues.  There are myriad other issues that are stopping people availing of either the training employment schemes or the actual employment that is available.  Collectively, we can get to the bottom of it and provide the supports and services to ensure that those 80,000 long-term unemployed are given the supports by the State to make sure that number comes drastically down.  As the overall numbers come down, that group of problems will become more prevalent.</p><p> The final question was about Turas Nua and Seetec.  The fee payments were &euro;1.2 million in 2015, &euro;25.2 million in 2016, &euro;54 million in 2017 and &euro;38.9 million up to the end of June in 2018.  The actual expenditure of &euro;38.9 million was an estimate of &euro;25 million with a variance of &euro;13.9 million.  I do not think it is intended to publish the individual payments to each of the companies because they are commercially sensitive.  In addition, the publication of these payments would place the State at a disadvantage in terms of our current contracts and the future placement of these or other, new alternatives.</p></speech>

Two figures are issued, namely, every month and every quarter.  The monthly figures from the CSO for the end of August show that the youth unemployment rate is 13.9%.  It is the quarterly figures that we really rely upon, the labour force survey.  They reflect a more accurate position.  That figure is at 15.4%.  Given that it is coming from 30% and going down, the figure is definitely going in the right direction.  I hope that YESS will provide a significant roadmap to ensure we get the figure down to single digits next year.</p> <p>  At the end of July, there were approximately 93,000 clients engaged with JobPath, of whom 708, less than 1%, had a current penalty rate applied to their claim.  The figure is consistent with the overall level of penalty rate applied across all jobseekers claims.  I do not think it what the Deputy is asking; he is asking about penalties to Seetec and Turas Nua.  I will get back to him on that if he does not mind.</p></speech>

She mentioned that throwing extra money at it would not suffice.  While that would not fix it, it would go a long way to solving the issue.  I welcome comments made by my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, on giving every support to parents, especially in respect of education, and ensuring that grants for parents in part-time education are available and that parents are fully supported in that endeavour.  It is very important that young single mothers, in particular, have all the flexibility they need when caring for their children.  I attended the National Women's Council budget meeting this morning.  They highlighted the need to fully restore the income disregards when it comes to having a part-time job.  The Minister touched on it today but we need to go further and fully restore them.  The only way we are going to resolve the issue of child poverty is by empowering children, putting supports in place for parents and children and ensuring that their housing needs are catered for.  We need to do a lot more than what we are doing at the moment.  We need to go that extra mile.  We need radical proposals.  There should be no need in a modern democracy and a small country for any child to be living in poverty.</p> <p>  We are going to see a lot more fuel poverty when we go into the colder months.  Deputy Brady advocated an increase in the fuel allowance.  This time last year, I suggested increasing the income threshold for the fuel allowance.  Once someone is in receipt of the fuel allowance, there are many ancillary benefits he or she can get, especially for elderly people, including having a house insulated.  As we know, many incomes are remaining the same while the cost of living is dramatically increasing year by year.  I welcome that we will be keeping the Christmas bonus, as do all my colleagues.</p> <p>  On the general gender pension inequality and backdating the homemakers disregard to the time of the marriage bar, I know it is costly at about &euro;290 million.  Has the Minister given any more thought to that?  My colleague, Deputy O'Dea, welcomed the assessment times for carers allowance, jobseekers allowance and disability allowance.  I am glad to see they are reducing.  We still need to ensure that the timeframe is reduced further.  When somebody is applying for carers allowance, it is generally done in a hurry when a loved one is acutely sick and when it is necessary for the person involved to take time off work.  We have to support people in this time of need and not have them waiting for their applications to be processed when they are going through such personal turmoil with parents or relatives in hospital and while they are trying to deal with a sick person's physical needs.</p> <p>  I wish to raise the status of the pension auto-enrolment scheme.  Those who are self-employed do not receive any illness benefit at the moment.  What are the Minister's thoughts on introducing an illness benefit for them?</p></speech>

Let us not be naive about the latter.  It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that the State does everything possible to make sure that does not happen.  We must also collectively support the charitable organisations which deal directly with those families to financially support them.  I hope to God I did not say that the answer involves just throwing money at them-----</p></speech>

Nobody is ever going to refuse an increase in a payment directly into a household.  It has been shown right across the European Union that we have the best outcomes from the social transfers system that we have employed and engaged with for scores of years.</p><p>It is not just about giving extra money.  It is also about making sure we improve the outcomes from our educational system and that we support children in that, and that we improve the health services and the accommodation provided to the children.  It involves myriad supports and wraparound services that have to be the responsibility of a number of Departments down to the likes of the Department of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring, providing local playgrounds for the children to play in, the Department of Health implementing its Healthy Ireland policy to make sure the children get as much exercise as required, and the parents ensuring their children do not sit in front of screens, which is incumbent on all of us.  It involves myriad responsibilities under many Departments and society to ensure that children are not living in consistent poverty.  I intend to make sure that our Department plays its part in reaching those targets.</p><p> I take on board Senator Ardagh's suggestion with regard to the income disregard and the fuel allowance.  I hope she will appreciate that given that we are at such sensitive stages in our negotiations for this year's budget, it would be unwise for me to give any indication on that.  The same goes for the following suggestion the Senator made.  The anomaly introduced during the 2012 rate band changes and arising from the cuts, particularly in the legislation by the then Government, has been fixed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.1042" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018092500002#J00300"><p>I appreciate that.  That particular change in isolation will cost the Exchequer, the tax man, probably in excess of &euro;70 million.  To be respectful, on the &euro;290 million the Senator is talking about, given that we have only &euro;800 million to spend this year, I do not believe it is something that is even on the table this year.  However, I understand and appreciate the reason she is raising it.</p> <p>  The turnaround for people applying for carer's benefit is at 11 weeks.  The turnaround for carer's allowance applications is a little higher at 18 weeks, but as I said to Senator Ardagh's colleague, Deputy O'Dea, that is not something we find acceptable.  It is something on which we continually move staff into and out of the Department for the very reason the Senator described, namely, people are busy doing what they are doing, which is caring for somebody they love deeply who has a serious illness.  When the information is given to us in one complete format, we try our best to try to turn around the application as quickly as we can, but by the very nature of some of these applications and the complexity of the needs of the person being cared for, it sometimes takes a little longer.  The only way I can genuinely tell the Senator how we would improve that is to hire hundreds more people, and that is not something I have the gift within the Department to do at the moment.  In terms of what we do, when we have extra resources in different areas because of lulls or peaks during the year, we move staff to the carer section to make sure that the scanning of medical documents happens on a timely basis, that the medical assessments happen with the medical team as quickly as possible and that we turn around the application as quickly as we can.</p> <p>  I admit and acknowledge that 18 weeks is not something we are hugely proud of, but it is because of those complexities that we are now readdressing and looking at changing the application form to try to make it as streamlined and as efficient as we did when we looked at the domiciliary care allowance.  We have had huge success with that, and those are not my words but those of the people who are making the applications.  It has reduced from what then was probably in excess of 20 weeks to five now and, in a worst case scenario, to nine weeks.  I hear what the Senator is saying but we are conscious of the issue.</p> <p>  The automatic enrolment retirement savings system consultation started at the end of August.  It will close on 3 November.  We did a launch in Dublin but I have three roadshows pencilled in so far.  There is one happening in Dublin next week.  I think we are doing a second one because the first one in Dublin was oversubscribed.  We will have one in Galway and one in Cork.  If they are as well attended as the Dublin one will be, we may even go further afield.  The most important aspect I am concerned about is that I hear the views of the interested bodies loudly and repeatedly.  I want to hear the views and wishes of the people who will be pensioners in 20, 30 and 40 years in terms of what their retirement savings will be if they engage in the automatic enrolment system, which I hope will go live in 2022.  That will take place between now and 3 November.</p> <p>  I have just been ably told that the Oireachtas will be getting a briefing similar to the one on the total contributions model, and it will probably happen in the audiovisual room.  All Deputies and Senators will be invited to that.  It is very important that we hear their views as to what they would like to see, how much they would like people to contribute, for how long, whether there is an opportunity to be able to dip in on a once-off basis and the reason for that.  The so-called Strawman proposal is very comprehensive but the reason it is so prescriptive is because it is very easy for people to rip it apart and say they would prefer this, that or the other.  As I said, the most important thing for me is engagement from what we could call normal people and not the industry between now and 3 November.  We have taken out advertisements in local newspapers, and if there is a roadshow coming near any of the members, I would be grateful if they could help by putting it on their Facebook page and encouraging people to attend.</p> <p>  In recent years we started to equalise the schemes available for people who are employed.  This is something Senator Butler has long championed, as far back as when he was first elected to these Houses in 2011, to introduce the same level of supports for people who are self-employed as those who are employed.  That process started a number of years ago with the current Taoiseach, then Minister for Social Protection, starting with the invalidity pension.  We hope in the years to come to be able to continue that until we have parity of esteem between self-employed and employed people.</p> <p>  Also, we extended the treatment benefits to people who are self-employed that are enjoyed by people who are employed, which is the right thing to do.  Someone who is employed and someone who is self-employed makes the same contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  I appreciate they do not make an employer's contribution at the same time but they should not be penalised on the supports available from the State if and when they fall on hard times, either in terms of illness or jobseeker's benefit or a pension.  I hope that answers all the questions.</p></speech>

I welcome the news that the Christmas bonus will be paid this year.  It is a huge boost for local businesses and very good news for people living in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Naturally, I will start the ball rolling by raising the issue of the discrimination of self-employed people in terms of social protection over the years.  Four hundred thousand people who are self-employed get up every morning and go out to work.  That is one quarter of the workforce.  I refer to the painter, the plasterer, the electrician and the shopkeeper.  They are ordinary, decent people.</p> <p>  I welcome the good work the Government has done, especially this Minister and her predecessor, on tax equalisation, eye and dental cover and disability payments.  However, we need to go further.  Those benefits should have been put in place 30 or 40 years ago.  In terms of putting a new stamp in place, I would like to see that done on a mandatory basis, but I know it will come about on a voluntary basis and that we will have to move with that.  The Mangan report that was done three or four years ago through social protection stated that putting a new stamp in place at 5.5% would provide sick pay for self-employed people and other benefits that we have put in place.  I want to see this new stamp put in place.  During the economic crash, I saw the devastation done when self-employed people lost their businesses and had to pay everyone.  When they thought they were entitled to something, they got nothing, however.  During the recession, many self-employed people went into dark places, including into the back of sheds and fields, and never came back, which is very sad.</p> <p>  We are the only country in industrialised Europe that does not have social protection benefits for the self-employed.  I am pleading with the Minister to put this new stamp in place, if she can, in this budget.  I am aware the research has been done by her Department and that she has been heavily involved in that.  Everything is in place now and, in fairness to Fianna F&aacute;il, it is in the programme for Government so let us put this new stamp in place.  We will never get a better chance to do it.  People are returning to work.  We can build on the fund as we move forward so that if an economic crash happens, self-employed people will be covered.</p> <p>  Meath County Council is reviewing the rents of all its tenants in social housing.  Why is the working family payment, formerly known as family income supplement, taken as part of gross income, which results in rents being increased, when that money is given through the Department to support families, not for rent?  No other body includes the working family payment in a person's gross income.</p><p>It is scandalous that local authorities are allowed to do so.  The Department is giving the money to lower income families in good faith, yet it is being used to pay rent to local authorities.  I know of people whose rent has increased significantly because the working family payment is being counted as part of their gross income.  It is not right.</p><p> I have referred previously to the abolition of the bereavement grant.  If possible, it should be restored in some shape or form.  For a family, it was a recognition by the State of the loss of a loved one.  Even if we cannot restore it in its entirety, surely we can restore it at just &euro;400.  The system is being abused and unfair on ordinary, decent, working people.</p><p> There should be more information on advertisements about the stamp one pays and what it entitles people to receive from the Department.  There are many people who do not have a clue what their entitlements are and we should be giving them that information.</p></speech>

We were both elected to the Oireachtas in 2011 and he has been relentless in raising these issues ever since.  That was because he had experienced at first hand the impact of the social welfare system's capacity to look after self-employed persons like him.  He had not only provided a job for himself for donkey's years but also for others in County Meath.  Cases such as his are the reason we have recognised and acknowledged in recent years the enterprise of the self-employed in providing employment and their invaluable contribution to the State over and above their social insurance contributions of 4% plus.  That was why we needed to equalise the schemes across all categories of worker.  We have gone some of the way down the road towards doing so, but we are not finished.</p> <p>  I cannot answer the Senator's question about specific extensions, but the report acknowledged that there could not be an opt in or an opt out.  Either the contribution rate for all self-employed persons should be increased or it should not be increased at all.  My opinion is that we should not increase it because the self-employed contribute enough.  I have other ideas on how the Social Insurance Fund for the self-employed could be supplemented.  I hope we will be able to have a further conversation on it.  I intend to balance it out and ensure that, as and when the economy can sustain it in the years ahead, all of the schemes currently available to employees will also become available to the self-employed.</p> <p>  There are inconsistencies in the working family payment scheme.  At the end of the day, it is income.  We only give it to persons who are on a low income or who only work 19 hours every fortnight because they cannot survive on the money they are earning.  The working family payment supplements their income based on their working hours and number of children.  Therefore, it is household income and Meath County Council has a right to evaluate it as income when working out the differential rate.  The inconsistency lies in the fact that the same is not done in every county council area.  Applying it equally one way or the other would be fairer.  I will make inquiries in that regard.</p></speech>

What people do not remember is the range of other support payments, many of which come from the Department, that are available to the bereaved.  We do not just stop minding people once they become bereaved.  We have extended carer's allowance and the domiciliary care allowance and taken a number of measures to continue payments for a significant number of weeks after someone passes away to try to ease the burden of the associated costs that arise following the loss of a loved one.  The Department pays a sizable amount of money in exceptional needs payments to people who have a genuine financial difficulty in covering funeral expenses.  That will always continue.  It is not a case of someone receiving one amount of money and someone else receiving another.  A standard amount is allocated on the basis of need and the outlay incurred when someone passes away.  These payments will form part of the budgetary discussions.</p> <p>  The Senator's idea about stamp entitlements is a good one.  He is right, in that a large number of people do not know what their entitlements are.  Consider the increased participation rates under the dental treatment benefit scheme that was improved last year.  I believe we told everyone 100 times that we had improved the benefit in the last budget, but people have approached me about it in my area and said they had not known about it until their dentist only charged them &euro;15 for a visit.  That tells me that we did not announce it enough.  Therefore, the Senator's suggestion might be worthwhile.  I am not sure giving newspapers advertising money is the best way to go about it, but I will review the options.</p></speech>

I will focus on some of the issues that have arisen.  As a number of the questions I would have asked have been addressed, I will try to build further on them.</p> <p>  As the Minister knows, I long advocated in my previous life for an increase in the home caring credit in the context of pensions, with reference to the 20-year provision.  Regarding the T12, however, I have a concern about the threshold being pushed out to 40 years and 20 years of home caring credits being considered within that timeframe.  I would be concerned if we were to move towards a 40-year contribution requirement in the pension system, which is one of the options on the table.  There were consultations during the summer, but perhaps the issue was not described as clearly as it could have been.  Many found the consultation process difficult to navigate.  ICTU which represents a large volume of workers has expressed serious concerns about the goal posts being moved towards a figure 40 years.  The Minister discussed considering other ideas to supplement the Social Insurance Fund for the self-employed.  I ask that the State bring similar creativity to finding ways to address and recognise caring without necessarily pushing out the threshold.</p> <p>  I have a smaller but more detailed concern and I am sure the Minister's officials will have indicated that they are examining it.  It relates to carers who have not had contributions made on their behalf because they returned to caring and fell out of the contributory pension system.  There is a gender inequality dimension to pensions.  A strong concern of mine is that the budget should be gender and equality proofed.  Such proofing is planned to be intensified this year.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has asked that Departments, specifically the Minister's, consider using the expanded simulated welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model when conducting gender analyses of and tests on their budgetary measures.  What are the Minister's plans in that regard?</p> <p>  The litmus test of whether a gender equality perspective will be brought to next year's social protection budget relates to lone parents.  This is an issue on which the Minister has engaged.  In January she spoke at the ESRI about unwinding the cuts.  I recognise that she has a concern in that regard and that some measures were taken in the previous budget, but a few specific elements need to be addressed in the upcoming budget.</p><p>The question of the qualified child increase is important as it relates to teenagers.  I realise there are wider issues in terms of services and supports that the Minister spoke to eloquently.  Those problems affect everybody but children in lone parent families are up to three times more likely to be in consistent poverty.  There are additional and specific supports that need to be addressed in that area and the qualified child increase is one such area.  We talked about the cost of teenagers.  There is a problem at the moment that lone parents leave the jobseeker transitional payment when their child reaches the age of 14.  That is a time when additional costs, difficulties and challenges kick in but the caring obligations and work they are doing becomes effectively invisible to the system.  This is not simply about cost, but about recognition too.  If we were to widen the eligibility for the jobseeker transitional payment to allow for those with children up to the age of 18, it would mean they would be able to work full-time or part-time, according to their needs.  It would mean they could access income disregard.  The additional supports of the system would continue to be directed to them.  That change, from 14 to 18, would make a significant difference.</p><p> I recognise that children's allowance is a universal payment.  There is a concern for situations where children have dropped out of school and there are vulnerabilities that surround such cases.  There are concerns as to whether parents can lose child benefit payments and there have been questions on that.  A situation where a child is dropping out of school might be an indicator of vulnerability and might be a time when families need more support rather than less. </p><p> On the fall in community employment schemes, lone parent advocates in particular have raised the fact that, while there is a general improvement across childcare, specific schemes, like the childcare, education and training support, CETS, scheme and the community employment childcare, CEC, scheme, have fallen away a little bit.  There is a concern that some of the additional targeted childcare supports for people taking part in schemes might need to be looked at again because they are falling through the cracks.  </p><p> The quality of outcome is an issue in many areas and was mentioned earlier in the context of quality part-time education access.  There are also quality part-time employment measures which eliminate a binary choice between precarious and full-time employment but rather create quality part-time employment routes for people who are trying to balance childcare with the rebuilding of a labour market attachment. </p><p> There are also many overlaps in schemes and grants.  That was something that this committee spoke about for people with disabilities and the Minister will be looking at the report of the committee on that matter.  The back to education allowance, the student universal support Ireland, SUSI, grant and rent allowance intersect and people find there are obstacles to going back into education.</p><p> Education options need to be put on the table.  Activation of that includes a question of shifting towards an education first model, which would be my preference, or at least an education equal model.  There are a number of ways in which people can fall between the cracks.  It can be the luck of the draw as to at what point one ends up on the live register whether one gets offered a college course or pushed into a two-week training course.  That can make the difference and that is a real concern because we want to make sure that everybody is accessing the right option, and the best option, for them.</p><p> Given the new, wider remit that the Minister's Department has, how is the Department going to engage with other Departments about the quality of employment?  That will be important in the budgetary context.  The Minister said that people do not want to suggest tax areas.  I will happily do so.  We need significant changes in the hospitality sector.  There are so many staff in that sector who are still working in poor conditions and poor employment.  We need to question the VAT rate for that sector if changes are not made.  </p><p> We are spending more than &euro;2 billion in private pension tax relief.  I think the figure of &euro;17 million that was mentioned, and the figure of &euro;290 million that Senator Ardagh mentioned, is a drop in the ocean compared to the &euro;2.3 billion in private pension tax relief.  The Minister and I have spoken about this in the Seanad and she will have the figure herself.  Is this marginal rate, which disproportionately benefits higher earners, the best investment and recognition of contribution across the board?</p><p> This is a little outside the budgetary issue, but there are still ministerial concerns about the public service card.  We saw in the media last week, however much the media should be trusted, that there were serious concerns about the sharing of data across Departments as part of the single customer view dataset that comprises the public services card dataset.  Is there a satisfactory legal basis for that and, if there is not, what measures might be taken?  I have raised concerns previously with the Minister about the issue of biometric data and what is to be recognised and not recognised as biometric data.  There are cases of contractors who were called biometric and then renamed themselves.  Under fundamental European definitions, some aspects of the single customer review dataset are likely to end up being in that area of biometric data and different and appropriate protections must be made.</p><p> This is not simply expenditure.  Social protection is fundamentally the investment we make in our social fabric.  It is something that needs to be recognised as not simply an output but an investment in the idea that we are living together and that aspect of social solidarity.  We should not apologise for the size of the budget - in fact, I think it should be increased.  The Minister reflects that part of the social solidarity equation and she should feel strong in pressing for further resources in these areas.</p></speech>

Behind every line is a person, a family, a child who needs support and, in many cases, has no support other than the solidarity and goodness of Irish people.  It is not my money, or Senator Higgins's money.  It derives from social insurance contributions for benefits, but the vast majority comes from the taxpayers' purse and that is recognition that we live in a society, not just an economy.  I have not one ounce of embarrassment when I am sitting in front of the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, or any of his officials, to ensure my Department gets the largest chunk of that &euro;800 million to look after people who cannot look after themselves at vulnerable times in their lives.  The Senator should not be worried about me being embarrassed.  I am well able for embarrassment.  I will do my best over the next couple of weeks to make sure that all of the areas that we talk and care about are addressed.</p> <p>  I will return to the Senator's first question about equality budgeting.  The pilot project programme on equality budgeting was initially started with six Departments and it focused primarily on gender and ran for the first time in the Estimates of last year.  This is now being rolled out to other Departments this year.  My Department is represented on the new equality budgeting technical advisory group, which is chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and it will include equality budgeting targets in my revised Estimates for this year.  Be assured that we will examine the gender concepts in the SWITCH model and we have officially arranged for training with the ESRI for all the relevant staff in that area, including me.  We are conscious that the budget will not be regressive and will be gender proofed.  I can give the committee that reassurance.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the Senator's representation that children over the age of 12 cost more to rear than children under 12.</p><p>I have heard that said and it has not gone over my head.</p><p> The Senator is not the first person to mention the jobseeker's transitional payment being extended.  As the Senator may be aware, I had a meeting with Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, because Louise was part of the Senator's press conference last week.  She brought it to my attention in the submission she gave me, as have others.  It will form part of the budgetary discussions.</p><p> No child who drops out of school is penalised under the child welfare system, although I know people might like to be able to use that.  As the Senator knows, a child who drops out of school is crying out for help and, in many cases, the family require the assistance of the State, not to be penalised by &euro;140 a month.  What we do with the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, and other support services is notice the fact that the child is not going to school and make initial contact.  I do not need to tell the Senator how to suck eggs.  She knows exactly what we do.  I would not be in favour of any model that would penalise the family because their child was having difficulty or stressed and could not go to school for whatever reason.  They need support, not stigma.</p><p> The Senator brought some anomalies to my attention for people who potentially would like to participate either in community employment or other activation schemes because of the limitations in communities.  I was not aware that there were limitations.  Given that it is not my Department that is involved, perhaps that is just my ignorance.  I apologise if that is the case.</p></speech>

I will certainly bring the matter to somebody's attention, but the last thing we need is to have somebody being hindered who wants to participate in a community employment scheme to be activated in full or part-time quality employment.  The supports available encourage people into activation, training, education and, therefore, a career.  I know that the Senator agrees with me in that regard.  I am not interested in people finding low-paid, part-time work; rather, I am interested in them having access to a quality support system, involving education, activation and work experience to make sure they have a well paid career.  From my perspective, that is no different from support that should be available to somebody who is a lone parent, whether male or female, or a married man or woman with one or 15 kids.  Support services, including financial support, should be in place to support people to maintain and improve their living standards through education, activation and work experience.</p> <p>  Quality of employment is an issue that is prevalent.  We are bringing employment rights legislation through the Houses which will enshrine certain rights for people who are in precarious and low-paid employment.  It has been stalled somewhat on the basis of a body of work that needs to be completed on people with self-employed status.  I am adamant that it is a priority for us and we will continue to work on it.  </p> <p>  The Senator has brought the issue of pension tax relief to the committee's attention.  It does not fall within my remit, but I am adamant that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will extend the benefits enjoyed in the private pension sector to the rest of the world.  Once we finalise the new auto-enrolment scheme for the 65% of persons in the private sector who do not currently save anything towards their pension, we will be adamant about implementing it by our 2022 deadline.</p> <p>  The Senator is probably aware from comments in the media that we received a report from the Data Protection Commission, outlining the commissioner's concerns and comments.  In fairness to her, she asked us not to discuss it with anybody, something which does not seem to have happened, given the content in the newspapers, but I will honour her wishes and not discuss it, except to say it is a very comprehensive document and that we are compiling a response to her within the deadlines.  That response will be made public and the Senator can look at the concerns raised and our responses to them.  As long as the Senator and I are here, we will have a different definition of a photograph.  The only thing we collect is a photograph.  We do not distinguish it as biometric data.  While there are different definitions, our definition of biometric data does not include a photograph.</p></speech>

I apologise.  For many pensions, 40 years is the norm and the number which will be required as part of the total contributions approach, TCA, 2012 revisions when the legislation is passed for those affected by the 2012 rate band.  The Senator is aware that class S contributions were only introduced in 1988.  That will make it challenging for many self-employed persons to qualify for a full pension in 2020 if the number of contributions at the time exceeded 32.  We are not yet wedded to an outcome.  I know that people have made up their minds that we are absolutely wedded to something at the end of the public consultation process.  We are not, which is why we had a public consultation process.  We received in excess of 300 quality submissions, which is great.  Arising from the submissions, we will have a new proposition later for us on which to agree.  I hope we will collectively pass legislation.</p></speech>

While we are not wedded to the outcome, the report was only part of the public consultation process.  It certainly was not the agreed endgame.  We are in consultations on the design of the TCA, which is probably the most important thing, other than the principle of the policy, which we will determine in the next couple of months.  What is most important for me is that people get out of the system what they pay into it, while recognising its value and contribution.  People are living and working for longer.  At the end of the process, we will have a system that I hope everybody will buy into, acknowledging that it is the best and most robust system that will be sustained for generations to come.</p></speech>

Experience from 2010 and 2011 tells us that it cannot always be assured.  I understand the Minister may not be able to impart an answer to the committee today, which I understand in the context of the pre-budget discussions that she will be having with ministerial colleagues.  Has she decided the rate at which the bonus will be paid this year, now that she has confirmed that it will be paid?  I accept that she understands how important it is.  I understand and assure her that I understand how important it is, through direct personal experience.  I was a little confused by the vagueness of the language used in the Minister's contribution yesterday.  Two journalists contacted me yesterday evening about references made to the Christmas bonus in the Minister's submission.  She may or may not accept that the language used is vague, that it allows people to draw certain conclusions that she tells that me cannot be drawn, but I am glad that she has clarified that the Christmas bonus will be paid.  That will be reassuring to the 1.2 million people who will depend on it to lighten the load this Christmas.  If the Minister has an issue with how the headline is written - I do not write them, nor does she - I am sure she can contact the editor or the journalist concerned to have that argument with him or her.  She has known me for long enough to know that I do not pursue cheap headlines.  I am a legislator who takes his policy responsibilities very seriously.</p></speech>

I have explained it to her and she can accept it or not.  It is entirely up to her.  We should all be about trying to represent the interests of all citizens, particularly those who depend on the State for their income.  I am glad that the Minister has confirmed that the Christmas bonus will be paid.</p> <p>  On other items of expenditure, expenditure on paternity benefit is &euro;1.9 million behind profile.  The Department was probably anticipating that approximately 290 more people would benefit from this payment.  Has the Minister a sense of why everybody who is entitled to the benefit is not accessing it?  Does the Department have additional plans to promote the scheme or increase the payment rates?  It is important that the large number of people who qualify for the scheme access and benefit from it because it is a very good scheme which, I think the Minister will agree, should be built on in the next period.  I expect to see that happen.</p> <p>  With regard to the PRSI step effect, in the context of successive Low Pay Commission reports, I imagine that the Government will accept the report of the Low Pay Commission and do what is necessary in the budgetary discussions in the next couple of weeks.</p><p> There is a PRSI step effect when the national minimum wage increases, and there is the potential for national minimum wage increases to precipitate additional employer PRSI responsibilities and obligations.  This adds to the cost of hiring people, and this is something that the Low Pay Commission has warned about time and again.  The PRSI step effect has been addressed in previous budgets to ensure that employers are encouraged to continue employing, that costs are not excessively burdensome and that the increase in the national minimum wage goes where it needs to, namely into the pockets of the lowest paid workers in the country.  Perhaps the Minister might give me her thoughts on how that PRSI step effect could be addressed in the long term and whether she has done any analysis on this matter to date.</p><p> With regard to the question of lone parents, a major mistake was made in some of the reforms introduced back in 2012.  This needs to be addressed, and in truth these reforms never achieved the original stated ambitions outlined at the time.  This needs to be acknowledged and fixed.  The recent ESRI study confirms that, by and large, the original objectives of the reform programme were not achieved.  I understand and accept that.  We need to work collectively to try to address those issues.  The Labour Party's alternative budget proposals will bring forward some proposals to address many of the shortcomings, as we see them, along with what we can learn from the kind of situation we should provide for some of the most marginalised families in this country.</p><p> I very much support and acknowledge the Minister's work on this and her personal commitment to this area.  This committee will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting any budget proposals she might bring forward to address some of the very apparent gaps and deficits in the system.</p><p> I support the work carried out in recent years by my colleague, Senator Ray Butler, in highlighting anomalies in the system affecting the self-employed.  I know that the Minister has committed personally to trying to address these anomalies.  The process of providing some benefits through the PRSI system to the self-employed was started by my colleague, Deputy Burton, continued by our current Taoiseach when he was Minister for Social Protection, and then advanced further by the Minister herself in the form of the treatment benefit schemes now available.  All of this comes at a cost, , and this needs to be looked at within a wider review of the PRSI system and how much we pay for social insurance in this country.</p><p> There should be a wider awareness of the kinds of payments and supports that citizens of this country manage to access through PRSI and tax.  As Senator Higgins said, a social protection system is about investing in the social fabric of our State.  It is not just about supporting those who may be out of work or unable to work for a short time because of illness.  It is a matter of ensuring that we have a floor beneath which nobody should be allowed to fall, and it is a matter of a decent society.  I know that the Minister understands and accepts that, and she has demonstrated as much in some of the decisions she has taken.  One way of convincing people of the merits and value of the system is to provide them with more information about the benefits they will get from it.  There is a lesson for all of us in public life when it comes to how we do that and why.</p></speech>

I will say two things.  It is a fact that the birth rate is down this year on last year, so both maternity and paternity payments are down.  Paternity leave is a new scheme.  Given that in most, though not all, houses the man earns more than the woman, a work-in-progress issue that we will have to address over the coming years, taking paternity leave has a cost implication for certain families and that is why some men are not taking it up.  A tremendous number of men are, however, and a total of 46,800 paternity benefits were paid up until the end of July 2018.  We advertised the campaign last year and the year before and we will re-advertise it this year because the Senator is right in saying that not everyone knows of everything that is available to them on the back of their social insurance contributions.  We need to continue to recognise and support men to stay home with their children during the first 12 months of those children's lives, and the only way we can do that is to try to extol to them the benefits of doing so.  Every woman knows this and 46,800 men know this too.  We need to keep going until we reach an equal rate, within a few percentage points, of people taking maternity and paternity leave.  Rates of maternity leave are at about 70% uptake and very few women in the country do not take it.  We need to achieve equality over sexism and we will keep working towards this.</p> <p>  I am very pleased to hear Senator Nash talk about the Low Pay Commission in such positive terms and he is obviously back in favour of the commission's recommendations.  The increase in low pay last year did cause a step effect, which we addressed in last year's budget.  I anticipate that we will do the same in this year's budget, negotiations notwithstanding.  It would be nice, however, if we had parity and if we did not have to pick and choose which of the commission's recommendations to accept.</p> <p>  The Senator raised the issue of lone parents.  We spend a lot of time at this committee talking about supports for lone parents and about the struggles they face because of being alone and because of the stigma surrounding mothers raising their children alone.  This is a matter of which I am particularly conscious and that I am especially keen to address.  Not only did I start last year to reverse the cuts that were by made by the Senator's colleague, Deputy Burton, in 2012, and I very much anticipate that we will continue to do so over the next few years until the reversion of those cuts is complete, but I am also adamant that the historical stigma and misogyny surrounding this issue in society will continue to be broken down by people like the Senator and me and by others at this committee.  Such stigma is diminishing but not quickly enough.  If we do not break it down, then we will do a huge disservice to the new types of family that are not yet recognised in our Constitution but which it is hoped will be in the very near future.  It is difficult to raise children on one's own and it is doubly difficult when one has to deal with the stigma still attached to single parents in this country.</p> <p>  Like others around this table, I will do as much as I can to ensure that this stigma is diminished, not just through policy but also through walking the walk as well as talking the talk when it comes to what is required to assist women, in particular, in lone parent families to make sure that they get the education, support, childcare and housing that they require and that should be acceded to by this State.  This is so that they can find decent careers for the rest of their lives rather than having to work in a low pay sector, which is what we seem to have accepted over recent years as being the best that they can get.</p> <p>  I do not know if Senator Nash was here when Senator Butler raised the possibility of a campaign to make people aware of their social insurance entitlements.  This would be a good idea.</p> <p>  Whenever I come before this committee, particularly to address either Revised Estimates or budget conversations, I always open my speech with a reminder to the members of how big a spend the Department has and what it is that we spend it on.  I do not even need to tell the members this as they already know.  They can be sure, however, that there is a view in society that the vast bulk of the money spent by the Department goes to jobseekers and those who are unemployed.  This is far from the truth.  It would be valuable for us to recognise and to inform people of the solidarity that we extend on their behalf to citizens at various stages of their lives.  The numbers of unemployed are dropping drastically, so the budget for them is dropping drastically too and is nowhere close to where people's expectations might be.  When people hear that we have a budget of &euro;20 million, they think that the vast bulk of that is spent on jobseekers, and this is a stigma and a white elephant that also needs to be broken down.  I take Senator Nash's point on board and I will consider very carefully how we could best impart that information in the most cost-effective way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.1070" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2018092500002#O00100"><p>I thank the Minister for what is a carefully crafted document.  She does not give away too much and obviously has stuff up her sleeve.  I congratulate the women and men who campaigned to have the measure regarding pensions reversed.  In an extraordinary moment, the Minister took the megaphone from me outside the D&aacute;il to address the crowd when she was first made Minister, and it was a welcome thing to do.  She stuck to her word and began to reverse this terrible, discriminatory cut.  It was a clear case of discrimination.</p> <p>  Can the Minister say again when the legislation will be passed?  On what date will the payments be made?  Has any audit been done by the Department on the negative impact that may result for a certain cohort of people as a consequence of this, particularly after 40 years?  There are already some pensioners who are saying they will suffer as a result.  These are not homemakers but others.  If the Department has done an audit on this issue, can I ask that it release it to us?  I thank Senator Higgins for saying we had an obscene tax break of &euro;2 billion for private pensions but that we had become worried about the few bits and pieces we were going to give back in social protection.  The social welfare system addresses the question of solidarity but the imbalances and the naked preference of one over another are quite something.</p> <p>  The question of fuel poverty is not unrelated to pensioners.  The Minister might remember a kerfuffle in the D&aacute;il last year, during an extreme weather event, over the question of ensuring that another month's fuel payment was given to everybody, following which councils were instructed to leave the heating on in apartment blocks that housed older persons.  We will see much more of this in the future and I would bet my house that we will see more and more extreme weather events throughout our winters.  Fuel poverty is a huge issue.  A recent MABS study in Ballyfermot showed that one quarter of all households suffered from fuel poverty, which is a very high figure.  There have been increases in gas and electricity prices and the retrofitting of homes is taking place slowly.  It is happening and attics are being insulated but it is not being done quickly enough and there is not enough focus on it.  As the weather gets colder and weather events get more extreme, people have to spend a huge amount of their income to stay warm.  They make choices between staying warm and cooking hot meals.  Climate change will impact on old people and we need to show solidarity with those who suffer fuel poverty.</p> <p>  The information about the live register caught my eye immediately.  It is good news that another 40,000 people left the live register last year, and a total of 80,000 over the past two years.  It must be asked, however, what kind of jobs these people are going into.  Other studies, for example by unions and Social Justice Ireland, show an increase in low pay and low hours, which means people leave the live register but are not able to cope with what they have.  The Minister does not mention any comparator between the return of people to work and the impact on the working family payment, which used to be the family income supplement, FIS.  In my view, many are returning to low-paid, low-hours work.  The issue of employment rights is now going to be fully part of this committee and I am delighted about that because it makes sense.  There are lots of employers that do not give employees the full 19 hours which would allow them to benefit from the working family payment so we will find a cohort of people who will fall short of being able to claim the payment.  We need figures showing how many workers who leave the live register fall short of being able to claim the working family payment.  This would apply to a lot of women in the hospitality sector, the food industry etc., many of whom are lone parents.  Is there a way that we could assess individual cases where employers refuse to give the 19 hours for family income support payments?</p> <p>  The Minister said it was not acceptable to wait 18 weeks for a carers allowance application.  That is four and a half months and it is a long time to wait.  I find that there seems to be an almost automatic refusal when an answer does come, often accompanied by advice to the effect that an applicant can appeal.  The appeal process takes even longer.  What do departmental officials say about that?  What is the rate of refusal?  In my clinics, I see evidence of a very high refusal rate for carers and an attempt to put them into a long appeal process.  Can the Minister comment on that?</p> <p>  In regard to lone parents, the Minister spoke about the universality of child benefit.  This universality should not be touched but there are extra costs in rearing a teenager.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice stated that it cost &euro;46.65 extra per week and I am sure those who came up with the figure did not just suck their thumbs and produce it.  It costs nearly &euro;50 per week more to rear a teenager than to rear a young child but this is not taken into account.  I accept the universality of the payment and the benefit of that.  Is there no mechanism, however, to means-test an extra payment for children aged over 12?  It might focus on lone parents who might need an extra few bob.  Somebody on ministerial pay would not need the extra money.  The Minister's teenage kids are happy teenagers and do not need it but many lone parents do need it.  Is there a way she could look at means testing in this area?  To do so would acknowledge the science which finds that it costs more to rear teenagers.  Can the Minister look at giving child benefit not just up to the age of 18 but up to when children complete their leaving certificate?  A lot of kids turn 18 in November or December but do not do their leaving certificate until the following June.  That hits a lot of women and families I know and I have been asked to raise it.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the fact that, as the Minister said, she raised the income disregard again last year.  However, it is still much lower than it was in 1997, when it was at IR&pound;115, which equates to &euro;146.50.  What a shame that, in the 21st century, we are keeping something that addresses the poverty of children at so low a level.  Would the Minister favour getting rid of the income disregard in its entirety?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has said he is considering getting rid of FEMPI. </p></speech>

He refers to a penalty but we call it a discount.  An 8% discount is applied to all fees paid from April to December 2017.  The Department has recently applied discounts to both contractors, in the range provided for in the contracts, on all fees payable in 2018.</p><p>In addition, the Department assesses performance primarily using a quantitative assessment of the performance levels achieved versus the performance bid.  The results of audits, inspections and client feedback, as measured through the client surveys, are also taken into account.  This answers question about penalties.</p></speech>

The discount rate applies to the number of people going forward on the live register as opposed to going backwards so they are paid in the subsequent calendar year.  The 8% discount was applied to all fees.  That was for April to December last year.  We recently applied for the discount for this year.</p> <p>  My apologies for being so rude to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  I have a document.  Given that the Deputy only has a few minutes, I do not know whether she wants me to read it out.  Alternatively, I can just give it to her.  It details the process for the T12, which involves the ladies and gentlemen who will get their money back on foot of the legislation we will pass.  We are in the process of recruiting.  We need extra staff in one of our offices to look after all of these new applications.  This recruitment will be completed by the end of this month.  In early October, having recruited the additional temporary resources, we will engage in an in-house examination of 76,000 social insurance records.  This will take a couple of months.  At the end of that process, we will be able to tell each of those 76,000 people that they would have got &euro;10 under the old system but that they are entitled to &euro;12 under the new system, and that they can choose between the two.  The Deputy's concern, which was raised on behalf of people who have spoken to her about it, that somebody might lose out will not become a reality because the person will decide whether or not they stay on &euro;10 or move to &euro;11.  People who are on &euro;10 and get moved to &euro;9 will get the opportunity to remain on the &euro;10 payment if they want.  This means that nobody will lose out as a result of the changes we are making.  People will only opt to move to an increased payment.  They will certainly not opt to move to a reduced payment.</p> <p>  Initially, I would have thought that we would have introduced the legislation that is required to fix this anomaly in the social welfare Bill.  It may not be part of the Bill; it might be easier to do it on a stand-alone basis.  We are deliberating on that but either a small part of the social welfare Bill will deal with this issue or a small, stand-alone Bill will be introduced between now and the end of the year to ensure that we get ready to start making those payments at the beginning of next year.  The payments will be backdated to March of this year.  This is a three-page explanation, a copy of which I will forward to the Deputy later so that she will have it for her records.</p></speech>

It involves the timelines around the T12 project.  I might have mentioned them already but I will provide them in written form.  The audit has not been conducted with regard to that because there is no need.  I am making the assumption that nobody will choose to be on a lesser payment than their current payment.  People will only opt to move to a more positive payment, therefore, the only impact will be positive.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the imbalance on the basis of private pensions being able to avail of tax relief to the tune of &euro;2.6 billion.  I will address that imbalance by introducing automatic enrolment.  Under the Strawman proposal, someone would get a 33% incentive as opposed to the 20% or 40% incentives that currently obtain in respect of private pensions.  It is not an end game.  What that actual system will look like has not been determined or decided.  When the public consultation is concluded at the end of November, we will collectively decide what that new pension system and savings scheme will look like for the future pensioners of Ireland.  It is the only way in which I can address the imbalance because 65% of people currently working in Ireland will have no income other than the State pension when they reach 66 or 67 depending on when they retire.  While we have agreed in the pensions roadmap that this pension will never drop below 34% of the average mean income in Ireland, I know that in many cases, people who have not planned for their pension and only have that find a huge cliff in terms of a drop in earnings in terms of what they previously enjoyed in their working career compared to what they might enjoy in pensionable age if they have not put aside some other form of savings.  That is how we will address that imbalance.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy with regard to what we could expect as unforeseen or extreme weather incidents.  It is nearly the case that they are no longer unforeseen because we all expect them.  There is a definite shift and change in climate patterns in this country that we must acknowledge and prepare for but that is probably as much as I can say given the context of the discussions we are having.  I agree with the Deputy that we should prepare for other extreme weather events, particularly in the context of vulnerable people about whom, in comparison with other households, we must think outside the box.</p> <p>  The 40,000 new jobs that have come on stream in the past year are not a true reflection of the number of jobs that were created.  Although the number on the live register has dropped by 40,000 since this time last year, 74,000 new jobs have actually been created.  Obviously, one can assume that either some people are returning to Ireland, which is great, while others might not have been on the live register because they might have been qualified adults or have been in college are taking up those new jobs.  Our job is to make sure that the employment rights legislation we passed through the House goes to the Seanad and is passed as quickly as possible notwithstanding the body of work that must be done for the self-employed contractors and business to make sure those rights are enshrined so that low pay, low hours and the precarious nature of work are not flaunted by the very small number of employers that we know do it.  In the main, those most affected are the people on the minimum wage who are in the most precarious positions in their economic life, for want of a better term, and undertake those kind of jobs.  Once that legislation is passed, in the vast majority of cases, zero-hour contracts will be banned.  The bands of dedicated contracts on which people are put must reflect the actuality of their services for the previous 18 months.  All of this will come into play as soon as we pass the legislation, which I hope will be sooner rather than later.  Far more jobs are being created.  IDA Ireland and the CSO inform us that they are good-quality and well-paid jobs and not, in the main, in the low-paid sector to which the Deputy referred.  However, we need the legislation in order to ensure that people who are on the minimum wage not only get the supports from the State that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection can offer them but also the employment rights equal to those enjoyed by people working for a large multinational or a large Irish corporation.</p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is under the impression that people who apply for carer's allowance are told "No" and must then appeal.  Only 1% of applications are appealed.  We will provide her with the numbers so we can prove it is not anecdotal.  A tiny number of people must appeal.  I will confirm that so the Deputy should not take that as gospel.  That is only a recollection-----</p></speech>

I also acknowledge that when people do appeal, they may have to wait another 12, 14 or 16 weeks but it is because of the complexity of the application in the first instance.  This is why we not only move staff around to try to reduce those working weeks turnaround, we are going to improve the application process to make it easier for people to give more accurate information in the first instance in the same way as we did with the domiciliary care allowance.  The changing of the form has had a huge impact so we are going to do for carers.</p></speech>

I am well aware that if I was to unravel them, I would need to bring it back up to &euro;146, which is what it was.  As already stated, it would probably be premature to say anything given that I am in negotiations for the budget but I think she knows where my head is at with regard to that and I will keep working on it.</p> <p>  As I mentioned to Deputy Brady earlier, the children's allowance is a universal payment.  If we were to change it to extend it to people who are in full-time primary education regardless of their age until they do their leaving certificate, first of all, there would be a sizeable amount of money associated with that.  Second, it would not-----</p></speech>

It is not small beans.  It would cost tens of millions to ensure that everybody who stays in school until their leaving certificate regardless of their age got a children's allowance payment.  It would increase that expenditure by tens of millions.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith rightly pointed that out that if my children were 18 and still in school, I should not get that extension.  The Deputy asked me whether we could find a way of means testing for the most vulnerable families who need that money.</p><p>The means-tested payment is the qualified child payment that is made on a weekly basis to those who have no income other than what they get in State supports or their part-time jobs, whether they receive the working family payment or not.  That is the way we as a State target the funding that we have to ensure those families who need it most get it, not by extending a universal payment to those who might not need it just for the sake of keeping the universality of the payment.  That is only my opinion.  That is just the way I feel.  I think we have too many children living in consistent poverty.</p><p> When I look disappointedly - this is probably my own naivete - at the changes we made to last year's budgets which I know were only tiny, they only had an impact of bringing 0.3% of the children who were living in poverty out of poverty.  That tells me that we need billions of euros in direct transfers to bring the other 8.2% of children who are living in consistent poverty out of poverty.  The State's money is not best spent by giving it to those who do not necessarily need it.  We should support in a targeted fashion those who do need it.  That is why I would disagree with increasing the universal payment for everybody in school.</p></speech>

In fairness, everyone in this committee worked with the Minister as well in a constructive fashion.  It is nice to see that work is being implemented now and there is a timeframe around it, and there is certainty and that continues to happen.</p> <p>  In terms of the live register, it is remarkable that it continues to reduce at such a rate.  That is testament to the policies that have been introduced by successive Governments since the crash.</p> <p>  In terms of our success as well, many Irish people who emigrated at that time are coming home.  I am engaging with those people because they are encountering problems.  For example, there was a lady in my office the other day who came home to look after her mother.  She had been living in Dubai for a number of years.  Her Mam now is sick with cancer and she will be her carer.  The question of habitual residency will come in the way.  Obviously, she will apply for the payment and, hopefully, be her mother's carer.  There are so many other issues arising with the habitual residency clause, for example, trying to get a driving licence, if one is coming back from abroad.  It needs to be looked at, particularly as there is a shortage of skilled labour in this country.  Irish people face barriers coming home.  Maybe that is something the Minister would look at.</p> <p>  I would certainly support the issues raised by Senator Butler about the self-employed.  I recognise the work that has been done by the Minister, Deputy Doherty, and the former Minister, and now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, in terms of introducing supports for the self-employed.  I would encourage the Minister to continue that momentum into the forthcoming budget as well.</p> <p>  It was grossly irresponsible, in my view, for any journalist to take up a story on the Christmas bonus and I welcome the Minister's comments here today.  It is wrong that she had to make them.  There were calls to my office today about this issue and we should not have been in that position.  However, I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought certainty to that issue.</p> <p>  The Minister might try to address a few of those matters for me.</p></speech>

That was started, as the Chairman will be aware, with the invalidity pension and the extension of the treatment benefits last year.  It is not something that will be equalised in one, two or even three budgets.  It is a work in progress and we anticipate continuing to do that until there is parity of esteem, whether one is employed or self-employed, and the State recognises a self-employed person on equal terms.</p> <p>  The Chairman is correct that habitual residency is a governing rule for many of our schemes.  Maybe it causes issues.  The case the Chairman highlighted is probably a perfect case in point.  There are other issues for returning emigrants, for example, getting a driving licence.  It is like hens' teeth for them to get motor insurance having been out of the State for more than 30 days.  Accessing some of the schemes we have put in place for first-time buyers does not apply to them unless they have been here for the past number of years.  There are a couple of anomalies and they probably need to be addressed in the future because we want our Irish people back.  The circumstances the Chairman described of that young lady coming home are sad but we do want our Irish people back in the country, not only for their skills and their qualifications but because of the empathy and solidarity we feel as an Irish nation.  That is one of these areas where a number of Departments will have to come together to address the issues and there will be financial implications in the future.  I will bring that message to Cabinet.</p> <p>  On the pensions, I just got lucky.  I merely happened to be the person in the Department when the opportunity arose to fix it but there is not one of us here who did not receive representations.  It was in the main elderly women - my mother would kill me for saying "elderly".  These older women who were in the throes of retiring after 2002 were in every one of the constituency offices giving out about the changes that were made in 2012 and how they were directly impacted.  That is why it was the right thing for us all to do and why it was easy for me to go outside the D&aacute;il.  I remember the day they were protesting.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith was slagging me because she thought no Minister ever came out previously in the middle of a protest.  This protest was not against me.  It was against something that was done in 2012.  We all recognised it was wrong.  We all collectively fixed it.  It is done now, thankfully, and hopefully, we will not ever have to do it again.  In any case, I thank the Chairman for the compliment.</p></speech>

In my constituency, there are problems with what the local authority deems as income.  For example, with carers, child maintenance - which is really a payment for the child and should not really be taken into consideration as household income - is taken into consideration in some local authorities.  I wanted to touch on that point.</p> <p>  The Minister answered some of the points on the fuel allowance.  I made some specific remarks on fuel poverty and the fuel allowance.  I hear what the Minister is saying.  She is looking at rowing back on some of the cuts that have been made in previous years.  Hopefully, the cuts in the number of weekly payments made in fuel allowance will be one of those changes.</p> <p>  I made a specific point around a dedicated automatic payment that kicks in.  Hopefully, that will be up for consideration.  The Minister might elaborate on that.</p></speech>

On the working family payment, carer's allowance and maintenance, all that is taken as income is income.  If somebody is on a carer's allowance, it is income into the family.  It is not - not to be disrespectful - special income.</p></speech>

There should not be an inconsistency between Bray and Ratoath.  I will come back to Deputy Brady on that one.</p> <p>  On the automatic payment, I do not know how we would have an automatic payment because we have a system that pays a person, either on a weekly basis or in two lump sums.  It is an IT system.  The IT system only gets changed quarterly which is why - I do not know whether the Deputy recalls - the debacle last year was that when we decided to make the payment everybody said that we only made it because we were shamed into making it.  The only reason that we had to delay the payment announcement was because we did not know whether we could interfere with the IT system to the hundreds of thousands of people who get fuel allowance.  People will dismiss that and say I am full of talk.  However, it is an IT system and it does not get interfered with, and I do not know how we would make an automatic payment for an unforeseen event.  I do not know how one would know that we will get snow in February.  All I know is that if people need help, that is what we are here for.</p></speech>

I am sure they use computers over there.  They have all the systems we have here and set criteria are laid out.  I ask that something similar be looked at here, that after three or four consecutive weeks-----</p></speech>

I do not know how it was done because I know how difficult it was for us to do it.  After the snow it took a number of weeks for us to ensure that the payments got to people because our IT system is unique, perhaps, or special.  Again, I do not think it needs to be automated either because if there is snow and adverse conditions, we will ensure we look after people.  I will look into the system.</p></speech>
