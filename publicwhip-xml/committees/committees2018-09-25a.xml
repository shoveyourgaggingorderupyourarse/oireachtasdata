    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#C00500"><p>We have a quorum and are now in public session.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We will take the business of the committee as normal on Thursday next.  Today we will be dealing with the 2016 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts, Vote 1 - President's Establishment.  We will also have an update on the 2017 position.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach who is the Accounting Officer for the Vote relating to the President's Establishment.  I thank him making himself available, especially as I understand he had an accident.  His arm is in a sling and he is somewhat incapacitated.  We wish him a speedy recovery.</p><p>I draw the committee's attention to some distinctions relating to Vote 1.  First, while Mr. Fraser is the Accounting Officer for Vote 1, he does not have operational responsibility for the Office of the President.  Second, our examination will be carried out in a way that respects the constitutional independence of the Office of the President, as per Article 13.8.1 of the Constitution which states, &quot;The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas or to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.&quot;  I know members appreciate this point.</p><p>As Chairman, I want to put the purpose and timing of this particular meeting in context.  An Taoiseach discusses the Estimates and related information for Vote 1 before a select committee of the D&aacute;il every year.  The related appropriation account is voted on in the D&aacute;il at the end of each year.  The actual appropriation accounts for 2017, which include Vote 1, the President's Establishment will be published by the Comptroller and Auditor General on Friday next, 28 September.  The Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform will publish the 2019 abridged Estimates for Vote 1, the President's Establishment, as part of his Budget Statement on 9 October.  Our role as the Committee of Public Accounts is to complete the cycle by examining the allocation of moneys to the President's Establishment and how they were spent and to look at the governance and oversight measures adopted by the Accounting Officer relating to that expenditure.</p><p>Regarding the timing of this meeting, certain questions regarding the President's Establishment were raised over the summer months.  The first opportunity this committee had to discuss these was on Thursday last.  As already stated, this committee has a clear role in respect of the examination of all voted expenditure.  However, I was concerned that we would do so in a way that is respectful of the upcoming election process.  As a result, I proposed - and the committee agreed - that this examination should take place at the earliest opportunity and in advance of the closing date for nominations, which is tomorrow.  Unfortunately, it was not feasible to hold this meeting any earlier and I wanted to put that on the record.</p><p>Before we begin, I want to summarise guidance for members because of the unique nature of this particular Vote.  Objective questions relating to oversight and control of moneys allocated to or for the benefit of the President's Establishment are obviously in order.  Detailed questions relating to expenditure that would, of their nature, potentially concern decisions or actions of the President are not in order.  For other matters, I will carefully weigh up the question asked before deciding whether a particular matter is in order.  We expect to get answers to all of our questions today.  However, any matters that are not clarified will be dealt with at a later date.  I ask for full co-operation from all members in this regard.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off.  I wish to advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.9" nospeaker="true" time="10:00:00" ><p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect the witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to make the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement.</p></speech>

The 2016 Appropriation Account for Vote 1, President's Establishment, shows gross expenditure of &euro;3.6 million.  Expenditure in relation to the centenarian's bounty scheme accounted for &euro;1.15 million, with the balance relating to other expenses of the President's Establishment.  The amount provided in the Estimate for 2016 was &euro;3.9 million.  After receipts for the year of &euro;84,000 were taken into account, a surplus of &euro;287,000 was surrendered.  There were no matters arising from the audit of the Vote for the President's Establishment that I considered warranted reporting.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. Fraser to make his opening remarks and note that he has not sent a pre-scripted opening statement.</p></speech>

I apologise for that.  I do not have much to add to what the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.  The spend of &euro;3.6 million in 2016 is set out in the account in a lot of detail.  There is only one non-office expenditure, the centenarian's bounty, which is the amount paid to people on reaching 100 years, in the country each year.  My position is a little bit different in respect of Vote 1 in that I do not have any executive authority over the Office of the President, for obvious reasons.</p> <p>  Broadly speaking, in 2017 the spend is again approximately &euro;3.7 million and that was again within budget, but the account has not been published yet.  As I stated in my letter, I rely in the main on the Comptroller and Auditor General for assurance on the accounts, and he has found no problems.  That is all I have to say in the way of an opening statement.</p></speech>

He will be free to answer questions in so far as the Constitution permits.  As it is a special meeting members have indicated the sequence in which they wish to speak.  It has been agreed that each member will have a ten-minute slot and if people want to come back a second time they can do so.  Members have indicated in the following sequence: Deputies Bobby Aylward, Alan Farrell, Catherine Connolly, Shane Cassells, David Cullinane and Catherine Murphy.  Deputy Alan Kelly is next and we will see what happens after that.  Deputy Aylward has ten minutes and because of the nature of the meeting I ask members to strictly adhere to the ten minute time slot.</p></speech>

When there is a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General our remit is to scrutinise the Vote and to make sure there is value for money for the taxpayers of this country who pay to keep the system in place.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said &euro;3.6 million was the overall amount spent in 2016.  In one of last Sunday's newspapers I read there had been a cost of &euro;50 million.  I do not know where that amount came from.  That would be &euro;7 million a year.  Where did such a figure come from or how did anyone come up with the amount?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#D00700"><p>Could the Deputy clarify the figure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#D00800"><p>I read in a newspaper that since 2011 a total of &euro;50 million was spent on the Presidency.  I am just asking Mr. Fraser or Mr. McCarthy to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#D00900"><p>I did not see the article on Sunday.  I imagine the calculation is based on aggregating the figures from the operating costs statement of the account.  That statement tries to get the full costs associated with a service and so it brings in expenses that are borne on other Votes for which other Accounting Officers are responsible and includes them in the operating costs statement.  If we go to page 7 of the Appropriation Account we will see a figure in 2016 of &euro;8.2 million, and at the bottom of the page there is a breakdown.  The net allied services figure is &euro;4.6 million and the breakdown of it is given there.</p><p>It indicates the other Votes and the Central Fund as being the sources.</p></speech>

There are other costs from the Garda, security, the Army and so forth.</p></speech>

It was &euro;2.4 million in 2016.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#E00600"><p>Is the &euro;3.6 million a true reflection, therefore, of the costs of having the Presidency in place, or could it be more than &euro;7 million?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-25a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092500002#E00700"><p>The point of the operating costs statement is to try to get the full costs of the service.  The Vote is specifically for office expenses and the centenarian bounty, as I have said.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Fraser happy with the procedure and the governance of the moneys that are spent?  He is the Accounting Officer and he must stand over this each year.  Is he happy with the way it is spent and distributed?  Is he happy with all the procedures that are in place?</p></speech>

If the Deputy is asking whether I am happy with the financial management, controls and oversight, I am.  My main assurance comes from the clean audit reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

If Mr. Fraser believed there was an overspend or money was being spent unnecessarily, if there was extravagance or whatever else one might call it, who has control or the authority to check that and call it in?  Can that happen and is it scrutinised to keep it under control in order that there is value for money in what is spent?</p></speech>

If there was any sense that the proper procedures were not being followed in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, that would be picked up either under internal audit in the future or by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

Who decides who goes where?  Who in the President's office decides who goes where, what hotels are used and what travel arrangements there are?</p></speech>

I can help somewhat.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade makes most of the travel arrangements but I cannot get into who in the President's office makes decisions.</p></speech>

I am following the money, which is our job.  I am asking a straight question and I do not want to overstep any mark or make any accusation.  All I am asking is whether we are getting value for money on all aspects of the spend on Vote 1, the President's Establishment.  That is what I am trying to get at.

If there was a state visit, and I am not talking about the incumbent but rather any President here, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would make the travel arrangements in the host country.  While it has its own procedures, broadly speaking it is interested in logistics, security, location, whether a venue is suitable and so on.  Regarding the Deputy's general point, it is the responsibility of the people in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, and to a lesser extent in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I get assurance from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If he saw anywhere where procedure was not being followed, he would highlight it.</p></speech>

One thing about an appropriation account is that there must be no overspending.  That is the priority.  One is always aiming to come in under the budget provided.  The 10% underspend is about what is usual on the President's Establishment Vote and it is not out of line with spending for similar small offices or Departments.</p></speech>

Let me put it as follows.  If I received an internal audit report or management letter or audit report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which gave rise to concern, I would have to take it up with staff in the Office of the President because that is my responsibility.  However, I would not seek to intervene in the operations of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  As I am sure people understand, the relationships between the Government and the President and the Oireachtas and the President are very delicate.  As such, it would be with the greatest reluctance that I would intervene in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  However, if a financial issue of the kind which would interest the committee arose, I would have to ask questions of the people in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and hope to have it fixed.

The third point was that there is a very profound constitutional issue which everyone accepts here.  The fourth point was that I was worried about political impartiality in the context of an election campaign, as I am in any other situation.  Finally, I made the point that the President is, of course, open to scrutiny and will be in the election campaign.  I felt they were important points to make.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Fraser.  I will comment briefly on the decision to hold this meeting.  I was not present at the previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts when the decision was made to have this hearing.  Had I been present, I would have said that it stinks for us to make a decision to look at presidential expenditure the day before the closing date for nominations for the Presidency and the election.  That said, the decision has been made democratically and I respect that.</p> <p>  From a procedural perspective, I note the references to the audit committee's chair being absent in 2016 and for a period of 22 weeks from the date on which the accounts were to be filed to the actual date of the filing of the accounts.  Will Mr. McCarthy comment on those two issues?</p></speech>

I did get what the Accounting Officer was required to do.</p></speech>

I get management letters from the Comptroller and Auditor General at quite a level of detail.  I am obviously an Accounting Officer for the Taoiseach's Department, another small enough organisation.  Nonetheless, I am very familiar with the procedures.  I was a finance officer and set up the audit committee in the Taoiseach's Department, as well as in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  I am very familiar with all of these themes.  In fact I wrote a thesis on value for money if the Deputy really wants to get bored.</p> <p>  I was happy that I was getting clean audit reports and reasonable management letters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's team in the &Aacute;ras.  That gave me the assurance.  Indeed, the committee has the same assurance from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There were particular circumstances, which were not ideal but, I am afraid, were rather sensitive.  I just felt it is not appropriate to go into them.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McCarthy.  As has already been acknowledged, I acknowledge that opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General is that the Appropriation Account properly presents the receipts and expenditure of 2016, with adequate accounting records and so on.  I accept that.  I am looking at the controls and processes in place.  That is all we are looking at in this committee.  Let us look at the audit committee which Mr. Fraser set up in spring 2014 for the first time ever.  Talk to me a little bit about an internal audit.</p></speech>

I have to mention something positive.  When I look back on the appropriation accounts for all of the years, there was very little information prior to Mr. Fraser's time, so it gradually improved in terms of what is written down.  On 23 March 2016, he talks about periodic reviews and states that the internal audit function and its programme are subject to periodic reviews.  The previous year he said exactly the same thing.  Did he carry out periodic reviews?</p></speech>

I want to touch on expanding on the net programme costs of the Presidency and the true reflection of the course born.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's short opening statement refers to the appropriation accounts and gross expenditure of &euro;3.6 million but, as has been pointed out by Mr. McCarthy himself, when one goes to page 7 of the appropriation accounts, the net programme cost is &euro;8.1 million.  We therefore have this direct expenditure of &euro;3.5 million and then these net allied services at a cost of over &euro;4.5 million.  This reminds me a little of when we were trying to get to the bottom of the accounts for local government.  Obviously, the net allied costs are quite significant, even more so when one discounts what is paid in terms of the centenary and the bounty.  Then the President's Establishment is only &euro;2.4 million, yet the net allied costs are &euro;4.6 million.  In order that I understand this, how does the Office of the President make those demands, whether it be the office of the Minister for Justice and Equality, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW or the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for defence?  There are half a dozen different departments there.  As has been pointed out, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW went from &euro;2 million in the 2015 accounts to nearly &euro;2.5 million in 2016.</p><p>In the overall context of these accounts, that was a significant amount.  The OPW's figure is now as much as that relating to the President's Establishment, which comes in at &euro;2.4 million.  Expenditure under Vote 36 - Defence went from &euro;408,000 to &euro;431,000.  How does this work?  Are demands made by the Office of the President for X, Y and Z needs to be met and various Departments then make the requisite appropriations to meet them?</p></speech>

The Constitution actually requires the President to live in an official residence.  The &Aacute;ras does not place a demand for the accommodation to be provided.  Rather, the Constitution makes the demand.</p></speech>

Cumulative expenses of &euro;4.6 million are not falling directly under the Office of the President but are being spent on that office.

Is it the case that the Garda Commissioner would, for example, consider last week's situation of someone going straight through the gates and saying "Hello" to the President and decide that the security arrangements at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in need to be reviewed and allowances need to be made for increasing the security detail?

There is &euro;4.6 million being spent on the President's Establishment by other Departments and it is not coming from its Vote.  In order to examine it, we would have to spend days in having the individual Accounting Officers come and asking them what they are doing in terms of spending on the President's Establishment.  By the way, if they are accountable, that is what we will end up doing.  People can answer these questions because the money is coming from different Departments.  It does not come under the auspices of the President's Establishment at all.  For example, the Department of Defence went from spending a sum of &euro;408,000 to &euro;431,000.  What was the purpose of the additional expenditure?  Was the increase initiated by the Department of Defence or the Office of the President?  I think I have put that question in a compact fashion.</p></speech>

That goes to the root of the issue in this interaction.  Moneys are being spent on the President's Establishment that do not come within the remit of the supposed Accounting Officer but cumulatively the cost is very big.  As Deputy Bobby Aylward said, they give a proper and true reflection of the cost of the Office of the President.  Perhaps I might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General about this in the light of his role in dealing with all of these Accounting Officers.  Is it the case that they are coming up with it themselves?  Are they saying they anticipate additional expenditure in these areas?  If there is to be some big event in a particular year and a Department has to allocate expenditure for it, I am sure the Office of the President has to alert the Department concerned to the need for additional expenditure, expenditure which does not come within the remit of the office but which it thinks the Department needs to put aside to cater for the event.  Does Mr. McCarthy understand the question?</p></speech>

In 2016 there were seven State visits approved by the Office of the President, although I think the number came in at nine in the end.  How does that work?  Is it the Office of the President that sets down the expenditure figure and how it will work or is it the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  I am trying to find out which Department is actually running the show.</p></speech>

Like every other office and Vote, there is an estimate of the cost for the year which is published in the Estimates.  As the Chairman pointed out, it is reviewed by the relevant committee of the House.  The Estimate is voted through and it is then for the Office of the President to expend the money granted to it.  It is very clear from the appropriation account - some things are self-evident - that it does it in conjunction with the OPW for the reasons I have outlined; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of security; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, mainly in respect of foreign travel; and the Department of Defence because there are five Defence Forces personnel stationed in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.</p></speech>

I am trying to get a feel for whether it is the individual Departments that make adjudications on the Office of the President or whether it is the office that makes requests of the individual Departments in terms of how the figure for expenditure anticipated for a coming year is arrived at.  Who is making the judgment call on how much it should cost and how much it will cost?</p></speech>

That is interesting.  I understand the constitutional position, but with regard to scrutiny or accountability of the spend, there is a block, or certainly a practice, that Mr. Fraser does not respond to freedom of information, FOI, requests from people outside the Oireachtas.  In the letter that Mr. Fraser sent to this committee he quite rightly pointed out that the President is not accountable to either House of the Oireachtas, which is fine.  What is the logic or the reason there is no response to FOI requests or a refusal to engage in that regard?  Is that something Mr. Fraser would respond to or is it something the &Aacute;ras would respond to?</p></speech>

I believe that government has felt the President should be separate to the normal run, and that is the policy.  There is also a fundamental constitutional issue, which is the article I mentioned in my letter, in that the President cannot be answerable to the Oireachtas or to the courts.  The freedom of information legislation ultimately leads to the courts.  That is the constitutional-----</p></speech>

I want to put on record that I think all public moneys should be subject to scrutiny.  I do think, however, that the timing of this is very unfortunate, to put a benign interpretation on it.  Once the writ was moved, I think we should have delayed this until after the presidential election.  So be it.  The committee has decided to have this hearing today.</p> <p>  There is quite a substantial difference between the Committee of Public Accounts and the freedom of information provisions in terms of the information that is forthcoming.  There may be an expectation that we are going to see a big box of receipts or something here today which, of course, is never the case.  There may be an expectation that we are going to be trawling through travel, accommodation and all that kind of stuff.  That expectation was never going to be realised.  That would never be the case with any organisation that we look at here.  We have a difficulty in portraying what the role of the Committee of Public Accounts is when we fall into that kind of situation.</p><p> I would like to explore slightly further the line of questioning Deputy Cullinane opened up regarding the Freedom of Information Act.  My memory of what happened with that Act is that most of the real focus related to whether freedom of information requests should be paid for as opposed to an emphasis on the various aspects that were excluded from the process, although some attention was paid to those.  Was Mr. Fraser asked for his opinion on whether the Office of the President should be excluded from the freedom of information process?  I presume all Departments would have been asked for an input.  Does Mr. Fraser recall being specifically asked about that and, if so, what was his response?</p></speech>

If one does not get it, one can appeal to the Information Commissioner and, ultimately, to the courts.  In that context, putting the Office of the President under the freedom of information legislation would include it in a process that could lead to the courts.  That would be, in my opinion, the difficulty.  I think it is a policy matter and that it should not arise in respect of the accounts.  I do not want to be unhelpful to the Deputy but I think that is a serious point.</p></speech>

I do not think that it is in respect of the general headings that possible concerns arise.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General had most of the responsibility for this in the absence of the audit committee.  I recognise that the audit committee was put in place on his insistence that it would happen, albeit that it did not function as it should.  In terms of his engagement with the &Aacute;ras, his office would have had full sight all of all of the documentation.  Would he have examined matters such as value for money or was the purpose just to reinforce that the audit was clear?  Has there been any issue highlighted over the years - whether during this or a previous Presidency - which has caused the Comptroller and Auditor General a difficulty?</p></speech>

It would not have mattered would was President at the time but the incumbent played a central role.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General aware whether the difference for 2016 relating to the Office of Public Works involved physical changes to the &Aacute;ras or would that all have been accounted for by virtue of the various additional activities in that year?</p></speech>

That is something the Deputy would have to get from the Accounting Officer for the Office of Public Works.  One thing the Deputy should bear in mind is that the expenditure is on a cash basis so if, for example, there were significant building works or adjustments made within a year, the full cost of that would be charged here.  We would not be looking at the depreciation figure or whatever.  There can be lumpy patterns in the spending because it is cash.  I know that a substantial part of that is the maintenance and upkeep of the buildings and the grounds of the &Aacute;ras.</p></speech>

There was a change from 2015 to 2016 in respect of expenditure by the National Shared Services Office.  Obviously, this is related to salaries.  Given that many, although not all, Departments and State organisations are covered by the National Shared Services Office, payroll is obviously the big ticket item.

I am not interested in whether the person was on holidays.  Deputy Connolly made the point very clearly earlier.  The fact is, when the chairman was missing the committee did not do anything for nearly three years.  Against the backdrop of the letter Mr. Fraser sent to the committee last week, that is a problem.  Like Deputy Murphy I take the view that, leaving aside the Constitution, all public money should be subject to scrutiny.</p> <p>  In terms of the expertise of the people on the audit committee, are they accountants?</p></speech>

Perhaps it is something the audit committee set up in 2016 can look at once it gets around to it in 2018 or 2019.  What procedures govern the expenditure or use of the sum of &euro;317,000?  Perhaps we could have an indication, staying within the bounds of the constitutional position, of what it has been used for in the last seven or, for that matter, ten or 20 years.  It seems bizarre that &euro;317,000 of public money is given to whomever on an annual basis, with no oversight or responsibility by anybody, while Mr. Fraser, as Accounting Officer, states to me that he presumes there are procedures in place that govern it in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and the Comptroller and Auditor General confirms that he does not audit it.

What statutory instrument it is, I do not care about.  The bottom line is that we have established that &euro;317,000 per year is paid to somebody and nobody has any interest in and oversight of what it is spent on.  That is significant.</p></speech>

Whoever was responsible at the time, we do not know on what the money was spent per year and still do not.  We want to get the procedures, albeit we know that the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach does not know and that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not responsible and does not know.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance also does not know or have a role in auditing that amount of money.  That is significant and if it is all we find out today, it is good work.</p></speech>

I mentioned the Office of Public Works, OPW, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all the people in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who incur costs in their Departments, borne by their Departments, but it is for the benefit of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  That is it in a nutshell.  The Comptroller and Auditor General records that in note 1.1 in his accounts.  That is in the Government accounting rules.  A memorandum the witnesses would have received relating to net allied services states, "Departments are required to include actual figures where possible rather than the previous practice of estimated expenditure."  It continues, "However, in addition, both the providers and receivers of allied services are reminded to ensure that for the 2017 account the allied services are still relevant and that the breakdown across Departments is provided using an up to date and reasonable method of calculation/apportionment."  What kind of assurances has Mr. Fraser received from, for example, the OPW, such that he is satisfied what it has listed under this &euro;2.4 million in 2016 was fair and reasonable?  What assurances has Mr. Fraser received from those Accounting Officers?  What is the system?</p></speech>

I looked at the &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in website last night.  It provides useful information about the items we are discussing.  There was a discussion about the shared services provided by the Office of Public Works.  It lists on its website the costs for last year of &euro;2.5 million.  It is on the website and I am sure that Mr. McCarthy will publish the figures on Friday with his appropriation account.  The OPW staff costs are listed as &euro;800,000.  The building work going on in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in cost &euro;261,000.  Electricity and gas cost &euro;182,000.  Property maintenance cost &euro;1.283 million.  &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in puts that information up itself.  It is a big figure and we do not have a breakdown here.  I want to be helpful to people who are watching by giving that breakdown which was received.  One other item is mentioned on the website.  It says the Central Fund of &euro;894,000 includes:</p><blockquote>- Costs not covered elsewhere in the Vote for the Presidential Establishment (eg. hospitality for 20,000 visitors, State Dinners, community events, etc.)<br /><br />- Pensions for former Presidents<br /><br />- President's salary</blockquote> <p>Mr. Fraser cannot answer this because he is not the Accounting Officer for the Central Fund.  Has Mr. McCarthy any information about how much of the &euro;894,000 related to pensions or hospitality?  Has he looked at that as part of the audit of the Central Fund?</p></speech>

On the allowance which was mentioned earlier and which is referred to under emoluments and allowances as part of the Central Fund payment, the &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in website states that there is - from the Central Fund - a payment in respect of hospitality for 20,000 visitors.  Perhaps there is a relationship, although I do not know.  Does Mr. Fraser know?  It might be helpful if someone knew.</p></speech>

That Central Fund figure of &euro;894,000 in the accounts includes the allowance and various other things, such as pensions and the President's salary.  I think some of that is used for entertainment for, as the &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in website says, 20,000 visitors a year, State dinners and so on.  However, the OPW also employs household staff.  This is because there are permanent staff in the &Aacute;ras who deal with catering and so on.  The OPW also probably meets expenses like equipment costs, etc.</p></speech>

Obviously, transparency is critical and there may be some information that has come out today that helps in regard to that.  I understand that this is the first time we have ever done this.  As regards future transparency, are there issues in respect of which Mr. Fraser feels improvements could be made?  We have many priorities on this committee across a range of issues and, obviously, if we want to discuss this Vote, we will make the decision to do so.  I am not saying that we will not do so.  From a transparency point of view, are there more changes or inclusions that can happen in regard to how this Vote is brought out to the public that would ensure we have more information so that, when it comes to looking at our priorities as a committee, we will be able to leverage that and use it to identify whether this is a priority?  It is up to every committee to decide.  Are there changes that could be made or better platforms for providing information that would help?</p></speech>

It was certainly very appropriate to hold this meeting and I do not agree with any comments about it stinking or being inappropriate timing.  If this Committee of Public Accounts cannot look at the appropriation account for the President's Establishment, we are in serious trouble as a committee.  I fully support the Chairman in holding this meeting.  It is very important that we look at processes.  I have not mentioned a single President.  I have looked at processes, and Mr. Fraser has admitted that the processes leave something to be desired.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

That is great.  Today we have looked at the matter and we have seen that no audit committee sat.  I do not want to hammer Mr. Fraser as we have been through the matter, but it concerns me that when I look back at the previous years, I do not see where it was highlighted that there was no audit committee.  I would have thought the lack of an audit committee would be a basic thing to highlight.  If I go back, to 2013 or 2014, Mr. Fraser continually talks about the office having an internal audit function with appropriately trained personnel which operates in accordance with a charter and so on, but actually it was never operating.  Is that correct, or am I wrong?</p></speech>

I am thinking in the context of the Garda, the education and training boards and the other organisations we have had before us.  We were very hard on them in respect of processes and procedures.  The first time I see anything about an audit committee is in Mr. Fraser's 2016 appropriation account.  Does he see where I am coming from?  There is not an open and accountable system.  One thing is being said on paper but the operation of that is not happening on the ground.  Is that not right?  If this is happening with the President's Establishment, regardless of who the President is, we are not giving out a proper message here on accountability, are we?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General seems to be the main person responsible even though his role is only as auditor.  Mr. Fraser has tried to pass the buck to him a few times.  There is also the audit committee in the &Aacute;ras.  The question of who is responsible needs to be established.  With other audits, the Comptroller and Auditor General makes a report and we ask questions based on what he lays before us, but there seems to be some crisscrossing today.  That is something that we should take from our meeting.</p> <p>  I looked up the reason the Committee of Public Accounts exists, that being, the three Es and two Ps.  We investigate whether something has been done economically, efficiently and effectively in line with procedures and privileges.  No one seems to have answered Deputy MacSharry's question on the &euro;317,000 that seems to have appeared from out of the blue.  I knew nothing about it until he mentioned it, but no one present is responsible for it or even able to throw any light on why it was paid.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that it was not paid out of the Vote, but under a 1997 Act.  That and what the money is for need to be clarified.  It is &euro;317,000 of taxpayers' money.  The question on why and how it was spent must be answered within a short time.  Let us know why it was spent so that the public in general and the presidential candidates - the nomination process closes tomorrow - can know what the &euro;317,000 entailed and on what grounds it was spent.  This question needs to be answered sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

It is not about what it is spent on or about the amount of money.  Indeed, this allowance or whatever it is - about which none of us know anything and which is not taxable - could be &euro;1 million.  That is not the point.  The point is that we, as the public, are entitled to know that Mr. McCarthy, as Comptroller and Auditor General, is auditing and having a look at this and that it is being done in the right way.  Even the perception of it being some kind of a slush fund is damaging.  I wonder could Mr. McCarthy give us any information other than suggesting that he presumes that there are procedures to govern that fund in the &Aacute;ras.  We look forward to getting that information as early as possible.</p> <p>  Again, I concur 100% with Deputy Connolly.  It was remiss of previous Committees of Public Accounts not to do this, rather than mischievous of this committee to do so.  I hope it is done every year in the future.  This meeting is timely and has been informative.  I can certainly think of 317,000 reasons it was a good exchange today.</p></speech>
