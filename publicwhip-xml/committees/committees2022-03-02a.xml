I want to pay tribute to Senator Paul Daly's father Se&aacute;n.  He was a great advocate for agriculture and the rural community.  If ever we need a reminder of why we sit on this committee and what this committee is about, we should reflect on the life of a man who was of the land, dedicated himself to it and will be forever immortalised in the land.  He was involved in racing through his local track Kilbeggan.  He was involved in ploughing and so many aspects of farming.  I am glad to see many of those traditions continued by his son.  I know it is a great loss not only to the Daly family but to the wider agriculture community and the local Kilbeggan community.  May he rest in peace.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to put phones on silent because this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the challenges facing the pig, poultry and horticulture sectors, particularly with regard to production costs and retail prices.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to a committee.  This means that a witness has full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>   Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurance in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts, and members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.  </p> <p>  We are joined today by representatives of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, including Mr. Tim Cullinan, president, Mr. Roy Gallie, pigs committee chair, Mr. Nigel Sweetnam, poultry committee chair, Ms Niamh Brennan, horticulture policy executive, and Mr. Robert Malone, senior policy executive for retail.  I invite Mr. Cullinan to make the association's opening statement.</p></speech>

Before I start, I want to speak about the Ukrainian people and, in particular, Ukrainian farmers.  I want to pass on our sympathies to them on what is happening out there at the moment.</p> <p>  Again, I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the issues facing the pig, poultry and horticulture sectors.  I am joined by IFA poultry chair, Mr. Nigel Sweetnam, IFA senior policy executive for retail, Mr. Robert Malone, and IFA policy executive for horticulture, potatoes and organics, Ms. Niamh Brennan.  </p> <p>  The challenges facing the sectors we are representing here, namely horticulture, poultry and pig farmers, are multifactorial but centre around the increasing costs of production and the dominant position of a small number of retail buyers, resulting in ever tightening margins.  These three sectors are going through a very difficult time.  Energy, feed and fertiliser bills are overwhelming for farm families trying to run their businesses.  These same farmers are being squeezed from all sides with the added actions of retailers who are relentlessly pushing down the retail price of their products and embarking on unsustainable discounting to encourage store footfall.</p> <p>  Produce from these sectors is dependent on the Irish retail sector for routes to market.  Apart from mushrooms, virtually all horticultural produce is for the home market.  Poultry production is centred around servicing the home market, with some low-value offcuts exported.  The Irish pig sector, while generating significant export value of close to &euro;1 billion per annum, is reliant on the home market, predominantly the retail trade, for 50% of all sales.</p> <p>  Retail food price deflation from 2010 to 2020 is putting huge downward pressure on farmers&rsquo; margins.  The falling price of food, and of fresh produce from the horticulture sector in particular, has resulted in squeezed margins for primary food producers and it now poses a significant threat to the viability of primary food production in Ireland in these sectors.  The horticulture sector, similar to the pigs and poultry sectors, depends on getting a viable return direct from the marketplace as farmers in this sector generally do not receive direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  While there have been some moderate increases in food prices on the shelves in recent months, the reality is that between January 2010 and December 2021, the average price of all food declined by 9 %.  Over the same period, the average level of overall consumer prices increased by 12.5%, according to the CSO.  As a consequence, only a small number of horticulture growers have survived.  They have been forced to scale up and all are extremely vulnerable today.  This situation is replicated in the pig farming and poultry sectors.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT,  analysis of the Irish agrifood sector in 2021 and clearly identified that the primary producers&rsquo; share in the value chain is very low and is well below the EU average of the total value-added share which is being passed back to farmers.</p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s retail environment is dominated by five players, Dunnes Stores, SuperValu, Tesco and the two discounters, Aldi and Lidl.  Together, these five retailers constitute 90% of the total grocery market in Ireland.  It is the latter two, Lidl and Aldi, that have fundamentally had the biggest negative impact on the price that primary producers receive for their produce.  These retailers have used fresh produce in particular as marketing tools to attract consumers into their stories, offering fresh fruit and vegetables at discount prices that do not relate to the production costs.  Retailers may claim that the cost of special promotions is funded by them and while this may be accurate on a short-term basis, the cost of such promotions is built into procurement prices over time.  The reality is that the price farmers get paid each year has consistently declined up until this year.  Many primary producers in these sectors have been forced out of business and many more will follow unless strong intervention in the market occurs.</p> <p>  Retail discounters Lidl and Aldi, in particular, use local-sounding brand names and fake farms and creameries to market many of their products.  The IFA called out this practice in summer 2021, only to be hauled into the courts by Lidl seeking a court injunction to stop IFA from highlighting this potentially misleading practice.  However, the court rejected the application by Lidl and awarded costs against it.  </p> <p>  The average price of food increased by 1.3% in 2021, the first year that food has increased in over a decade.  The price of food will have to increase further in order for the producers to be paid for their work.  The massive increase in energy and fertiliser costs in recent weeks are well documented.  These costs cannot be borne by farmers without significant increases in the food chain being passed back to the farmer.  While there has been some recognition by the retail sector of these cost increases in recent weeks, it is not nearly enough.  We need the food regulator that has been long-promised by this Government and that regulator needs to be given real statuary powers of investigation and enforcement to ensure that there is equality in the food chain.</p> <p>  The EU directive on unfair trading practices, UTP, was transposed into Irish law in April 2021.  This is a step in the right direction, but on their own, the UTP regulations will have minimal effect.  There is no recognition of the price required to produce a head of cabbage, a kilogram of carrots, a dozen eggs, a whole chicken or a pound of rashers in the UTP regulations.  </p> <p>  We are bombarded with talk about sustainability.</p><p>There are three pillars to sustainability: environmental, social and economic.  Today in Ireland we have legislation underpinning two of these pillars, environmental and social sustainability.  There is no legal protection for the economic sustainability of food producers.  This has to change.</p><p> The Government has the opportunity today and must give the new food regulator office legal powers that go beyond the UTP regulations.  It must have the authority to investigate and properly sanction those who breach the regulations.  It must ensure the farmer&rsquo;s position at the bottom of the food chain is not abused as it has been for many years.  The Department has set up the UTP enforcement authority as required under the EU directive on UTPs.  The Government has committed to setting up and funding a food regulator, or food ombudsperson, to ensure the implementation of the UTP directive and, going further, to provide greater transparency and reporting of where the value is being distributed in the food chain.  Budget 2022 committed &euro;4 million to the establishment of a food ombudsman office.</p><p> There were an estimated 350 commercial vegetable growers in Ireland in 2010.  The IFA now puts this number at fewer than 100, only one third of what we had.  This can be almost exclusively attributed to the reducing price being paid by the big retail buyers to their suppliers, forcing more and more of them out of business.  The result is what we see on the shelves today: imported broccoli from Spain, imported tomatoes from Holland, strawberries from Egypt and raspberries from Morocco.  All these crops can be grown and produced almost ten months of the year in Ireland, but only if the retailers pay the cost of local sustainable production.</p><p> Below-cost selling must be prohibited.  The IFA is calling for this to be enshrined into Irish law and regulated by the new food regulator office.  The discounting and degrading of food must be stopped.  Retail buyers must be held accountable for the declining number of farmers in these vulnerable sectors of Irish food production that depend on the Irish domestic retail market.  It is a sad state of affairs when farmers who are producing beef and dairy products, where over 90% is exported, are doing better in world markets than farmers suppling fresh fruit, vegetables, pork and poultry to be consumed here in Ireland.</p><p> I am calling on every Deputy and Senator here today to ensure legal protection is given to food producers.  Legislation on the office of the food regulator must be prioritised and must be underpinned with statutory powers of enforcement.  Below-cost selling must be banned.  Fairness must be is returned to a fundamentally unfair food supply chain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00200"><p>I thank Mr. Cullinan and the rest of the IFA delegation.  It is always good to have them in.  I have a couple of questions, so I will ask them very quickly and perhaps one at a time.  On the pig sector, is the IFA happy with what the Government has recently announced in terms of supports for the sector or does it see any shortcomings?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00300"><p>Any intervention by the Government or the State is always welcome.  The pig sector is going through an extremely difficult situation at the moment.  It is very impacted by the enormous increase in the price of feed, fuel and energy.  It is a very serious situation and we will need more intervention from the Government.  It is important that all stakeholders in the industry come together.  It is about protecting a sector that is very vulnerable at the moment.  I described where a number of vulnerable sectors are at the moment.  We have seen a massive decline in the horticulture sector.  We want to ensure we protect the pig sector going forward.  Overall, there are 8,000 people involved or employed in the sector in Ireland.  We have exports of almost &euro;1 billion a year.  It is very important as well that we have 50% of our produce sold here on the home market.  That goes right back to the practice within the retail sector of using fresh pork as a loss leader and driving down the price.  We need more measures from the Government and we also need legislation coming forward, which is the reason we are here this evening.  It is a combination of funding and legislation and everybody in the chain working together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00400"><p>I will come to the legislation on retail, specifically, shortly.  If we could turn very quickly to the horticulture sector, we have met with many of the producers and we are deeply concerned about the challenges that are there.  Growing Media Ireland, GMI, would have circulated us with a snapshot of where it sees the sector at the moment in terms of the Government&rsquo;s guidelines and the definition of the sub-30 ha rule.  There is a view that if it were to be clarified, in the sense that the 30 ha were set aside, anything above that could be left over to environmentally appropriate works.  Is that in line with the IFA&rsquo;s view on that sector at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00500"><p>Ms Niamh Brennan, our horticulture expert, will answer that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00600"><p>Our position is that there is a bit of ambiguity around the sub-30 ha definition.  If the sub-30 ha plot of land was part of a larger-scale bog that had already been exploited for horticulture for the production of peat, it would be beneficial to the sector because one would be using a bog that had already been utilised and the machinery, etc., would be in place.  This would be better than starting on a virgin 30 ha bog, as they outline it to be, where one is unsure of the quality of the peat that would there, whether any infrastructure would be available in the locality or whether there would be any expertise to go into that.  Therefore, we are in agreement with that.  If the sub-30 ha plot of land was taken as part of a larger-scale bog, historically, that would be beneficial to the position at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00700"><p>I am greatly heartened by the emphasis on retail in Mr. Cullinan&rsquo;s presentation.  I take great heart when I see the IFA taking on the retailers and, particularly, the discount multiples.  Everybody in the Government and everybody in every political party wants to see cheaper food prices and it is very important.  However, it is set out there very succinctly in the consumer price index, CPI, over the past ten years that there is only one loser in cheaper food prices and, unfortunately, that is the producer at the moment.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions on this.  Clearly, we need to do more legislatively to support farmers, and the IFA has certainly set out some of that.  The Government and the political parties need to stand shoulder to shoulder with the IFA on this issue.  We need to take on the supermarkets and multiples.  They have to be accountable.  They have been very adept and successful at their marketing and they have certainly presented an image that they are a friend and are putting a warm embrace around rural Ireland.  However, when one looks at the stark figures, that is certainly not the case.  They need to be challenged.  I am very supportive of any effort by the IFA to take the fight to them.  I am interested to tease out where the IFA sees we need to go in terms of legislative support.  Certainly, the food regulator is very important.  The UTP has its shortcomings, and I suppose for Mr. Malone in particular, we would have seen the legislation on alcohol pricing recently.  From my own discussions with small retailers, they would say that while it was not necessarily the aim of that legislation, it has levelled the playing field and the multiples cannot do the huge discounts that they were able to do.  Suddenly, the corner shop off-licence is able to compete head-to-head with Dunnes Stores on the price of a bottle of whiskey.  Do we need to get to a model like that?  Is that where we need to get to in terms of food production and food retailing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00800"><p>Exactly.  If one looks at a large retailer today, they have 18,000 lines in that shop.  Therefore, one line will not make or break them, whereas everything that a small local retailer sells is important.  Therefore, legislation is required.  It does not necessarily have to mean that the consumer has to pay more for a particular product.</p><p>However, the cost of production for the farmer must be recognised in whatever is paid back with the wholesale price.  That is not happening now and it is why we continuously see fresh produce in particular with fewer growers.  It is evident right across the sectors we represent today because they are more closely linked to the retail market.  It is evident with 50% of all pig meat sold by retailers and virtually all poultry product sold in domestic retail and some food service.  Retail is the biggest part of it.  All of our horticulture, except for mushrooms, is sold in the retail trade as our president has outlined.</p><p> The commodities dealing with the export market are in beef.  They are open to those markets and they are up and down; we are in a high period now.  We can see today with high commodity input prices, we have not the response from the retail trade.  That is the ultimate issue.  We need transparency so we can see clearly who is taking what from the value chain.  At least if there is transparency people will have to stand up and be accountable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#D00200"><p>Is any retailer proactively engaging and putting its hand up as having identified an issue for the producer?  Do any of them wish to work with the producers?  Is it very much a case of them standing off and doing what they want, with the farmer and producer paying the price?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#D00300"><p>We have done a full round of retail engagements and ultimately a discounter by its nature will look to offer value.  They want it at both ends.  They want it from the suppliers putting in product and that has ultimately driven down the price of food.  According to the consumer price index, the price of food is down almost 10% over the past ten years.  That is where the problem lies.  They can all say they are engaging and we see many Irish flags and farmers' pictures in all retailers.  Ultimately, it is where the man is buying the product and setting the price that we need to tackle this.  Legislation is required to open up this process so we can get accountability.  Below-cost selling is an issue but tackling it on its own is not the answer.  We must have transparency and somebody to call out these retailers.  We have seen it in the UK with Ms Christine Tacon in the role of food regulator.  It worked there and we need something like that put in place here in Ireland.</p></speech>

Is it fair to say that in many cases the producer is at the whim of those retailers, particularly with fresh products?  A person with a product is basically told what price it will be bought at and there is no choice only to accept the price.  Is that a fair analysis of the position with the discounters?</p></speech>

I know plenty of farmers and Teagasc that have done work on cost increases this year.  As we know, this year cost increases have been above and beyond what is expected.  Last October, in Ms Brennan's sector of horticulture, Teagasc did an excellent report identifying cost increases across different sectors.  There were cost increases of between 10% and 20%.  I know suppliers at the scale where they deal directly with a retailer.  They have sought 10%, 15% or 20% of an increase and have got back half of it.  That is the reality and they have not got full costs recovery.  People can take some price volatility but these producers are looking at facing into 2022 at not recovering their costs; they will be producing below the cost of production.  It is very disheartening to see a head of broccoli or cabbage retailing at less than what it can be produced for.</p></speech>

We knew input costs have increased dramatically.  Can what has happened in the pig sector be attributed to the retailer or is it about world market trends?  The price has dropped very significantly in the past couple of months.  Horticulture and poultry is more home-based and would not be as prone to variations in the world marketplace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#D00800"><p>It is a very relevant question.  Teagasc has done a nexus analysis of where the sector is now.  Farmers are losing anything between &euro;35 to &euro;40 per pig currently, and that put in the context of a 500 to 600 sow unit means it is in the region of &euro;50,000 per month.  There are multiple reasons why it happens.  There are pressures from the input side and on the back of Covid-19, there is the matter of transporting Irish pork, much of which is exported to China.  We have an excellent export market but the cost of transporting that pork increases because of factors such a lack of availability of containers and the increasing price of energy.  It has put substantial pressure on the market.  The import of grain into the country has been substantially affected by the cost of shipping.<br/><br/>The practices we see retailers using when it comes to fresh produce, whether it is meat or vegetables, continues to drive down the price.  We employed Mr. Jim Power in 2019 to look in particular at the retail beef sector, as that was struggling at the time.  I will quote a paragraph from the report at the time, as it is relevant to this evening's discussion.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The growing market share of the discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl, has fundamentally altered the retail grocery landscape and retail food prices.  The market share of Aldi and Lidl has expanded from 9.5% in October 2010 to 24.5% in November 2019.  This is not unique to Ireland.  The growth of discounters is altering the pricing behaviour of the rest of the retail grocery sector. </blockquote> <p>What has happened over the past number of years is that as discounters have moved into Ireland, there is what we might call a habit of using food as a loss leader.  That is fundamental to the problem we are experiencing this evening.</p></speech>

In the past ten years prices have fallen by approximately 9% and in the same period the number of vegetable growers, for example, has fallen to a third of what it used to be.  Given that so much of the industries concerned have a reliance on the Irish market, is it incomprehensible that our current position has been allowed to develop to this stage?  Is the challenge facing the sector even more difficult given that retailers have based their business model on the long-standing trend continuing and consumers have also become used to loss leaders and so on?  Will the witnesses give an idea of the negotiating power of the sectors concerned?  Will they give their views on the farm to fork strategy and the extent to which economic sustainability for the producers can be developed with officials to ensure food supply and security?</p></speech>

We all know the challenges we must deal with in that respect.  This is another challenge coming from the European Commission, involving taking out land and putting 25% of European land into organic farming, with less fertiliser and pesticide being used.  In itself, that will lead to less food produced in Europe.  That is very worrying, given where the world is now.  We have seen that over the past two years people have been trying to produce food in very difficult times during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Now we see what is happening in Ukraine, which is known as the breadbasket of Europe because it produces grain in particular for the feeding of animals right across Europe and the world.  I am very concerned about the farm to fork strategy.</p> <p>  We all acknowledge there are many challenges around climate change.  We are working to meet those challenges but we must be very careful not to legislate ourselves into a position where we end up with a food scarcity, which may well happen.</p><p>If we continue on this journey, we may end up with a shortage of food.  At that point, food will be at a price that the consumer will not be able to afford.  We are clearly saying that the price of food has to go up.  That is our position on farm to fork.</p></speech>

I have to go to another meeting.  On pigs, what capacity do farmers have to deal with the further increases in energy costs that are likely to be incurred immediately due to the invasion of Ukraine?  We need to be realistic.  The war is happening in real time so the consequences that will be felt in higher energy costs will be felt more immediately.  What are the IFA's views on what is needed?  I refer to the &euro;7 million package that was announced during the week by the Department.  What impact will that have for farmers in the immediate term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#E00300"><p>There is massive concern, not just in Ireland but across Europe, on the natural gas supply in particular.  Almost 50% of the natural gas that is consumed in Europe comes from Russia.  We are concerned about that and about the impact of the increase in the price of energy.  Pig, poultry and horticulture farmers are all massive users of energy so that will have a direct impact and lead to further losses for those sectors.  In the pig sector specifically, the Deputy is referencing the &euro;7 million direct aid package that the Minister has announced.  That is a first step but it will take more for any sector that has the potential to lose somewhere in the region of &euro;130 million, to quote Teagasc figures again, in a 12-month period.  This is a substantial amount of money.  The Deputy will be aware that many people in Tipperary are employed directly in the pig sector.  This is because there is a large processing plant in Roscrea.  Overall, 8,000 people are involved in the sector so we need more engagement from the Government and we need a strategy and more funding to get us out of the serious situation we find ourselves in.</p></speech>

However, I must record my disappointment that we have set to secure a meeting with two Ministers and one Minister of State, who we have asked to be present to discuss the issue of horticultural peat.  It is nothing short of a scandal that they have continuously refused to co-operate with us in that regard.  Nevertheless, the issues that have been raised this evening are incredibly important and I thank our guests for bringing them up.</p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses will take this opportunity to outline to laypeople how it is that the IFA&rsquo;s battle is with retailers.  In my county, there was a protest outside Dunnes Stores by pig and poultry farmers recently.  Many people stopped and asked me about it because the farmers do not sell their pigs and chickens directly to Dunnes Stores so they wondered why they were protesting outside the shop.  I was trying to explain as best I could the issue of retailers suppressing the prices relating to agricultural produce.  Farmers sell to processors and those processors agree a price with retailers.  As a result, the first battle is with those who are underpaying the IFA&rsquo;s members.  It does not matter if Dunnes Stores decides to give away the food for nothing if farmers are paid a fair price for it.  That is all that we want to see.</p></speech>

The reason we are here is that this is a serious situation.  I want to comment on the meeting with the two Ministers and one Minister of State.  This is a good initiative on the part of the Chairman.  It is important that the two Ministers and one Minister of State attend because peat is a serious issue.  We have been engaging a lot with the committee on that topic.</p> <p>  Mr. Sweetnam is with me.  He is chairman of our poultry committee.  There is a lot of poultry in Deputy Carthy&rsquo;s area so I will ask Mr. Sweetnam to comment on this first.</p></speech>

As poultry farmers, we see the multiple buyers as bully boys who have forced down the retail price of our products.  Our products are produced to the highest standards in the world, yet we are getting one of the lowest prices in Europe for it.  We have been to the processors looking for money but the intermediaries are already battling with the increase in the price of feed, which is astronomical and going up to &euro;250,000 per week extra just to feed the birds.  Their backs are to the wall and they have a poor relationship with the supermarkets, which are refusing to even give them a price increase for their costs, not to mind our costs.  That is why we were at the door of the retailers and we got no response back from them.  We have been waiting for representation from Dunnes Stores for three years so that is what brought us outside their doors and that is what it took to get it to talk to us.</p> <p>  Along with Mr. Cullinan and Mr. Malone we have met representatives of most of the supermarkets and they all know our costs.  We did not have to tell them how much soy or gas had gone up; they all knew already.  Getting the price back through the food chain is our big problem.  Our costs to produce chicken are double what they were this time last year.  As a result, the big battle we face is to get the money back to the farmers who need it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#E01400"><p>It is valid to ask how we ended up outside the doors of the retailers.  Our farmers are all busy and they do not want to be outside the doors of retailers, nor do I.  I wrote to all the retailers before Christmas because the problem was escalating and the reason we target retailers is that they are our route to the market.  Some 50% of pigmeat is sold in the Irish market, which is an excellent market to have.  It is the best market we have.  The vast majority of poultry and horticultural products are sold in the Irish market as well.  We engaged with a number of retailers but we protested outside the premises of the retailers that did not engage with us.  As primary producers it is important that we are able to engage with all actors in the chain.  We are relying on the retailers for a route to the market and that makes it very important that all actors will sit around the table with us to discuss where we are coming from.</p> <p>  The other reason we were there is because of the massive impact that the extraordinary price increases we are dealing with has, particularly with the cost of feed and energy.  That has put us in a serious loss-making situation.  The retailers we engaged with acknowledged this and they pointed out that they have a practice with a range of produce whereby they have contracts from six months to one year in duration.  They gave us a commitment, which we need to see followed through on, that they would go back to their processors and suppliers because of the extraordinary circumstances and look at the contracts again.  That is why we were there.</p> <p>  If one looks at poultry in particular-----</p></speech>

I am trying to get to the core of why that is not the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#F00200"><p>I was coming to that.  The money has to trickle down the supply chain from the retailer to the processor and down to the farmer.  The ask from poultry farmers was for 15 cent of an increase in the price of a chicken and a 2 cent increase on the price of an egg.  On pigmeat, they need to be able to get 50 cent at retail level down the line, which is a minimum increase at retail level.  We had best be clear.  The people dealing directly with retailers would be afraid, and there is no point in saying otherwise, to stand outside their doors as they would run the risk of being delisted.  That is a major issue for them.</p></speech>

Are farmers afraid to stand outside the gates of their direct contractor, as in the processors?</p></speech>

If we did not have that engagement, we would have to stand outside their premises as well.  We want to be able to engage and have direct dialogue with all actors in the supply chain.  The retailers were not having that dialogue or engagement with ourselves and that is the reason we were outside their premises.  It is very important in this sector that everybody would act together from the primary producer down the line.  In some instances, there is a secondary processor along with a primary processor before the product gets to the retailers.  All those actors must be able to engage in a proper manner.  People must acknowledge when there are extreme circumstances, as there are currently with the extraordinary costs with which the primary producer is trying to deal.</p></speech>

How important is the establishment of a food ombudsman office in addressing the broad range of issues that were mentioned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#F00800"><p>It goes back to the Deputy's fundamental first question.  The food chain, as it stands, is broken.  If farmers are protesting outside a retailer with which they do not deal directly, they are doing that because their costs are not recognised through that food chain.  That is why we are here.  We need legislation to make this food chain transparent, to open it up to see who gets what and to make sure there is fairness right through the food chain.  If somebody is dealing directly with a processor and is not on the ground producing pigs or chickens, he or she is a step removed from the reality facing the farmer.  The Deputy is right in what he said.  In normal circumstances Mr. Sweetnam would go into his processor to supply chickens, outline his costs and negotiate a price increase and that would be it.  However, it has gone to a stage where that provision is not in the food chain.  We need somebody with legal powers to do a legal overview of the food chain, to request the books to see who is getting what out of the food chain and where the value is going.  Ultimately, that is why we are here today.  We need to establish the office of a food regulator, fully fund it, have it up and running in order that, on foot of a complaint, I or anybody else can get the regulator to investigate it and call out malpractice.  Ultimately, that is why we are here.  Retailers are not recognising the cost of production.</p></speech>

He asked how can we get a solution to this problem.  The establishment of the office of a food ombudsman was part of the unfair trading practices directive.  The Deputy will recall we had a beef task force.  The Department commissioned Grant Thornton to carry out an investigation into the margins along the supply chain, to ascertain what margin the retailer had and what margin the processor had.  We all know the result of that was that we did not get an answer.  The Deputy rightly probed that also.  I was a member the beef task force for the final year of its term.  When we were not able to get that information, the Minister came before the task force and committed to introducing primary legislation to establish a food regulator to strengthen the powers of the ombudsman.</p> <p>  I would like to hear from this committee that we would get its support to ensure that when the legislation comes on to the floor of the D&aacute;il, the regulator would get proper powers.  There is no point in introducing legislation if it is not targeted in the right direction.  By that I mean the person appointed must have the power to ascertain where the margin is at.  We know one thing for certain, the margin is not with the farmer at present.  We are open and transparent.  We are willing to show our margin.  I ask the committee for its support in bringing forward that request to the Minister to ensure when this legislation comes on to the floor of the D&aacute;il it will be effective and the person appointed will be able to check the margin along the food supply chain.  We do not want to revert to what we had with the Grant Thornton report when it failed to find out the answer to that question for us.</p></speech>

I voted against it because I did not think it was sufficiently robust.  I thought it gave too much latitude for governments to take a minimal approach.  The Irish Farmers Association had quite a go at me for voting against it and I was challenged in many a forum, but that is its job as a lobby organisation.</p> <p>  I will outline the problem I have with where we are at now.  The Government transposed the directive, essentially, on the last day it could do so.  It left it until the last moment and did it on a minimal basis, as I had feared.  Since then, it has two or three members of staff working in the enforcement unit it was obliged to establish.  Last May, the Minister told the D&aacute;il he intended to establish a food ombudsman or regulator by the end of last year.  He told us this month it will be established by the end of this year.  It is nine months since the original commitment was given and we have been told it will take an extra three months than was originally anticipated.  Does Mr. Cullinan have confidence on foot of his direct dealings with the Minister or the Department that when we have sight of this legislation, it will do precisely what he has set out, namely, it will have the teeth to address the imbalances that exist within the food chain?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we were protesting outside two Dunnes Stores retail premises at that time.  The Minister's was very clear in what he said when answering a question put to him by the media seeking his response to the action taken by Irish farmers.  This is an important point.  He clearly stated that farmers cannot continue producing food below the cost of production.  If the Minister and this House are serious about that statement, it will take legislation to address it.  The Deputy asked me if I am confident about it.  I suppose I have to be confident and I like to take people at their word.  The Minister spoke at our annual general meeting in the Mansion House a few weeks ago and he clearly stated this legislation would be on the floor of the D&aacute;il during the first quarter of the year.  It is March now and we need it to be brought to the floor of the D&aacute;il before the end of March.</p></speech>

Ms Brennan will probably be best placed to answer both of them.  A &euro;7 million package was announced for the pig sector, which will work out at approximately &euro;20,000 per pig farmer.  The Minister is on record as saying that is all he is allowed to give under the <i>de minimis</i>rules.  What else is needed?  Has the IFA a proposed avenue in order to support pig farmers who are still on their knees?</p><p>My second question relates to horticultural peat.  The horticulture sector is dealing with the same challenges faced by every other sector with increased input costs and energy costs, in particular, and there is a matter of how we address that.  Where does the threat of peat input fall in terms of the price crisis?  Which is more important?</p><p>Deputy Flaherty mentioned plots smaller than 30 ha.  Have any statutory bodies engaged with the IFA to deal with the proposal in the working paper on this issue that will address how we can extract peat in a sustainable way on plots smaller than 30 ha?</p></speech>

We are clearly stating and understand that any funding we get is taxpayers' money.  We are conscious of that.  We are trying to support a sector.  Much of the money generated in this sector goes back into the local economy, which is important to remember too.  The Minister can increase the funding above &euro;7 million.  I am acutely aware of that.  More funding will be needed.  We need everybody to sit down and negotiate how that will happen and to put in place structures around it.  The Minister is not restricted to just &euro;7 million.  More funding can be provided.  It is critical that we have a structure and a way to protect this sector until a time that the market starts to improve.  The market will improve.  The major concern is about where inputs are going.  I mentioned the situation in Ukraine earlier.  This is worrying.  Will we be able to lower input costs again?  There has to be more intervention in funding by the Minister and Government.</p></speech>

The peat issue has been overshadowed by the retail issue and the crisis in the horticultural sector in the last weeks.  The issue is still to the fore.  We are losing growers from the industry because they cannot continue to endure the measures.  In the 1999 census, there were nearly 400 horticulture bed growers.  In 2014, there were 150.  It is now estimated that there are fewer than 100.  Our critical mass has been eroded.  It is feared that if we go below that, we will not have a core base to be able to re-establish the horticulture industry.  There is no point in talking about any policy or specific strategy that is in place to try to expand or redevelop the sector if we do not have that core mass.</p> <p>  The availability and subsequently the cost of peat is a significant issue.  We estimated before Christmas that the cost would have increased by over 40% because of the imports.  There are also issues of the quality and availability of that peat.  We are continuing to bang the drum about that.  We recently engaged with the Department on this, especially with regard to the proposed action plan that was published alongside the final report.  We did the final report.  Members of the IFA were involved with it.  There were 14 meetings to try to find alternatives to peat.  It is evident that they are not available at the minute and it will take some years for them to be in place.  Our main issue was the contradiction in that action plan, whereby it focuses on bogs smaller than 30 ha.  That will not be sufficient in the short term for peat for the commercial horticultural sector.  We need peat in substantial quantities for commercial matters, not just for the hobby market.  A certain quality and quantity need to be available, especially in the current market.  We will come back to that.  I welcomed the Deputy's earlier comment about ministerial engagement.</p> <p>  The two main positive points in the action plan are that two experts are to be appointed.  One is to address legal aspects for anyone wishing to be involved with the bogs smaller than 30 ha, while the other is to find out the actual requirements of the Irish horticultural peat industry.  We welcome that.  We want those people to be appointed as soon as possible.  There cannot be more delays.  We have been waiting for this final report for more than a year, with many meetings.  If there is to be the same scenario, waiting for those two experts to be appointed, we might as well put that to bed.</p> <p>  We will take the peat issue further in the next weeks.  The issue of retailers and margins is to the fore.  Import substitution is mentioned in various policies.  In 2020, we imported more than &euro;1.3 billion worth of fresh fruit and vegetables.  Import substitution erodes the critical core mass of growers.  Where is the opportunity?  They will not be allowed an opportunity, not to mention the issues of peat and labour.  We will not mention that today, but all of the issues that existed last year are still there.  It is becoming more critical because the margins are eroding and we are losing growers.</p></speech>

Much has been covered.  We have representatives here from the pig, poultry and horticulture sectors.  It is obvious that the system is broken and that is why the witnesses are before us.  This can be compared with the dairy sector, where we have a co-operative movement, and there are not the same governance issues encountered by farmers.  If Nigel has a problem with his milk price, he can go to the Bandon or Carbery co-operatives.  There is a line of command all the way.  In this scenario, farmers are very vulnerable when it comes to the retailer.  Other members have mentioned where the processor fits into this sector.  They are not co-operatives, but private industries in many ways themselves and they must make a buck too.  Tying the farmer, the processor and the retailer in together to make sure that farming at the primary level can be supported is a significant issue.  Do the witnesses believe the food ombudsman is the silver bullet to solve this?  We need to progress legislation to have the capability to tie all three together.</p> <p>  The UK model has worked to a degree.  It is not the success story that we have talked about here.  I am concerned that the silver bullet that we have talked about, which is the ombudsman, and that person tying all three entities together within years will require a huge amount of work.  We need a template of how that can help.  I am interested in the witnesses' views.  Is the ombudsman the silver bullet for the industry?  Can it be legislated for appropriately and financed appropriately?  What membership and workforce will the ombudsman's office have to deal with these substantial, complex issues?  We have seen success with ombudsmen.  Ms Dixon is in charge of data protection and is undoubtedly one of the most competent and capable people in Europe.  There are issues with ombudsmen around Ireland.  They have not been the success story that we have talked about before.</p> <p>  Will the president tell me his vision of what power the ombudsman would have?  How would the ombudsman deal directly with all three entities that are being talked about?  How does he believe that body can be funded appropriately?  Who should fund it, so that it can deliver for farmers at the farm gate?</p></speech>

We need a system that will work.  There are four sectors involved, because the potato sector is similar.  It relies on the retail market.  I spoke to people from the potato sector yesterday.  They are in a similar situation to the one being discussed here.  Last year, our concern was about liquid milk.  It also relies on the retail sector.  The Senator is right that the system is broken.  We have to find a solution to that.</p><p>The UTP directive in itself will not resolve this issue.  I have been clear from the start that a number of things need to happen and the Minister bringing forward primary legislation relating to a regulator is one part of it.  The UTP is a softer approach but we need the legislation, which is why I would like a commitment from this committee around that legislation and that this person will have the powers.  The Senator is right.  There are three actors in the chain - ourselves, the processors and the retailers.  We need clarity once and for all.  All of the people around this table this evening have been working to try to establish where the margin is for a long number of years and we have an opportunity now.  We need the help of these Houses.  The first thing we need is legislation around this regulator.  </p><p> Regarding the second part of it, this has happened recently with the banning of below-cost selling of alcohol and using alcohol to get consumers into stores.  We cannot and will not be allowed to continue with the practice because we will not survive.  The sectors we represent will not survive if we continue with the practice of below-cost selling of our produce.  From the day discounters came to this country, the practice of using our produce as a loss leader started.  They put photographs of farmers inside shops and then discounted our produce.  </p><p> The Senator mentioned funding.  The Government must put funding in place.  This funding will be used very well if we can get a solution to this and we do not end up in the current situation where pig farmers are losing anything up to &euro;40 per pig and poultry farmers risk going out of business.  We have already seen a mass exodus from the horticulture sector.  We have to make this work for the survival of these sectors.</p></speech>

A package of somewhere in the region of &euro;7 million was put in place for this industry.  Mr. Cullinan mentioned that a Teagasc report put losses in the industry at &euro;120 million in losses.  I might be wrong.  If so, please correct me.  Given that the cost of energy, feed and labour is only going one way in the next 12 months and the cost of transport is a significant issue when it comes to getting products to market as it is only going one way as well, where do Mr. Cullinan and Mr. Sweetnam see the future when they look at the pig and poultry industries?  These are not short-term issues.  You could argue that the survival of these two industries in particular is a long-term issue at this stage when it comes to the projected price of energy, feed, labour and transportation.</p></speech>

We have massive concerns, one of which concerns feed.  If we are going to survive, we are going to have to get a better return from the marketplace.  There are two areas we can get that.  I will speak about the pig one while Mr. Sweetnam will speak about the poultry one.  Fifty percent of what pig farmers produce is sold here at retail level.  It is paramount that we get regulation around this in order that we can see where the margin is and regulate so that we will get a fair price going forward.  That is part of the solution.</p> <p>  We can look at energy as well.  For years, we have been listening to the Government saying that farmers are part of the solution in respect of climate change.  If the Government had a proper policy on renewable energy, we could become energy producers ourselves, which would alleviate part of the problem around energy, so there is more we can do.  The Senator is right.  We need to look at where our energy is coming from.  The value of energy being imported into this country is in the region of &euro;8 billion per year.  We as farmers are willing and able and have been asking the Government for support on this for a long number of years.  It is high time Government took this issue seriously.  </p> <p>  They are the areas we must work on.  Inputs like feed are out of our control.  It is about market forces and world market prices and we have to deal with those.  The solution in the pig sector and other sectors is, first of all, about being able to get a proper price at retail level.  Obviously, we will have to work on world markets as well.  There is a job of work for Bord Bia to do to find and open up new markets.  There are markets in regions of North America and we need more promotion.  There is demand for pigmeat in California at present.  These are areas we need to focus on.  We all understand that the past two years were very difficult for our agencies, including Bord Bia.  The Minister was on his first trade mission in Dubai only two weeks ago.  We need to see more trade missions.  We need to get out there and get a foothold in new markets.  Mr. Sweetnam will give us an update on the poultry sector.</p></speech>

The first is the regulator to make sure we do not end up in this situation again.  In the short term, we need a price increase for our product.  I have seen 20 years of false dawns in renewables.  I had one of the first biomass boilers that could actually burn poultry litter and produce energy.  We could have a carbon-neutral chicken and produce electricity and heat from the litter under the chickens.  Two thirds of the litter would produce enough energy to rear that chicken but that needs to be supported.  It is being supported everywhere else in Europe.  We are competing against chickens in Northern Ireland.  Twenty years ago, I put a boiler into my farm.  If I put in the same boiler in Northern Ireland, I would be getting &pound;79,000 per year in a subsidy.  Here, I got nothing.  I had the first licence in Europe to burn poultry litter.  We have spoken about renewables here but that is all we have done.  We have just paid lip service to it.  The only green measure we have had to date has been a carbon tax, which is another joke.  Paying VAT on carbon tax is crippling us.  It is a tax on a tax.  This is one area we could look at immediately.  Carbon tax could be suspended or at a minimum, we could ensure that no VAT is applied to it.  To go back to electricity, every poultry house in Ireland should have solar panels on the roof.  It is a no-brainer.  There are huge sheds, the facility and usage are there and it is 24-7 so whatever power that is produced during the day will be used inside the poultry house and that can be supplemented.  Reverse metering on electricity is not a big ask.  The Minister announced targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, funding in this regard but limited it to 5 kW or 12 kW.  That is a domestic house, not a poultry farm.</p> <p>  Those are three areas.  We need an immediate price increase to keep the show going.  We have seen guys getting their returns back from the factories and because they are paid by the processor, their energy bills are double what they were this time last year.  When we protested outside supermarkets, we saw there was a willingness on the part of the public to pay an additional 15 cent or an additional 2 cent for the egg guy.  Some of the discounters were offering half of what we needed but that is just not an option.  We have to get cost recovery and that is only to maintain our margin.  We are not looking to improve our margin.  In the long term, we are looking for the regulator in order that we are not in this situation.  Another thing we are looking for is proper support in renewables, not just lip service.</p></speech>

The clock is ticking.  The need for peat to be extracted is very much required.  The horticulture industry in particular needs it rather than for it having to be imported directly from another country, which is slightly bizarre when we look at the carbon footprint involved.  The IFA might give us its view regarding the timelines pertaining to when we potentially need to have licences in place in order that we can have the extraction of peat required to keep the industry alive.</p></speech>

The answer is immediately.  We are importing peat every week at the minute.  The Minister told us a stockpile of 2,000 tonnes of peat was found when the final report was outlined but, unfortunately, he failed to mention that these 2,000 tonnes will not be of any use to the mushroom sector.  We were not aware of the quality or availability of the 2,000 tonnes.  That will go nowhere once the main season begins.  That answer is that we need it in place immediately if the Government wants to put an end to this environmental hypocrisy whereby we are importing peat to keep the show on the road.  Our main season is starting.  The amenity sector will have an event next year to mark the beginning of the season.  It is in place.  The way the environment has gone, people want local fresh produce with a sustainable substrate in order to do that.  My answer to that question is immediately.</p></speech>

It gives me the opportunity not to repeat the questions already posed but to have a conversation with the witnesses.  I want to start by welcoming the IFA.  I was in the mart in Kilcullen last Tuesday and, over a cup of coffee, a number of people asked what the IFA was doing for them.  We are talking about prosperous country that comprises Timolin, Moone and Ballitore, down into County Carlow, and Athy and Fontstown - great agricultural lands and communities.  I was glad to say that the IFA is doing a hell of a lot.  That is really important.  I said it is in and out of these Houses at night working for and representing them.  I want to acknowledge that.</p><p>As someone who has sat on this committee for two years, I see the work of the IFA.  I see media coverage in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>, <i>agriland.ie</i>and all other publications and provincial papers.  We have them all upstairs in the library.  They all come in here on a Thursday and I take the time to look, read and see the measure of the publicity.</p><p>I am not going to be critical but I will give the IFA a little bit of advice.  The ask has to be very succinct.  I sit and hear people around this table talking about being disappointed.  The reality is that we have a national Government made up of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  The reality is that we have three Ministers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, namely, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon, who is from County Kildare.  I unable to square up why we are having these difficulties in agriculture when we have three Ministers.  It has been ably demonstrated today when we have a situation whereby we cannot get the three Ministers to appear before this committee.  Here we are; it is not the IFA's problem but our problem in these Houses.  Yet they come in every week, eloquently read the IFA's statements and ask us to tell them what we think.  There is a bit of a disconnect there.  We need to sharpen up our messages.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and see how representatives from the construction industry come in.  They do not make any secret of what they want.  They spell it out crystal clear and make hard, sharp asks.  I say that in a helpful way not to be too provocative.  That is an important thing to say, however.</p><p>I acknowledge the enormous work done by the IFA.  I think back on the great politics of agriculture and the witnesses' predecessors, who managed and leveraged that political power on politicians.  We need to do something on that.  I want to share that with the witnesses.  I thank the IFA for its ongoing briefings.  I read its statement today and there are two issues I wish to take up.</p><p>I acknowledge the importance of the horticultural sector being the fourth largest after beef, dairy and pigs.  I am really saddened and disappointed by what Ms Brennan said but she has given us a dose of reality today in terms of the horticultural sector and our growers dropping.  I like to divide horticulture into ornamentals and crops, and then, of course, the mushroom sector on its own.  What a wonderful industry we have had up until now.  I think we are somehow failing to communicate the real challenges.  Somehow, we cannot crack it.  We had debates in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on this issue and yet we have a national Government and three Ministers in the Department who are all based in rural constituencies representing rural communities.  I do not understand that.</p><p>I would like Ms Brennan to provide some more detail to the committee although not necessarily today.  I would like more detail with regard to the mushroom sector and the real prices.  We need to be equipped with the knowledge the IFA has as professionals representing those sectors, be it poultry, pigs or horticulture, to continue to advance an argument.  No one has taken this seriously to date.  That is really disappointing.  As I said, I think that is important.  I understand that horticulture is not a big sector in terms of IFA representation.  Yes, it has the horticultural sector and forestry and all the other bits but it is an area in which we have great opportunities.  There is a demand for horticulture, food and so forth.</p><p>I also want to pick up what on someone said.  If we look at all the multiples and advertising in all the papers, they have suddenly glamourised farming.  Farmers now have designer boots, coats and jackets, and lovely orange carrots that are varnished.  They are using this to sell produce.  I will not name any of them.  I will not give them that publicity.  I bump into people and ask myself whether it is a real person or not.  They are all dressed up in Hunter boots, cut-off jackets and designer hairdos with their family - Johnny and the designer sheepdog - telling us to buy Irish and wear Irish producers.  It is a very nice image and I am impressed by it but we cannot be fooled by it.  That is another concern.  I see the concerns in terms of the multiples and the challenges the IFA has.</p><p>On page 4 of the IFA's submission, there is a reference to UTPs.  Clearly, such practices are hugely challenging for the IFA.  The Minister is undertaking a survey, which is to be completed by 15 March.  Has any of the IFA's members engaged in that.  Has the IFA encouraged them to engage in that?  What is its view of the survey?  It strikes me as yet another survey.  Surely, the Minister and his officials know what the problems are.  They do not need another survey of farmers.  I do not know the uptake in respect of all of that.  The IFA might share with us its knowledge of the survey, how it is going and what it thinks of it.  Dare I ask if the IFA thinks it is even necessary.  I do not necessarily think so but I would be interested to see the results of the survey.</p><p>The national food ombudsman's office is in the programme for Government, therefore, I presume this Government is going to implement this.  Ultimately, the national food ombudsman will eventually take over the powers of the unfair trading practices enforcement authority.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.</p><p>As I said, I acknowledge the important work the IFA does on behalf of farmers across the country.  They do not see it here tonight.  It is not necessarily reported in all the media.  The IFA provides a great service to agriculture and to the rural communities in this country.  It is important to say that.</p></speech>

I welcome his acknowledgement of the work the IFA does.  He mentioned the horticulture sector and representation.  I will be very clear on this.  We represent a multitude of all farmers.  We focus our attention, in particular at a time when any sector is in trouble or bother, by putting extra resources and time around that sector, which we are doing within the three or four sectors we are representing here this evening.</p></speech>

We were all very disappointed with the reaction we got.  The Senator is right; there are three Ministers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We probably should not have to be here.  This is our job, however, and we must continue to highlight the concerns within our sector.</p> <p>  The Senator made one excellent point when he spoke about a national Government.  We have the two main parties in government, but we also have the Green Party.  I get confused.  I cannot really understand the policy of one party in government, namely, the Green Party.  It is important that we have an open debate when we are here.</p></speech>

There is a misdemeanour here somewhere.  We have a party encouraging the growing of more horticulture and this serious situation where we are seeing a serious decline in that sector at present.  I have to question the policies and how this will help the climate change debate, which we are engaging in and working on.  Farmers have already done a lot around climate.  I am confused regarding that.</p><p> The Senator spoke about getting the three Ministers in front of the committee but another group needs to appear, one we have been discussing for the past hour, which is retailers.  It would be a very useful exercise to get the other side of the story as well.  I am not telling the committee what to do, but if that could be facilitated, it would definitely be a very useful-----</p></speech>

The Senator mentioned farmers being dressed up and all of this that goes on.  I will bring us back to June of last year when one of the discounters was using fake brands and fake creameries.  The advertising was incorrect and when our association took a stand and highlighted this in the media, which was the proper thing to do, it did not go down very well with that particular discounter.  It took a challenge against us, went all the way to the High Court and sought an injunction against our association, which was highlighting fake branding by that discounter.  That was very concerning.  The outcome was correct in that the judge saw that the discounter was incorrect in what it was doing.  Not alone did he not grant the injunction, he granted us our costs on the day.  We should not have to go to those lengths to try to protect our sectors.  That is the length we had to go to last year.  The reason I referred to that is the Senator asked me about a survey.  I have not engaged in a survey.  Like him, I believe we need to sit around the table with these people and engage, as I said, with all the actors in the chain.  That is the survey we need.</p> <p>  I will go back to what the Senator said, which is very important.  The Seanad is a very useful part of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It goes back to us needing every bit of support we can get.  He is correct about the food ombudsman.  We need more around this legislation and around a regulator that will get in there and will see whether the margin is with the retailer or processor.  The other side of it is that I am asking the Senator for the support of the Seanad tonight, in getting the legislation to stop, once and for all, this practice of below-cost selling.</p></speech>

The IFA has my support unequivocally.  We have an agricultural panel in this Seanad, which always reminds me of how engaged our agricultural bodies are with that panel.  It always strikes me.  I acknowledge the enormous work of the agriculture members on the panel who are present, including Senators Tim Lombard, Paul Daly and others, who work exceptionally hard.  I actively engage with them.  They are representing agriculture in the Seanad on panels that the IFA has a major influence on.  I believe it can use them.</p><p>I will make an ask of the IFA because it is important to make asks of all of us, to assist us in getting the three Ministers who represent three rural communities and the IFA's membership in those three constituencies in front of the committee.  We are talking about Laois-Offaly, Donegal and Kildare.  I ask the IFA to use its influence and, by Golly, it has influence in the media, including the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>and other publications.  I would like it to use those publications; I understand the IFA is a stakeholder in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>.  It might use that influence to put pressure on the three Ministers to support us in our fight to support farmers.  I look forward to running to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service next Thursday to see that.  The deadline might be too tight for this week, but I want to see the IFA supporting us to get these Ministers in front of the committee so we can hold them to account for the IFA and the industry.</p><p>Ms Brennan might like to touch on the seriousness of the peat issue. </p></speech>

It is critically important that they come before the committee.  As I said, the horticulture situation is very serious.  We do not want to see the demise of another industry.  We saw the demise of the beet industry a number of years ago.  Once an industry goes, we can never revitalise it again.</p></speech>

It was at a critical point this time last year, let alone now.  I will touch on the mushroom industry.  A number of our members have been involved directly with the committee on this and they are happy to again meet anybody here at any opportunity in order to get across the exact criteria of the mushroom industry.  Many of those in the mushroom industry in particular are very frustrated about the fact their exact requirements were not known by certain members of the Government or outlined in the final report.  There could have been a figure for the mushroom industry that was counterproductive to its requirements.  In addition, there is 80% water in any mushroom peat that needs to be imported into the country.  It is at a critical point.  If the mushroom industry gets to a stage where it has to import a product that is 80% water into the country, we have to ask ourselves a big question about what we are doing.</p></speech>

It is our Tipperary way of pointing someone in a different direction.  The Chairman and the Senator would know that.</p><p>My question may have been answered.  There seems to be a very relaxed attitude at departmental level to giving the unfair trading practice directive the teeth it is supposed to have.  I do not understand why that is the case although maintaining the <i>status quo</i>seems to be the preferred option by the looks of it.  Will the representatives give us the IFA's take on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#K01300"><p>I will answer that.  The unfair trading practices directive is a European directive.  As Deputy Carthy outlined, he was involved in it a number of years ago.  It goes not go far enough.  If we go through it, there are 16 unfair trading practices that are banned by the directive and minimum requirements are to be enforced for all new contracts and existing contracts from 28 April this year.  I have no doubt they will be but they do not go anywhere near far enough.  The words "price recognition" of the cost of production are never mentioned in the context of an unfair trading practice.  Terms and conditions of trading, terms of payment and those kind of things are mentioned as they relate to unfair trading practices.  That is why we are here today.</p> <p>  To go back to the Senator's advice, we have a specific ask.  When committee members get a chance to scrutinise this legislation, we want them to look for proper teeth in the powers of the food regulator or the ombudsperson, whatever it is termed, of engagement with retailers, investigation and enforcement in order to call out people who are not recognising the cost of production.  Whether it is Mr. Cullinan as a pig farmer or Ms Brennan's horticulturist members, their costs of production are not recognised in those prices.  That is ultimately where the problem is.  If the price set by a retailer for a packer or processor is not enough, the farmer will ultimately lose. </p></speech>

We are at a critical juncture in all of this.  The Deputy is correct that the UTPs will not do what we need done now.  We need to strengthen the UTP and the only way we can do that is through legislation.  Again, that legislation will be coming to the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p><p>As we said earlier, the Minister has committed to doing this, but the legislation must be strong and capable of giving a person the power to go along the food supply chain to see where the margin is.  We saw this in 2018, when farmers protesting at the gates over beef prices led to the establishment of the beef task force.  As we stated here earlier, Grant Thornton failed to find out where the margin was at the time.  We now have an opportunity to protect all sectors in farming but the legislation needs to be strong.  It will be scrutinised properly in the D&aacute;il and by this committee, which is important.  The legislation needs to have power.  We need to go a step further than envisaged in that, as well as having a food regulator, we need a regulation to prevent the use of food as a loss leader within stores once and for all.  Our real ask this evening is to have the legislation we require.  It will protect a sector in rural Ireland.  It will protect not just one sector but four or five whose only route to market is the retailer.  We need protection from retailers.  We never see the profits of many retailers.  They are in this country but their headquarters are in other countries right across Europe.  We just have to get the legislation to protect our sector.</p></speech>

Ninety-five percent of the people we met in Dunnes Stores in Cork were supportive of the 15 cent increase per chicken that we were looking for.  That was all we were looking for to cover our end and keep us profitable.  We want support from the committee for the establishment of an ombudsman or regulator to do the job for us.  We should not have to be doing what we did over the past two weeks.  There should be a statutory approach.  Supermarkets should not have the power basically to throw away our product to get footfall.</p></speech>

I support Senator Boyhan.  I appreciate where the Chairman is coming from, in that two Ministers agreed to come, but the Ministers are like three children, in that we cannot get the three of them into the committee together.  I encourage the IFA and other bodies to put pressure on the Department and Ministers so the latter will come in here, as Senator Boyhan requested, to help us to help the delegates.  While they are dragging their feet, it is very hard to put any plan together.  As Senator Boyhan said, the delegates need to start putting massive pressure on the three Ministers to stop this nonsense of saying one of them is not coming but that another is, or that they will appear only if all three are together.  They should appear before this committee to start answering questions so we can start helping the sectors.</p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice has been on hold all day.  It is not like him to be so quiet.  I texted him but he does not seem to be available.</p> <p>  I thank the representatives of the IFA for attending.  They have made an excellent presentation to the committee.  The legislation is very important.  We will write to the Minister and look for an exact timeframe as to when it will be before us.  All stakeholders, including retailers, will be invited in to give their views on the legislation and how it will work in practice.</p> <p>  Below-cost selling of alcohol was mentioned already.  The measures put in place have levelled the pitch.  They were implemented on health grounds more than anything else but the matter under discussion is about the survival of important sectors in our economy.  I assure the delegates that members will do their utmost to ensure the legislation introduced will have the teeth necessary to do what we want it to achieve, that is, to prohibit below-cost selling using loss leaders to attract footfall to stores at the expense of the primary producer, as mentioned by the IFA president on a few occasions.  That practice has to stop.  We need to get a fair price for our produce.  A price that covers just the cost of production is a very fair ask.  This committee will do all it can to get the legislation through as quickly as possible.  It will be before us for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The delegates will be here again at that stage to comment on it and to suggest amendments reflecting what they need to see done.  As I stated, we will write to the Minister to look for an exact timeframe.  All stakeholders will be involved when we get into the legislative process.</p> <p>  I thank the delegates.

I welcome the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and his officials to the meeting.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind Members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit Members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any Member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask that any Members partaking via Microsoft Teams confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions to the meeting.</p> <p>  Those attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Masks should continue to be worn by those present while they are not addressing the committee.  I remind all members that should a vote be called, members must physically come to the committee room to vote.  I advise all in attendance that should a division be demanded, the secretariat is operating a new system which will display the taking of the division on the screens in the committee room.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and his officials for attending today and engaging with the committee.</p></speech>

Administrative records can include but are not limited to: <blockquote> 	(a) records of admission and discharge;<br /><br />(b) photographs;<br /><br />(c) minutes of meetings;<br /><br />(d) diaries;<br /><br />(e) reports;<br /><br />(f) annual reports;<br /><br />(g) internal publications;<br /><br />(h) external publications;<br /><br />(i) policy and procedure manuals;<br /><br />(j) staff records;<br /><br />(k) financial records;<br /><br />(l) maintenance payment records;<br /><br />(m) death and burial records;<br /><br />(n) log books;<br /><br />(o) visitors books;<br /><br />(p) correspondence;<br /><br />(q) punishment books; <br /><br />(r) baptismal and confirmation records;<br /><br />(s) weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual returns;<br /><br />(t) records concerning daily life;<br /><br />(u) ephemera, e.g. fundraising materials, signs, books;&rdquo; </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>Deputies Ward, Cairns and I are working collaboratively and, as much as possible, we will break the amendments up.  Generally, we will not all speak to each one.  We will see how that goes.  We thought that was the best way to approach it.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 1, 78 and 84 to 92, inclusive, are linked.  I might read out the reasons for each amendment if that is the best way of doing it.  The purpose of the legislation is to give people access to their records, data and information, which, as we know, has been denied to many people for many years.  In the case of some people, this has been for their entire lifetime.  We know some people have passed away before being able to get some of this information.</p><p>We believe the legislation should include all possible and relevant data.  There should be no scope to leave anything out.  That applies in particular to amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 78 is very similar to amendment No. 1.  It is to include all data, information and possible records.  There is a fear that information may be withheld.  We must acknowledge that has been the experience of people.  These amendments will strengthen the legislation.</p><p>Amendment No. 84 is to include all possible scenarios and situations.  Amendment No. 85 relates to all the personal data, making it more inclusive.  Amendment No. 86 relates to the time restrictions mentioned.  We do not believe the legislation should have any time restrictions for fear it might prohibit somebody accessing their records if they fall outside that timeframe.</p><p>Regarding amendment No. 87, there may be times when an adoption did not actually take place but it is important that all the relevant information and data are given to the person.  Amendment No. 88 is in the same spirit as amendment No. 87.</p><p>Regarding amendment No. 89, we and others believe certain information may not be disclosed.  This relates to the contact preference register.  If somebody indicates he or she does not want to contact and gives a reason, is there a possibility that reason will not be communicated to the individual?  That was the reason for proposing amendment No. 89.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 90 to 92, inclusive, are to ensure there should be no preconditions and that absolutely nothing is left out.  We believe the language we are suggesting in our amendments is much stronger.</p><p>The Minister might want to respond to those first because the grouping covers amendments Nos. 1, 78, and 84 to 92, inclusive.  Sorry, other Deputies may want to come in now.</p></speech>

At the same time, Members are entitled to have this information to be able to participate in the session as well.  That is very important.</p> <p>  I will not stay very much on this because I am not fully ready yet anyway.  As Deputy Funchion said, the amendments were submitted to try to elicit as much information and to cover as many bases as possible to ensure information is provided to the adopted person in pursuing his or her information.</p><p>It says something that adopted people feel they must be so comprehensive in putting information forward and having it spelt out so forcefully in the amendments.  That should be taken on board.  The Department probably feels it has covered the issue with its amendments and we will hear that from the Minister.  I believe there is something in this and it should be looked at and taken on board by the Department.</p></speech>

As we acknowledged, an awful lot of amendments have been submitted and there is no point in us doubling up on everything we say.</p> <p>  These specific amendments speak to an issue that is at the heart of the Bill and deal with the type of information to which adopted people and their relatives are entitled.  As Deputy Pringle said, it is necessary explicitly to include clear and comprehensive definitions of things such as administrative records, other records and sources that will guarantee survivors and relatives access to the full information they should be provided with.  The level of detail we are looking for is based on the experience of survivors and campaigners.  For years, people have been denied access to information based on the interpretation of the law by public bodies and officials.  We can all understand why people feel the urge to make things such as this explicitly clear in the legislation.  There cannot be any ambiguity this time.  State bodies, institutions and the church need to have no room to continue to deny people access to their information.  I wanted to come in at this early stage and say that.</p></speech>

I too have received many emails.  It is important we listen to survivors and look at these amendments to see what we can do.  It is important we give proper information in order that people, including the survivors, in particular, and other advocates, understand what is happening.  There are a lot of amendments and it is important we see where changes can be made.  It is important we go through these amendments.</p></speech>

My understanding of the intention of amendment No. 1, combined with amendment No. 90, is to include administrative records in the definition of relevant records so that such records can be safeguarded.  This is something we have given significant consideration to and there was reference to it in the pre-legislative report.  It is important to mention the legislation essentially provides that all birth, early life and care information a relevant body holds must be provided to an applicant.  That includes any such information held on any form of administrative record.  That is why we have written all these definitions so broadly.</p> <p>  The term "relevant record" does not limit the release of information under Parts 2, 3 or 4.  The term "relevant record" is about the safeguarding of records, which is dealt with in Part 7.  That definition of relevant record already covers any administrative record containing birth, early life, care or medical information, or information such as admissions and discharge registers, visitors' books, baptismal and confirmation records, and any other records containing personal information on the daily life of individuals.  The definition of "relevant records" is already very wide but, importantly, section 42 empowers the Minister to prescribe other classes of records as relevant records and bring them within the scope of the definition.  We are of the view the definition of relevant record is already extremely broad and covers everything we need it to.  However, we have the option under section 43 that will allow a future Minister to come back to this.  We have that flexibility if something is left out of the definition of relevant records.</p> <p>  Administrative records are very useful for understanding the overall working of mother and baby and county home institutions.  They have an historical value.  That is why section 43 empowers the Minister to prescribe relevant records.  It is envisaged these administrative records will most certainly fall within the definition set out in that section.  I am satisfied the legislation would support the inclusion of administrative records in a way that allows coherent archives of institutional records to be protected.</p> <p>  I hear there is some concern about the issue of administrative records.  I will ask my officials to consider if any additional detail could be included within the definition of relevant records to provide further reassurance in that regard.</p></speech>

The Minister said he would agree to look at the issue but amendment No.1 includes a comprehensive list.  If it were accepted, that would show an intention to work collaboratively and address some of the concerns that exist.</p></speech>

The Minister outlined that there is already provision within the Bill to revisit the situation if the documents are not comprehensive enough.  What would be lost in the period between this Bill being passed and the Minister deciding to revisit it?  What could be the impact on people who have suffered a lot already?  After this Bill is passed, if it is discovered a class of documents is deemed important and needs to be covered by and included in this legislation, there is provision here to do that.  What is going to be lost in the intervening period?  That is a real risk.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation and think about including the amendment, as Deputy Funchion has said.</p></speech>

We believe everything that is listed in this amendment is already covered within the definition of relevant records.  We do not see where the gaps are.  I do not feel there is a real risk but we have that catch-all provision there, if necessary.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Funchion, we do not see that there are gaps here.  We are willing to go away, have a look and see is there something that can be done, but I am not inclined to put this lengthy list into the legislation when I believe these types of records are already captured elsewhere in the Bill.  I am trying to meet the Deputy half way.  I understand the issues at play are important.  We believe they are protected but we are happy to look at the issue again.  If we believe it is needed, we can address the issue on Report Stage.  I am speaking in respect of amendments Nos. 1 and 90.</p></speech>

We want to ensure nobody is excluded.  The amendments propose, in page 8, to delete lines 13 to 15 and substitute it with &ldquo;born in the State and placed for adoption outside the State and whose adoption was effected outside the State&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 3 proposes to delete lines 13 to 15 and substitute it with &ldquo;born in the State and placed for adoption outside the State&rdquo;.  We believe our language and wording are stronger and ensures nobody is excluded.  We believe it is a wider definition and that the language in the Bill is too restrictive.</p><p>On amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which are in this grouping, we seek the insertion of &quot;who was subject to an illegal birth registration&quot;, thereby calling it exactly what it is, an illegal birth registration, or in the case of amendment No. 5, an illegal adoption.  It is important to use the correct language.  I know that people who fall into that category feel very strongly about this and that it should be referenced as it was illegal.  I will be making this point on a number of occasions, which is that the genuine reason for our amendments is to try to strengthen this legislation where we believe the language could be a lot stronger and more inclusive in parts, thereby ensuring that no records are left out of the process.</p></speech>

The Bill currently focuses on incorrect registrations.  This may seem an accurate term for some cases, but for many others, it is not accurate at all and, moreover, it is deeply insulting to the people considered.  Without acknowledging the illegalities involved, there is an erasure of the realities and lived experiences of many adopted people.</p> <p>  The Minister previously expressed a willingness to address this issue.  Will he respond specifically to amendments Nos. 72 and 75, which are in my name, that seek to allow the words "incorrect" and "illegal" to feature?  Is this the approach the Minister would be willing to accept?  We all want to address this issue in a way that is legislatively sound while recognising the lived experiences of adopted people and their relatives.  I heard the Minister on the "Your Politics" podcast when he was asked why we would not include that terminology, and he said he would have a willingness to include both - incorrect or illegal.  Has he looked into that since?</p></speech>

While my name is not on it, I believe it is an important amendment.  The focus of the Bill, rightly, is on State agencies, including An Bord Ucht&aacute;la, that placed people outside the State for adoption.  However, there are many cases of adopted people who were placed illegally outside the State, outside of any official organisations.  I have spoken to people to whom it has happened.  They were born in Donegal and placed for adoption across the Border or <i>vice versa</i>.  This series of amendments is trying to capture that within the legislation.  The Minister might say it has already been captured, but I would like to hear that because adopted people want to hear it as well because it is important to them.</p><p>These amendments attempt to recognise that adoptions also took place outside the State.  I believe they are worthwhile amendments.</p></speech>

I proposed amendments Nos. 81, 82 and 103.  They are technical amendments proposed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for the purposes of accuracy.  The definition of "incorrect birth registration" is purposefully constructed so that a person who is the subject of an illegal birth registration will always come within the scope of the definition, even after the correction of the birth register.  Therefore, on the grounds of accuracy, this set of amendments simply removes the redundant words "or has been" in references to persons affected by an illegal birth registration, and this ensures alignment with other sections of the Bill.</p></speech>

As others have done, I pay tribute to the many survivors who have taken the time to email or contact us to describe their experiences and express their desire to see this legislation through and effectively give them a right to information.  We are trying effectively to reflect their experiences, which is why I have tabled this amendment.  The amendment also reflects a recommendation of our pre-legislative scrutiny report that, rather than simply saying people had their particulars incorrectly entered in the register of births, that it would be reflected that there were also cases where individuals' dates of birth and so on were falsely entered.  We wanted to capture that reality in the definitional section, section 2, and make that distinction that, in some cases, records were deliberately falsified.</p><p>That is why I am tabling this amendment.  It is reflective, as with so many other amendments in this grouping, of our findings as a committee and our recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.</p></speech>

It would not be solely up to the Minister.  It clearly states, "any institution, agency or individual".  We think it is important that that tone is clear throughout the Bill, and that it covers any institution, agency or individual, so people are not left out and people who should be held accountable do not get away.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 139 also strengthens this section.  The authority will do all in its power to assist the person in this situation.  It ensures that the State does everything possible to address potential illegal birth registrations.  We have all seen the story that was in a documentary a number of months ago about illegal birth registrations.  It is important that we have the strongest possible language about that.</p> <p>  Regarding amendments Nos. 352 and 359, we believe it is more correct and appropriate to use the term "illegal".  The reality is that it was illegal.</p></speech>

We are going to try to be more clear.  There are limits to how much we can do that because of some of the procedural rules we need to follow.  There is a list of amendments - quite a long list; longer than Bills would normally get - and on that full list the amendments that are similar have been grouped together.  The unfortunate thing is, as we discuss them, we are only discussing them by number and not the details of them, which I appreciate can make things confusing without that full amendment list being available.  However, what we then do is discuss each amendment as it is grouped.  We will discuss all the amendments in that group but only vote on amendments in numerical order.  Therefore, there will be amendments we are discussing now that we will not actually vote on until later in the session or in another session.  At that time we will only take a vote on them because the discussion will have happened now, when the first of that grouping comes together.</p> <p>  I appreciate this is complex, and given the nature of the 360 amendments, it adds to that complexity.  I appreciate that, for many people who might be watching outside of the committee rooms, if they do not have that list of Committee Stage amendments it will be almost impenetrable.  Therefore, apologies for that.  We will move on.</p> <p>  What we have done is, we have moved amendment No. 2.  We have discussed the grouping, which is amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, 70 to 76, inclusive, 81 to 83, inclusive, 104, 105, 138, 139, 352 and 359, all of which are in similar areas or related.  For any of the Deputies who tabled some of those amendments to which we have already spoken, are there amendments in that list that I have called out, either from the Deputies or from the Minister, to which we have not yet spoken?  If there are no further discussions, we can move to a vote.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her amendment.  This relates to the definition of illegal birth registration and use of the term "incorrect birth registration" within the legislation.  I am very clear and I and the Government absolutely accept that illegal birth registrations took place, and in terms of my engagement with this issue, this is how I describe them.  It is also important, speaking to the set of amendments that Deputy Cairns spoke to earlier, that we make sure as broad a number of people as possible can use the provisions of this legislation.  Our concern is if we use a definition of "illegal birth registration", there is a requirement to prove illegality before using that particular provision to benefit.  A person who is the subject of an incorrect birth registration as it currently stands can use this legislation.  If a person has to prove that his or her birth registration was not just incorrect but was actually illegal, that is a harder standard to prove.  That means the provision of using this legislation can apply to fewer people.  What we have always tried to do is broaden access to this legislation to let as many people as possible use the provisions of this legislation to get their information.</p> <p>  However, I am cognisant of the issues that have been raised about the language, so I have brought forward an amendment quite similar to Deputy Bacik's.  I asked my officials to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  This amendment clarifies that information leading to an incorrect birth registration was given to the General Register Office by a third party, and that information was not merely incorrect, but also false or misleading.  Therefore we have used that term and the addition of that language, that is, as a result of giving information that was false or misleading in respect of the name, to try to address that.  That is very similar to the change Deputy Bacik proposed.  I believe this addresses the concerns that have been raised.</p></speech>

I completely understand what the Minister is saying, that nobody wants to limit access to the provisions by causing anyone to have to prove anything, and the Minister referenced a situation where somebody would have to prove his or her adoption was illegal.  Amendment No. 72 that I have put forward inserts "or illegal birth registration information".  It is literally incorrect to say they are just inaccurate, or what is the original term in the legislation?</p></speech>

It is incorrect to say they are just incorrect registrations.  Some of them are illegal and that needs to be acknowledged.  I am not saying to replace it.  The amendment is to say "or illegal birth registration information".  I understand the Minister's sentiment of not wanting to limit it, but the argument does not make any sense.  It can include the two so that it is not limited to, but acknowledges the fact, there were illegal birth registrations, which is what people are looking for.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</p></speech>

The input of those with direct experience of adoption is essential if the services set out under the Bill are to be effective.  A previous Minister with responsibility for children, the late Brian Lenihan Jnr., set up an advisory group to assist the Adoption Authority on an information and tracing service and other matters.  Campaigners have sought that similar groups be put in place for this Bill in recognition of the complexity involved and the vital insight adopted people can provide.  The Minister and his officials create the law but adopted people live it.  It would be beneficial to the process and a strong sign of good faith from the Department to include it.</p></speech>

Consultation with stakeholders and people who benefit from this legislation have been to the forefront of the development of the legislation.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, members engaged with a large number of groups.  I have also engaged with a large number of groups and individuals.  I continue to engage with survivor groups, adopted people and their families.  Deputy Funchion and I had a useful meeting last week with a former resident.  That was important and developed my understanding of what is needed in this area.</p> <p>  In the pre-legislative scrutiny report, a recommendation was made for a role for stakeholders in the implementation of the legislation.  We considered that recommendation and, on foot of that, I will put in place a stakeholder representative group.  The work of the group will be aimed at supporting the preparation for the implementation of the legislation when it is enacted.  That work will have regard to the public information campaign we have spoken about and general awareness-raising of changes being brought about by this legislation.  The proposals for the group's role, composition and relationship are being developed by my Department.  </p> <p>  That is not the only work we are doing in the area.  Action 1 of the 22-point action plan in response to the commission's report referred to developing a new and enhanced model of engagement and we are looking at the proposal to bring forward a special advocate for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  This could look at providing a well-resourced and dynamic model of representation for former residents to make sure there is a strong advocacy voice for them on a range of issues beyond the implementation of this legislation.  We know from our engagement with survivors that their priorities are multifaceted.  For some this legislation is key, while for others it is about memorialisation or the recovery of remains, which we have already discussed.  For others again it is issues around redress or education and how the history of this period is reflected.  That special advocate model could support systematic advocacy on behalf of former residents.  The longer term, resourced advocacy model addressing survivors in the myriad of ways they require and the stakeholder group we are establishing for the implementation of this legislation constitute the preferable way to go.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 9 is in the same vein or spirit and provides that any institution, agency, organisation or individual involved in the separation of mothers and their children should be covered.  In relation to amendment No. 10, it was brought to our attention that not all care was provided by institutions.  We know that there were some <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements but there may have been periods of time when a child was with his or her mother or father but then moved back into an institution.  Our aim is to ensure that all of those situations are covered.</p><p>I stress again in relation to these amendments that they are strengthening the Bill and the language therein.  If the Department and the Minister really believe that everything is covered, I do not see why they would have a difficulty with including some of these language changes just to strengthen the Bill and to signal to the people affected that all situations will be covered.  Again, I stress that there is distrust.  That distrust is understandable, given the years of being let down, for want of a better phrase.  When one reads these amendments, one sees that their aim is to strengthen what is already in the Bill.  I do not see why we cannot include stronger language.</p></speech>

We need to guarantee that all records relating to the adoption or informal care arrangement of a relevant person are understood as that person's personal data.  These amendments simply provide for a fuller definition that will provide greater reassurance for adopted people and their relatives.  It is difficult to understand why they cannot be accepted by the Minister.</p></speech>

That sets out the types of care arrangements that are relevant to the release of information provided for in the Bill.  It is particularly relevant to the definition of a &quot;relevant person&quot; and the categories of information that are eligible for release under the Bill.  The types of care arrangement defined in the Bill include a nursed out arrangement, a boarded out arrangement, and an arrangement under which a child was cared for by a resident of an institution, among others.</p><p>On the specific amendments in this group, amendment No. 7 is not one I can support.  The definition of care arrangement is a key definition and is central to the understanding of several other definitions.  This definition is expansive and seeks to ensure that a broad range of care arrangements and areas are covered.  What is being proposed by amendment No. 7 is the removal of that and this is obviously not something I can support.</p><p>I am also not in a position to support amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10.  They seek to alter the definition of care arrangement.  The provisions of amendment No. 8 are already covered in subsection (9) of the existing definition of care arrangement contained in the legislation, which provides for &quot;an arrangement under which a child was cared for as a resident of an institution specified in the <i>Schedule</i>&quot;.  We believe that part is already covered.  Amendment No. 9 is already covered by the definition of care information which provides for the release of information to anyone who made care arrangements or was a party to them.  In that context, amendment No. 9 is unnecessary.</p><p>Amendment No. 10 seeks to expand the definition to include care provided by a parent or guardian of the child.  I understand the spirit behind this amendment but this refers to care provided to a child by its parent, outside of the institution.  We have to be very honest about the type of information we are going to have available.  When the child is with a parent and not in an institution, there will not be records of what happened in that situation.  We must be honest with people.  We have all met survivors who have tried to get their information only to be told that the information no longer exists.  Suggesting to survivors that there is information about what happened when they were cared for by their own parents outside of an institution is problematic.  That is not information that the institution has because, by its very nature, the care was taking place outside of the institution.  We can confirm that where a child was cared for by a parent within an institution, and we know that happened in many of the mother and baby homes, that information is available because obviously it is part of the institutional records but we cannot make claims about finding and delivering information about what happened outside of these institutions.  We would be raising false hope by doing that.</p></speech>

However, what we are trying to say here is that if there was a situation where a child was in a care institution, was boarded out or fostered and that did not work out and the child was sent back, it would be important that any records of that would be accessible.  That is why we are including guardians, mothers and fathers because, potentially, the child could have been boarded out with or fostered by a birth parent and then sent back to an institution.  We are trying to cover all possibilities and angles.  I know people will look at this and say that the types of situations we are trying to cover are immense and that everything is covered by the Bill.  However, when people have been consistently let down for years, if not decades, they want absolutely everything possible to be covered by this legislation to ensure that no situation is left out.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.</p> <p>  I understand some of the points made by the Minister.  There have been numerous apologies made to survivors and survivor groups over the years but the best way to honour and acknowledge that is by ensuring we respect their wishes and what they want in the wording of this legislation.  It is possible to put this wording into the Bill.</p></speech>

However, in terms of the circumstances Deputy Funchion just outlined, the type of care arrangements that are defined in the Bill clearly include a nursed out arrangement, a boarded out arrangement and an arrangement under which a child was cared for by a resident of an institution.  Our belief is that the situation that Deputy Funchion just outlined is already covered by this legislation.  We know that boarded out and nursed out arrangements are two separate things.  Nursed out children were usually very young whereas boarded out children, while still young, could be seven or eight years old as opposed to a few months old.  We believe that the very comprehensive definition of care arrangement and the various types of arrangement provided for cover all of the instances that we can envisage and would have experience of from talking to survivors over the years.  At the same time, it does not raise a false or unmeetable hope that information about what happened when an adopted person or someone boarded out was in his or her own home, cared for by his or her own parent because that information just does not exist.</p></speech>

It is important that all medical records such as X-rays are included.  That is all I have to say for now.  I may come back when the Minister responds.</p></speech>

We need definitions that incorporate the full range of people and actors involved in providing care.  The materials that recorded aspects of that care are a vital area where we need stronger definitions to help people assemble a clear understanding of their identity and heritage.</p></speech>

I do not propose to accept these amendments, primarily because we believe these definitions are already clearly contained within the existing definitions in the Bill.  Like the Deputies, we also wish to see as broad a range of categories of information as possible provided to adopted people, people who were subject to illegal birth registrations and those who were boarded out.  That is why the definition of care information provided in the Bill is expansive.  It was drafted in consultation with organisations familiar with the types of records that would be held by these institutions.</p> <p>  Many of the proposed amendments seek to capture types of information already provided for in the Bill under other categories of information: birth, early life, medical information and provided items.  The type of information these amendments propose to address is already guaranteed for release under the legislation.  For example, the information specified in amendments Nos. 14, 19, 20, 23 and 24 is already explicitly covered under the definition of early life information.  The information specified in amendments Nos. 18, 21, 23, 24 and 25 is explicitly covered by the definition of care information.  The information specified in amendment No. 13 is specifically captured under birth information.  The information specified in amendment No. 14 is set out under medical information.  The information specified in amendment No. 16 is already covered across all categories of information, birth, early life, care, medical information and provided items. </p> <p>  It is not possible to support amendment No. 22 because we believe the wording of the amendment is more restrictive than what is currently provided for under the legislation.  As such, we do not want to restrict the type of information available.</p></speech>

The definition contained in the Bill is problematic and focuses on a specific timeframe of the person's early life.</p><p>Amendments No. 27 to 64, inclusive, spell out precisely what personal data means in this context.  We are attempting to give an extensive description of personal data and provide a full and exhaustive list of personal data in terms of adopted persons and their identity.  We also seek to include information as to how the relevant persons acquired their adoptive identity, the names of their genetic family members, their county and country of origin at the time of their birth and the occupation of their parents and grandparents at the time of their birth.  We also seek to include information on the number of siblings and other relations in a person's genetic family, correspondence about the person, records surrounding the assessment and administrative processes associated with the person's adoption and the names of the people involved in that person's care.  This goes to the heart of what we have been saying all along.  We believe the amendments would ensure that everything that can be included is included.</p></speech>

The definition was highlighted as being problematic.  It is important to note this point was also raised by UN rapporteurs.

This set of amendments represents a very strong and human rights informed understanding of care information.  I encourage the Minister to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

There is quite a lot here.  The amendments govern the provision of information.  It is telling that adopted people feel they have to put forward these amendments.  I am concerned about the Bill on that basis.  I know the Minister will say the legislation is comprehensive and covers all options but we will not know that until afterwards.  The problem is that we will not know until it is too late whether they are all covered.  That is really worrying.</p> <p>  I agree with amendment No. 26.  It would be right to delete the whole lot.  All the amendments in the group are relevant and important.  They reflect the information it is felt has to be included in the section to ensure all the information and all of the options are covered.  Information is vital for adopted people.  Their whole lives are lived with a lack of information.  Amendment No. 29 refers to letters, cards or other materials placed in an adoption file by the relevant person's father or other relatives.  It states people should have access to this information.  Clearly there have been instances where people have not been given this information.  This is why the amendment has been tabled.  It is directly from experiences that people have had.  Amendment No. 30 refers to letters, cards or other material placed in the adoption file by the relevant person's mother.  There is a reason for these amendments.  It is important and the Minister should take the amendments on board and include them in the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030200002#K04100"><p>I want to recall what we are trying to do with regard to early life information.  The definition provided on page 10 of the Bill sets out the various types of information relating to a relevant person's life from birth to 18 years that are eligible to be released under the legislation.  It is not an exhaustive list but it provides clear and consistent guidance on the type of information that has to be released in all cases, which is what we are achieving with the Bill.  It is an expansive definition.  It covers many different types of information, including, among many other examples, any religious ceremony that may have taken place, whether a relevant person has had vaccinations, any record of a person's physical or emotional development and whether the mothers of persons stayed with them in an institution for any length of time.</p><p>I cannot accept the amendment because it proposes to delete the definition of early life information, which is a key definition that ensures essential personal histories are captured and released.  The fact that the word "includes" precedes the list of types of information that may be on record makes it clear that it is an expansive and not a restrictive definition.</p><p> I cannot support amendment No. 27, which proposes to delete the reference to section 2(2).  That is important because it looks at the reference to that subsection.  The function of the reference in the section is to define the period of time during which the definitions of care information and early life information apply, and it is included for accuracy and precision in drafting.  This amendment deletes the particular reference entirely, but it does not offer any substitute or alternative.  That would have the consequence of extending the period until the relevant person is 18 years old, but that amendment would have no practical effect as there would be no records in relation to care information or early life information that would extend past that cut-off point, because once a person is adopted or the persons named as his or her parents in a false or incorrect registration assume the role of parents, there would no longer be any records held by public bodies because the person would no longer be with a public body but with his or her adoptive or non-adoptive parents.</p><p> I have spoken about this with the officials.  We do not support this amendment in respect of the reference to section 2(2).  I am advised that under grouping 11, amendment No. 102, seeks to delete section 2(2), and I have asked my officials to review the potential benefits to individuals of amending that particular section.  In the context of amendment No. 102, we will look to see if there is something we can do to provide additional clarity.  That is what I have been advised in respect of amendment No. 27.</p><p> To address the extensive list of points that have been raised in amendments Nos. 28 to 63, inclusive, we are not accepting the amendments because we believe all of these issues, bar a small number that I will speak to at the end, are already covered within the definitions that we have provided under this legislation, either under the definition of early life information or the definitions of birth, care and medical information.  Amendments Nos. 45, 48, 50, 51, 54 and 56 to 59, inclusive, are explicitly provided for under early life.  Amendments Nos. 41 and 47 are clearly covered under care information.  Amendments Nos. 32, 33, 36, 37, 42 to 44, inclusive, and 61 are explicitly covered under our definition of birth information.  Amendments Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, are captured under the term "provided items".  Amendments Nos. 52 to 55, inclusive, are provided for under both medical information and early life information.  Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 are covered under both early life and care information.  I believe all of the amendments as set out are unnecessary as they are already covered.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 34, 39, 40, 42 and 46 refer to the inclusion of information that is the personal data of a relevant person&rsquo;s mother and is not therefore the personal data of the relevant person.  We cannot support their inclusion in this legislation as that would provide for the release of another person&rsquo;s data without that person's consent.</p></speech>

Deputy Funchion was making points on a good-faith gesture regarding the acceptance of amendments.  We have made significant changes between the publication of the pre-legislative scrutiny report and the final Bill.  I have already indicated that I will ask officials to review some of the points Deputies made where I feel they are legitimate.  I have made proposals that I feel, particularly in terms of illegal birth registration, respond to issues Deputies have raised.  Others have asked whether their list of amendments cannot just be accepted if we are all trying to cover what is roughly the same material.  The definitions we have in the Bill have been carefully fine tuned in accordance with engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General.  Every word has been considered and thought through, and we have examined previous legislation that did not get passed.  The provisions have been expanded to make sure they are as inclusive as possible.  The definitions of "birth information", "early life information" and "medical information" have all been planned and designed in a very specific way to work across all the various sections of the legislation.</p> <p>  I accept the point Deputy Pringle was making on the dissatisfaction of adopted people and others in seeking access to information previously, and that is why this legislation is being considered.  I have two points on the question of whether people can have confidence in Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  First, my Department is leading the implementation group.  It is being led by Ms Laura McGarrigle, the assistant secretary in this area.  It brings together our Department, Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland with a view to changing the culture in organisations in the sense of making it very clear that the presumption is one of the release of information.  I accept that has not happened in the past.  This legislation is to give very clear legal grounding for always releasing information but there has to be a culture change.  My Department is leading that through the implementation body.  I have discussed the required change to organisational culture in the past three weeks with the chief executive of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, who firmly believes in it.  Whenever he was before this committee, he was very clear on it.  I have also discussed the matter with the chairperson of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Irrespective of whether the change of culture is clear, the Minister has the power, under various sections of this legislation, to issue specific guidelines on how the release of information can be understood by the relevant bodies.  The cultural changes we are trying to achieve in the agencies and the specific guideline-writing power give us an opportunity to continue to ensure the categories we already argue are very broad can continue to be interpreted in an expansive way.</p></speech>

We are aware that there is a considerable institutional aversion to change in such organisations.  This disregards how people have been treated by them.  There is a need to acknowledge this in legislation.</p></speech>

What Deputy Cairns said is right.  There is a need for cultural change.  It has to happen at some point, and something has to start it off.  I am still worried about the period in which cultural change is to take place in that adopted people could be left behind or something could happen.  I do not know the solution or the best that can be achieved for anybody in this regard.  As is evident from the number of amendments suggested by the bodies acting on behalf of adopted people, a big task needs to be done.  It may require a leap of faith by everybody to ensure it is done.  I hope it happens.  The best way is to give all the information because there should not be anything hidden.  That is how it should happen.  We will see how it goes.</p></speech>

The definition of &quot;early life information&quot; is problematic as it currently denies access to information about a person's siblings, despite general data protection regulation, GDPR defining &quot;personal data&quot; as any information relating to a person.  Many adopted people and their siblings, whether adopted or not, are eager to learn about each other and be in contact.  We believe they must be facilitated in doing so.  Amendments Nos. 65 to 69, inclusive, are on that genetic relative information.</p></speech>

It is vitally important.  I know the GDPR argument, but this is GDPR that applies to individuals who are similar people and have similar GDPR, so there has to be away around this.  We should not be making any distinctions between adopted people and everybody else.  This is what these amendments try to avoid in the Bill.</p><p>I am fully in favour of these amendments. </p></speech>

These amendments also provide a framework to acknowledge and include relatives who may only come to light as the process evolves.  Adopted people often have to assemble disparate pieces of information, which leads to more records.  These definitions strengthen the recognition of rights to information through genetic registers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030200002#S00300"><p>I cannot support this set of amendments.  They seek to alter or expand the definitions of "genetic relative" and "genetic relative information" contained in the Bill.  These definitions were carefully considered in consultation with the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commissioner.  The definition of genetic relative is central to information release in two key ways.  First, it relates to the release of the medical information of a genetic relative where the information is necessary for the maintenance of a relevant person's health; and second, to the release of correspondence between a relevant body or secondary information source and the genetic relative of a relevant person.  It also relates to information pertaining to any visit a genetic relative may have made to a relevant person under the definition of early life information.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 65 seeks to extend that definition of a genetic relative to include grandchildren.  However, this is not relevant or necessary in any scenario where this definition applies.  For example, a record will not hold the medical information of a relevant person's grandchild and they will have corresponded with relevant bodies in relation to that person.  There is no way that someone who was in an institution up to the age of 18 will have had a letter from their grandchild because their grandchild would not have been born at that stage.  This is therefore an unnecessary amendment.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 66, the current definition of a genetic relative already sufficiently covers this, especially with regard to the reasons for defining a genetic relative within the legislation.  It is highly unlikely that a relative beyond a parent, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle or cousin would have visited or corresponded with a relevant person.  This is also relevant as regards access to medical information of a genetic relative, as it is highly unlikely that information pertaining to anyone beyond the list provided under the definition would exist within records or would be medically relevant and necessary for the maintenance of a relevant person's health.  This amendment is also unnecessary.</p> <p>  It is important to emphasise that both these amendments, Nos. 65 and 66, could jeopardise the release of a genetic relative's information to a relevant person if the definition ended up containing vague or unsupported categories of relatives, as it would not meet the necessity and proportionality test that releasing the personal sensitive data of a genetic relative to a third party would involve. </p> <p>  I cannot support the list of information suggested under amendments Nos. 67 and 69 as the name of the genetic relative and their potential status as an adopted person is their own personal data and not the personal data of the relevant person.  This was confirmed by the Data Protection Commissioner when appearing before the committee.  The other suggested additions under this amendment, namely, sex of siblings and position within the family order, are already provided for under the existing definition of a genetic relative.</p> <p>  I cannot support amendment No. 68.  Where this information is contained within a file, it will be released under the current definition of genetic relative information.  However, there cannot be a guarantee that this information is accessible and available on all files, as it is totally dependent on a person's position within the family order and whether siblings existed at the time of the record's creation.  I therefore cannot guarantee its release in all cases.  However, the database of the commission of investigation, which created a single record of a mother and her children and which we protected under legislation passed in 2020, should be helpful in that regard.</p></speech>
