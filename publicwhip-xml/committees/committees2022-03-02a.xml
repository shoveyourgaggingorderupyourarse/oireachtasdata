I want to pay tribute to Senator Paul Daly's father Se&aacute;n.  He was a great advocate for agriculture and the rural community.  If ever we need a reminder of why we sit on this committee and what this committee is about, we should reflect on the life of a man who was of the land, dedicated himself to it and will be forever immortalised in the land.  He was involved in racing through his local track Kilbeggan.  He was involved in ploughing and so many aspects of farming.  I am glad to see many of those traditions continued by his son.  I know it is a great loss not only to the Daly family but to the wider agriculture community and the local Kilbeggan community.  May he rest in peace.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to put phones on silent because this will maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the challenges facing the pig, poultry and horticulture sectors, particularly with regard to production costs and retail prices.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to a committee.  This means that a witness has full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>   Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurance in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts, and members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.  </p> <p>  We are joined today by representatives of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, including Mr. Tim Cullinan, president, Mr. Roy Gallie, pigs committee chair, Mr. Nigel Sweetnam, poultry committee chair, Ms Niamh Brennan, horticulture policy executive, and Mr. Robert Malone, senior policy executive for retail.  I invite Mr. Cullinan to make the association's opening statement.</p></speech>

Before I start, I want to speak about the Ukrainian people and, in particular, Ukrainian farmers.  I want to pass on our sympathies to them on what is happening out there at the moment.</p> <p>  Again, I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the issues facing the pig, poultry and horticulture sectors.  I am joined by IFA poultry chair, Mr. Nigel Sweetnam, IFA senior policy executive for retail, Mr. Robert Malone, and IFA policy executive for horticulture, potatoes and organics, Ms. Niamh Brennan.  </p> <p>  The challenges facing the sectors we are representing here, namely horticulture, poultry and pig farmers, are multifactorial but centre around the increasing costs of production and the dominant position of a small number of retail buyers, resulting in ever tightening margins.  These three sectors are going through a very difficult time.  Energy, feed and fertiliser bills are overwhelming for farm families trying to run their businesses.  These same farmers are being squeezed from all sides with the added actions of retailers who are relentlessly pushing down the retail price of their products and embarking on unsustainable discounting to encourage store footfall.</p> <p>  Produce from these sectors is dependent on the Irish retail sector for routes to market.  Apart from mushrooms, virtually all horticultural produce is for the home market.  Poultry production is centred around servicing the home market, with some low-value offcuts exported.  The Irish pig sector, while generating significant export value of close to &euro;1 billion per annum, is reliant on the home market, predominantly the retail trade, for 50% of all sales.</p> <p>  Retail food price deflation from 2010 to 2020 is putting huge downward pressure on farmers&rsquo; margins.  The falling price of food, and of fresh produce from the horticulture sector in particular, has resulted in squeezed margins for primary food producers and it now poses a significant threat to the viability of primary food production in Ireland in these sectors.  The horticulture sector, similar to the pigs and poultry sectors, depends on getting a viable return direct from the marketplace as farmers in this sector generally do not receive direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  While there have been some moderate increases in food prices on the shelves in recent months, the reality is that between January 2010 and December 2021, the average price of all food declined by 9 %.  Over the same period, the average level of overall consumer prices increased by 12.5%, according to the CSO.  As a consequence, only a small number of horticulture growers have survived.  They have been forced to scale up and all are extremely vulnerable today.  This situation is replicated in the pig farming and poultry sectors.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT,  analysis of the Irish agrifood sector in 2021 and clearly identified that the primary producers&rsquo; share in the value chain is very low and is well below the EU average of the total value-added share which is being passed back to farmers.</p> <p>  Today&rsquo;s retail environment is dominated by five players, Dunnes Stores, SuperValu, Tesco and the two discounters, Aldi and Lidl.  Together, these five retailers constitute 90% of the total grocery market in Ireland.  It is the latter two, Lidl and Aldi, that have fundamentally had the biggest negative impact on the price that primary producers receive for their produce.  These retailers have used fresh produce in particular as marketing tools to attract consumers into their stories, offering fresh fruit and vegetables at discount prices that do not relate to the production costs.  Retailers may claim that the cost of special promotions is funded by them and while this may be accurate on a short-term basis, the cost of such promotions is built into procurement prices over time.  The reality is that the price farmers get paid each year has consistently declined up until this year.  Many primary producers in these sectors have been forced out of business and many more will follow unless strong intervention in the market occurs.</p> <p>  Retail discounters Lidl and Aldi, in particular, use local-sounding brand names and fake farms and creameries to market many of their products.  The IFA called out this practice in summer 2021, only to be hauled into the courts by Lidl seeking a court injunction to stop IFA from highlighting this potentially misleading practice.  However, the court rejected the application by Lidl and awarded costs against it.  </p> <p>  The average price of food increased by 1.3% in 2021, the first year that food has increased in over a decade.  The price of food will have to increase further in order for the producers to be paid for their work.  The massive increase in energy and fertiliser costs in recent weeks are well documented.  These costs cannot be borne by farmers without significant increases in the food chain being passed back to the farmer.  While there has been some recognition by the retail sector of these cost increases in recent weeks, it is not nearly enough.  We need the food regulator that has been long-promised by this Government and that regulator needs to be given real statuary powers of investigation and enforcement to ensure that there is equality in the food chain.</p> <p>  The EU directive on unfair trading practices, UTP, was transposed into Irish law in April 2021.  This is a step in the right direction, but on their own, the UTP regulations will have minimal effect.  There is no recognition of the price required to produce a head of cabbage, a kilogram of carrots, a dozen eggs, a whole chicken or a pound of rashers in the UTP regulations.  </p> <p>  We are bombarded with talk about sustainability.</p><p>There are three pillars to sustainability: environmental, social and economic.  Today in Ireland we have legislation underpinning two of these pillars, environmental and social sustainability.  There is no legal protection for the economic sustainability of food producers.  This has to change.</p><p> The Government has the opportunity today and must give the new food regulator office legal powers that go beyond the UTP regulations.  It must have the authority to investigate and properly sanction those who breach the regulations.  It must ensure the farmer&rsquo;s position at the bottom of the food chain is not abused as it has been for many years.  The Department has set up the UTP enforcement authority as required under the EU directive on UTPs.  The Government has committed to setting up and funding a food regulator, or food ombudsperson, to ensure the implementation of the UTP directive and, going further, to provide greater transparency and reporting of where the value is being distributed in the food chain.  Budget 2022 committed &euro;4 million to the establishment of a food ombudsman office.</p><p> There were an estimated 350 commercial vegetable growers in Ireland in 2010.  The IFA now puts this number at fewer than 100, only one third of what we had.  This can be almost exclusively attributed to the reducing price being paid by the big retail buyers to their suppliers, forcing more and more of them out of business.  The result is what we see on the shelves today: imported broccoli from Spain, imported tomatoes from Holland, strawberries from Egypt and raspberries from Morocco.  All these crops can be grown and produced almost ten months of the year in Ireland, but only if the retailers pay the cost of local sustainable production.</p><p> Below-cost selling must be prohibited.  The IFA is calling for this to be enshrined into Irish law and regulated by the new food regulator office.  The discounting and degrading of food must be stopped.  Retail buyers must be held accountable for the declining number of farmers in these vulnerable sectors of Irish food production that depend on the Irish domestic retail market.  It is a sad state of affairs when farmers who are producing beef and dairy products, where over 90% is exported, are doing better in world markets than farmers suppling fresh fruit, vegetables, pork and poultry to be consumed here in Ireland.</p><p> I am calling on every Deputy and Senator here today to ensure legal protection is given to food producers.  Legislation on the office of the food regulator must be prioritised and must be underpinned with statutory powers of enforcement.  Below-cost selling must be banned.  Fairness must be is returned to a fundamentally unfair food supply chain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00200"><p>I thank Mr. Cullinan and the rest of the IFA delegation.  It is always good to have them in.  I have a couple of questions, so I will ask them very quickly and perhaps one at a time.  On the pig sector, is the IFA happy with what the Government has recently announced in terms of supports for the sector or does it see any shortcomings?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00300"><p>Any intervention by the Government or the State is always welcome.  The pig sector is going through an extremely difficult situation at the moment.  It is very impacted by the enormous increase in the price of feed, fuel and energy.  It is a very serious situation and we will need more intervention from the Government.  It is important that all stakeholders in the industry come together.  It is about protecting a sector that is very vulnerable at the moment.  I described where a number of vulnerable sectors are at the moment.  We have seen a massive decline in the horticulture sector.  We want to ensure we protect the pig sector going forward.  Overall, there are 8,000 people involved or employed in the sector in Ireland.  We have exports of almost &euro;1 billion a year.  It is very important as well that we have 50% of our produce sold here on the home market.  That goes right back to the practice within the retail sector of using fresh pork as a loss leader and driving down the price.  We need more measures from the Government and we also need legislation coming forward, which is the reason we are here this evening.  It is a combination of funding and legislation and everybody in the chain working together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00400"><p>I will come to the legislation on retail, specifically, shortly.  If we could turn very quickly to the horticulture sector, we have met with many of the producers and we are deeply concerned about the challenges that are there.  Growing Media Ireland, GMI, would have circulated us with a snapshot of where it sees the sector at the moment in terms of the Government&rsquo;s guidelines and the definition of the sub-30 ha rule.  There is a view that if it were to be clarified, in the sense that the 30 ha were set aside, anything above that could be left over to environmentally appropriate works.  Is that in line with the IFA&rsquo;s view on that sector at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00500"><p>Ms Niamh Brennan, our horticulture expert, will answer that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00600"><p>Our position is that there is a bit of ambiguity around the sub-30 ha definition.  If the sub-30 ha plot of land was part of a larger-scale bog that had already been exploited for horticulture for the production of peat, it would be beneficial to the sector because one would be using a bog that had already been utilised and the machinery, etc., would be in place.  This would be better than starting on a virgin 30 ha bog, as they outline it to be, where one is unsure of the quality of the peat that would there, whether any infrastructure would be available in the locality or whether there would be any expertise to go into that.  Therefore, we are in agreement with that.  If the sub-30 ha plot of land was taken as part of a larger-scale bog, historically, that would be beneficial to the position at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00700"><p>I am greatly heartened by the emphasis on retail in Mr. Cullinan&rsquo;s presentation.  I take great heart when I see the IFA taking on the retailers and, particularly, the discount multiples.  Everybody in the Government and everybody in every political party wants to see cheaper food prices and it is very important.  However, it is set out there very succinctly in the consumer price index, CPI, over the past ten years that there is only one loser in cheaper food prices and, unfortunately, that is the producer at the moment.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions on this.  Clearly, we need to do more legislatively to support farmers, and the IFA has certainly set out some of that.  The Government and the political parties need to stand shoulder to shoulder with the IFA on this issue.  We need to take on the supermarkets and multiples.  They have to be accountable.  They have been very adept and successful at their marketing and they have certainly presented an image that they are a friend and are putting a warm embrace around rural Ireland.  However, when one looks at the stark figures, that is certainly not the case.  They need to be challenged.  I am very supportive of any effort by the IFA to take the fight to them.  I am interested to tease out where the IFA sees we need to go in terms of legislative support.  Certainly, the food regulator is very important.  The UTP has its shortcomings, and I suppose for Mr. Malone in particular, we would have seen the legislation on alcohol pricing recently.  From my own discussions with small retailers, they would say that while it was not necessarily the aim of that legislation, it has levelled the playing field and the multiples cannot do the huge discounts that they were able to do.  Suddenly, the corner shop off-licence is able to compete head-to-head with Dunnes Stores on the price of a bottle of whiskey.  Do we need to get to a model like that?  Is that where we need to get to in terms of food production and food retailing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#C00800"><p>Exactly.  If one looks at a large retailer today, they have 18,000 lines in that shop.  Therefore, one line will not make or break them, whereas everything that a small local retailer sells is important.  Therefore, legislation is required.  It does not necessarily have to mean that the consumer has to pay more for a particular product.</p><p>However, the cost of production for the farmer must be recognised in whatever is paid back with the wholesale price.  That is not happening now and it is why we continuously see fresh produce in particular with fewer growers.  It is evident right across the sectors we represent today because they are more closely linked to the retail market.  It is evident with 50% of all pig meat sold by retailers and virtually all poultry product sold in domestic retail and some food service.  Retail is the biggest part of it.  All of our horticulture, except for mushrooms, is sold in the retail trade as our president has outlined.</p><p> The commodities dealing with the export market are in beef.  They are open to those markets and they are up and down; we are in a high period now.  We can see today with high commodity input prices, we have not the response from the retail trade.  That is the ultimate issue.  We need transparency so we can see clearly who is taking what from the value chain.  At least if there is transparency people will have to stand up and be accountable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#D00200"><p>Is any retailer proactively engaging and putting its hand up as having identified an issue for the producer?  Do any of them wish to work with the producers?  Is it very much a case of them standing off and doing what they want, with the farmer and producer paying the price?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#D00300"><p>We have done a full round of retail engagements and ultimately a discounter by its nature will look to offer value.  They want it at both ends.  They want it from the suppliers putting in product and that has ultimately driven down the price of food.  According to the consumer price index, the price of food is down almost 10% over the past ten years.  That is where the problem lies.  They can all say they are engaging and we see many Irish flags and farmers' pictures in all retailers.  Ultimately, it is where the man is buying the product and setting the price that we need to tackle this.  Legislation is required to open up this process so we can get accountability.  Below-cost selling is an issue but tackling it on its own is not the answer.  We must have transparency and somebody to call out these retailers.  We have seen it in the UK with Ms Christine Tacon in the role of food regulator.  It worked there and we need something like that put in place here in Ireland.</p></speech>

Is it fair to say that in many cases the producer is at the whim of those retailers, particularly with fresh products?  A person with a product is basically told what price it will be bought at and there is no choice only to accept the price.  Is that a fair analysis of the position with the discounters?</p></speech>

I know plenty of farmers and Teagasc that have done work on cost increases this year.  As we know, this year cost increases have been above and beyond what is expected.  Last October, in Ms Brennan's sector of horticulture, Teagasc did an excellent report identifying cost increases across different sectors.  There were cost increases of between 10% and 20%.  I know suppliers at the scale where they deal directly with a retailer.  They have sought 10%, 15% or 20% of an increase and have got back half of it.  That is the reality and they have not got full costs recovery.  People can take some price volatility but these producers are looking at facing into 2022 at not recovering their costs; they will be producing below the cost of production.  It is very disheartening to see a head of broccoli or cabbage retailing at less than what it can be produced for.</p></speech>

We knew input costs have increased dramatically.  Can what has happened in the pig sector be attributed to the retailer or is it about world market trends?  The price has dropped very significantly in the past couple of months.  Horticulture and poultry is more home-based and would not be as prone to variations in the world marketplace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#D00800"><p>It is a very relevant question.  Teagasc has done a nexus analysis of where the sector is now.  Farmers are losing anything between &euro;35 to &euro;40 per pig currently, and that put in the context of a 500 to 600 sow unit means it is in the region of &euro;50,000 per month.  There are multiple reasons why it happens.  There are pressures from the input side and on the back of Covid-19, there is the matter of transporting Irish pork, much of which is exported to China.  We have an excellent export market but the cost of transporting that pork increases because of factors such a lack of availability of containers and the increasing price of energy.  It has put substantial pressure on the market.  The import of grain into the country has been substantially affected by the cost of shipping.<br/><br/>The practices we see retailers using when it comes to fresh produce, whether it is meat or vegetables, continues to drive down the price.  We employed Mr. Jim Power in 2019 to look in particular at the retail beef sector, as that was struggling at the time.  I will quote a paragraph from the report at the time, as it is relevant to this evening's discussion.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The growing market share of the discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl, has fundamentally altered the retail grocery landscape and retail food prices.  The market share of Aldi and Lidl has expanded from 9.5% in October 2010 to 24.5% in November 2019.  This is not unique to Ireland.  The growth of discounters is altering the pricing behaviour of the rest of the retail grocery sector. </blockquote> <p>What has happened over the past number of years is that as discounters have moved into Ireland, there is what we might call a habit of using food as a loss leader.  That is fundamental to the problem we are experiencing this evening.</p></speech>

In the past ten years prices have fallen by approximately 9% and in the same period the number of vegetable growers, for example, has fallen to a third of what it used to be.  Given that so much of the industries concerned have a reliance on the Irish market, is it incomprehensible that our current position has been allowed to develop to this stage?  Is the challenge facing the sector even more difficult given that retailers have based their business model on the long-standing trend continuing and consumers have also become used to loss leaders and so on?  Will the witnesses give an idea of the negotiating power of the sectors concerned?  Will they give their views on the farm to fork strategy and the extent to which economic sustainability for the producers can be developed with officials to ensure food supply and security?</p></speech>

We all know the challenges we must deal with in that respect.  This is another challenge coming from the European Commission, involving taking out land and putting 25% of European land into organic farming, with less fertiliser and pesticide being used.  In itself, that will lead to less food produced in Europe.  That is very worrying, given where the world is now.  We have seen that over the past two years people have been trying to produce food in very difficult times during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Now we see what is happening in Ukraine, which is known as the breadbasket of Europe because it produces grain in particular for the feeding of animals right across Europe and the world.  I am very concerned about the farm to fork strategy.</p> <p>  We all acknowledge there are many challenges around climate change.  We are working to meet those challenges but we must be very careful not to legislate ourselves into a position where we end up with a food scarcity, which may well happen.</p><p>If we continue on this journey, we may end up with a shortage of food.  At that point, food will be at a price that the consumer will not be able to afford.  We are clearly saying that the price of food has to go up.  That is our position on farm to fork.</p></speech>

I have to go to another meeting.  On pigs, what capacity do farmers have to deal with the further increases in energy costs that are likely to be incurred immediately due to the invasion of Ukraine?  We need to be realistic.  The war is happening in real time so the consequences that will be felt in higher energy costs will be felt more immediately.  What are the IFA's views on what is needed?  I refer to the &euro;7 million package that was announced during the week by the Department.  What impact will that have for farmers in the immediate term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#E00300"><p>There is massive concern, not just in Ireland but across Europe, on the natural gas supply in particular.  Almost 50% of the natural gas that is consumed in Europe comes from Russia.  We are concerned about that and about the impact of the increase in the price of energy.  Pig, poultry and horticulture farmers are all massive users of energy so that will have a direct impact and lead to further losses for those sectors.  In the pig sector specifically, the Deputy is referencing the &euro;7 million direct aid package that the Minister has announced.  That is a first step but it will take more for any sector that has the potential to lose somewhere in the region of &euro;130 million, to quote Teagasc figures again, in a 12-month period.  This is a substantial amount of money.  The Deputy will be aware that many people in Tipperary are employed directly in the pig sector.  This is because there is a large processing plant in Roscrea.  Overall, 8,000 people are involved in the sector so we need more engagement from the Government and we need a strategy and more funding to get us out of the serious situation we find ourselves in.</p></speech>

However, I must record my disappointment that we have set to secure a meeting with two Ministers and one Minister of State, who we have asked to be present to discuss the issue of horticultural peat.  It is nothing short of a scandal that they have continuously refused to co-operate with us in that regard.  Nevertheless, the issues that have been raised this evening are incredibly important and I thank our guests for bringing them up.</p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses will take this opportunity to outline to laypeople how it is that the IFA&rsquo;s battle is with retailers.  In my county, there was a protest outside Dunnes Stores by pig and poultry farmers recently.  Many people stopped and asked me about it because the farmers do not sell their pigs and chickens directly to Dunnes Stores so they wondered why they were protesting outside the shop.  I was trying to explain as best I could the issue of retailers suppressing the prices relating to agricultural produce.  Farmers sell to processors and those processors agree a price with retailers.  As a result, the first battle is with those who are underpaying the IFA&rsquo;s members.  It does not matter if Dunnes Stores decides to give away the food for nothing if farmers are paid a fair price for it.  That is all that we want to see.</p></speech>

The reason we are here is that this is a serious situation.  I want to comment on the meeting with the two Ministers and one Minister of State.  This is a good initiative on the part of the Chairman.  It is important that the two Ministers and one Minister of State attend because peat is a serious issue.  We have been engaging a lot with the committee on that topic.</p> <p>  Mr. Sweetnam is with me.  He is chairman of our poultry committee.  There is a lot of poultry in Deputy Carthy&rsquo;s area so I will ask Mr. Sweetnam to comment on this first.</p></speech>

As poultry farmers, we see the multiple buyers as bully boys who have forced down the retail price of our products.  Our products are produced to the highest standards in the world, yet we are getting one of the lowest prices in Europe for it.  We have been to the processors looking for money but the intermediaries are already battling with the increase in the price of feed, which is astronomical and going up to &euro;250,000 per week extra just to feed the birds.  Their backs are to the wall and they have a poor relationship with the supermarkets, which are refusing to even give them a price increase for their costs, not to mind our costs.  That is why we were at the door of the retailers and we got no response back from them.  We have been waiting for representation from Dunnes Stores for three years so that is what brought us outside their doors and that is what it took to get it to talk to us.</p> <p>  Along with Mr. Cullinan and Mr. Malone we have met representatives of most of the supermarkets and they all know our costs.  We did not have to tell them how much soy or gas had gone up; they all knew already.  Getting the price back through the food chain is our big problem.  Our costs to produce chicken are double what they were this time last year.  As a result, the big battle we face is to get the money back to the farmers who need it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#E01400"><p>It is valid to ask how we ended up outside the doors of the retailers.  Our farmers are all busy and they do not want to be outside the doors of retailers, nor do I.  I wrote to all the retailers before Christmas because the problem was escalating and the reason we target retailers is that they are our route to the market.  Some 50% of pigmeat is sold in the Irish market, which is an excellent market to have.  It is the best market we have.  The vast majority of poultry and horticultural products are sold in the Irish market as well.  We engaged with a number of retailers but we protested outside the premises of the retailers that did not engage with us.  As primary producers it is important that we are able to engage with all actors in the chain.  We are relying on the retailers for a route to the market and that makes it very important that all actors will sit around the table with us to discuss where we are coming from.</p> <p>  The other reason we were there is because of the massive impact that the extraordinary price increases we are dealing with has, particularly with the cost of feed and energy.  That has put us in a serious loss-making situation.  The retailers we engaged with acknowledged this and they pointed out that they have a practice with a range of produce whereby they have contracts from six months to one year in duration.  They gave us a commitment, which we need to see followed through on, that they would go back to their processors and suppliers because of the extraordinary circumstances and look at the contracts again.  That is why we were there.</p> <p>  If one looks at poultry in particular-----</p></speech>

I am trying to get to the core of why that is not the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#F00200"><p>I was coming to that.  The money has to trickle down the supply chain from the retailer to the processor and down to the farmer.  The ask from poultry farmers was for 15 cent of an increase in the price of a chicken and a 2 cent increase on the price of an egg.  On pigmeat, they need to be able to get 50 cent at retail level down the line, which is a minimum increase at retail level.  We had best be clear.  The people dealing directly with retailers would be afraid, and there is no point in saying otherwise, to stand outside their doors as they would run the risk of being delisted.  That is a major issue for them.</p></speech>

Are farmers afraid to stand outside the gates of their direct contractor, as in the processors?</p></speech>

If we did not have that engagement, we would have to stand outside their premises as well.  We want to be able to engage and have direct dialogue with all actors in the supply chain.  The retailers were not having that dialogue or engagement with ourselves and that is the reason we were outside their premises.  It is very important in this sector that everybody would act together from the primary producer down the line.  In some instances, there is a secondary processor along with a primary processor before the product gets to the retailers.  All those actors must be able to engage in a proper manner.  People must acknowledge when there are extreme circumstances, as there are currently with the extraordinary costs with which the primary producer is trying to deal.</p></speech>

How important is the establishment of a food ombudsman office in addressing the broad range of issues that were mentioned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#F00800"><p>It goes back to the Deputy's fundamental first question.  The food chain, as it stands, is broken.  If farmers are protesting outside a retailer with which they do not deal directly, they are doing that because their costs are not recognised through that food chain.  That is why we are here.  We need legislation to make this food chain transparent, to open it up to see who gets what and to make sure there is fairness right through the food chain.  If somebody is dealing directly with a processor and is not on the ground producing pigs or chickens, he or she is a step removed from the reality facing the farmer.  The Deputy is right in what he said.  In normal circumstances Mr. Sweetnam would go into his processor to supply chickens, outline his costs and negotiate a price increase and that would be it.  However, it has gone to a stage where that provision is not in the food chain.  We need somebody with legal powers to do a legal overview of the food chain, to request the books to see who is getting what out of the food chain and where the value is going.  Ultimately, that is why we are here today.  We need to establish the office of a food regulator, fully fund it, have it up and running in order that, on foot of a complaint, I or anybody else can get the regulator to investigate it and call out malpractice.  Ultimately, that is why we are here.  Retailers are not recognising the cost of production.</p></speech>

He asked how can we get a solution to this problem.  The establishment of the office of a food ombudsman was part of the unfair trading practices directive.  The Deputy will recall we had a beef task force.  The Department commissioned Grant Thornton to carry out an investigation into the margins along the supply chain, to ascertain what margin the retailer had and what margin the processor had.  We all know the result of that was that we did not get an answer.  The Deputy rightly probed that also.  I was a member the beef task force for the final year of its term.  When we were not able to get that information, the Minister came before the task force and committed to introducing primary legislation to establish a food regulator to strengthen the powers of the ombudsman.</p> <p>  I would like to hear from this committee that we would get its support to ensure that when the legislation comes on to the floor of the D&aacute;il, the regulator would get proper powers.  There is no point in introducing legislation if it is not targeted in the right direction.  By that I mean the person appointed must have the power to ascertain where the margin is at.  We know one thing for certain, the margin is not with the farmer at present.  We are open and transparent.  We are willing to show our margin.  I ask the committee for its support in bringing forward that request to the Minister to ensure when this legislation comes on to the floor of the D&aacute;il it will be effective and the person appointed will be able to check the margin along the food supply chain.  We do not want to revert to what we had with the Grant Thornton report when it failed to find out the answer to that question for us.</p></speech>

I voted against it because I did not think it was sufficiently robust.  I thought it gave too much latitude for governments to take a minimal approach.  The Irish Farmers Association had quite a go at me for voting against it and I was challenged in many a forum, but that is its job as a lobby organisation.</p> <p>  I will outline the problem I have with where we are at now.  The Government transposed the directive, essentially, on the last day it could do so.  It left it until the last moment and did it on a minimal basis, as I had feared.  Since then, it has two or three members of staff working in the enforcement unit it was obliged to establish.  Last May, the Minister told the D&aacute;il he intended to establish a food ombudsman or regulator by the end of last year.  He told us this month it will be established by the end of this year.  It is nine months since the original commitment was given and we have been told it will take an extra three months than was originally anticipated.  Does Mr. Cullinan have confidence on foot of his direct dealings with the Minister or the Department that when we have sight of this legislation, it will do precisely what he has set out, namely, it will have the teeth to address the imbalances that exist within the food chain?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we were protesting outside two Dunnes Stores retail premises at that time.  The Minister's was very clear in what he said when answering a question put to him by the media seeking his response to the action taken by Irish farmers.  This is an important point.  He clearly stated that farmers cannot continue producing food below the cost of production.  If the Minister and this House are serious about that statement, it will take legislation to address it.  The Deputy asked me if I am confident about it.  I suppose I have to be confident and I like to take people at their word.  The Minister spoke at our annual general meeting in the Mansion House a few weeks ago and he clearly stated this legislation would be on the floor of the D&aacute;il during the first quarter of the year.  It is March now and we need it to be brought to the floor of the D&aacute;il before the end of March.</p></speech>

Ms Brennan will probably be best placed to answer both of them.  A &euro;7 million package was announced for the pig sector, which will work out at approximately &euro;20,000 per pig farmer.  The Minister is on record as saying that is all he is allowed to give under the <i>de minimis</i>rules.  What else is needed?  Has the IFA a proposed avenue in order to support pig farmers who are still on their knees?</p><p>My second question relates to horticultural peat.  The horticulture sector is dealing with the same challenges faced by every other sector with increased input costs and energy costs, in particular, and there is a matter of how we address that.  Where does the threat of peat input fall in terms of the price crisis?  Which is more important?</p><p>Deputy Flaherty mentioned plots smaller than 30 ha.  Have any statutory bodies engaged with the IFA to deal with the proposal in the working paper on this issue that will address how we can extract peat in a sustainable way on plots smaller than 30 ha?</p></speech>

We are clearly stating and understand that any funding we get is taxpayers' money.  We are conscious of that.  We are trying to support a sector.  Much of the money generated in this sector goes back into the local economy, which is important to remember too.  The Minister can increase the funding above &euro;7 million.  I am acutely aware of that.  More funding will be needed.  We need everybody to sit down and negotiate how that will happen and to put in place structures around it.  The Minister is not restricted to just &euro;7 million.  More funding can be provided.  It is critical that we have a structure and a way to protect this sector until a time that the market starts to improve.  The market will improve.  The major concern is about where inputs are going.  I mentioned the situation in Ukraine earlier.  This is worrying.  Will we be able to lower input costs again?  There has to be more intervention in funding by the Minister and Government.</p></speech>

The peat issue has been overshadowed by the retail issue and the crisis in the horticultural sector in the last weeks.  The issue is still to the fore.  We are losing growers from the industry because they cannot continue to endure the measures.  In the 1999 census, there were nearly 400 horticulture bed growers.  In 2014, there were 150.  It is now estimated that there are fewer than 100.  Our critical mass has been eroded.  It is feared that if we go below that, we will not have a core base to be able to re-establish the horticulture industry.  There is no point in talking about any policy or specific strategy that is in place to try to expand or redevelop the sector if we do not have that core mass.</p> <p>  The availability and subsequently the cost of peat is a significant issue.  We estimated before Christmas that the cost would have increased by over 40% because of the imports.  There are also issues of the quality and availability of that peat.  We are continuing to bang the drum about that.  We recently engaged with the Department on this, especially with regard to the proposed action plan that was published alongside the final report.  We did the final report.  Members of the IFA were involved with it.  There were 14 meetings to try to find alternatives to peat.  It is evident that they are not available at the minute and it will take some years for them to be in place.  Our main issue was the contradiction in that action plan, whereby it focuses on bogs smaller than 30 ha.  That will not be sufficient in the short term for peat for the commercial horticultural sector.  We need peat in substantial quantities for commercial matters, not just for the hobby market.  A certain quality and quantity need to be available, especially in the current market.  We will come back to that.  I welcomed the Deputy's earlier comment about ministerial engagement.</p> <p>  The two main positive points in the action plan are that two experts are to be appointed.  One is to address legal aspects for anyone wishing to be involved with the bogs smaller than 30 ha, while the other is to find out the actual requirements of the Irish horticultural peat industry.  We welcome that.  We want those people to be appointed as soon as possible.  There cannot be more delays.  We have been waiting for this final report for more than a year, with many meetings.  If there is to be the same scenario, waiting for those two experts to be appointed, we might as well put that to bed.</p> <p>  We will take the peat issue further in the next weeks.  The issue of retailers and margins is to the fore.  Import substitution is mentioned in various policies.  In 2020, we imported more than &euro;1.3 billion worth of fresh fruit and vegetables.  Import substitution erodes the critical core mass of growers.  Where is the opportunity?  They will not be allowed an opportunity, not to mention the issues of peat and labour.  We will not mention that today, but all of the issues that existed last year are still there.  It is becoming more critical because the margins are eroding and we are losing growers.</p></speech>

Much has been covered.  We have representatives here from the pig, poultry and horticulture sectors.  It is obvious that the system is broken and that is why the witnesses are before us.  This can be compared with the dairy sector, where we have a co-operative movement, and there are not the same governance issues encountered by farmers.  If Nigel has a problem with his milk price, he can go to the Bandon or Carbery co-operatives.  There is a line of command all the way.  In this scenario, farmers are very vulnerable when it comes to the retailer.  Other members have mentioned where the processor fits into this sector.  They are not co-operatives, but private industries in many ways themselves and they must make a buck too.  Tying the farmer, the processor and the retailer in together to make sure that farming at the primary level can be supported is a significant issue.  Do the witnesses believe the food ombudsman is the silver bullet to solve this?  We need to progress legislation to have the capability to tie all three together.</p> <p>  The UK model has worked to a degree.  It is not the success story that we have talked about here.  I am concerned that the silver bullet that we have talked about, which is the ombudsman, and that person tying all three entities together within years will require a huge amount of work.  We need a template of how that can help.  I am interested in the witnesses' views.  Is the ombudsman the silver bullet for the industry?  Can it be legislated for appropriately and financed appropriately?  What membership and workforce will the ombudsman's office have to deal with these substantial, complex issues?  We have seen success with ombudsmen.  Ms Dixon is in charge of data protection and is undoubtedly one of the most competent and capable people in Europe.  There are issues with ombudsmen around Ireland.  They have not been the success story that we have talked about before.</p> <p>  Will the president tell me his vision of what power the ombudsman would have?  How would the ombudsman deal directly with all three entities that are being talked about?  How does he believe that body can be funded appropriately?  Who should fund it, so that it can deliver for farmers at the farm gate?</p></speech>

We need a system that will work.  There are four sectors involved, because the potato sector is similar.  It relies on the retail market.  I spoke to people from the potato sector yesterday.  They are in a similar situation to the one being discussed here.  Last year, our concern was about liquid milk.  It also relies on the retail sector.  The Senator is right that the system is broken.  We have to find a solution to that.</p><p>The UTP directive in itself will not resolve this issue.  I have been clear from the start that a number of things need to happen and the Minister bringing forward primary legislation relating to a regulator is one part of it.  The UTP is a softer approach but we need the legislation, which is why I would like a commitment from this committee around that legislation and that this person will have the powers.  The Senator is right.  There are three actors in the chain - ourselves, the processors and the retailers.  We need clarity once and for all.  All of the people around this table this evening have been working to try to establish where the margin is for a long number of years and we have an opportunity now.  We need the help of these Houses.  The first thing we need is legislation around this regulator.  </p><p> Regarding the second part of it, this has happened recently with the banning of below-cost selling of alcohol and using alcohol to get consumers into stores.  We cannot and will not be allowed to continue with the practice because we will not survive.  The sectors we represent will not survive if we continue with the practice of below-cost selling of our produce.  From the day discounters came to this country, the practice of using our produce as a loss leader started.  They put photographs of farmers inside shops and then discounted our produce.  </p><p> The Senator mentioned funding.  The Government must put funding in place.  This funding will be used very well if we can get a solution to this and we do not end up in the current situation where pig farmers are losing anything up to &euro;40 per pig and poultry farmers risk going out of business.  We have already seen a mass exodus from the horticulture sector.  We have to make this work for the survival of these sectors.</p></speech>

A package of somewhere in the region of &euro;7 million was put in place for this industry.  Mr. Cullinan mentioned that a Teagasc report put losses in the industry at &euro;120 million in losses.  I might be wrong.  If so, please correct me.  Given that the cost of energy, feed and labour is only going one way in the next 12 months and the cost of transport is a significant issue when it comes to getting products to market as it is only going one way as well, where do Mr. Cullinan and Mr. Sweetnam see the future when they look at the pig and poultry industries?  These are not short-term issues.  You could argue that the survival of these two industries in particular is a long-term issue at this stage when it comes to the projected price of energy, feed, labour and transportation.</p></speech>

We have massive concerns, one of which concerns feed.  If we are going to survive, we are going to have to get a better return from the marketplace.  There are two areas we can get that.  I will speak about the pig one while Mr. Sweetnam will speak about the poultry one.  Fifty percent of what pig farmers produce is sold here at retail level.  It is paramount that we get regulation around this in order that we can see where the margin is and regulate so that we will get a fair price going forward.  That is part of the solution.</p> <p>  We can look at energy as well.  For years, we have been listening to the Government saying that farmers are part of the solution in respect of climate change.  If the Government had a proper policy on renewable energy, we could become energy producers ourselves, which would alleviate part of the problem around energy, so there is more we can do.  The Senator is right.  We need to look at where our energy is coming from.  The value of energy being imported into this country is in the region of &euro;8 billion per year.  We as farmers are willing and able and have been asking the Government for support on this for a long number of years.  It is high time Government took this issue seriously.  </p> <p>  They are the areas we must work on.  Inputs like feed are out of our control.  It is about market forces and world market prices and we have to deal with those.  The solution in the pig sector and other sectors is, first of all, about being able to get a proper price at retail level.  Obviously, we will have to work on world markets as well.  There is a job of work for Bord Bia to do to find and open up new markets.  There are markets in regions of North America and we need more promotion.  There is demand for pigmeat in California at present.  These are areas we need to focus on.  We all understand that the past two years were very difficult for our agencies, including Bord Bia.  The Minister was on his first trade mission in Dubai only two weeks ago.  We need to see more trade missions.  We need to get out there and get a foothold in new markets.  Mr. Sweetnam will give us an update on the poultry sector.</p></speech>

The first is the regulator to make sure we do not end up in this situation again.  In the short term, we need a price increase for our product.  I have seen 20 years of false dawns in renewables.  I had one of the first biomass boilers that could actually burn poultry litter and produce energy.  We could have a carbon-neutral chicken and produce electricity and heat from the litter under the chickens.  Two thirds of the litter would produce enough energy to rear that chicken but that needs to be supported.  It is being supported everywhere else in Europe.  We are competing against chickens in Northern Ireland.  Twenty years ago, I put a boiler into my farm.  If I put in the same boiler in Northern Ireland, I would be getting &pound;79,000 per year in a subsidy.  Here, I got nothing.  I had the first licence in Europe to burn poultry litter.  We have spoken about renewables here but that is all we have done.  We have just paid lip service to it.  The only green measure we have had to date has been a carbon tax, which is another joke.  Paying VAT on carbon tax is crippling us.  It is a tax on a tax.  This is one area we could look at immediately.  Carbon tax could be suspended or at a minimum, we could ensure that no VAT is applied to it.  To go back to electricity, every poultry house in Ireland should have solar panels on the roof.  It is a no-brainer.  There are huge sheds, the facility and usage are there and it is 24-7 so whatever power that is produced during the day will be used inside the poultry house and that can be supplemented.  Reverse metering on electricity is not a big ask.  The Minister announced targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, funding in this regard but limited it to 5 kW or 12 kW.  That is a domestic house, not a poultry farm.</p> <p>  Those are three areas.  We need an immediate price increase to keep the show going.  We have seen guys getting their returns back from the factories and because they are paid by the processor, their energy bills are double what they were this time last year.  When we protested outside supermarkets, we saw there was a willingness on the part of the public to pay an additional 15 cent or an additional 2 cent for the egg guy.  Some of the discounters were offering half of what we needed but that is just not an option.  We have to get cost recovery and that is only to maintain our margin.  We are not looking to improve our margin.  In the long term, we are looking for the regulator in order that we are not in this situation.  Another thing we are looking for is proper support in renewables, not just lip service.</p></speech>

The clock is ticking.  The need for peat to be extracted is very much required.  The horticulture industry in particular needs it rather than for it having to be imported directly from another country, which is slightly bizarre when we look at the carbon footprint involved.  The IFA might give us its view regarding the timelines pertaining to when we potentially need to have licences in place in order that we can have the extraction of peat required to keep the industry alive.</p></speech>

The answer is immediately.  We are importing peat every week at the minute.  The Minister told us a stockpile of 2,000 tonnes of peat was found when the final report was outlined but, unfortunately, he failed to mention that these 2,000 tonnes will not be of any use to the mushroom sector.  We were not aware of the quality or availability of the 2,000 tonnes.  That will go nowhere once the main season begins.  That answer is that we need it in place immediately if the Government wants to put an end to this environmental hypocrisy whereby we are importing peat to keep the show on the road.  Our main season is starting.  The amenity sector will have an event next year to mark the beginning of the season.  It is in place.  The way the environment has gone, people want local fresh produce with a sustainable substrate in order to do that.  My answer to that question is immediately.</p></speech>

It gives me the opportunity not to repeat the questions already posed but to have a conversation with the witnesses.  I want to start by welcoming the IFA.  I was in the mart in Kilcullen last Tuesday and, over a cup of coffee, a number of people asked what the IFA was doing for them.  We are talking about prosperous country that comprises Timolin, Moone and Ballitore, down into County Carlow, and Athy and Fontstown - great agricultural lands and communities.  I was glad to say that the IFA is doing a hell of a lot.  That is really important.  I said it is in and out of these Houses at night working for and representing them.  I want to acknowledge that.</p><p>As someone who has sat on this committee for two years, I see the work of the IFA.  I see media coverage in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>, <i>agriland.ie</i>and all other publications and provincial papers.  We have them all upstairs in the library.  They all come in here on a Thursday and I take the time to look, read and see the measure of the publicity.</p><p>I am not going to be critical but I will give the IFA a little bit of advice.  The ask has to be very succinct.  I sit and hear people around this table talking about being disappointed.  The reality is that we have a national Government made up of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  The reality is that we have three Ministers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, namely, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon, who is from County Kildare.  I unable to square up why we are having these difficulties in agriculture when we have three Ministers.  It has been ably demonstrated today when we have a situation whereby we cannot get the three Ministers to appear before this committee.  Here we are; it is not the IFA's problem but our problem in these Houses.  Yet they come in every week, eloquently read the IFA's statements and ask us to tell them what we think.  There is a bit of a disconnect there.  We need to sharpen up our messages.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and see how representatives from the construction industry come in.  They do not make any secret of what they want.  They spell it out crystal clear and make hard, sharp asks.  I say that in a helpful way not to be too provocative.  That is an important thing to say, however.</p><p>I acknowledge the enormous work done by the IFA.  I think back on the great politics of agriculture and the witnesses' predecessors, who managed and leveraged that political power on politicians.  We need to do something on that.  I want to share that with the witnesses.  I thank the IFA for its ongoing briefings.  I read its statement today and there are two issues I wish to take up.</p><p>I acknowledge the importance of the horticultural sector being the fourth largest after beef, dairy and pigs.  I am really saddened and disappointed by what Ms Brennan said but she has given us a dose of reality today in terms of the horticultural sector and our growers dropping.  I like to divide horticulture into ornamentals and crops, and then, of course, the mushroom sector on its own.  What a wonderful industry we have had up until now.  I think we are somehow failing to communicate the real challenges.  Somehow, we cannot crack it.  We had debates in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on this issue and yet we have a national Government and three Ministers in the Department who are all based in rural constituencies representing rural communities.  I do not understand that.</p><p>I would like Ms Brennan to provide some more detail to the committee although not necessarily today.  I would like more detail with regard to the mushroom sector and the real prices.  We need to be equipped with the knowledge the IFA has as professionals representing those sectors, be it poultry, pigs or horticulture, to continue to advance an argument.  No one has taken this seriously to date.  That is really disappointing.  As I said, I think that is important.  I understand that horticulture is not a big sector in terms of IFA representation.  Yes, it has the horticultural sector and forestry and all the other bits but it is an area in which we have great opportunities.  There is a demand for horticulture, food and so forth.</p><p>I also want to pick up what on someone said.  If we look at all the multiples and advertising in all the papers, they have suddenly glamourised farming.  Farmers now have designer boots, coats and jackets, and lovely orange carrots that are varnished.  They are using this to sell produce.  I will not name any of them.  I will not give them that publicity.  I bump into people and ask myself whether it is a real person or not.  They are all dressed up in Hunter boots, cut-off jackets and designer hairdos with their family - Johnny and the designer sheepdog - telling us to buy Irish and wear Irish producers.  It is a very nice image and I am impressed by it but we cannot be fooled by it.  That is another concern.  I see the concerns in terms of the multiples and the challenges the IFA has.</p><p>On page 4 of the IFA's submission, there is a reference to UTPs.  Clearly, such practices are hugely challenging for the IFA.  The Minister is undertaking a survey, which is to be completed by 15 March.  Has any of the IFA's members engaged in that.  Has the IFA encouraged them to engage in that?  What is its view of the survey?  It strikes me as yet another survey.  Surely, the Minister and his officials know what the problems are.  They do not need another survey of farmers.  I do not know the uptake in respect of all of that.  The IFA might share with us its knowledge of the survey, how it is going and what it thinks of it.  Dare I ask if the IFA thinks it is even necessary.  I do not necessarily think so but I would be interested to see the results of the survey.</p><p>The national food ombudsman's office is in the programme for Government, therefore, I presume this Government is going to implement this.  Ultimately, the national food ombudsman will eventually take over the powers of the unfair trading practices enforcement authority.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.</p><p>As I said, I acknowledge the important work the IFA does on behalf of farmers across the country.  They do not see it here tonight.  It is not necessarily reported in all the media.  The IFA provides a great service to agriculture and to the rural communities in this country.  It is important to say that.</p></speech>

I welcome his acknowledgement of the work the IFA does.  He mentioned the horticulture sector and representation.  I will be very clear on this.  We represent a multitude of all farmers.  We focus our attention, in particular at a time when any sector is in trouble or bother, by putting extra resources and time around that sector, which we are doing within the three or four sectors we are representing here this evening.</p></speech>

We were all very disappointed with the reaction we got.  The Senator is right; there are three Ministers in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We probably should not have to be here.  This is our job, however, and we must continue to highlight the concerns within our sector.</p> <p>  The Senator made one excellent point when he spoke about a national Government.  We have the two main parties in government, but we also have the Green Party.  I get confused.  I cannot really understand the policy of one party in government, namely, the Green Party.  It is important that we have an open debate when we are here.</p></speech>

There is a misdemeanour here somewhere.  We have a party encouraging the growing of more horticulture and this serious situation where we are seeing a serious decline in that sector at present.  I have to question the policies and how this will help the climate change debate, which we are engaging in and working on.  Farmers have already done a lot around climate.  I am confused regarding that.</p><p> The Senator spoke about getting the three Ministers in front of the committee but another group needs to appear, one we have been discussing for the past hour, which is retailers.  It would be a very useful exercise to get the other side of the story as well.  I am not telling the committee what to do, but if that could be facilitated, it would definitely be a very useful-----</p></speech>

The Senator mentioned farmers being dressed up and all of this that goes on.  I will bring us back to June of last year when one of the discounters was using fake brands and fake creameries.  The advertising was incorrect and when our association took a stand and highlighted this in the media, which was the proper thing to do, it did not go down very well with that particular discounter.  It took a challenge against us, went all the way to the High Court and sought an injunction against our association, which was highlighting fake branding by that discounter.  That was very concerning.  The outcome was correct in that the judge saw that the discounter was incorrect in what it was doing.  Not alone did he not grant the injunction, he granted us our costs on the day.  We should not have to go to those lengths to try to protect our sectors.  That is the length we had to go to last year.  The reason I referred to that is the Senator asked me about a survey.  I have not engaged in a survey.  Like him, I believe we need to sit around the table with these people and engage, as I said, with all the actors in the chain.  That is the survey we need.</p> <p>  I will go back to what the Senator said, which is very important.  The Seanad is a very useful part of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It goes back to us needing every bit of support we can get.  He is correct about the food ombudsman.  We need more around this legislation and around a regulator that will get in there and will see whether the margin is with the retailer or processor.  The other side of it is that I am asking the Senator for the support of the Seanad tonight, in getting the legislation to stop, once and for all, this practice of below-cost selling.</p></speech>

The IFA has my support unequivocally.  We have an agricultural panel in this Seanad, which always reminds me of how engaged our agricultural bodies are with that panel.  It always strikes me.  I acknowledge the enormous work of the agriculture members on the panel who are present, including Senators Tim Lombard, Paul Daly and others, who work exceptionally hard.  I actively engage with them.  They are representing agriculture in the Seanad on panels that the IFA has a major influence on.  I believe it can use them.</p><p>I will make an ask of the IFA because it is important to make asks of all of us, to assist us in getting the three Ministers who represent three rural communities and the IFA's membership in those three constituencies in front of the committee.  We are talking about Laois-Offaly, Donegal and Kildare.  I ask the IFA to use its influence and, by Golly, it has influence in the media, including the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>and other publications.  I would like it to use those publications; I understand the IFA is a stakeholder in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>.  It might use that influence to put pressure on the three Ministers to support us in our fight to support farmers.  I look forward to running to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service next Thursday to see that.  The deadline might be too tight for this week, but I want to see the IFA supporting us to get these Ministers in front of the committee so we can hold them to account for the IFA and the industry.</p><p>Ms Brennan might like to touch on the seriousness of the peat issue. </p></speech>

It is critically important that they come before the committee.  As I said, the horticulture situation is very serious.  We do not want to see the demise of another industry.  We saw the demise of the beet industry a number of years ago.  Once an industry goes, we can never revitalise it again.</p></speech>

It was at a critical point this time last year, let alone now.  I will touch on the mushroom industry.  A number of our members have been involved directly with the committee on this and they are happy to again meet anybody here at any opportunity in order to get across the exact criteria of the mushroom industry.  Many of those in the mushroom industry in particular are very frustrated about the fact their exact requirements were not known by certain members of the Government or outlined in the final report.  There could have been a figure for the mushroom industry that was counterproductive to its requirements.  In addition, there is 80% water in any mushroom peat that needs to be imported into the country.  It is at a critical point.  If the mushroom industry gets to a stage where it has to import a product that is 80% water into the country, we have to ask ourselves a big question about what we are doing.</p></speech>

It is our Tipperary way of pointing someone in a different direction.  The Chairman and the Senator would know that.</p><p>My question may have been answered.  There seems to be a very relaxed attitude at departmental level to giving the unfair trading practice directive the teeth it is supposed to have.  I do not understand why that is the case although maintaining the <i>status quo</i>seems to be the preferred option by the looks of it.  Will the representatives give us the IFA's take on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022030200002#K01300"><p>I will answer that.  The unfair trading practices directive is a European directive.  As Deputy Carthy outlined, he was involved in it a number of years ago.  It goes not go far enough.  If we go through it, there are 16 unfair trading practices that are banned by the directive and minimum requirements are to be enforced for all new contracts and existing contracts from 28 April this year.  I have no doubt they will be but they do not go anywhere near far enough.  The words "price recognition" of the cost of production are never mentioned in the context of an unfair trading practice.  Terms and conditions of trading, terms of payment and those kind of things are mentioned as they relate to unfair trading practices.  That is why we are here today.</p> <p>  To go back to the Senator's advice, we have a specific ask.  When committee members get a chance to scrutinise this legislation, we want them to look for proper teeth in the powers of the food regulator or the ombudsperson, whatever it is termed, of engagement with retailers, investigation and enforcement in order to call out people who are not recognising the cost of production.  Whether it is Mr. Cullinan as a pig farmer or Ms Brennan's horticulturist members, their costs of production are not recognised in those prices.  That is ultimately where the problem is.  If the price set by a retailer for a packer or processor is not enough, the farmer will ultimately lose. </p></speech>

We are at a critical juncture in all of this.  The Deputy is correct that the UTPs will not do what we need done now.  We need to strengthen the UTP and the only way we can do that is through legislation.  Again, that legislation will be coming to the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p><p>As we said earlier, the Minister has committed to doing this, but the legislation must be strong and capable of giving a person the power to go along the food supply chain to see where the margin is.  We saw this in 2018, when farmers protesting at the gates over beef prices led to the establishment of the beef task force.  As we stated here earlier, Grant Thornton failed to find out where the margin was at the time.  We now have an opportunity to protect all sectors in farming but the legislation needs to be strong.  It will be scrutinised properly in the D&aacute;il and by this committee, which is important.  The legislation needs to have power.  We need to go a step further than envisaged in that, as well as having a food regulator, we need a regulation to prevent the use of food as a loss leader within stores once and for all.  Our real ask this evening is to have the legislation we require.  It will protect a sector in rural Ireland.  It will protect not just one sector but four or five whose only route to market is the retailer.  We need protection from retailers.  We never see the profits of many retailers.  They are in this country but their headquarters are in other countries right across Europe.  We just have to get the legislation to protect our sector.</p></speech>

Ninety-five percent of the people we met in Dunnes Stores in Cork were supportive of the 15 cent increase per chicken that we were looking for.  That was all we were looking for to cover our end and keep us profitable.  We want support from the committee for the establishment of an ombudsman or regulator to do the job for us.  We should not have to be doing what we did over the past two weeks.  There should be a statutory approach.  Supermarkets should not have the power basically to throw away our product to get footfall.</p></speech>

I support Senator Boyhan.  I appreciate where the Chairman is coming from, in that two Ministers agreed to come, but the Ministers are like three children, in that we cannot get the three of them into the committee together.  I encourage the IFA and other bodies to put pressure on the Department and Ministers so the latter will come in here, as Senator Boyhan requested, to help us to help the delegates.  While they are dragging their feet, it is very hard to put any plan together.  As Senator Boyhan said, the delegates need to start putting massive pressure on the three Ministers to stop this nonsense of saying one of them is not coming but that another is, or that they will appear only if all three are together.  They should appear before this committee to start answering questions so we can start helping the sectors.</p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice has been on hold all day.  It is not like him to be so quiet.  I texted him but he does not seem to be available.</p> <p>  I thank the representatives of the IFA for attending.  They have made an excellent presentation to the committee.  The legislation is very important.  We will write to the Minister and look for an exact timeframe as to when it will be before us.  All stakeholders, including retailers, will be invited in to give their views on the legislation and how it will work in practice.</p> <p>  Below-cost selling of alcohol was mentioned already.  The measures put in place have levelled the pitch.  They were implemented on health grounds more than anything else but the matter under discussion is about the survival of important sectors in our economy.  I assure the delegates that members will do their utmost to ensure the legislation introduced will have the teeth necessary to do what we want it to achieve, that is, to prohibit below-cost selling using loss leaders to attract footfall to stores at the expense of the primary producer, as mentioned by the IFA president on a few occasions.  That practice has to stop.  We need to get a fair price for our produce.  A price that covers just the cost of production is a very fair ask.  This committee will do all it can to get the legislation through as quickly as possible.  It will be before us for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The delegates will be here again at that stage to comment on it and to suggest amendments reflecting what they need to see done.  As I stated, we will write to the Minister to look for an exact timeframe.  All stakeholders will be involved when we get into the legislative process.</p> <p>  I thank the delegates.

The Bill aims to provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing a request for remote work can be based.  It also aims to provide legal clarity and procedures to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests.  The committee recently discussed the proposed legislation with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Today I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to consider the matter further and the committee members will hear from representatives of IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  I welcome from IBEC Ms Maeve McElwee, director of employer relations, and Ms Nichola Harkin.  I welcome from ICTU Ms Patricia King, general secretary, and Dr. Laura Bambrick.</p> <p>  Before we start I must mention some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to references the witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of the matter I now invite Ms McElwee to make her opening remarks on behalf of IBEC.</p></speech>

IBEC has been deeply engaged on the issue of remote working for some time.  In addition to the statement I will make today, I have provided the joint committee with a more detailed submission setting out the views of our members on the Bill.  We have also provided the Department with detailed submissions setting out the views of our members on the opportunities and challenges presented by remote working.  I would be happy to share these further submissions with any members who may be interested.</p> <p>  IBEC and its members recognise the benefits flexible working solutions, including remote working, can bring.  Of course, as well as the benefits remote working can bring to both parties, there are complex impacts for individual businesses, not least of which is cost.</p> <p>  It is imperative that a fair balance is drawn between the importance of achieving reconciliation of professional and private life and the need to sustain employment and enhance economic competitiveness.  It is also crucial to recognise that while many employers can and will offer remote working to employees, there are some sectors and employers for whom remote working simply cannot be facilitated.</p> <p>  IBEC notes that the draft Bill is just one element of the Government&rsquo;s broader remote working strategy.  IBEC has previously welcomed Government commitments to invest in necessary infrastructure such as remote working hubs, alignment with childcare facilities, and the national broadband plan, as well as reviewing tax arrangements to incentivise remote working.  We look forward to seeing further progress on these matters.</p> <p>  While we are generally supportive of the Government&rsquo;s remote working strategy, we question whether enacting legislation in this area is the most effective way of promoting remote working.  Employers are currently facing an unprecedented amount of legislative and policy reforms in the employment rights space.  Legislation in respect of statutory sick pay, whistleblowing, the gender pay gap and extended family leave entitlements are all expected in the coming 12 months, and that is nowhere near an exhaustive list in terms of new employment-related regulation that businesses must consider and implement.</p> <p>  Government must consider these legislative proposals in a way that properly takes account of the cumulative cost and burden of administration for employers.  Furthermore, businesses and their staff are continuing to learn what works for their sector, and many employers are already iterating on various forms of remote, hybrid and flexible work options.  The reality is that offering remote or hybrid working, where feasible, is increasingly a competitive factor and employers will ensure they take the necessary steps to attract and retain talent.  We believe that legislating for a statutory right to request remote work at this stage is premature and may stymie the ability of employers and employees to manage remote working in a creative and flexible way.  It is undoubtedly the case that remote work in some form will remain a permanent feature of the labour market.  However, it would be prudent to take some time to experience the post pandemic workplace before seeking to regulate this area by way of legislation.  There is, therefore, a significant question around the necessity to introduce a statutory right at this stage.</p> <p>  If the intention is to provide a framework for employers and employees, then we are of the view that best practice guidance in the form of a code of practice would provide a much more agile and flexible way to address this whole area, particularly in circumstances where there is no one-size-fits-all approach that will work across all sectors.  A non-statutory framework, with appropriate Government supports, is likely to yield much more positive support and results.</p> <p>  If this proposed legislation is enacted, it must not be overly rigid or prescriptive.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution to managing this issue.  Employers across sectors are currently engaging closely with employees with respect to requests for remote and flexible working, and they must be given the space and discretion to continue to do this in a flexible, productive and amicable manner.</p> <p>  IBEC welcomes the broad grounds included in the draft Bill under which businesses may consider applications for remote working.  We note the criticism these provisions have received from certain parties.  However, it is important to emphasise the need for employers to be given discretion to consider requests for remote working in accordance with their own business needs and objectives.</p> <p>  Quite apart from the suitability of the role for remote working, not all remote working locations will be appropriate for home working.  IBEC submits that it is reasonable to expect that employees who request to work remotely can identify a suitable and secure work area which, where necessary, is not too far from an employer&rsquo;s on-site location.  It is the case, however, that there will be cohorts of employees who will find it more difficult than others to identify a suitable work area in their homes.  The obligation to ensure a proper and safe place of work, ensuring data security, confidentiality and the protection of intellectual property at a place of work are paramount considerations for employers.</p><p>They must be permitted to refuse requests for remote working where there are concerns relating to these issues.</p><p> For some employers, the cost implications of granting a remote working request may be prohibitive.  This is particularly the case given the general expectation on employers to provide whatever equipment they deem reasonable for employees working remotely.  IBEC notes that where remote working is facilitated on a long-term basis, a higher standard will most likely be required to be met to ensure compliance with health and safety, data protection and employment rights legislation.  Facilitating remote work may impose a disproportionate cost burden on some employers that they will simply not be in a position to absorb.  Again, these employers must be given the discretion to decline a request where the financial position of the company so dictates.  We believe the non-exhaustive, indicative list of business grounds for declining a request for remote working included in the draft Bill are fair and objective.  In this regard, we note the requirement that a decision to decline a request be grounded in an assessment of business needs rather on other spurious or arbitrary grounds, and we believe this to be appropriate.</p><p> We are very concerned by the mandatory requirement for all employers, regardless of size or sector, to have a remote work policy in place and the creation of a criminal offence for a failure to do so.  We believe this requirement is entirely disproportionate and is based on a misplaced assumption that the legislation can set out a one-size-fits-all approach to this issue.  In addition, this proposal to introduce a legislative requirement to have a policy in place will have a number of unintended consequences.  These include driving employers to have the narrowest-possible policy to ensure the number of claims, litigations or employee-relations issues arising will be reduced to the greatest extent possible.  If enacted as currently drafted, the Bill would stymie innovation and creativity and certainly would not encourage employers to be as agile or flexible as they otherwise would be.</p><p> Remote working poses some practical challenges for employers.  Just a sample of some of the questions with which employers are currently grappling include: where equipment or property belonging to an employer is in an employees home, who is responsible for insuring it; how an employer should ensure confidential information is adequately and properly secured when employees have highly sensitive information in their homes; and how an employer should comply with its statutory obligation to record employees&rsquo; working time when they are working remotely and thus not clocking in and out of the office.  We have requested guidance from the Data Protection Commission, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Health and Safety Authority with respect to how employers can best manage such risks associated with remote working.</p><p> Furthermore, the area of health and safety in remote and hybrid working models is very complex for employers to navigate.  Employers understand health and safety at work rests with the employer, regardless of whether an employee works remotely.  In response to Covid-19 and increased numbers of employees working from home, the HSA published a frequently asked questions, FAQ, document, including advice on ergonomic assessments of an employee&rsquo;s home workspace, equipment provision and good practice when using digital technologies.  IBEC submits that further guidance from the HSA in certain key areas is required as more permanent remote or hybrid working arrangements are put in place.  One area where clarity is required concerns work-related accidents that occur at home and, in particular, what exactly is reportable if there is a work-related accident at home.  IBEC remains of the view that there must have been a work activity, not just an accident that took place in the home during working time.  It is important further clarity be provided by the HSA in this regard, given the extent of an employer&rsquo;s obligations and responsibilities determines any potential liability that may arise for employers.</p><p> Employers recognise the benefits of remote working, not least the ability to attract and retain talent.  Nevertheless, the challenges faced by employers go far beyond the need to ensure adherence to employment rights legislation.  The cost and administrative burden will be significant.  IBEC submits that in order for remote working to become a viable flexible working solution for both parties, detailed guidance and Government supports and incentives will be required, rather than inflexible legislation.  The concept of remote working remains an evolving one, the benefits and challenges of which will continue to emerge in the post-pandemic workplace.  Where legislation is enacted in this area, it must be sufficiently agile to enable employers and employees alike to reap the benefits remote working can offer.</p><p> I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC&rsquo;s views on this draft legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030200002#B00300"><p>On behalf of ICTU, I thank the members of the committee for their invitation to contribute to their pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, which is intended to deliver a new workers&rsquo; right.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. Laura Bambrick.<br/><br/>While most jobs require a physical presence in the workplace, as many as one in four workers in employment worked from home during the first lockdown.  Remote working has now moved into the mainstream of workplace issues.  For the vast majority of these workers and their employers, this was their first experience of remote working, and while it was challenging for some, in the main it has proven to be a success and there is now strong demand to make this temporary arrangement permanent.  Remote working has been shown to improve workers&rsquo; quality of life and their well-being, and it can benefit the environment and foster rural regeneration.  Furthermore, it makes good business and economic sense.  Studies have repeatedly found most employers reported productivity either increased or stayed the same over the past two years.<br/><br/>This is why the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and its affiliates were the first to call for legislation on a right to request remote work in summer 2020, bringing us into line with long-established employment law in most EU member states, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  While employees in Ireland have always had a right to ask to work remotely, they have no right to be heard, nor for their request to be given proper consideration, nor to appeal a decision.  This legislation is intended to end the fact a request can be ignored by the employer or dismissed out of hand for no good reason.  However, as we detailed in our written submission to the committee, which is available to view online, the draft Bill has been stacked in favour of the employer at every turn and is fatally flawed in key parts.  It will not deliver what we campaigned for or what it is intended to provide, namely, robust legislation guaranteeing fair procedure and balancing employers' and employees' needs.<br/><br/>In the brief time that remains for my opening remarks, I will concentrate on the grounds for refusal and the grounds for appeal, which significantly impair the usefulness and effectiveness of the entire statutory scheme that has been proposed.  Head 12 of the Bill provides that the employer can decline a request for remote working if it is satisfied the request is not suitable on &ldquo;business grounds&rdquo;.  Thirteen examples of grounds they may &lsquo;&rsquo;include, but are not limited to&rdquo; are listed.  The head is explicit on this point.  The explanatory note states &quot;the phrase 'including but not limited to' is intended to ensure that the list provided does not fetter or confine the definition of &lsquo;business grounds&rsquo; ... The list provided is intended by the Department to be purely indicative and not limiting or binding.&quot;  In essence, the employer continues to be able to refuse a request on any grounds it chooses that relate to the business, including a mere assertion that remote working is not suitable to the needs of the business.<br/><br/>In the UK, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy is in the process of completing a consultation reviewing its flexible working legislation, including whether the eight business reasons an employer can reject a request remain valid.  Six of these eight reasons have been duplicated in the 13 examples cited in the draft Bill under consideration today.  Despite a statutory right to request having been in place for all employees in the UK since 2014, it has not brought about the changes intended.  We must learn from the UK&rsquo;s policy mistake and grasp our late-mover advantage.  ICTU and affiliates recommend a refusal must be justified on grounds that relate to the real needs of the business and that are appropriate and proportionate having regard to all the circumstances of the business and the employee.<br/><br/>Head 16 confers the employee with a &ldquo;right to appeal&rdquo;, whereby a complaint can be made to the WRC on the following grounds: the employer has failed to return a decision within the timeframe in compliance with head 10; or the employer has failed to provide a notice of the grounds for refusal in compliance with head 12; or an employer&rsquo;s notification under head 9 was given in circumstances that did not satisfy the requirements of head 9(1) or (2).  A major omission from this head is any provision providing that an adjudication officer can hold that a refusal of a request under the Bill is unreasonable, or was not justified on objective grounds, or was not proportionate in all the circumstances.  The head is explicit, however, on the grounds for appeal.  The explanatory note states:</p> <blockquote> 	For the avoidance of doubt, it is noted that the right to make a complaint to the WRC under this Head is <i>not</i>intended to extend to a right to complain in respect of the substance or merits of an employer&rsquo;s decision to decline a request under Head 12(1). The right to complain only extends to a failure to effect notice of the reasons grounding that declination as required under Head 12(2). </blockquote><p>In effect, the proposed legislation will only allow for a complaint to the WRC on procedural grounds.  ICTU and its affiliates are strongly of the view that an appeal to the WRC taking issue with the substantive decision of the employer must be provided.  Without this, the proposed legislation is utterly pointless.  Furthermore, there is no provision for a complaint that an employee was penalised, victimised or discriminated against as a result of having requested, appealed or engaged in remote working.  It should also be noted that the proposed limit of 4 weeks pay, by way of compensation, is wholly inadequate and completely out of line with the limit of 104 weeks that is available under most existing employment legislation.</p><p> It is important that I correct the conventional wisdom that businesses are ahead of Government on this and have put or are in the process of putting in place company policy on remote and blended working arrangements.  This does not tally with what we are hearing from union representatives on the ground.  Their experience is of employers reluctant to engage until this legislation is enacted.  ICTU and affiliates are urging this committee and all Members of the Oireachtas to work with trade unions and the Government in getting this legislation fit for purpose and enacted without delay to ensure the gains from remote working are not lost.  I thank members for their attention.  We are happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I thank the officials for attending and for their submissions.  I have a couple of questions.  My first is to Ms McElwee.  The IBEC submission refers to potential costs for employers and the grave and serious fear it has this is going to run out of control.  I come at this from a different perspective, which I am sure will be no surprise to anyone listening.  I raise the potential benefits.  There are massive benefits.  In addition to the specific benefit to the individual, we might look at the benefits in a climate change context of people commuting less.  We know there are huge benefits that extend beyond access to a form of work-life balance, etc.  From reading the IBEC submission I would not be convinced Ms McElwee and her colleagues see any benefit at all from it.  Does they not see there are also savings for employers in this regard?  I can see huge benefits in this and I have spoken to workers.  In the ICTU submission, a myth has been busted regarding what employers are actually doing at the moment.  My questions are simple.  There are saving and benefits for employers and that does not seem to be reflected in the IBEC submission at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030200002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  First and foremost, the vast majority of our members are indicating to us they intend to continue with remote and hybrid methods of working into the future.  They definitely see the benefits.  Even before the pandemic hit, we had already seen quite a significant move towards more remote and hybrid working on an ongoing basis.  Employers recognise the benefit to themselves.  Especially where we look at trying to draw and attract talent and particular skill sets into our businesses and industries, the opportunity to be able to look at a wider market, to be able to identify people who are not within necessarily within the immediate vicinity of the office or environment in which we are working is an enormous benefit.  It also means that we have lots more individuals in the labour market who potentially are not now participating but are much more open to participating in remote or hybrid settings.  Employers absolutely see the opportunities.  Lots of employers are looking at how they might resize some of their working spaces and environments.  That also provides some opportunities.  It is fair to say business and employers see the opportunities and the cost savings for themselves and for their own employees directly.</p> <p>  The purpose of this morning was maybe to focus on the issues relating to the general scheme.  There are undoubtedly challenges for employers within that because there are very considerable costs that arise.  These are not just the direct costs but the potential responsibilities that fall on employers.  It is the scale of the fines relating to data protection.  It is the scale of the risk around cybersecurity.  It is the risk that arises with very prescriptive legislation where there are challenges around occupational health and safety, accidents in the workplace, insurance queries and all sorts of equality issues that may arise.  We need to focus on these.  It is not in any way that we do not see the benefit.  Lots of employers absolutely see the benefit and the cost benefit.  It is the scale of the financial liabilities we also need to consider as we look at the development of legislation around this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030200002#C00500"><p>Of course there must be some form of balance but, with respect, there is no balance in the IBEC submission.  It is all, I would have thought, fairly negative towards what has been done so far.  I add that what has been done so far is, in the eyes of most people, actually quite prohibitive and is not in any way, shape or form going to deliver the right to remote work that people want.</p> <p>  I refer briefly to the ICTU submission.  Ms King said that in Britain all they saw was a 4% movement in their legislation.  Would she be in favour of setting a target in that regard, namely, a target for numbers who have actually moved and that that would be a reasonable assessment by which we could judge the success or otherwise of this.  That is the first question.</p> <p>  With the civil and public services, where the Government has an opportunity to, as we might say, put its money where its mouth is, and lead on this, would ICTU be in favour of those targets being set?  In the event of targets being set - and I am aware there are some there at the minute - should they be ambitious, or more ambitious?  Should we see some leadership, even ahead of this legislation coming in, with the civil and public services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030200002#C00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The usefulness of any piece of legislation when it is enacted can be measured by how many people are using it and how successful it is in the change it purports to achieve.  You can see in the UK legislation that has not been great but there are much more fundamental things that need to be considered outside the targets.  It is pointless saying to an employer you can refuse it on any grounds you like and then an employee says I disagree with you and think you are being unreasonable and the piece of legislation before us says you cannot take that and have any appeal on it.  What we are looking at is useless in terms of an employee.  The proposed legislation is giving every ground an employer can put forward as a reasonable reason to reject the request.  That is as good as having no right to request it, if employers can refuse it on any grounds and that is what the current legislation says.  When you take that position and the employee feels it is unreasonable, he or she then goes to the WRC and cannot cite the grounds for the refusal other than just three technical things.</p><p>The legislation we are looking at is a real missed opportunity.  There is no hope of reaching any target because nothing will change.  From our point of view, we must grasp this opportunity and move progressively into the new world of working post pandemic.  That is not to say we should not have the interests of both the business and the worker in mind when putting legislation together.  Of course the legislation has to be balanced.  However, it is so unbalanced at this stage that it can only be described as useless.  Neither of those provisions, as set out in the Bill, will improve the position of any worker seeking remote working.  The only thing that will come of it is that workers might be heard and employers might have to listen but, other than that, employers face no obligations.</p></speech>

It is literally a tick box for employers.  If they had no imagination at all, they could just read out the lines in the legislation as a mechanism for refusing requests.  We know that, but when we are talking about making it fit for purpose and when Ms King is talking about increasing the number of grounds on which to base an appeal, in what direction should we be pushing the legislation?  Obviously, I have ideas, many of which are born out of experience while others I developed from consultation.  From Ms King's perspective and with a view to ensuring that balance, how should we be directing this legislation?  If she would like to be prescriptive, is there a country that has already done this to which we could point and whose model we could replicate?  Should we try to be leaders - God forbid - and get this absolutely right and see it delivers for everybody?</p></speech>

We only have to look at our own legislation.  The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 and the contract Act contain objective grounds.  We do not have to rob anybody else's ideas.  We already have employment legislation that includes such provisions.  Employers are therefore already obliged to show that certain decisions were based on objective grounds.  At the moment, decisions under this legislation are completely subjective and there is no right to appeal a decision on the basis of the grounds used.  With regard to the Deputy's question on targets, she is probably more positively disposed to this legislation than I am because I do not believe any targets would be met.  The question would not even arise because no one would use the legislation.  Why would they?  It is nonsense.  It is an awful pity it is nonsense and there was no consultation with us where both employers and trade unions representatives could have-----</p></speech>

I note Ms King referenced the campaign of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this regard.  Has the engagement to date involved engaging with Government, Government Deputies, Government representatives or representatives from the Department?  What response did ICTU get during that engagement?  Is it the case the Bill was already written?  I know submissions were asked for but was there any face-to-face, or screen-to-screen, engagement?</p></speech>

Through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, we put forward our view on remote working since 2020.  We then publicly campaigned for the right to request it.  At least three times the Minister in charge said, through the Labour Employer Economic Forum, that he was disposed towards putting forward legislation.  We had a general discussion about that on three occasions.  There was then a public consultation, in which we took part in the same way as everybody else.  At the last meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum on 10 December, the Minister told us the heads of a Bill would be published in January.  He did not share those heads with us so we had no idea what was in them, nor was there any disclosure at those meetings as to what would be in the heads of the Bill.  When we saw those heads, it was the first time we knew what was intended with them.  That is why it was so disappointing.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will know herself from previous experience, and as Deputy Bruton will also know because he participated in the process, it used to be the case that potential legislation was the subject of separate discussions with employers and trade unions.  On some occasions there were joint discussions, but these were not held that often.  We would be asked for our views on legislation and would engage with officials from the Department and share strong views, particularly on certain aspects of proposed legislation.  To give the Deputy an example, we did that when the Bill on zero-hour contracts, which aimed to provide the flexibility needed to comply with the directive on transparency and so on, was going through.  We had hours and hours of discussions on that.  We did not get the Department to accept everything we wanted it to, but we at least had engagement.  It is an awful pity that, on proposed legislation as important as this Bill, we did not get that opportunity because the Bill would have been much more fit for purpose had we done that.</p></speech>

My time is up so I will be very brief.  To be very clear, what has been lacking from the very start has been meaningful input on behalf of the people the sponsoring Minister tells us will benefit from the Bill.  In truth, there can be no benefit from it in its current format.  Ms King would probably agree with me that the lack of engagement and the failure to listen to the worker's voice is the reason for that.  I apologise; my time is up.  I will have to leave before the end of this meeting as I have to speak in the D&aacute;il Chamber in a while.</p></speech>

I thank Ms McElwee and Ms King for their presentations.  They both raised valid points and concerns.  I note that Ms King said that union representatives on the ground are advising employers who are reluctant to engage until legislation is implemented.  Will Ms King expand on that?  As far as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is aware, has it been the norm since the lifting of Covid restrictions for employees who have been working remotely to return to their workplaces and no longer work remotely at all?</p></speech>

There are a few things to say here.  One is that we have had feedback, much of which has come from the private sector because, as the Senator will know, in the public sector there is a phased return under way at the moment, which means people are taking part in arrangements for a phased return and there are discussions ongoing with the employer with regard to various aspects of that return, including remote working.  However, this has not been conceded.  I imagine the public sector employer is awaiting the progress of the legislation.  That is an impediment.  We are getting strong feedback from those workers that they want productive legislation that allows them to seek and, in reasonable circumstances, get a right to remote working.</p> <p>  On the private sector side, we have received feedback from our private sector committee suggesting there is a strong interest in this.  The Senator will probably have picked up on this himself.  Workers will vote with their feet on this, whether they are organised or unorganised.  The labour market is tight and workers are going to have their own conditions with regard to seeking and finding jobs.  The tables have turned a little bit.  It is now not all about what the employer wants.  Because of the tight labour market, workers have a different context and background.  Their views as to what they want for work will have to be taken on board.  Remote working during the pandemic has proven the value of such practices to people.  It is very valuable to workers who can do it.  That is not meant, in any way, to discount the pieces the employers have set out here this morning.  There are issues that need to be answered.</p><p>We are not against having all those issues dealt with.  We are not closed to it but there has to be a reasonable outcome.  There should not be barriers to progressive legislation that allows workers to request and achieve remote working. </p></speech>

I see it in my own city of Galway.   Retail businesses are already trying to fend off increasing challenges from digital giants, of which we are all aware.  Fewer people in city centre areas will also significantly impact the hospitality sector.  Those two sectors employ around 500,000 across the country.  Has IBEC considered this?</p></speech>

It is certainly an issue that is very alive in the minds of employers.  It is entirely separate from this legislation but of course we have seen the very challenging impact Covid has had on our city centres and towns over the last two years.  However, it has also added some vibrancy into our rural areas and that is to be welcomed.  We want to have a strong and attractive economy and be a destination of choice.  What lots of people look for when they travel and work abroad or are developing their careers is those high-density cities and towns where there are lots of opportunities and places of work.  Having those strong and vibrant cities is very important and having people working on site at least some of the time is an important aspect of that.</p></speech>

As I said previously, this should be a good news story but it is not at that level yet.  I do not understand why small caf&eacute;s and restaurants would be required to have a remote working policy when it is not viable or feasible for them to offer remote working.  I raise the matter of work-related accidents in the home.  As an employer, I am well aware of this issue.  My concern is the implications for employers and who determines where the liability is.  I ask both Ms King and Ms McElwee to comment on that.</p></speech>

There is nothing unusual about that.  There is also nothing unusual about having a dialogue between stakeholders on that and finding the proper and most appropriate solution to it.  I do not regard any of those things as barriers.  Whether we like it or not, there are going to be some seismic changes post pandemic in the way our economy is structured and we are going to have to deal with some of the issues the Senator raised, such as issues around city centres, and face up to them.  There are going to be changes and it is not going to be as it was before.  Even from a spatial point of view, the Government had proposals for 2040 regarding building and expanding areas in which people could work and live and have essential services provided to them.  We were very positively disposed towards all of that as it would be a holistic way of living.  If people had children in school, their education could be adjacent, rather than 1.2 million people arriving on trains, buses and cars into the city centre of Dublin every day and doing the reverse in the evening, or getting up at stupid hours to get on trains and leaving children in cr&egrave;ches at 6 a.m. or 6.30 a.m.  That is not a holistic way to live life.  To be candid, there were not many positives from this pandemic but one of them is lifting the veil on some of that and showing what can be done.  That is not to say that everything I want will be conceded or that everything the employers want will be either.  We need a balanced approach.  We have always succeeded in doing that in the past so I cannot see why we would not be able to do it this time.</p> <p>  We are strong supported of the proposition regarding the workplace hubs.  The Minister is right to promote it and she was quite speedy in presenting her proposition on that.  I believe they should be developed and they are one part of the answer to this remote working piece.</p></speech>

It does seem entirely disproportionate.  There are many very small employers and businesses where there is no reality to people working remotely because of the nature of the work they provide.  To make it a criminal offence to not have a policy in place that would be reissued every 12 months seems disproportionate in the extreme.  I agree with ICTU on the issue of health and safety.  We have sought more clarification on a number of occasions around the issues that will pertain to home working and the obligations and responsibilities on both parties in that case.  It is very important that we get more clarity on that before we finalise this legislation.  Those pieces are particularly important.</p></speech>

I agree with Ms King that one of the few positives of Covid is that it has shone a light on the challenges people face, particularly in rural Ireland, with regard to long commutes and the opportunities available through remote working.  In many senses this is a good news story.  It is a good opportunity for employees but also for employers.  In the main, employers have embraced this positively and have engaged with the process.  I ask Ms King to reflect on her private sector committee, which she mentioned briefly already.  What are the stumbling blocks and big issues that are being reported back there?  Where does she she those stumbling blocks, bearing in mind, as she rightly says, that there has been a partnership approach between the trade union movement and employers.  At the end of the day, we want to help get employers there.  Where does Ms King see the challenges?  What do we need to do to help those employers?</p></speech>

The biggest issue is that we have to get the protection in the legislation.  Workers want to be able to avail of this and they want to be able to ask but they do not want to be "afraid" to do that and they do not want their request to be declined.  If they come to a place in their own circumstances where they want to make this application, they want to feel they have a good chance of it being conceded.  At the moment, that is not the context or the backdrop within which we are working in certain industries.  As the committee will know, some of the bigger players in our economy in some sectors have been progressive and have moved forward but-----</p></speech>

Workers are not picking up that there would be a positive response to an application.  In those circumstances, there is a fear that if they make the application, they will be refused.  It is, therefore, important that we have the backdrop of legislation which allays those fears.  Our point at the moment is that this proposed legislation is not going to reduce that fear.  That is what we need to do.  If legislation took account of the objective grounds and stated that if an employer refuses to grant it, that decision can be appealed, we would have a far better pitch that would assuage the fear of employees.  There is no point in me saying that some progressive employers are in favour of this and, because of their own interests, likely to concede remote working.  That is where they will build their own policies.</p> <p>  In the private sector, where workers are organised and represented, and a collective agreement can be built, they can make arrangements themselves collectively with their employers and this is how they will handle the prospect of remote working.  There are swathes of the private sector that are not organised.  As the committee knows, collective bargaining is not recognised.</p></speech>

We are hearing that in feedback from our own members and across the board.  To the point Ms King raised, in a tight labour market, employees have many options and employers that are keen to recruit and retain talent have seen opportunities.  Very few employers see the opportunity of fully remote working but they see great opportunity around hybrid and blended working in the longer term.  We are seeing significant moves where it is practicable and sensible to introduce more remote working.</p></speech>

I welcome the publication of this legislation and introducing it swiftly is the right thing to do.  It is, however, disappointing to find that the two sides are so far apart, with IBEC stating that no legislation should be considered at all and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, stating the legislation is useless.  I see our role as trying to find a middle way to make this legislation meaningful but also to take account of the concerns that may exist in some reasonable and proportionate way.  I will ask both parties if we could proceed by way of the Workplace Relations Commission developing a code of practice?  That might be a way to explore some of the difficulties that have been put up on the employers' side as being major obstacles that we should not be trying to address in primary legislation.  Could we evolve a code of practice which would then become relevant where an employee feels an employer unfairly failed to respect the code in respect of the employee's particular circumstances?  That would give some flexibility, rather than trying to enshrine in primary legislation a set of tests or criteria which I think we cannot do in the time available to us.  That is my primary question to both sets of witnesses.</p><p>IBEC has raised many issues that I understand the principles of.  There are issues around data protection, intellectual property, IP, confidentiality, insurance, working time directives, and health and safety.  We are now two years into using these practices and while there may be issues to iron out in health and safety, and in some of these codes, has a fair amount of evidence built up as to how employers have, in practice, overcome the issues of insurance, data, IP or confidentiality?  We should not be putting up <i>ab initio </i>arguments when we are already two years into using these practices in many workplaces.  Can we drill down to a few net issues that need to be resolved from an employer point of view?  IBEC and ICTU recognise that health and safety needs more work.  Can we identify a few net areas where more work could be done which would, in turn, inform a code which could  be drawn up by the Workplace Relations Commission?</p></speech>

A code of practice does not have any enforceability.  It is what it says it is.  A code of practice can possibly highlight best practice and both parties can probably agree what best practice would look like.  That is all it does.  It creates a set of principles that suggest what should be done to do a job right from the perspective of both worker and employer.  However, it has no further significance.  It is not going to allay the fears of those workers whose position I outlined in response to Deputy Flaherty.  It is not going to allay those fears at all.  Therefore, in my judgment, it is not the route to go.  There is a provision in the Act whereby the Minister can put forward a code of practice if he wants to.  That probably relates more to the development of a remote working policy.  There is a requirement in the proposed Bill for employers to publish their policies.  I presume the code of practice was to assist consistency in that.  Other than that, the answer is not a code of practice.  I am clear on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030200002#F01000"><p>As we set out in our opening statement, we feel a code of practice might be a useful way to address some of these issues.  The scale of the differences across sectors and industries means this will be a legislative challenge.  We have already seen that in the ability of employers to set out different types of business cases that the legislation is already trying to recognise.  A code of practice might give us some more flexibility in dealing with that.  A statutory code of practice would have significant standing.  We have a number of statutory codes of practice that have significant standing within our employment rights framework.  It can be linked to legislation, in that failure to comply with the code of practice could be relevant to an adjudicator's decision, which could make it an effective mechanism for dealing with some of the challenges.</p> <p>  I will also comment on the issue the Deputy raised around the fact that we now have two years' experience.  He was asking if we are raising issues that have already been dealt with.  It is important to point out that many of these issues have not yet been dealt with, which is a point I have made on many occasions.  Over the past two years, we have had the overarching obligation, first and foremost, to manage public health and to address issues of public health and safety.  That has been paramount, above all other considerations, as was right and appropriate in a pandemic situation.  Employers and employees have tolerated situations that are less than ideal and that have created significant risk for many employers but because of the overarching public health issue, we have supported that.</p><p>As the members are aware and as I am experiencing myself here today, there are challenges around broadband and connectivity that continue.  Many employers have tolerated that because there has been no option and it has been the safer option to deal with reduced quality in terms of connection than to have people come into the office.  We have tolerated significant challenges around data security and privacy.  We know that when we look at younger cohorts of workers, many of whom are living in shared accommodation, we are going to need to dip into very significant privacy issues around dealing with some of these questions that will come up, such as who they share their home with, where they lock away information, and whether others in the home also have rights to work remotely.  We will deal with questions such as how data are secure, for example, when a person works for one of the big legal houses and the person her or she shares his or her home with works for its biggest competitor.  We will deal with questions of whether conversations are overheard and how a worker can be sure that he or she has not inadvertently left a document on the table at home.  There are big issues for employers to consider.  They have not been worked out in any way.  We have not, in any way, worked out the issues around occupational health and safety or how they arise.  We have not worked out, in any way, how we provide adequate support for people with mental health difficulties and how they operate in the isolation of remote working.  We certainly have not dealt with any of the issues around cybersecurity.  We have tolerated situations where it was more important to protect public health and to make it work than actually focusing on long-term situations where employers bear the overall responsibility and the fines for any of these breaches.  That still needs a lot of work and perfecting before we go down the line of this type of legislation.  I want to put on the record that it is absolutely not settled yet.  We know that people can all work remotely.  We have very little experience of how people work in a hybrid environment.  We certainly do not have the investment required to say that this will work positively in the long term.  </p></speech>

If we have legislation to ensure it is a statutory obligation to have a policy and for employers to behave reasonably, and if a code of practice is developed by the Workplace Relations Commission, which may be relevant to adjudication, so we are therefore moving beyond the existing scope of adjudication in the Bill to test something with reference to this code, would that not be a significant strengthening of this legislation?  I believe it would.</p></speech>

All codes of practice mean is that if a person takes a case, cites the code of practice and the adjudicator in the WRC looks at the code of practice, they may very well tell the employer that it has not complied with it.  When it suits the employer, it will argue that it did not have to because it is only a code of practice.  That is the answer to that.  Codes of practice fall on their feet.  They do not stand up to robust opposition.  That is the reality.  If they did, they would be used a lot more than they are currently.  In a situation where we need to have a legislation that states that a worker can request remote working and that the refusal has to be on objective grounds, if it is left freefall and open for an employer to pick whatever ground it likes and that cannot be appealed, it is of no meaningful assistance to the worker who wants to achieve home working.  I understand that Ms McElwee has gone into great detail on some of the issues that might arise.  However, some of the issues that she cited might arise whether a person works from home or not.  For example, if a person is a professional working in a legal company and has to read papers for the next morning, he or she could take them home to read at night and could inadvertently leave them on a table.   A person does not have to be working from home for breaches of confidentiality to occur.  There are lots of circumstances around everybody's work that can present those sort of risks.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a few issues.  I have had a look through some of the examples that the Department provided with respect to what happens in other jurisdictions.  It seems to me that the right to request remote working is basically it, and that from what I can see, this legislation is on a par with that is already in place in other jurisdictions.  One of the core issues that Deputy Bruton touched on a bit is the right to go to the WRC and what the WRC can do.  Specifically, it is about whether it can adjudicate and decide on procedural issues or on a substantive issue.  I ask Ms McElwee the following.  If the WRC was given the power to adjudicate on the substantive issue as to whether a right to remote work should be granted in the first place, would that give clarity to the whole situation?</p> <p>  I have a question for Ms King.  With respect to what they do in New Zealand, if a person has the right to work from home and the employer is responsible for the health and safety, should the employer have the right to, somehow or other, either remotely or in some other way, inspect the workplace or work location?  It seems to me that it could be the case that a person is working from home and the employer is responsible for the worker's safety, yet the employer cannot gain access because it might be a worker's private residence.  Has Ms King thought how that might be dealt with in any way?  </p> <p>  I note that there is an internal appeals procedure.  Within two weeks of the start of the internal appeals procedure, a claim can be taken to the WRC.  In Ms King's view, does that mean that there could be two processes ongoing, an internal appeal and the WRC procedure, at the same time?  Would it not make more sense of the internal appeal procedure was finished first?  If it reached some kind of agreement in that way, there would be no need for the WRC claim.  I will finish there and perhaps come back in later.  </p></speech>

The challenge there is the whole issue of how the WRC would actually manage to investigate that.  The important thing here is that an employer is seen to give appropriate and adequate consideration, and that in line with all best practice and with the legislation, they have considered all of the angles and give a reasoned response to an employee as to why that request is being refused or perhaps being offered in a different format.  For the WRC to investigate, we are really looking into very substantial challenges for employers.  In many ways, with issues that are so significant, it would be very difficult for the WRC to actually determine at the individual level of a practice at an operational level, whether that person is critically needed.

It is reasonable that a very strong business case is set out and a reasoned response given.  In relation to on-site inspections, it is really important to state that there are challenges for employers that we would love to see more clarity from the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, on this point.  There will be people working alone in their homes.  Sending in inspectors to identify risks and any of the normal ergonomic considerations that employers are obliged to undertake is quite challenging.  Issues include the cost and the geographic distances that may have to be covered.  There is also the reality of people working alone and having strangers moving around their homes, which throws up lots of other considerations for employers.  Briefly, on the last issue raised by the Deputy on the two processes ongoing, we think that it does appear that there are two processes ongoing.</p><p>We would prefer to see that any policy would have a reasonable timeframe in which an appeal should be heard after which point, consistent with all other pieces of legislation, an external appeal could go forward as opposed to two weeks into an internal appeal process that may well resolve the issue.</p></speech>

In the Labour Party, we are extremely clear that we need to build towards a right to flexible working in this country.  We agree with ICTU in that we need robust legislation guaranteeing fair procedure and that we ensure a greater balance between employers and employees.</p> <p>  I refer to the detail of the submissions and direct my questions to IBEC first.  I hear that employers have concerns and we need to understand those.  I agree that we need updated guidance from the Health and Safety Authority on the ergonomic suitability of workplaces and such issues.  However, I refer to three other issues Ms McElwee raised, which is the insurance of equipment within a person's home, clocking in, and digital security.  We are 24 months on from when thousands of workers were forced into working from home.  Is IBEC suggesting that employers are only beginning to grapple with these issues now?  They include vital issues of insurance, clocking in and that employers have not been putting software in place to ensure working time is recorded.  With regards to digital security, I find it hard to believe that employers have allowed a Wild West scenario with regards to digital security systems in place for their workers working remotely.  From what I hear today, these are concerns IBEC is raising now with regard to remote working.  Is IBEC saying that these are issues that have not been dealt with in the past two years?</p></speech>

In fact, we have been saying this for at least two years and we were saying it pre pandemic as we were looking at more organisations moving to remote working.  However, they are big challenges to grapple with and it takes employers time to work them out.  When we talk about the scale of remote working and the fact that we have recognised it is possible, we are saying some of it is possible and some of it will absolutely remain longer term; a lot of what happened would not have been done with the blessing of employers in the absence of the public health guidance and advice.  It is certainly not a Wild West of cybersecurity.  Employers have been investing significant amounts in managing cybersecurity, but it is a fact that where we have challenges around networks and connectivity, and challenges around where people are actually working from, they open up avenues of additional concern for employers and they need to be taken care of.</p> <p>  Insurance of equipment continues to be an issue.  Everybody has operated within a pandemic environment for two years, including our insurers, employees and employers, and we have looked at this as being temporary, albeit that its temporary nature has been extended.  When we start to look at permanent solutions to this, we will start to see different issues coming through and we need to have that clarification.  Insurance should just be a matter of clarification.</p> <p>  Clocking is extraordinarily difficult because software is not going to be sufficient by itself and there is paperwork required.  Just because a person is not logged in, does not mean he or she is not working, and that is a challenge for many employers in professional environments where people are not monitoring their workday all day long through technological means.</p></speech>

Of the challenges Ms. McElwee outlined, I believe many employers have managed them in recent years and can manage them with workers continuing to work from home.  The other issue I want to ask is about costs-----</p></speech>

It is definitely not a matter of trust.  It is very much a matter of responsibility that lies, appropriately, with the employer and we have to be able to demonstrate our responsibility in those area.  It is not a matter of trust, necessarily.  It is our obligation under other pieces of legislation.</p></speech>

As for costs, what detailed information does IBEC have from its members with regards to the costs of remote working and, indeed, the benefits?  I read Ms McElwee's submission in detail.  I have seen many of the complaints and am aware of those that have been issued in the context of other legislation that has come before this committee.  What experience has been gathered from surveys conducted within IBEC?  In the Labour Party, we have conducted surveys and the overwhelming reaction from the public has been that they want remote working and flexible work options.  What are the detailed cost issues that IBEC has identified?</p></speech>

It is important to say again that the vast majority of employers are saying that they are supportive of introducing elements of remote, flexible and hybrid working.  I appreciate that it sounds as though we are complaining all the time, but when looking at the specific issue of the Bill, it is important that we highlight where we see those challenges.  It is important to clarify that.  Looking at the surveys we have done, very significant numbers-----</p></speech>

We have not done a specific survey on the costs, but as an employers' organisation, we clearly understand our obligations under legislation and we understand where penalties lie under legalisation.  There will be penalties around making sure we have the clocking and time recording system adequately in place.  There will be penalties under miscellaneous provisions if we cannot demonstrate the hours people are working when they are clocking in and out.  I am not saying people have to be on site for that.  I am saying there have to be mechanisms in place to do that.  There are costs around data protection breaches that we have to introduce so-----</p></speech>

I agree with everything Ms King said in her submission.  On the waiting period of 26 weeks, does she think that is appropriate before an employee can request a right to flexible work?  What is her view on the impact of having to wait 26 weeks, particularly for those who seek remote working opportunities?  We need to expand working opportunities for those who want to work but cannot work.  We have a pensions affordability issue.  We need to expand the labour market.  The second question relates to the request-----</p></speech>

That would be seen in the lobbying returns.  We submitted our submissions.</p> <p>  I can check for the Deputy specifically which lobbying returns relate to each of the issues.  We will have addressed issues to the Data Protection Commissioner around remote working, etc., looking for that guidance that we have spoken about.

I will ask about one particular lobbying register item, which is down as a virtual meeting.  The date is not given.  It is between 1 September 2021 and 31 December 2021 and Ms McElwee is listed as the person primarily responsible for lobbying.  Those people who appeared to be at the meeting - Ms McElwee can correct me if I am wrong - include the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister of State, Deputy English, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and Mr. Brian Murphy, chief of staff in the Department, Mr. John Shaw, assistant secretary in the Department, Ms Clare Dunne, assistant secretary in the Department and Mr. Matthew Lynch, special adviser in the Department.  Was that a virtual meeting about the question of remote working?</p></speech>

If it is registered in that way, it was certainly one of the issues that we would have raised.  I would expect that that was a meeting that came up through a subcommittee of the Labour Employer Economic Forum but I can check the specific reference.  I do not know off the top of my head.  I do not have access to open it here.</p></speech>

It seems like IBEC met the whole caboodle.  It was not just some special adviser.  It was the Minister and the two Ministers of State in the Department.  Is that not quite a high-level meeting for IBEC to get its position across?</p></speech>

Those are typically Labour Employer Economic Forum meetings and, therefore, they would be tripartite meetings that we would participate in.  They would be shared.</p> <p>  As I say, I am happy to go back and confirm for the Deputy which meeting exactly that was.  It would not be unusual that we would meet through LEEF and talk about these issues.  It would be on the agenda of subcommittees.</p></speech>

Did ICTU have such a meeting with the Minister and the two Ministers of State present to discuss remote working in advance of the heads of Bill coming out?</p></speech>

There is a subcommittee of that which is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and on one occasion that I can recall those two Ministers attended a subcommittee.  I want to make it clear that at those meetings, the substance, content or detail of a remote working Bill was never discussed with us.  They were working on producing heads of Bill but there was never discussion with us on the details of those heads.  I want to make it clear that there was nothing of that nature.</p></speech>

We were not given the detail of the heads of Bill.  We are afforded an opportunity to address the fact that the legislation was being brought forward and the impact that we feel it may have for the labour market as is appropriate to the remit of the Labour Employer Economic Forum.  We did not discuss or negotiate in any way the heads of Bill.  As Ms King has said, they were not made known to us.</p></speech>

Did IBEC ask for appeals to be only on procedural, and not on substantive, grounds?</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy from recall, because we did not have sight of the heads of Bill, we would have been speaking in broad terms.  Exactly as I am saying to the Deputy this morning, it would be important that there would be balance and flexibility within the legislation.  Certainly, we would not have been discussing anything like the kind of detail around whether there  was a substantive or just a procedural appeal.  That never came up for discussion in any meeting that I can recall.</p></speech>

IBEC is clearly against any legislation at all but if there is to be legislation, IBEC's position is that the employer has the absolute right to say no with no substantive appeal.</p></speech>

That is what we have been discussing and engaging with publicly around the issue.

We are all on the one page in that we welcome some progress on the idea of offering remote and flexible working to employees but it has to be said it will not work for every business sector and every employer.</p> <p>  In relation to the discussion about how the heads were arrived at and who was involved, I have stated on a number of occasions that I would like to see Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, ISME, represented on the LEEF, which it is not.  I am not sure that small businesses here, in terms of the small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector, are being properly represented.  A couple of people have made comments already that to oblige small businesses, which have no opportunity to offer remote working, to engage in having a policy in place, renewing it every year etc., is only one more onerous task that small businesses do not need.  That needs to be recognised from the outset.</p> <p>  It may be my own analysis but I wonder whether a large amount of the rhetoric in the discussion here today essentially is trying to marry the private and the public sector as if they are exactly the same.  I would say that remote working works in many administration jobs and we have a great deal of that in the public sector.  We do not have the same across the private sector.  Maybe Ms King tell us has ICTU done any analysis to determine what percentage of work in the public sector can be done remotely.</p></speech>

There would be good reason for that.</p><p>The gradual return to the workplace in the public sector is only evolving as we speak, so it would be too early to do such a survey.  I agree with Deputy Shanahan that not every job is conducive to remote working.  I understand that.  It is perfectly normal for employers to have rights in legislation.  A bricklayer or somebody else working somewhere where the work has to be done on site cannot be at home doing that sort of work, so a rationale and a level of reasonableness have to come into this.  The Deputy mentioned rhetoric.  I hope this is a little more substantive than rhetoric.  We will not be unreasonable about this but we do know that a considerable level of home-working could be done successfully.  What we are saying is that if legislation is put in place, it should be made meaningful.  As drafted, this legislation is not.</p></speech>

There is certainly no one-size-fits-all solution here.  The problem with legislation such as this is that that is essentially what we are trying to craft.</p> <p>  Ms King referred to private employers earlier.  She talked about the tightening labour market, and it is absolutely a tightening market out there.  I was speaking last night to guys in the hospitality industry who want to extend their opening hours and they cannot do so because they cannot get the staff.  That is the situation out there.  There is flexibility for employees to look around for jobs.  If a job entails the possibility of working from home, I think most employers, as long as they get productivity, will offer that.  That raises the question of where exactly the problem is, which brings me back to what I said.  Many public sector administration jobs can possibly be done through remote working.  During the Covid pandemic, however, and other Members of the Oireachtas might agree with me on this, it has been difficult enough for us to do our jobs, trying to meet public servants and civil servants.  That was made even more difficult because of Covid and remote working.  It is very hard to know how productivity is being assessed when so many people are not on site, they are not meeting day-to-day and they are extracurricular, if you will.  These issues need to be brought into this policy before we start enacting policy that will make it very difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to deal with this legislation on top of everything else we are now putting on top of businesses, given the tightening business environment out there.</p></speech>

It would not be appropriate to engage on that this morning.  I am sure the Deputy and I could have a very interesting conversation and debate on what needs to happen in the hospitality sector.  I am not sure we would ever have a meeting of minds on the matter.</p> <p>  As for remote working, the Bill at present states that if a worker requests remote working, the employer can use any grounds - any - unfettered to refuse.  That is not objective, fair or reasonable and it needs to be addressed.  The current proposition in the legislation states that if a worker has from his or her employer a rejection of a request for remote working, that worker cannot appeal that substantive objection to the WRC.  That is unfair and unreasonable.  From our point of view, there are several ways to remedy that.  We are looking for a remedy to this.  We think that engagement would address a lot of this and that we could have reformed legislation that works.  That would not confer a right to remote working on every employee.  It would allow workers to apply for remote working in reasonable circumstances and allow the employer either to accept it or to refuse it on reasonable, objective grounds.  It would allow the worker to say, "I do not think that is fair so I will go to the WRC and appeal it.".  It would allow that appeal against the decision of the employer to happen.  Neither of those exigencies is included in this proposed legislation.  Our aim is to have that reformed, and we hope the Deputies and Senators on the committee will assist in arriving at that place.</p></speech>

That would be the grounds on which the employer would then respond.  It might be the case that if we had reformed legislation, the employer could say, "I will not agree to five days' remote working because that would not suit our business at all, but we can arrange for two days or one day.".  Again, if a worker did not think that fair, he or she could take an appeal on reasonable grounds to the WRC.  None of those options are available in the Bill as drafted.  We wish to have those pieces included in any scrutiny the committee carries out in order to try to get a resolution to this.</p></speech>

They are miles apart in their views; nonetheless I thank them for coming before us.</p> <p>  Ms McElwee spoke about how employers are not yet fully aware of the opportunities of remote working.  What, if anything, is IBEC doing to inform employers of the positive opportunities available to them?  Is it engaging with companies that have been facilitating remote working for a long time, learning from them and giving that information to people who have concerns about offering remote working, whether blended or full remote working, to their employees?</p> <p>  In Ms McElwee's view, should the right of appeal be procedural, that is, should it follow legislation, or should it be substantive?  Does she think it is right to disagree with the employer's decision where the WRC can adjudicate if the employer was correct to refuse?  Some people would have concerns about that.</p> <p>  This legislation is being brought in for companies of all sizes.  What is Ms McElwee's view on exempting some small companies?  How would that be done?  What size of companies would be exempt?  The obvious problem is that if companies with five to ten staff are exempted, a company with 11 staff will have an issue with that.  Where does Ms McElwee see that going?  I understand how having this on top of everything else employers face could be a burden for small companies.</p></speech>

As I said, the issue is of huge interest to our member companies.  We have used the opportunity of the past two years to share lots of the good advice and best practice that has grown in those organisations, some of whose staff were working remotely or in a hybrid manner pre-pandemic and had experience of these types of operations.  Also, in sharing that experience through member networks, we have done quite a lot of work on developing frequently asked questions and putting together toolkits for employers as to how to go about setting up a remote working policy and on the types of considerations that need to be taken into account.  It is a matter of working through how such a policy might be got up and running in the organisation.  We have been asked for a lot of advice and guidance on that.  Then it is a matter of highlighting the areas in the legislation that need to be looked out for and the areas where companies need to make sure their compliance is appropriate.</p><p>There is a great deal of work going on and a lot of very positive engagement for members in the context of getting good practice in place and learning from one another as to how they can best deal with the implementation of remote working.</p><p> Most employers feel that we have done remote working relatively well.  There are questions around productivity because we are not measuring people in the same way.  We know lots of people are not in the ideal environment to be as productive and, as a result, that has not been measured in quite the same detail.  Hybrid is very new, and the technology that requires half the people to be in a meeting room versus everybody remotely on one particular screen is different.  Sound systems and the etiquette are growing up and we are very much learning.  The management of that is a very big learning curve at the moment as well.  We are looking at how we train managers and how we put in place appropriate safeguards in order that people do not get forgotten and that they get adequate opportunity.  All of those issues need to be addressed.  There is a lot of learning going on, and some very strong engagement from members around that.</p><p> In response to the second question, we support the procedural element of the WRC investigations.  That is because there is a requirement for an employer under this proposed Bill to give a reasoned response.  That should, therefore, already be a matter of record which demonstrates that the employer has considered the questions, looked at their own particular circumstances within their business and addressed the issues.  We must bear in mind that there may be individual and team-related complexities that are private to other members of the team, but that an employer or section manager may need to take into account in the wider application of some of those requests.</p><p> I fully accept the Senator's point on the exemption for smaller organisations as to where the cut-off lies, but we suggest that for very small and microenterprises, the exemption from a legally required right to request remote working policy would alleviate it.  That is there.</p><p> I apologise for taking up Senator Ahearn's time, but while I have the floor, I confirm that I have opened my own responses on the lobbying register and, in response to the question Deputy Murphy asked me, I understand from my own records that there is a meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum subgroup on enterprise, trade and employment.  As we have already outlined, that would have been a very general discussion about our views and would not have got into the detail of any of the heads of the general scheme because they were not known to us at the time.</p></speech>

It is because we have a labour market that has a very high propensity towards small- and medium-sized businesses, and we should not be including such divisions in the labour market and not giving the same rights and entitlements to people just because they work in a small business.  There are other ways of handling those exigencies, but I am not in favour of causing any further division within the labour market.</p></speech>

Some of the grounds that are listed are reasonable and some are not.  An employer must give what would be regarded as a reasonable refusal, and this will be done on objective grounds.  All we have to do is look at the legislation for contract employment or part-time working applications and it deals with all of those things.  The same challenges for small businesses occur in those circumstances, and they were dealt with by including the objective grounds provision.</p></speech>

I might start with Ms McElwee.  My reading of her documents is that, effectively, IBEC is opposed to a statutory right to request to work remotely.  That is what it amounts to.  Is that a fair summary?</p></speech>

Where we try and capture questions like a right to request remote working under one-size-fits-all legislation, we see that is much more difficult.  We would be much more strongly in favour of a code of practice that is more flexible and open, but where the legislation comes through, we need to make sure there is a fair and reasonable balance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030200002#L00800"><p>There is a difficulty with a code of practice.  I speak as someone who practised as a trade union official for many years.  I am always reminded of Captain Jack Sparrow when he spoke about the pirates' code and reminded his fellow pirates it was more a set of guidelines than an actual code.  I know from years spent as a trade union official that codes of practice do not work when it comes to vindicating employees' rights.  That is just my experience and I thought I would put it out there.</p> <p>  "Flexibility" and "agility" are key words these days in terms of business, but they seem one-sided in nature.  I will give an example of that in terms of how the general scheme is currently drafted.  I echo a point my colleague, Senator Sherlock, was hoping to get a response on earlier.  Under the proposed legislation as it stands, an employee must have worked for an employer for six months before he or she can request a right to work remotely.  Employers then have three months to consider the request and can demand more elements or meetings to discuss the request further, so it would be close to a year before an employee has an answer.  Employees who want to appeal the matter to the WRC could be waiting for up to a further year.  Once the request is refused, a person is barred from making a new request for 12 months.  My question to both parties is simple.  Where is the flexibility or agility in that?  Is agility a word that we only use for employers and not for employees?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022030200002#L00900"><p>First and foremost, I might suggest that the code of practice on grievance and disciplinary investigations has been a fundamental pillar of our industrial relations and employment rights, so codes of practice can have a very strong impact.  Senator Gavan might agree that that one has been very effective over many years.</p> <p>  When it comes to agility, it is not unreasonable that an employer would say that somebody must be with them for six months in order that they have an opportunity to meet colleagues, learn the culture of an organisation and learn things that one cannot write down on how we operate, what our normal methods of engagement are and then the opportunity to have the conversation.  It is not necessarily a case that an employer cannot permit somebody with less than six months' service to work remotely.  It is a piece whereby, if an employer had somebody very new or very junior, he or she might want to make sure that they were very well versed.  For instance, when I think of some of our own team coming in, we want to be very clear that people have the training and background before we send them out to WRC cases and so on.</p> <p>  Senator Gavan says that an employer would then have three months.  It is not an unreasonable timeframe in which an employer would have an opportunity to answer.  I am not thinking of smaller microenterprises here, but of an employment where multiple requests might be coming in, and they must be sequenced against requests for annual leave, carer's leave, parental leave, adoptive leave, work-life balance and every other request, whether that might be for a career break, a secondment or a recruitment gap that an employer has.  Where an employer has multiple requests and larger numbers, they must sequence all of those requests adequately and appropriately and to be fair and respectful to other people within the business where roles might fall to them in the event that somebody is working remotely.  I think in particular of where somebody who is going on leave or on secondment might have supervisory duties that another requester may be required to take up for a period.  It is complex, but it does not mean-----</p></speech>

Our guide on this would be the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, which provides that someone must give 13 weeks in terms of their notice and so on to an employer.  We think that is a good guide.  It is explicit in other legislation as well.  Therefore, 26 weeks should be 13 weeks in our view.  There is very little flexibility cited in the provision.  That there would not be that in-built flexibility in the piece did not surprise me considering the main pieces of the legislation are framed in the way they are.</p> <p>  As the Senator well knows, those are the sorts of pieces that should and could have been reasonably resolved in a tripartite engagement on these matters.  They have gotten some of these pieces badly wrong in our view.  When we leave that alongside the main issues - that is, the grounds and non-right to appeal of the grounds - that is why I make the assertion that it is useless.</p></speech>

It talks about granting a right to request remote working but it does not translate it into giving any right whatsoever.  Is that a fair summary?</p></speech>

I wish we were talking about the right to remote working.  We are not.  We are talking about the right to request remote working.  We can see the level of dismissiveness towards the points we made to try to have a reasonable legislation that takes account of that.</p> <p>  A worker will get a right to request as a result of this legislation if it were to be put in place.  That is not the right to remote working; it is the right request it with grounds for the employer to say "No".  At the moment, those grounds are unfettered and there is no right to appeal on those unfettered grounds in terms of any refusal.  That is how unreasonable this is, or as common parlance would say, this piece of proposed legislation has landed very badly.</p></speech>

I would be interested to find out if any other jurisdictions have that particular right built into their laws.  I cannot find it but I am sure that does not mean it is not there.  I am sure if it is there, Ms King will have located it and might be able to tell me.</p> <p>  Ms McElwee in her submission spoke about excluding certain cohorts of employees from the right to request remote working.  That is something on which Ms King might come in as well.  Would I be right in suggesting there are a certain number of employees for whom remote working just would not work?  Is Ms McElwee suggesting that it should be somehow or other built into an understanding or contract that they would never have the right to request remote working?  Is this what she is suggesting if they are excluded, as per the wording in her submission?  Ms King might come back in and speak to that.</p> <p>  I asked a question earlier with regard to employer responsibility.  I would be interested to hear Ms King's points on the home as a workplace, and the responsibility of the employer to ensure it is safe and that all the other issues regarding equipment, data protection, cybersecurity and so on are in place.  How will the employer ensure that is done to a standard required?   Does it mean the employer would have to have access to the workplace in the employee's home?  Does Ms King see any conflicts or problems around that?</p></speech>

As was mentioned in our opening statement, 12 EU members states already have this legislation.  Six, including Ireland, are in the process of including it.  The others are the UK, New Zealand and Australia.</p> <p>  When we look at it, the vast majority of the legislation is around the right to request for all the reasons we have spoken about today.  While many people will be in jobs that have tasks that allow them to work remotely, the vast majority still need to be in the employer's premises on-site to do the job.  There are two exceptions to that.</p> <p>  In the last year, Finland has introduced legislation whereby employees have the right to work where they want and for the hours they want for half of their contracted hours.  The legislation addresses flexitime and the location of their work, within limits, which are the same limits we are talking about today.  It has to be done in a way that works for the business as well.  I cannot say I would like to work between midnight and 6 o'clock if I am required to be contactable by members during the working day.  Therefore, there is a balance.  Finland has gone the furthest there in half-year contracted times.  A person can choose where and when he or she wants to work within reason.  We must recognise, however, that this has been built on by generations of looking at workers' rights around flexibility.  They are not coming at this anew.  Ireland is a laggard here.  That legislation did not happen overnight.</p> <p>  The only other one exception is Romania where workers have the right to one day of working remotely from home.  Again, it must suit the needs of the business.  As Ms King mentioned earlier, the bricklayer still would not be entitled to it.  Those are two countries that go that bit further around the right to request.  For the vast majority of jurisdictions that are way ahead of Ireland in this regard, it is around the right to request.  I hope that helps.</p></speech>

The employer would be expected to take action for the employee to be safe in the workplace and, therefore, the role of the Health and Safety Authority is important in order that, again, we will get that balance right.  This is about meeting this progressive new way of working, and I have no doubt the means of doing that could be established.</p></speech>

We have had some feedback on the over-reliance on certain technologies, and some people have referred to the Big Brother aspect of this in respect of how employers have tracked employees and so on.  What we are looking for is a reasonable solution.  I take the point Ms McElwee makes about how, when we were operating in pandemic-type circumstances, we did not have a choice and that, therefore, the exigencies that arose had to be dealt with.  Some of those experiences are valuable and will order how we manage those issues into the future.</p></speech>

Currently, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, the obligation on the employer refers to it applying &ldquo;so far as is reasonably practicable".  The employer has an obligation, therefore, and that home space becomes a workspace.</p> <p>  We would have to draw guidelines on how that would work.  It goes without saying it would be unreasonable for the employer not to know what was available in the workplace and what the circumstances were, given it is responsible for it.  The guidelines would have to be more detailed than are currently available under the health and safety legislation, although I do not see that necessarily as a barrier.  What we are talking about here is an arrangement in which there is a dual interest.</p></speech>

For instance, an employee could fall down his or her stairs, whether because it was not safe or for whatever reason, and if the home is the workplace and he or she was deemed to be at work, that could be an issue.  I will not go on because I do not have enough time, but this definitely needs further examination.</p> <p>  Will Ms McElwee expand on the issue of excluding certain cohorts of employee and how that would work?  Ms King might also give her views on that.</p></speech>

We are thinking about people in the experience economy such as bartenders, housekeepers, baristas, line operators and factory operators.  Reasonably, there is no prospect of them ever working from home remotely, and there is a challenge for employers in trying to balance the needs of on-site workers and the flexibilities they require against those of a cohort they believe are being afforded all the responsibilities and the work-life balance.  Rather than going out every time and presenting the policy with an explanation of why the employees can never avail of it, we should probably just exclude those types of roles.</p></speech>

Where an employer has agreed to accommodating remote working for an employee and, subsequently, has a need for sick cover or maternity leave cover, how would that be dealt with?  If I have given someone a contract that allows him or her to work for home and I am now stuck for cover in the office, where normally I would be able to delegate someone to do that and where I want the person who is working at home to come back to the office, where do I stand as an employer?</p></speech>

There is mention of the development of a remote working policy in the legislation.  Those policies will be much better and more likely to be adhered to if they have been agreed between the employer and the employee group.  Dealing with these issues is the purpose of producing that type of policy because the policy will be intended to meet the needs of the business and the workers in it.  Those exigencies will occur, where, unfortunately, workers will become sick and there will be a requirement for cover.  All of that can be included in the procedure and dealt with on that basis.  It is not unusual and it can be dealt with.</p></speech>

I think we may have seen examples of this.  Is that something ICTU has considered?  How will it give comfort to employers in that instance?</p></speech>

If somebody requests the right to have remote working, the employer will try to meet the request.  I think trying thereafter to put together a constructive dismissal case, which is usually based on the employee claiming to have had no choice but to leave because he or she could not deal with the circumstances, would be really difficult.</p> <p>  As for the issue of promotions and so on, there are issues arising from remote working - Ms McElwee may have alluded to them - such as how it would pan out in overall terms in the context of gender-related issues, promotions and so on.  I would not in any way want to minimise the points the Deputy made, because they are significant issues.  Previously, in the case of work sharing, job sharing and so on, policies were developed to try to ensure people would not be disadvantaged by virtue of the fact they were remote working, and that can be done using the procedures that are in place in a company.</p> <p>  The Deputy's points relate to real issues, but there are ways and means by which we can at least minimise those effects.</p></speech>

I think that if it can be explored, it should be explored and everyone should have the right to have it considered.  Nevertheless, all the unintended consequences need to be considered, from the points of view of both the employer and the employee.</p><p>If we are saying people will have the right to request to work from home, even where a company employs people remotely, will that give them a right to request that they be allowed to work in an office?  For example, if there is an office in Dublin and somebody decides he or she wants to work in town one day with his or her workmates because he or she does not like the idea of being contracted to work from home, can that person, <i>inter alia</i>, make a different request such that, given the employer is allowing people to work from home, he or she should equally be allowed to work in the office?</p></speech>

Therefore the employer will stipulate where the normal place of work is.  The right to request remote working is over and above stipulating that normal location and therefore it is either conceded or not in circumstances in which both parties can agree within a policy framework.  The normal place of work is stipulated by the employer.  We have not quite had the revolution yet.</p></speech>

When I look at the detail of the Bill I see that you have to wait 26 weeks after taking up employment before you can even submit a request for flexible work.  That is a real obstacle, particularly for those with a disability or disabled people and lone parents taking up flexible work.  I would like to hear the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of IBEC on that 26-week waiting period.</p></speech>

Those periods are far too long.  In essence there is a provision such that an employer is insulated from a further request within a period of time.  From our point of view that is long but those are the issues that should be thrashed out in a tripartite way between the people who are penning this legislation, the employers and the trade unions to see if it is reasonable.</p></speech>

We know that there are organisations that already hire remotely.  Some organisations will have had experience of hiring remotely during the pandemic and they may be well prepared to do that in the future.  Lots of organisations might just make adjustments to the timelines or the level of interactivity they will want in order to support people who may have different and challenging needs when it comes to their labour market participation, as the Senator has outlined.  The 26-week waiting period is typically there and it is protective for lots of employers because it provides them with the opportunity to get someone in, do induction and get them well settled within the organisation before they begin working remotely.  It is not to say that an organisation could not accept a request earlier or that it could not reflect on a person's particular circumstances.</p> <p>  The 12-month period is also reasonable in circumstances where nothing else has changed.  As I understand it from the Bill, an employee could not regularly submit requests to seek a right to remote working where the employer would then be obligated to undertake a formal process and write up a business case on every occasion.  In larger and mid-size workplaces that could be become unfeasible and would become contentious because if nothing has changed, the likelihood is the employer will continue to refuse the request.</p></speech>

As I see it there is currently a rigid interpretation of the types of circumstances people find themselves in when they want remote work.  Sometimes it is for temporary reasons and other times it is for permanent reasons.  Could a provision be inserted into the Bill that would allow for those temporary situations where people need to work remotely for a period of time?</p></speech>

However, they can be worked into organisation-level policies in an effective way or they can be addressed in codes of practice.  There are times when challenges arise and when employers may want to deviate from the legislation in favour of the employee.  It is not possible to deviate when it is something that would adversely affect the employee.  Head 7 of the general scheme states:</p> <blockquote> 	For the Purposes of this Act, an employee, in the same or substantially similar employment position following a previous request ..., shall not be entitled to submit a new request ... until after 12-months&rsquo; continuous service following ... the employer&rsquo;s final [response]. </blockquote> <p>This is only in the case of &ldquo;the same or substantially similar employment&rdquo;, so that already provides for the fact that circumstances may change.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and his officials to the meeting.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind Members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit Members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any Member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask that any Members partaking via Microsoft Teams confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions to the meeting.</p> <p>  Those attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Masks should continue to be worn by those present while they are not addressing the committee.  I remind all members that should a vote be called, members must physically come to the committee room to vote.  I advise all in attendance that should a division be demanded, the secretariat is operating a new system which will display the taking of the division on the screens in the committee room.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and his officials for attending today and engaging with the committee.</p></speech>

Generally, we will not all speak to each one.  We will see how that goes.  We thought that was the best way to approach it.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 1, 78 and 84 to 92, inclusive, are linked.  I might read out the reasons for each amendment if that is the best way of doing it.  The purpose of the legislation is to give people access to their records, data and information, which, as we know, has been denied to many people for many years.  In the case of some people, this has been for their entire lifetime.  We know some people have passed away before being able to get some of this information.</p><p>We believe the legislation should include all possible and relevant data.  There should be no scope to leave anything out.  That applies in particular to amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 78 is very similar to amendment No. 1.  It is to include all data, information and possible records.  There is a fear that information may be withheld.  We must acknowledge that has been the experience of people.  These amendments will strengthen the legislation.</p><p>Amendment No. 84 is to include all possible scenarios and situations.  Amendment No. 85 relates to all the personal data, making it more inclusive.  Amendment No. 86 relates to the time restrictions mentioned.  We do not believe the legislation should have any time restrictions for fear it might prohibit somebody accessing their records if they fall outside that timeframe.</p><p>Regarding amendment No. 87, there may be times when an adoption did not actually take place but it is important that all the relevant information and data are given to the person.  Amendment No. 88 is in the same spirit as amendment No. 87.</p><p>Regarding amendment No. 89, we and others believe certain information may not be disclosed.  This relates to the contact preference register.  If somebody indicates he or she does not want to contact and gives a reason, is there a possibility that reason will not be communicated to the individual?  That was the reason for proposing amendment No. 89.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 90 to 92, inclusive, are to ensure there should be no preconditions and that absolutely nothing is left out.  We believe the language we are suggesting in our amendments is much stronger.</p><p>The Minister might want to respond to those first because the grouping covers amendments Nos. 1, 78, and 84 to 92, inclusive.  Sorry, other Deputies may want to come in now.</p></speech>

As Deputy Pringle said, it is necessary explicitly to include clear and comprehensive definitions of things such as administrative records, other records and sources that will guarantee survivors and relatives access to the full information they should be provided with.  The level of detail we are looking for is based on the experience of survivors and campaigners.  For years, people have been denied access to information based on the interpretation of the law by public bodies and officials.  We can all understand why people feel the urge to make things such as this explicitly clear in the legislation.  There cannot be any ambiguity this time.  State bodies, institutions and the church need to have no room to continue to deny people access to their information.  I wanted to come in at this early stage and say that.</p></speech>

My understanding of the intention of amendment No. 1, combined with amendment No. 90, is to include administrative records in the definition of relevant records so that such records can be safeguarded.  This is something we have given significant consideration to and there was reference to it in the pre-legislative report.  It is important to mention the legislation essentially provides that all birth, early life and care information a relevant body holds must be provided to an applicant.  That includes any such information held on any form of administrative record.  That is why we have written all these definitions so broadly.</p> <p>  The term "relevant record" does not limit the release of information under Parts 2, 3 or 4.  The term "relevant record" is about the safeguarding of records, which is dealt with in Part 7.  That definition of relevant record already covers any administrative record containing birth, early life, care or medical information, or information such as admissions and discharge registers, visitors' books, baptismal and confirmation records, and any other records containing personal information on the daily life of individuals.  The definition of "relevant records" is already very wide but, importantly, section 42 empowers the Minister to prescribe other classes of records as relevant records and bring them within the scope of the definition.  We are of the view the definition of relevant record is already extremely broad and covers everything we need it to.  However, we have the option under section 43 that will allow a future Minister to come back to this.  We have that flexibility if something is left out of the definition of relevant records.</p> <p>  Administrative records are very useful for understanding the overall working of mother and baby and county home institutions.  They have an historical value.  That is why section 43 empowers the Minister to prescribe relevant records.  It is envisaged these administrative records will most certainly fall within the definition set out in that section.  I am satisfied the legislation would support the inclusion of administrative records in a way that allows coherent archives of institutional records to be protected.</p> <p>  I hear there is some concern about the issue of administrative records.  I will ask my officials to consider if any additional detail could be included within the definition of relevant records to provide further reassurance in that regard.</p></speech>

The Minister said he would agree to look at the issue but amendment No.1 includes a comprehensive list.  If it were accepted, that would show an intention to work collaboratively and address some of the concerns that exist.</p></speech>

The Minister outlined that there is already provision within the Bill to revisit the situation if the documents are not comprehensive enough.  What would be lost in the period between this Bill being passed and the Minister deciding to revisit it?  What could be the impact on people who have suffered a lot already?  After this Bill is passed, if it is discovered a class of documents is deemed important and needs to be covered by and included in this legislation, there is provision here to do that.  What is going to be lost in the intervening period?  That is a real risk.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation and think about including the amendment, as Deputy Funchion has said.</p></speech>

We believe everything that is listed in this amendment is already covered within the definition of relevant records.  We do not see where the gaps are.  I do not feel there is a real risk but we have that catch-all provision there, if necessary.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Funchion, we do not see that there are gaps here.  We are willing to go away, have a look and see is there something that can be done, but I am not inclined to put this lengthy list into the legislation when I believe these types of records are already captured elsewhere in the Bill.  I am trying to meet the Deputy half way.  I understand the issues at play are important.  We believe they are protected but we are happy to look at the issue again.  If we believe it is needed, we can address the issue on Report Stage.  I am speaking in respect of amendments Nos. 1 and 90.</p></speech>

We want to ensure nobody is excluded.  The amendments propose, in page 8, to delete lines 13 to 15 and substitute it with &ldquo;born in the State and placed for adoption outside the State and whose adoption was effected outside the State&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 3 proposes to delete lines 13 to 15 and substitute it with &ldquo;born in the State and placed for adoption outside the State&rdquo;.  We believe our language and wording are stronger and ensures nobody is excluded.  We believe it is a wider definition and that the language in the Bill is too restrictive.</p><p>On amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which are in this grouping, we seek the insertion of &quot;who was subject to an illegal birth registration&quot;, thereby calling it exactly what it is, an illegal birth registration, or in the case of amendment No. 5, an illegal adoption.  It is important to use the correct language.  I know that people who fall into that category feel very strongly about this and that it should be referenced as it was illegal.  I will be making this point on a number of occasions, which is that the genuine reason for our amendments is to try to strengthen this legislation where we believe the language could be a lot stronger and more inclusive in parts, thereby ensuring that no records are left out of the process.</p></speech>

The Bill currently focuses on incorrect registrations.  This may seem an accurate term for some cases, but for many others, it is not accurate at all and, moreover, it is deeply insulting to the people considered.  Without acknowledging the illegalities involved, there is an erasure of the realities and lived experiences of many adopted people.</p> <p>  The Minister previously expressed a willingness to address this issue.  Will he respond specifically to amendments Nos. 72 and 75, which are in my name, that seek to allow the words "incorrect" and "illegal" to feature?  Is this the approach the Minister would be willing to accept?  We all want to address this issue in a way that is legislatively sound while recognising the lived experiences of adopted people and their relatives.  I heard the Minister on the "Your Politics" podcast when he was asked why we would not include that terminology, and he said he would have a willingness to include both - incorrect or illegal.  Has he looked into that since?</p></speech>

While my name is not on it, I believe it is an important amendment.  The focus of the Bill, rightly, is on State agencies, including An Bord Ucht&aacute;la, that placed people outside the State for adoption.  However, there are many cases of adopted people who were placed illegally outside the State, outside of any official organisations.  I have spoken to people to whom it has happened.  They were born in Donegal and placed for adoption across the Border or <i>vice versa</i>.  This series of amendments is trying to capture that within the legislation.  The Minister might say it has already been captured, but I would like to hear that because adopted people want to hear it as well because it is important to them.</p><p>These amendments attempt to recognise that adoptions also took place outside the State.  I believe they are worthwhile amendments.</p></speech>

I proposed amendments Nos. 81, 82 and 103.  They are technical amendments proposed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for the purposes of accuracy.  The definition of "incorrect birth registration" is purposefully constructed so that a person who is the subject of an illegal birth registration will always come within the scope of the definition, even after the correction of the birth register.  Therefore, on the grounds of accuracy, this set of amendments simply removes the redundant words "or has been" in references to persons affected by an illegal birth registration, and this ensures alignment with other sections of the Bill.</p></speech>

As others have done, I pay tribute to the many survivors who have taken the time to email or contact us to describe their experiences and express their desire to see this legislation through and effectively give them a right to information.  We are trying effectively to reflect their experiences, which is why I have tabled this amendment.  The amendment also reflects a recommendation of our pre-legislative scrutiny report that, rather than simply saying people had their particulars incorrectly entered in the register of births, that it would be reflected that there were also cases where individuals' dates of birth and so on were falsely entered.  We wanted to capture that reality in the definitional section, section 2, and make that distinction that, in some cases, records were deliberately falsified.</p><p>That is why I am tabling this amendment.  It is reflective, as with so many other amendments in this grouping, of our findings as a committee and our recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.</p></speech>

It would not be solely up to the Minister.  It clearly states, "any institution, agency or individual".  We think it is important that that tone is clear throughout the Bill, and that it covers any institution, agency or individual, so people are not left out and people who should be held accountable do not get away.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 139 also strengthens this section.  The authority will do all in its power to assist the person in this situation.  It ensures that the State does everything possible to address potential illegal birth registrations.  We have all seen the story that was in a documentary a number of months ago about illegal birth registrations.  It is important that we have the strongest possible language about that.</p> <p>  Regarding amendments Nos. 352 and 359, we believe it is more correct and appropriate to use the term "illegal".  The reality is that it was illegal.</p></speech>

We are going to try to be more clear.  There are limits to how much we can do that because of some of the procedural rules we need to follow.  There is a list of amendments - quite a long list; longer than Bills would normally get - and on that full list the amendments that are similar have been grouped together.  The unfortunate thing is, as we discuss them, we are only discussing them by number and not the details of them, which I appreciate can make things confusing without that full amendment list being available.  However, what we then do is discuss each amendment as it is grouped.  We will discuss all the amendments in that group but only vote on amendments in numerical order.  Therefore, there will be amendments we are discussing now that we will not actually vote on until later in the session or in another session.  At that time we will only take a vote on them because the discussion will have happened now, when the first of that grouping comes together.</p> <p>  I appreciate this is complex, and given the nature of the 360 amendments, it adds to that complexity.  I appreciate that, for many people who might be watching outside of the committee rooms, if they do not have that list of Committee Stage amendments it will be almost impenetrable.  Therefore, apologies for that.  We will move on.</p> <p>  What we have done is, we have moved amendment No. 2.  We have discussed the grouping, which is amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, 70 to 76, inclusive, 81 to 83, inclusive, 104, 105, 138, 139, 352 and 359, all of which are in similar areas or related.  For any of the Deputies who tabled some of those amendments to which we have already spoken, are there amendments in that list that I have called out, either from the Deputies or from the Minister, to which we have not yet spoken?  If there are no further discussions, we can move to a vote.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her amendment.  This relates to the definition of illegal birth registration and use of the term "incorrect birth registration" within the legislation.  I am very clear and I and the Government absolutely accept that illegal birth registrations took place, and in terms of my engagement with this issue, this is how I describe them.  It is also important, speaking to the set of amendments that Deputy Cairns spoke to earlier, that we make sure as broad a number of people as possible can use the provisions of this legislation.  Our concern is if we use a definition of "illegal birth registration", there is a requirement to prove illegality before using that particular provision to benefit.  A person who is the subject of an incorrect birth registration as it currently stands can use this legislation.  If a person has to prove that his or her birth registration was not just incorrect but was actually illegal, that is a harder standard to prove.  That means the provision of using this legislation can apply to fewer people.  What we have always tried to do is broaden access to this legislation to let as many people as possible use the provisions of this legislation to get their information.</p> <p>  However, I am cognisant of the issues that have been raised about the language, so I have brought forward an amendment quite similar to Deputy Bacik's.  I asked my officials to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  This amendment clarifies that information leading to an incorrect birth registration was given to the General Register Office by a third party, and that information was not merely incorrect, but also false or misleading.  Therefore we have used that term and the addition of that language, that is, as a result of giving information that was false or misleading in respect of the name, to try to address that.  That is very similar to the change Deputy Bacik proposed.  I believe this addresses the concerns that have been raised.</p></speech>

I will now open it up for discussion on any of those to let any member speak on them who wishes to speak on them.  When that is finished, we will move to a vote on amendment No. 2.</p></speech>

I completely understand what the Minister is saying, that nobody wants to limit access to the provisions by causing anyone to have to prove anything, and the Minister referenced a situation where somebody would have to prove his or her adoption was illegal.  Amendment No. 72 that I have put forward inserts "or illegal birth registration information".  It is literally incorrect to say they are just inaccurate, or what is the original term in the legislation?</p></speech>

It is incorrect to say they are just incorrect registrations.  Some of them are illegal and that needs to be acknowledged.  I am not saying to replace it.  The amendment is to say "or illegal birth registration information".  I understand the Minister's sentiment of not wanting to limit it, but the argument does not make any sense.  It can include the two so that it is not limited to, but acknowledges the fact, there were illegal birth registrations, which is what people are looking for.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</p></speech>

However, the option that is made available by the Deputy's amendment is about the significance of this for people who feel aggrieved.  You potentially might have lived your whole life only to find out you are not who you thought you were.  To describe it as distressing is an understatement.  The amendment is well-worded.</p></speech>

The input of those with direct experience of adoption is essential if the services set out under the Bill are to be effective.  A previous Minister with responsibility for children, the late Brian Lenihan Jnr., set up an advisory group to assist the Adoption Authority on an information and tracing service and other matters.  Campaigners have sought that similar groups be put in place for this Bill in recognition of the complexity involved and the vital insight adopted people can provide.  The Minister and his officials create the law but adopted people live it.  It would be beneficial to the process and a strong sign of good faith from the Department to include it.</p></speech>

Consultation with stakeholders and people who benefit from this legislation have been to the forefront of the development of the legislation.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, members engaged with a large number of groups.  I have also engaged with a large number of groups and individuals.  I continue to engage with survivor groups, adopted people and their families.  Deputy Funchion and I had a useful meeting last week with a former resident.  That was important and developed my understanding of what is needed in this area.</p> <p>  In the pre-legislative scrutiny report, a recommendation was made for a role for stakeholders in the implementation of the legislation.  We considered that recommendation and, on foot of that, I will put in place a stakeholder representative group.  The work of the group will be aimed at supporting the preparation for the implementation of the legislation when it is enacted.  That work will have regard to the public information campaign we have spoken about and general awareness-raising of changes being brought about by this legislation.  The proposals for the group's role, composition and relationship are being developed by my Department.  </p> <p>  That is not the only work we are doing in the area.  Action 1 of the 22-point action plan in response to the commission's report referred to developing a new and enhanced model of engagement and we are looking at the proposal to bring forward a special advocate for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  This could look at providing a well-resourced and dynamic model of representation for former residents to make sure there is a strong advocacy voice for them on a range of issues beyond the implementation of this legislation.  We know from our engagement with survivors that their priorities are multifaceted.  For some this legislation is key, while for others it is about memorialisation or the recovery of remains, which we have already discussed.  For others again it is issues around redress or education and how the history of this period is reflected.  That special advocate model could support systematic advocacy on behalf of former residents.  The longer term, resourced advocacy model addressing survivors in the myriad of ways they require and the stakeholder group we are establishing for the implementation of this legislation constitute the preferable way to go.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 9 is in the same vein or spirit and provides that any institution, agency, organisation or individual involved in the separation of mothers and their children should be covered.  In relation to amendment No. 10, it was brought to our attention that not all care was provided by institutions.  We know that there were some <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements but there may have been periods of time when a child was with his or her mother or father but then moved back into an institution.  Our aim is to ensure that all of those situations are covered.</p><p>I stress again in relation to these amendments that they are strengthening the Bill and the language therein.  If the Department and the Minister really believe that everything is covered, I do not see why they would have a difficulty with including some of these language changes just to strengthen the Bill and to signal to the people affected that all situations will be covered.  Again, I stress that there is distrust.  That distrust is understandable, given the years of being let down, for want of a better phrase.  When one reads these amendments, one sees that their aim is to strengthen what is already in the Bill.  I do not see why we cannot include stronger language.</p></speech>

We need to guarantee that all records relating to the adoption or informal care arrangement of a relevant person are understood as that person's personal data.  These amendments simply provide for a fuller definition that will provide greater reassurance for adopted people and their relatives.  It is difficult to understand why they cannot be accepted by the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030200002#G00800"><p>Just to set out the overall context, it is important to remember that the definition of care arrangement is set out on page 9 of the Bill.  That sets out the types of care arrangements that are relevant to the release of information provided for in the Bill.  It is particularly relevant to the definition of a &quot;relevant person&quot; and the categories of information that are eligible for release under the Bill.  The types of care arrangement defined in the Bill include a nursed out arrangement, a boarded out arrangement, and an arrangement under which a child was cared for by a resident of an institution, among others.</p><p>On the specific amendments in this group, amendment No. 7 is not one I can support.  The definition of care arrangement is a key definition and is central to the understanding of several other definitions.  This definition is expansive and seeks to ensure that a broad range of care arrangements and areas are covered.  What is being proposed by amendment No. 7 is the removal of that and this is obviously not something I can support.</p><p>I am also not in a position to support amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10.  They seek to alter the definition of care arrangement.  The provisions of amendment No. 8 are already covered in subsection (9) of the existing definition of care arrangement contained in the legislation, which provides for &quot;an arrangement under which a child was cared for as a resident of an institution specified in the <i>Schedule</i>&quot;.  We believe that part is already covered.  Amendment No. 9 is already covered by the definition of care information which provides for the release of information to anyone who made care arrangements or was a party to them.  In that context, amendment No. 9 is unnecessary.</p><p>Amendment No. 10 seeks to expand the definition to include care provided by a parent or guardian of the child.  I understand the spirit behind this amendment but this refers to care provided to a child by its parent, outside of the institution.  We have to be very honest about the type of information we are going to have available.  When the child is with a parent and not in an institution, there will not be records of what happened in that situation.  We must be honest with people.  We have all met survivors who have tried to get their information only to be told that the information no longer exists.  Suggesting to survivors that there is information about what happened when they were cared for by their own parents outside of an institution is problematic.  That is not information that the institution has because, by its very nature, the care was taking place outside of the institution.  We can confirm that where a child was cared for by a parent within an institution, and we know that happened in many of the mother and baby homes, that information is available because obviously it is part of the institutional records but we cannot make claims about finding and delivering information about what happened outside of these institutions.  We would be raising false hope by doing that.</p></speech>

However, what we are trying to say here is that if there was a situation where a child was in a care institution, was boarded out or fostered and that did not work out and the child was sent back, it would be important that any records of that would be accessible.  That is why we are including guardians, mothers and fathers because, potentially, the child could have been boarded out with or fostered by a birth parent and then sent back to an institution.  We are trying to cover all possibilities and angles.  I know people will look at this and say that the types of situations we are trying to cover are immense and that everything is covered by the Bill.  However, when people have been consistently let down for years, if not decades, they want absolutely everything possible to be covered by this legislation to ensure that no situation is left out.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.</p> <p>  I understand some of the points made by the Minister.  There have been numerous apologies made to survivors and survivor groups over the years but the best way to honour and acknowledge that is by ensuring we respect their wishes and what they want in the wording of this legislation.  It is possible to put this wording into the Bill.</p></speech>

However, in terms of the circumstances Deputy Funchion just outlined, the type of care arrangements that are defined in the Bill clearly include a nursed out arrangement, a boarded out arrangement and an arrangement under which a child was cared for by a resident of an institution.  Our belief is that the situation that Deputy Funchion just outlined is already covered by this legislation.  We know that boarded out and nursed out arrangements are two separate things.  Nursed out children were usually very young whereas boarded out children, while still young, could be seven or eight years old as opposed to a few months old.  We believe that the very comprehensive definition of care arrangement and the various types of arrangement provided for cover all of the instances that we can envisage and would have experience of from talking to survivors over the years.  At the same time, it does not raise a false or unmeetable hope that information about what happened when an adopted person or someone boarded out was in his or her own home, cared for by his or her own parent because that information just does not exist.</p></speech>

I will speak to amendments Nos. 13 to 25, inclusive.  Amendment No. 13 relates to the relevant person's place of birth.  I believe this is a common-sense amendment.  It strengthens the legislation to include where the person was born.  The name and where he or she was cared for are already included and I do not understand why it does not include where the person was born.</p><p>Amendment No. 14 seeks to add &quot;records of any vaccine trials in which the relevant person was a research subject&quot;.  We know the issue of vaccine is very important.  There are many question marks around it.  It is a very contentious issue at times.  It is important that all information, no matter how difficult that may be, is included.</p><p>Amendment No. 15 seeks to add &quot;the relevant person&rsquo;s medical records from birth until the time of placement, including x-rays, tests, vaccines&quot;.  It is important that all medical records such as X-rays are included.  That is all I have to say for now.  I may come back when the Minister responds.</p></speech>

We need definitions that incorporate the full range of people and actors involved in providing care.  The materials that recorded aspects of that care are a vital area where we need stronger definitions to help people assemble a clear understanding of their identity and heritage.</p></speech>

I do not propose to accept these amendments, primarily because we believe these definitions are already clearly contained within the existing definitions in the Bill.  Like the Deputies, we also wish to see as broad a range of categories of information as possible provided to adopted people, people who were subject to illegal birth registrations and those who were boarded out.  That is why the definition of care information provided in the Bill is expansive.  It was drafted in consultation with organisations familiar with the types of records that would be held by these institutions.</p> <p>  Many of the proposed amendments seek to capture types of information already provided for in the Bill under other categories of information: birth, early life, medical information and provided items.  The type of information these amendments propose to address is already guaranteed for release under the legislation.  For example, the information specified in amendments Nos. 14, 19, 20, 23 and 24 is already explicitly covered under the definition of early life information.  The information specified in amendments Nos. 18, 21, 23, 24 and 25 is explicitly covered by the definition of care information.  The information specified in amendment No. 13 is specifically captured under birth information.  The information specified in amendment No. 14 is set out under medical information.  The information specified in amendment No. 16 is already covered across all categories of information, birth, early life, care, medical information and provided items. </p> <p>  It is not possible to support amendment No. 22 because we believe the wording of the amendment is more restrictive than what is currently provided for under the legislation.  As such, we do not want to restrict the type of information available.</p></speech>

The definition contained in the Bill is problematic and focuses on a specific timeframe of the person's early life.</p><p>Amendments No. 27 to 64, inclusive, spell out precisely what personal data means in this context.  We are attempting to give an extensive description of personal data and provide a full and exhaustive list of personal data in terms of adopted persons and their identity.  We also seek to include information as to how the relevant persons acquired their adoptive identity, the names of their genetic family members, their county and country of origin at the time of their birth and the occupation of their parents and grandparents at the time of their birth.  We also seek to include information on the number of siblings and other relations in a person's genetic family, correspondence about the person, records surrounding the assessment and administrative processes associated with the person's adoption and the names of the people involved in that person's care.  This goes to the heart of what we have been saying all along.  We believe the amendments would ensure that everything that can be included is included.</p></speech>

The definition was highlighted as being problematic.  It is important to note this point was also raised by UN rapporteurs.  We heard many compelling statements calling for a broader and more robust definition of care information.  This set of amendments represents a very strong and human rights informed understanding of care information.  I encourage the Minister to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

There is quite a lot here.  The amendments govern the provision of information.  It is telling that adopted people feel they have to put forward these amendments.  I am concerned about the Bill on that basis.  I know the Minister will say the legislation is comprehensive and covers all options but we will not know that until afterwards.  The problem is that we will not know until it is too late whether they are all covered.  That is really worrying.</p> <p>  I agree with amendment No. 26.  It would be right to delete the whole lot.  All the amendments in the group are relevant and important.  They reflect the information it is felt has to be included in the section to ensure all the information and all of the options are covered.  Information is vital for adopted people.  Their whole lives are lived with a lack of information.  Amendment No. 29 refers to letters, cards or other materials placed in an adoption file by the relevant person's father or other relatives.  It states people should have access to this information.  Clearly there have been instances where people have not been given this information.  This is why the amendment has been tabled.  It is directly from experiences that people have had.  Amendment No. 30 refers to letters, cards or other material placed in the adoption file by the relevant person's mother.  There is a reason for these amendments.  It is important and the Minister should take the amendments on board and include them in the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030200002#K04100"><p>I want to recall what we are trying to do with regard to early life information.  The definition provided on page 10 of the Bill sets out the various types of information relating to a relevant person's life from birth to 18 years that are eligible to be released under the legislation.  It is not an exhaustive list but it provides clear and consistent guidance on the type of information that has to be released in all cases, which is what we are achieving with the Bill.  It is an expansive definition.  It covers many different types of information, including, among many other examples, any religious ceremony that may have taken place, whether a relevant person has had vaccinations, any record of a person's physical or emotional development and whether the mothers of persons stayed with them in an institution for any length of time.</p><p>I cannot accept the amendment because it proposes to delete the definition of early life information, which is a key definition that ensures essential personal histories are captured and released.  The fact that the word "includes" precedes the list of types of information that may be on record makes it clear that it is an expansive and not a restrictive definition.</p><p> I cannot support amendment No. 27, which proposes to delete the reference to section 2(2).  That is important because it looks at the reference to that subsection.  The function of the reference in the section is to define the period of time during which the definitions of care information and early life information apply, and it is included for accuracy and precision in drafting.  This amendment deletes the particular reference entirely, but it does not offer any substitute or alternative.  That would have the consequence of extending the period until the relevant person is 18 years old, but that amendment would have no practical effect as there would be no records in relation to care information or early life information that would extend past that cut-off point, because once a person is adopted or the persons named as his or her parents in a false or incorrect registration assume the role of parents, there would no longer be any records held by public bodies because the person would no longer be with a public body but with his or her adoptive or non-adoptive parents.</p><p> I have spoken about this with the officials.  We do not support this amendment in respect of the reference to section 2(2).  I am advised that under grouping 11, amendment No. 102, seeks to delete section 2(2), and I have asked my officials to review the potential benefits to individuals of amending that particular section.  In the context of amendment No. 102, we will look to see if there is something we can do to provide additional clarity.  That is what I have been advised in respect of amendment No. 27.</p><p> To address the extensive list of points that have been raised in amendments Nos. 28 to 63, inclusive, we are not accepting the amendments because we believe all of these issues, bar a small number that I will speak to at the end, are already covered within the definitions that we have provided under this legislation, either under the definition of early life information or the definitions of birth, care and medical information.  Amendments Nos. 45, 48, 50, 51, 54 and 56 to 59, inclusive, are explicitly provided for under early life.  Amendments Nos. 41 and 47 are clearly covered under care information.  Amendments Nos. 32, 33, 36, 37, 42 to 44, inclusive, and 61 are explicitly covered under our definition of birth information.  Amendments Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, are captured under the term "provided items".  Amendments Nos. 52 to 55, inclusive, are provided for under both medical information and early life information.  Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 are covered under both early life and care information.  I believe all of the amendments as set out are unnecessary as they are already covered.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 34, 39, 40, 42 and 46 refer to the inclusion of information that is the personal data of a relevant person&rsquo;s mother and is not therefore the personal data of the relevant person.  We cannot support their inclusion in this legislation as that would provide for the release of another person&rsquo;s data without that person's consent.</p></speech>

The Minister is saying the provisions are already included.  There is obviously a breakdown somewhere.  Could a compromise be reached?  If they are covered, why can some of the amendments not be accepted to show good faith?  If the Minister believes they are covered, then what is the harm in having what is proposed in the Bill?</p></speech>

I ask him to expand on that.</p></speech>

Deputy Funchion was making points on a good-faith gesture regarding the acceptance of amendments.  We have made significant changes between the publication of the pre-legislative scrutiny report and the final Bill.  I have already indicated that I will ask officials to review some of the points Deputies made where I feel they are legitimate.  I have made proposals that I feel, particularly in terms of illegal birth registration, respond to issues Deputies have raised.  Others have asked whether their list of amendments cannot just be accepted if we are all trying to cover what is roughly the same material.  The definitions we have in the Bill have been carefully fine tuned in accordance with engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General.  Every word has been considered and thought through, and we have examined previous legislation that did not get passed.  The provisions have been expanded to make sure they are as inclusive as possible.  The definitions of "birth information", "early life information" and "medical information" have all been planned and designed in a very specific way to work across all the various sections of the legislation.</p> <p>  I accept the point Deputy Pringle was making on the dissatisfaction of adopted people and others in seeking access to information previously, and that is why this legislation is being considered.  I have two points on the question of whether people can have confidence in Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  First, my Department is leading the implementation group.  It is being led by Ms Laura McGarrigle, the assistant secretary in this area.  It brings together our Department, Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland with a view to changing the culture in organisations in the sense of making it very clear that the presumption is one of the release of information.  I accept that has not happened in the past.  This legislation is to give very clear legal grounding for always releasing information but there has to be a culture change.  My Department is leading that through the implementation body.  I have discussed the required change to organisational culture in the past three weeks with the chief executive of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, who firmly believes in it.  Whenever he was before this committee, he was very clear on it.  I have also discussed the matter with the chairperson of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Irrespective of whether the change of culture is clear, the Minister has the power, under various sections of this legislation, to issue specific guidelines on how the release of information can be understood by the relevant bodies.  The cultural changes we are trying to achieve in the agencies and the specific guideline-writing power give us an opportunity to continue to ensure the categories we already argue are very broad can continue to be interpreted in an expansive way.</p></speech>

We are aware that there is a considerable institutional aversion to change in such organisations.  This disregards how people have been treated by them.  There is a need to acknowledge this in legislation.</p></speech>

What Deputy Cairns said is right.  There is a need for cultural change.  It has to happen at some point, and something has to start it off.  I am still worried about the period in which cultural change is to take place in that adopted people could be left behind or something could happen.  I do not know the solution or the best that can be achieved for anybody in this regard.  As is evident from the number of amendments suggested by the bodies acting on behalf of adopted people, a big task needs to be done.  It may require a leap of faith by everybody to ensure it is done.  I hope it happens.  The best way is to give all the information because there should not be anything hidden.  That is how it should happen.  We will see how it goes.</p></speech>

The definition of &quot;early life information&quot; is problematic as it currently denies access to information about a person's siblings, despite general data protection regulation, GDPR defining &quot;personal data&quot; as any information relating to a person.  Many adopted people and their siblings, whether adopted or not, are eager to learn about each other and be in contact.  We believe they must be facilitated in doing so.  Amendments Nos. 65 to 69, inclusive, are on that genetic relative information.</p></speech>

It is vitally important.  I know the GDPR argument, but this is GDPR that applies to individuals who are similar people and have similar GDPR, so there has to be away around this.  We should not be making any distinctions between adopted people and everybody else.  This is what these amendments try to avoid in the Bill.</p><p>I am fully in favour of these amendments. </p></speech>

These amendments also provide a framework to acknowledge and include relatives who may only come to light as the process evolves.  Adopted people often have to assemble disparate pieces of information, which leads to more records.  These definitions strengthen the recognition of rights to information through genetic registers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030200002#S00300"><p>I cannot support this set of amendments.  They seek to alter or expand the definitions of "genetic relative" and "genetic relative information" contained in the Bill.  These definitions were carefully considered in consultation with the Attorney General and the Data Protection Commissioner.  The definition of genetic relative is central to information release in two key ways.  First, it relates to the release of the medical information of a genetic relative where the information is necessary for the maintenance of a relevant person's health; and second, to the release of correspondence between a relevant body or secondary information source and the genetic relative of a relevant person.  It also relates to information pertaining to any visit a genetic relative may have made to a relevant person under the definition of early life information.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 65 seeks to extend that definition of a genetic relative to include grandchildren.  However, this is not relevant or necessary in any scenario where this definition applies.  For example, a record will not hold the medical information of a relevant person's grandchild and they will have corresponded with relevant bodies in relation to that person.  There is no way that someone who was in an institution up to the age of 18 will have had a letter from their grandchild because their grandchild would not have been born at that stage.  This is therefore an unnecessary amendment.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 66, the current definition of a genetic relative already sufficiently covers this, especially with regard to the reasons for defining a genetic relative within the legislation.  It is highly unlikely that a relative beyond a parent, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle or cousin would have visited or corresponded with a relevant person.  This is also relevant as regards access to medical information of a genetic relative, as it is highly unlikely that information pertaining to anyone beyond the list provided under the definition would exist within records or would be medically relevant and necessary for the maintenance of a relevant person's health.  This amendment is also unnecessary.</p> <p>  It is important to emphasise that both these amendments, Nos. 65 and 66, could jeopardise the release of a genetic relative's information to a relevant person if the definition ended up containing vague or unsupported categories of relatives, as it would not meet the necessity and proportionality test that releasing the personal sensitive data of a genetic relative to a third party would involve. </p> <p>  I cannot support the list of information suggested under amendments Nos. 67 and 69 as the name of the genetic relative and their potential status as an adopted person is their own personal data and not the personal data of the relevant person.  This was confirmed by the Data Protection Commissioner when appearing before the committee.  The other suggested additions under this amendment, namely, sex of siblings and position within the family order, are already provided for under the existing definition of a genetic relative.</p> <p>  I cannot support amendment No. 68.  Where this information is contained within a file, it will be released under the current definition of genetic relative information.  However, there cannot be a guarantee that this information is accessible and available on all files, as it is totally dependent on a person's position within the family order and whether siblings existed at the time of the record's creation.  I therefore cannot guarantee its release in all cases.  However, the database of the commission of investigation, which created a single record of a mother and her children and which we protected under legislation passed in 2020, should be helpful in that regard.</p></speech>

I thank them for the invitation to meet the Joint Committee on Health and the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health to discuss the governance and clinical oversight of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Kerry.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer for the Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation; Mr. Jim Ryan, head of mental health operations; Dr. Maura Young, executive clinical director for Kerry mental health services; and Dr. Amanda Burke, child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist and executive clinical director for Galway Roscommon mental health services.</p> <p>  The report on the Look-Back Review into Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in south Kerry, also referred to as the Maskey report, was published on 26 January 2022.  The look-back review was formally commissioned by the chief officer for the Cork Kerry community healthcare organisation, CHO, in April 2021, following an audit of case files in south Kerry CAMHS after concerns were raised about the clinical practice of a non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD.  The purpose of the look-back review was to consider potential issues relating to the clinical practice of the NCHD with regard to prescribing, care planning, diagnostics and clinical supervision in south Kerry CAMHS.  In line with our procedures for dealing with serious incidents, this review was conducted in accordance with the HSE incident management framework 2020 and the HSE look-back review process guideline 2015.  The review team was led by Dr. Se&aacute;n Maskey, CAMHS consultant with the Maudsley Hospital in London.  Dr. Maskey and his team reviewed clinical records of close to 1,500 children and young people who had attended south Kerry CAMHS between 1 July 2016 and 19 April 2021.  A helpline was established in April 2021 to provide advice and support to families affected by the look-back review and it remains open.  Through this helpline, families can access information, free counselling support and schedule appointments with clinical support teams. </p> <p>  The Maskey report identified a number of deficits in respect of governance, supervision and oversight, clinical practice and administrative processes within the south Kerry CAMHS team.  These deficits are deeply regrettable and were contributing factors to the substandard care received by the 240 children, young people and their families.  On behalf of the HSE, I wish to reiterate our sincere apologies to all those who have experienced deficits in the services they have received.  Our aim at all times is to provide these children, young people and their families with safe and effective services and with every possible support and reassurance.  </p> <p>  Cork Kerry CHO has taken immediate action to ensure appropriate governance, clinical leadership and supervision within south Kerry CAMHS.  The objective remains to secure a permanent consultant psychiatrist and, in the interim, measures have been put in place to ensure clinical governance and leadership.  A consultant psychiatrist is on site two days per week with additional support provided remotely three days per week.  In line with recommendations in the Maskey report concerning telemedicine, a consultant psychiatrist will provide three evening clinics per week remotely from Dublin, while a pilot involving a consultant registered with the Irish Medical Council, based outside of the EU, is also under way. </p> <p>  The HSE has taken a range of actions to address the findings of the Maskey report and we are committed to ensuring full implementation of its 35 recommendations.  Together with the chief clinical officer, I will chair a national oversight group to oversee, monitor and report on our implementation of the Maskey report.  This oversight group will have a strong service user focus.  It will operate in a fully transparent manner and progress reports will be publicly available.</p> <p>  Cork Kerry CHO has already identified supports for children and young people affected in south Kerry CAMHS and, in addition, is standing up a dedicated clinical liaison support team, which will provide key worker and case manager services to children and young people affected.  This team will consult with families to determine how to best meet identified needs, taking into consideration the full range of health services, including specialist mental health services.  The clinical liaison support team will also identify other appropriate services in the community, as well as services available from private service providers that can support the children, young people and their families.  </p> <p>  While the scope of the look back review is confined to practices in south Kerry CAMHS, I appreciate that the Maskey report can give rise to concern among children, young people and families who avail of services provided by CAMHS teams in other parts of the country.  In order to provide assurance to families who need our services, the HSE&rsquo;s national oversight group will be commissioning an independently chaired review of medication practice across all CAMHS teams.  The national oversight group will also commission an audit of compliance with operational guidelines as well as a qualitative study of how those who use, work in and refer to CAMHS experience those services.  Information from the planned national audits will guide our continued efforts to enhance youth mental health services.  </p> <p>  There has been a significant investment in CAMHS over a number of years to meet increased demand and to improve services for children and young people with mental health difficulties.  Within the past six years, &euro;22.6 million of development funding has been directed to enhance CAMHS.  Since 2013, an additional 18 CAMHS teams have been established and close to 300 additional whole-time equivalent posts added to our workforce.  There are currently 73 multidisciplinary CAMHS teams in place providing important assessment and treatment services.  Alongside these targeted enhancements of capacity in our CAMHS teams, we have invested in telehealth, eating disorder teams and inpatient care.</p><p>Importantly, we have also invested in services such as Jigsaw and primary care psychology for children and young people with mild to moderate mental health difficulties who do not need to access the specialist mental health services that CAMHS provide.  The improvement of youth mental health services will continue to be a key priority for the HSE as we continue to implement the recommendations set out in Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.</p><p> I once again take the opportunity to apologise on behalf of the HSE to the children, young people and families whose care, as outlined in the Maskey report, did not meet the standards it should have.</p></speech>

I will open with the issue of checks and balances in the context of our mental health services.  If a consultant is working in a hospital, be it in orthopaedics or surgery, there are checks and balances in place within that hospital's structures.  In our mental health services, there are no checks and balances.  Even if one takes it that a consultant is in charge, there are no checks and balances in regard to reviewing what that consultant is doing or prescribing.  What action is the HSE taking to make sure those checks and balances apply across the board to consultants and junior doctors in our mental health services?</p></speech>

In terms of the checks and balances, there is a governance structure within our mental health services.  Doctors report up through the medical governance line to clinical directors and, ultimately, to the executive clinical directors.  There is the same clinical line of governance that we have in other services.  From an organisation-wide perspective, when looking at medical staffing and structures, Dr. Colm Henry and I lead a group that looks at the medical workforce, and, certainly, the non-consultant hospital doctor-----</p></speech>

I am talking about the checks and balances that are currently in the mental health services.  If a consultant is appointed, who reviews the work that consultant is doing?  In a hospital structure, there are checks and balances because there are a lot of management systems.  However, in the context of mental health day services, I am asking what structures are in place?  What happened in Kerry has proved that there was not a structure in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.539" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030200002#B00600"><p>It is the same.  I appreciate what happened in Kerry should not have happened - I wish to reiterate that.  We have an equivalent system whereby junior doctors report to more senior doctors.  Consultants report up through a clinical director in the area and, ultimately, to the executive clinical director in the CHO.  I will ask either Dr. Young or Dr. Amanda Burke to come in on the clinical pathway for that.</p></speech>

Similar to the hospitals, we have a number of other checks and balances.  We review all clinical complaints that come in for trends or outliers.  We also have clinical audits.

The Deputy's point is that, in this case, our measures for picking up deviations from practice did not work.  That is clear because it went on for four to five years.  We have our standard governance lines, such as in an acute hospital system, as Dr. Burke was explaining.  It goes up the CAMHS clinical director and then to the executive clinical director, ECD, eventually.  However, what happened was that we were looking at our key performance indicators but our quality measures were not robust enough to capture the quality of the service provided.  We were able to capture how long people were waiting and the length of time for the referral, but we were not able to capture the quality of the service that was provided on the ground.  We realise we need to do a lot of work to improve how we measure the quality of service, and a big component of that is service-user feedback.</p></speech>

I know we are talking about a non-consultant doctor in this case, but even with consultants, does Dr. Young not accept that there is not an adequate structure in place to cross-check their performance and the work they are doing in the mental health services as they are currently structured?</p></speech>

What we know is that, in this instance, it did not work and as Dr. Young set out this has demonstrated to us that some of the measures we use are not robust enough.  I dispute the assertion that we do not have a governance structure in place.  We have invested significantly in the structure of services to ensure we have clinical directors and executive clinical directors to provide the clinical governance.  They are in place in all our CHOs.</p></speech>

As to the position not being filled, a period of 12 months would not be unusual for a consultant post not to be filled but, in this case, it was running into two or three years.  Why was a proper structure not put in place such as someone giving support to that doctor?  It appears there was no support in place for that doctor who was providing the service.</p></speech>

It seems from what she said that supervision was available but not actually availed of.  Does Ms O'Connor accept that supervision and oversight should be coming from the top down as opposed to telling the non-consultant doctor it was there if he wished to avail of it?</p></speech>

Again, to be clear, we are not here to defend in any way what has happened.  Certainly, from our perspective, the uptake of supervision and the supervising structures we have in place is a key issue.  I might ask Dr. Young or Dr. Burke to comment on how that supervision works if somebody chooses not to engage.</p></speech>

That non-consultant was not fully qualified and does not meet what the HSE is looking for at present, as it is looking for a fully qualified consultant psychiatrist.  The HSE is still looking for a person to fill that role, but that supervision should have come from the top down in actively going to supervise the work that was being carried out as opposed to telling the consultant it was there if he wished to avail of it.  Does Ms O'Connor accept that?</p></speech>

As we said to Deputy Burke, the supervision was from another very busy consultant.  Again, a key issue in this area was not being able to get a consultant and relying on a junior doctor and a consultant who was covering a very busy patch in terms of supervision.  The Deputy is correct.  On how we provide supervision and somebody choosing not to avail of that, it absolutely should be provided regardless.  That should be part of the supervisory process, even if the person does not wish to engage.  I do not disagree with the Deputy.</p></speech>

However, from our perspective of running mental health services, we have our eyes wide open about the very real challenges in recruiting consultants to CAMHS.  When we say we have 72 teams requiring consultants, as we grow teams and as we need more consultants we struggle to get consultant psychiatrists.  That is not just an Irish challenge but a global one.  We are competing in a global market when it comes to getting CAMHS consultants.  There is a question to be asked about how we actually provide a sufficient medical workforce as we grow the numbers of teams.</p> <p>  Our priority has to be for the sickest children to receive the service they need.  That is why within mental health, over a number of years now, we have been investing in a range of solutions to try to look at how we can prioritise children with most need for our very specialist service.  We have to remember CAMHS is a very specialist mental health service.  There are other options available for mental health supports that we have funded, for example, Jigsaw, as I mentioned, in primary care psychology.  Those avenues should be used in the first instance.  While I do not disagree with what is stated in the policy, it is worth noting that we are now focused on Sharing the Vision - I know Mr. Ryan and Dr. Burke are very involved in that - and are looking at a different type of approach around youth mental health.  The workforce challenge is a very real one that we cannot ignore.</p></speech>

I was the national director for mental health until my role was reconfigured at the end of 2017.  I was the national director of mental health until 31 December 2017.  At that time, the structures in the HSE were very different.  There were siloed structures which comprised a mental health division, a primary care division, etc.  It was certainly of benefit at that time.  However, from my personal experience I would say it led to other challenges.  At that time, some of the challenges we were starting to encounter were challenges of integration.  Even at the time - in 2017 and heading in 2018 - there was a risk that a siloed approach to mental health was becoming an issue.  For example, we invested in primary care psychology.  The first course for anybody who is experiencing a mental health difficulty needs to be in primary care.  The specialist mental health services are exactly that.  Having a national director does not fit with an integrated approach to service delivery.</p> <p>  In other fora, we discuss with many of the members issues such as Sl&aacute;intecare, regional health areas, RHAs, and an integrated approach to care.  That is far more important.  It is more about looking at the functions.  There is much discussion about a national director for mental health.  I think it is more important that we focus on what the issues are.  What do people feel-----</p></speech>

I wish to recap and refresh my memory.  I thank the witnesses for attending and for the work they have done, in particular, those who were involved in the Maskey report.  The look-back review was formally commissioned by the chief officer for Cork-Kerry community healthcare organisation following an audit of case files.  Was that an audit of sample files or a full audit?</p></speech>

When the concerns were highlighted to us by the local consultant at that time, who said he was coming across abnormal prescribing patterns and was not happy with some of the diagnoses being made, we said that what we needed to do was take a 10% random sample to see if the issues were isolated or widespread across the whole caseload.  At that time, there were just over 500 cases open so we took a 10% sample, which is approximately 55 cases.</p></speech>

Sample files were, therefore, taken and the Maskey report was initiated as a result of findings of that.  Arising out of that, there was a look-back review, of which details have been given, to consider potential issues relating to clinical practice in regard to prescribing, care planning, diagnostics and clinical supervision specifically in Kerry.  I want to move away from Kerry, in one sense.  Having looked at the HSE look-back review process guidelines, it seems to me that they were followed and the system works in that sense.  The introduction of Dr. Maskey to carry out an independent review seemed also to have followed best practice.  He is a consultant based not in Ireland but in London, as outlined in the report and as we know.  There was a certain degree of independence in regard to the report carried out so good service was done.  Dr. Maskey's team reviewed the clinical records of 1,500 children and we know what happened as a result of that.  He identified defects.  This is all set out in the statement.</p> <p>  In regard to the details on some of the supports put in place, the verbs in the statement are often in the future tense.  I appreciate that it is not so long since the report came out and it is being worked on.  The statement notes that a consultant psychiatrist will provide three evening clinics per week remotely from Dublin, while a pilot involving a consultant registered with the Irish Medical Council based outside of the EU is also under way.  Where are we with that remote consultant piece?</p></speech>

That has been under way since the end of January.  He is reviewing people via a clinic on two afternoons a week.  The consultant in Dublin is actually to start next week.  He was to start this week but I am out on sick leave so I was not available to help sort the clinic out.  We want that to start on a good footing and it will start next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  That is in place.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Young for her presence this morning, given that she is out on sick leave.  I appreciate that.</p> <p>  Moving on to what for me is the important piece, Ms O'Connor stated that the HSE acknowledges in the report that the scope of the look-back review is confined to practices in south Kerry CAMHS.  She noted that the HSE also appreciates that the Maskey report can give rise to concern among children, young people and their families who avail of services provided by CAMHS teams in other parts of the country.  In order to deal with that and provide assurances to them, the HSE's national oversight group will commission an independently chaired review of medication practices across all CAMHS teams.  Ms O'Connor told us that Dr. Colette Halpin is to be the chair of that group.  On a brief perusal, and I am not casting any aspersions on Dr. Halpin who seems to have a very good curriculum vitae as a consultant child psychiatrist, she was involved in Offaly CAMHS at one stage.  As a layperson and public representative, I would like to have seen the Maskey model followed and someone without any involvement in CAMHS being appointed.  I ask Ms O'Connor to comment on that presently.</p> <p>  Ms O'Connor also stated that the oversight group will commission an audit of compliance with operational guidelines.  Will she talk me through the prescribing and medication audit that is proposed?  Many children who turn up to CAMHS would be referred to CAMHS with many different presenting issues.  It could be self-harm, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, or mental health intellectual disabilities, MHID.  That is quite a broad range of complex needs.  Will there be a look-back at a random sample of files to see if medication and prescribing was appropriate similar to the one that was done in Kerry?</p></speech>

We are starting with an audit of all teams in terms of prescribing.  Dr. Maskey, in his report and conversations, has advised that we start with ADHD.  The key issues here arose in respect of ADHD prescribing and that is where we are starting.  That audit, as I said, is being designed because we did not have standards so there are not common standards against which to audit, and in order to audit there must be common standards to use.  That work has been carried out in regard to defining what those standards are and the audit process being agreed.  As I said, the group is meeting tomorrow to sign off on our approach to that.</p></speech>

There may not be any surprises there because it is not unusual for young people to be medicated or offered prescriptions for ADHD, depending I presume on what problems are presenting.  I am trying to be sensitive with language and avoid being pejorative.</p><p>It is in the other presenting areas where many of the problems arose, though, and there was inappropriate and unusual prescribing.</p></speech>

A significant proportion of the children attending CAMHS are not prescribed medication.  We will be targeting those who have been prescribed medication to determine whether it is appropriate.</p></speech>

That is not what happened in Kerry, where there was an examination of a random sample of files.  They were not just ADHD files.  I am concerned that the HSE will look at just the ADHD files and, if it makes findings that are negative - I hope they will be positive rather than negative - it will only pursue the ADHD avenue.  I am thinking of all the other presenting cases, which would start getting lost as we moved down just this one avenue.  To the public's mind, it would not be unusual for medication to be prescribed.  I take it that the prescribing in question was inappropriate, but in Kerry the review did not focus on ADHD alone.  There was a full examination of random samples.  That is what gave rise to the Maskey report and the discovery that there allegedly was inappropriate prescribing across a range of presenting issues.</p></speech>

The challenge for us is that any audit of prescribing practices would have to be specific.  If we were to broaden it out, it would take much longer because we would have to devise standard criteria for everything instead of starting with ADHD as Dr. Maskey has recommended.</p></speech>

What made the Maskey report on Kerry ostensibly successful was that there was a random examination that was not confined to ADHD.  Notwithstanding what Dr. Maskey has recommended, that process seemed to work well, so why not start with that process across other CAMHS areas?  Take a random sample of files, do not focus exclusively on the ADHD piece and see whether there were other issues like inappropriate prescribing in respect of people with, for example, eating disorders or depression.  I am afraid that, if the HSE just focuses on ADHD and finds negative or unhealthy prescribing patterns in other CAMHS areas, it will just pursue the ADHD piece and may ignore all the other presenting issues.</p></speech>

We are starting with ADHD because Dr. Maskey's report was a successful process and this was its recommendation to us.  We need to start this.  If we do not start with the ADHD pathway, it will take us a long time to agree criteria for auditing all of the other conditions.  We must remember that there are many children who are prescribed medication through their GPs and who do not come to CAMHS.  Once we broaden the review to other conditions, the whole thing becomes a much larger and more complex task but will not necessarily deliver a different result.

Dr. Young might explain that in more detail.  A similar group of people were on the CAMHS oversight group as were on the management group in Kerry.  I believe it included the consultant and a couple of other individuals.  Dr. Young might explain the difference between the Kerry mental health management team and the oversight group.</p></speech>

The governance arrangements of a CAMHS team are complex.  The consultant is the de facto team leader and has clinical responsibility for the care delivered within the CAMHS team.  However, each discipline within the CAMHS team reports to its head - the social worker reports to the head of social work and the nurse reports to the director of nursing.  Each reports up through his or her discipline.  In reality, although the consultant is the nominal lead, he or she finds it difficult to get his or her wishes down to each of the disciplines because each of those are line managed by itself.</p> <p>  In an attempt to bring this together in some shape or form, my predecessor brought together a CAMHS governance group.  Within that group were all of the line managers of the disciplines that worked on the ground - social work, occupational therapy, psychology, speech and language, and medical.</p></speech>

The patient safety advisers report to me, as the chief officer, and they have responsibilities across each of the services.  They work with the services with regard to both the quality of the services and safety issues.

One of the key recommendations relates to the adherence to operational guidelines that exist.  It is important to note that within the CAMHS service there is a very well-developed operational guidance document that has been updated in recent times.  Dr. Maskey highlighted this as a model of very good practice.  The issues that have arisen have done so partly because these guidelines were not being implemented.

I cannot remember who said this during Deputy Shortall's session.  One of the phrases used was the consultant is the de facto team leader but various specialists and disciplines are line-managed by discipline.  The social worker reports to the social work team and the occupational therapist, OT, reports to that team.  When it comes to an individual patient, can we be clear that all those disciplines report to the consultant in question first and, in this case, the concern is around the consultant role?  It was not OT or social work that was the issue.</p></speech>

We have challenges as move forward with different integrated teams on that basis.  However, the consultant is - I do not know if Dr. Burke or Dr. Young said this - the de facto clinical lead for the care of a patient.  It is important to note, however, that disciplines do not report directly to the consultant.  It is about patient care versus their reporting line.</p></speech>

One of the things we have been doing on the mental health committee is pre-legislative scrutiny on the health amendment Bill.  A few weeks ago, I was struck by the opening statement from the Irish Medical Organisation on the role of the consultant in multidisciplinary teams.  According to its opening statement:</p> <blockquote> 	...a consultant is clinically independent and retains overall responsibility for the care of...[any] patient.  While a consultant psychiatrist may consult, and frequently does, with other members of the multidisciplinary team with regard to aspects of a patient's treatment including involuntary detention, [or] any legal requirement to do, it poses a risk to patient safety, undermines the contractual responsibility of the consultant and blurs the lines of accountability.  </blockquote> <p>What is being talked about there is something very specific, but it is instructive of a kind of reticence or concern around the role of consultants when making decisions on patient care.  I ask for comments on the fact that we currently now have a team, or it seems to me the representatives have outlined that there is a team, where it is not clear that the consultant is in charge or has full reporting responsibility from every single discipline on that team and yet, in practical terms, that is what is happening on the ground.  Is that providing the kind of trust and clarity needed in respect of decision-making for patients?</p></speech>

The challenge is, certainly for other team members, these are all professions regulated by CORU in their own right.  We are into all sorts of different professional discussions but when it comes to patient care and, again, Dr. Young can advise on this, the consultant is the de facto lead.  It is not that simple, however, because of each profession.  There are some people who attend services who will predominantly attend one of the other disciplines.  They will not necessarily attend the consultant all the time.  Dr. Young might want to comment on how that team worked.</p></speech>

He or she advises, at a discussion with members of the multidisciplinary team, whether or not the person should have psychological input, social work input or OT input and he or she co-ordinates that.  When the team is functioning properly, it is like the conductor of an orchestra bringing all the pieces together and making sure they are all working properly.  As Ms O'Connor said, there was no consultant in this post to do that properly, which is why it then fell apart.  There was a consultant providing oversight but that person was already managing a very busy patch and was not on the ground doing the day-to-day work, which needs to happen for a team to function efficiently.</p></speech>

I am trying to catch up and familiarise myself with all the reports and so on from this committee in the past.</p><p>Following on from Deputy Hourigan's questioning, the answers seem to imply that a team will function properly where there is a consultant and overmedication, such as what happened in Kerry, would not happen.  I ask for a comment on that implication.  Are there any cases where consultants are in a situation where the overmedication of children is a regular occurrence?  I am looking at the notes from the reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health in 2018, which referenced a 2011 report from Mental Health Reform that showed there were:</p> <blockquote> 	significant gaps in primary care provision, [a] dominance of medication as a treatment option, [a] lack of referral options for GPs...[for] counselling, [for] psychotherapy...[a lack of] family therapy or Community...Health Teams [and] Continued use of Emergency Departments as access points for mental health services  </blockquote> <p>It seems we are probably living in a system where consultants, or whomever, have little option but to medicate because other services are not available.  I would like the representatives to comment on that.</p><p>My second question relates to parliamentary questions asked by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  As far back as 2015, he has asked various Ministers for Health parliamentary questions about the kind of malpractice we are now dealing with, such as the overmedication of children.  Last April, specifically, he asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to &quot;order a...review of the use and overuse of psychiatric medication in children across all CAMHS...services&quot; and in particular to review the way chronic understaffing of CAMHS, and a complete failure to resource primary care, was leading to overmedication.  Deputy Boyd Barrett says the Minister passed this review off to the HSE, which apparently brushed off the request for review.  That goes back to April 2021.  Did the Minister pass this request for review to HSE management?  What was its response to that?  Those are two very specific questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030200002#G01700"><p>I will start and Dr. Burke will respond to the issue of the medication of children.  On CAMHS in general, it might be argued that mental health has been lucky in that we have had A Vision for Change for many years now, which has set a blueprint for the delivery of services that is based on multidisciplinary team working.  With this growth, especially in CAMHS, and we have to remember CAMHS came from a certain place of a child guidance model, etc., we have sought through the development funding in mental health to develop those multidisciplinary supports, including our OTs, social workers, psychology, speech and language therapists and, in some cases, dieticians for eating orders, etc.  However, as I said, we must remember that CAMHS is a very specialist mental health service and, in reality, we have prioritised early intervention.</p><p>This came from work that was done by the youth mental health task force a number of years ago.  We have been prioritising the early intervention supports for children because we know that early intervention is the most important thing in terms youth mental health.  This means having other organisations and working with our funded partners to provide supports to children earlier in their pathway of care and to provide supports, for example, in primary care.  </p><p> Most children who present with a mental health difficulty attend their GP in the first instance.  The priority is for the GP to have somewhere to send that child for support and that might not be a CAMHS service.  A very small percentage of children attend a CAMHS service; many more attend other supports that are at the lower level of the pyramid in terms of how we provide our services.  </p><p> Multidisciplinary care is essential.  We have increased the number of teams but, equally, we have increased the numbers of those different disciplines across the team.  We sought to invest in all of those multidisciplinary supports since the development funding started in 2011.  We have seen significant increases in those areas.  We will continue to do that and, certainly, in line with the ongoing implementation of Sharing the Vision, we will continue to invest in multidisciplinary care.  Consultants and doctors are a key part and, as Dr. Young said, they are critical in terms of diagnosis, agreeing the care plan and, ultimately, prescribing, where it is relevant.  However, as Dr. Burke said earlier, many children who attend CAMHS are not prescribed medication; they receive other interventions.  I might ask Dr. Burke to comment on the medicating of children.</p></speech>

They are different things.  A psychiatrist taking a history from a young person will always view the case in terms of biological, which is the medication piece, and also in terms of the psychological and the social piece.  A doctor would not prescribe for a child without the parts.  They would not be done in isolation.  However, we sometimes have challenges with psychological intervention.  The vast majority of psychiatrists would also have pursued other studies in psychological interventions and would be therapy-trained.  I do not want people to go away thinking that the only tool that psychiatrists have is medication.  We think long and hard before we put any child on medication.  Individual teams would have checks and balances in terms of medicating.  It is not just part of a national audit; we audit ourselves.  Individual teams audit themselves.  Good practice would have multidisciplinary team meetings every week.  Even though the consultant lead may not see every single person on the team, they would be part of the discussions.  As Dr. Young said, they would sign off on the care plan for that individual.  We never prescribe medication without looking at the other aspects for these young people.  However, we have challenges in terms of psychological therapies.  We also have waiting lists, which we are trying to work on.</p> <p>  I would also like to point out that as evidence base for treatments builds in, there are more and more specialist evidence-based and evidence-informed treatments.  It is difficult to provide them everywhere.  The evidence base for psychological therapies is for experienced practitioners who see people a lot with particular conditions and with fidelity to the model.  In every generic CAMHS team, one may not be able to see that number of people or have those experienced practitioners.  That is why, as part of the quality improvement and service development, we have been looking at the clinical programmes and developing hub-and-spoke models for these more specialised treatments, so that we can have fidelity to the model and specific clinical guidelines-----</p></speech>

I will run out of time and neither of my questions has been addressed.  Is it possible that even where a consultant is in situation, over-medication could be a problem within CAMHS?  Was the HSE asked by the Minister to review what was happening with the over-use of psychiatric medication in children in April 2015 and what was its response?  Those two questions have not been answered or addressed.  In the small bit of time we have left, could the witnesses please attempt to answer them?</p></speech>

That may have been dealt with somewhere within the organisation when it came in, but I am personally not aware of that request.  I can check that out though and see if somebody within the team is.</p> <p>  In terms of whether it is possible, I am sure it is possible for there to be issues with prescribing even where there is a consultant in place.  However, it is probably quite unlikely.  Certainly, we have to work on the basis that it would be quite unlikely.  Dr. Burke can share her view on that.</p></speech>

Consultants partake in continuing professional development.  They have peer support groups.  In my own area, we meet every month and we review challenging cases.  We would have regular reviews of our clinical complaints.  Again, in my own area we would do that fortnightly.  We would look at our serious incidences, which would reviewed by a very high-level team and we would see if there is any learning from that, which would go through clinical governance committees.  Therefore, there is a robust and tiered structure.  Regrettably, this broke down in this particular incidence.  However, in the vast majority of areas, and I want to reassure the people using our services because it is important we do that, there is good practice and very good practice in CAMHS.  A lot of satisfaction is expressed by our service users in terms of the service that they get.</p></speech>

Dr. Maskey found fault with regard to how the team was governed.  There were also specific issues with regard to the oversight of the junior doctor, which led to significant issues.  In fairness to Dr. Maskey, he is broader than that in his criticism and, as the Deputy said, he found fault with the oversight that was provided.</p></speech>

However, we have work to do to consider what is the proper structure we need across Cork and Kerry to ensure proper oversight across the community healthcare organisation.  That is the work that was asked of us in one of the recommendations of the Maskey report and, as I said earlier, that is what we are now starting to do.</p></speech>

We are looking at the development of community healthcare networks, in particular, with 14 community healthcare networks to be stood up across the areas of Cork and Kerry.  Any services, including child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams and adult teams, need to be realigned in that context.  That makes for better local governance arrangements and local ownership for services in Cork and Kerry.  I was going to start that process anyway but the report has certainly helped to guide us in a more concentrated area as it relates to CAMHS.</p></speech>

One of those key recommendations is that we would have a consultant in place in south Kerry.  Dr. Maskey also points out that we have a lot of work to do to create the conditions whereby we will attract a consultant to south Kerry.  It may not be easy.  While we have good cover in place at the moment from a consultant perspective, we would obviously like to have a permanent consultant in place.  The governance arrangements certainly need to be reviewed so that we have ongoing oversight right across Cork and Kerry, and we must build our structures accordingly.  We have a robust plan to implement all 35 recommendations and we will be working to that plan.</p></speech>

We will certainly have a better service when those recommendations are implemented.</p> <p>  I want to reassure people that while we have had significant issues in south Kerry, a lot of children are receiving services from the CAMHS teams across Cork and Kerry.  I assure the families of children who go in each day and receive services from those multidisciplinary teams, the children themselves, and, indeed, the young adults who receive adult services and who might have come from CAMHS, that the service process is robust.  We do not have concerns with regard to it now.  We will also be guided by the national audit we spoke about earlier and each of the teams will be subject to an audit.</p></speech>

We have spoken an awful lot about the governance of CAMHS in south Kerry.  I want to touch on probably the most important people, who are the children.  I travelled to Tralee a few weeks ago and met parents and their children on the issues in south Kerry.  Their stories are absolutely heartbreaking.  I am going to relay one of them in as generic a fashion as possible so as not to give away the identity of the child, with the permission of the child and her parents.  This child is now 16 years of age.  In primary school, she showed some mild forms of anxiety after being subjected to bullying.  Her parents and the school put things in place and then she thrived.</p> <p>  Outside the primary school, she was enthusiastic and eager to take part in extracurricular activities but she was nervous about the prospect of going from primary school to secondary school, as a lot of children are.  She started getting anxious again in the last few weeks of her summer holidays over the prospect of a new uniform, new people, a new school and new surroundings.  During the transition from primary school to secondary school, she started to suffer from panic attacks and her GP made a referral to north Kerry CAMHS.  She had just turned 14 at this stage in 2019.  She was immediately put on Prozac and melatonin.  This is returning to what was said earlier about other treatments being undertaken in conjunction with medication.  Her parents immediately asked what other treatments were available and she was put on a long waiting list for cognitive behavioural therapy.</p> <p>  On the third visit to the CAMHS, her medication was increased.  She was turning into a virtual recluse.  Her parents reported, as did the girl herself when I met her, that she started losing her personality and her smile, which was heartbreaking to see.  She was having trouble sleeping and was prescribed a sleeping tablet.  This sleeping tablet was Tevaquel, which the young girl found out by reading the leaflet is an anti-psychotic medication.  As I said, her personality went and she started losing touch with reality.</p> <p>  In February 2021, she was moved from north Kerry CAMHS to south Kerry CAMHS, where she had her first interaction with Dr. Sharma, who, as we know, is the whistleblower.  He immediately took her off the medication she was prescribed.  In his professional opinion, she was on the wrong medication.  Her parents, like any parents, including me, trust medical experts when it comes to the care of our children.  I must say the trust in CAMHS among parents and children is now at an all-time low.  I deal with this issue every day of the week.  This girl's parents reported that their daughter had missed many opportunities in life because of being over-medicated or misdiagnosed.  Her parents then received a letter from the HSE - from Mr. Fitzgerald, in fact.  I have it in front of me.  Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned he has a team working with him but this is one of the most badly written letters I have ever seen.  It is littered with spelling mistakes.  It was very disappointing for the parents to receive this letter.  Spelling mistakes aside, this letter stated that on review of her files, there was no adverse outcome or issue of concern.  This was one of the 1,332 files that were reviewed by CAMHS and this girl is not one of the 227 who have been deemed at risk of harm nor is she one of the 46 children placed at a risk of significant harm.  Did the CAMHS team actually sit down, meet and have a conversation with any of the parents or children prior to sending out these letters?  Was that a part of the review?</p></speech>

It was for those particular children that the open disclosure set of meetings took place.  Each meeting was set up or offered to the families or to the young adults to discuss with them, in detail, the findings of the file review and also to discuss where they were with regard to services.  Some of those people came back into service once again while others required or requested more follow through.  The files for the cases to which the Deputy is referring were considered by Dr. Maskey and his team.  On the basis of the file review, they were of the view that there was not a specific issue arising but that is not to say, importantly, that those people's experiences or their concerns are in any way minimised.  They may not have been satisfied with aspects of-----</p></speech>

I know that we cannot speak about individual cases which was why my question was as general as possible.  In a number of cases, parents and children feel that they were left out of the review process and that their personal testimonies were not taken on board.  Are there any plans to go back and rectify this so that the voices of these children and their parents can be heard?  To get a letter like the one the family received, having been through so much heartbreak and trauma while trying to get the best possible care for their daughter, was not acceptable.  When they met the locum psychiatrist, Dr. Sharma, he immediately said that the child was on the wrong medication and changed it but still this child is not one of the 227 deemed to have been at risk of harm.  Will there be retrospective consideration of these files?</p></speech>

We have dealt with a number of cases and queries from families within the group of 240 as well as from families not in that group.  As the Deputy said, a number of people raised concerns and issues and we have reviewed some of those cases to date and have been dealing with some of the requests that have come in from those families on an ongoing basis.  There have not been a lot of cases outside of the 240 but our business is to try to deal with any cases where there are ongoing concerns.</p></speech>

However, everything has to be contextualised in terms of previous history, family history, genetics and so on.  Fluoxetine, or Prozac, which is the trade name, is a licensed prescription.  It is one of the few licensed prescriptions for depression and it has been proven to be effective but we would never look at that in isolation, without looking at the psychological and social aspects as well.</p></speech>

Medications such as anti-psychotics, in the main, were inappropriately prescribed, rather than looking at other psychological therapies.</p></speech>

Psychological supports were not made available in tandem with medication and yet the parents of the child to whom I referred earlier received a letter to say no harm was done the child.  Something is not adding up here in terms of the letters that were sent to families and the treatment children received.</p></speech>

What I can say is that where medication was prescribed by a consultant, that was deemed to be with the knowledge and awareness of the consultant.  They are on a specialist register and have the experience and training to do that.  As Dr. Burke said, although it would not be usual practice to prescribe an anti-depressant on the first visit, it can and does happen.  The consultant may have looked at the case and determined that it was appropriate for an anti-depressant to be prescribed in the first instance.</p></speech>

In this particular case and in several other cases in Kerry, that just did not happen.</p></speech>

I ask them to talk us through the prescribing audit.  Children and young people are referred to CAMHS with many different issues including self-harm, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, ADHD and so on.  We are talking about a very broad range of complex needs and in that context, I am interested in how the audit will work.  I understand that it will be an independent, random sample audit of a proportion of the caseload and I am interested in the finer details.  It is vitally important that confidence is rebuilt and parents are reassured.  Will it work in the same way as the audit in Kerry, where red flags were raised and a full look-back of files was commissioned, resulting in the Maskey report?  Why narrow the scope of the review?  Should the aim not be to conduct as thorough a review as possible?  If there are problems on a wider scale, how will narrowing the scope of the review identify the issues and what needs to be fixed?</p></speech>

As we said earlier, the focus of the audit will be in line with the Maskey report and its recommendations and in line with our expert clinical advice.  We have spent a lot of time considering this.  Myself and the chief clinical officer have had many meetings with clinical leaders and others in the organisation and the expert clinical advice remains that the design and scope of the audit should focus on the prescribing practice for ADHD.  That is what we are focused on in terms of the use of medication.  However, as I said earlier, the key challenge for us is to identify the standard criteria against which we would be carrying out that audit.  That does not exist here.  We cannot just pick something off a shelf and do an audit against those criteria.  That work is being developed.  There has been a lot of work going on to determine how that will be.</p> <p>  The other point that I would make, although Dr. Burke might be better qualified than me to comment on this, is that a lot of prescribing for children in respect of depression and anxiety happens through GPs in the first instance.  There are many children on medication which has not been prescribed by CAMHS teams.  Once we get into the broader prescribing landscape, we get into a whole range of complexities.  We are starting with the ADHD audit but as that audit progresses, if flags emerge in respect of prescribing practices we will look at it in more detail.  </p> <p>  As I also said earlier, the plans around this audit will go the national oversight group tomorrow afternoon, which is the scheduled first meeting of that group.</p></speech>

One of the findings of the Maskey report on south Kerry CAMHS was that the team was accepting more referrals than was the norm in other CAMHS teams.  We know that when primary care psychology services are under-resourced, this can put more pressure on CAMHS teams.</p><p>How many primary care psychologists are employed by the HSE in the south Kerry region?  How many primary care psychologists are employed in north Kerry?  How many attempts has the HSE made to recruit primary care psychologists in south Kerry and north Kerry in the past five years?  What is the population of south and north Kerry, respectively?  I am trying to get many questions in before my time is up.</p></speech>

I am not sure we have data on specifics around primary care psychology here but we can come back to the Senator with that information, if we do not have it.  Does Mr. Ryan want to comment on investment in primary care psychology?</p></speech>

One of the initiatives we have taken over the past number of years is the development of primary care assistant psychologists.  We have funded 120 assistant psychologists from secondary care mental health services for primary care, nationally, on the basis that we know that they do some very good work at primary care level in working with the psychologists that we already have and they also provide online support.  More fundamentally, many of them go on to the doctor programme to become psychologists within the system and mental health services.</p> <p>  That figure of 120 is growing.  In other words, we have 120 at any particular time.  We have new people coming in as others move out of the system.  With regard to secondary care and mental health services and what Ms O'Connor said earlier, CAMHS is for 2% of the population and we need to make sure that 2% is adequately and appropriately met, rather than a situation where people end up on a CAMHS waiting list for services that should be provided with services in primary care.</p> <p>  I am not sure of the specifics in either north or south Kerry.  Mr. Fitzgerald may have more information.  If we do not, we can certainly get it to the Senator.</p></speech>

I would very much appreciate that.  I will ask some questions about the whistleblower who brought the issue in south Kerry CAMHS to the attention of the witnesses.  Families of young people who attended the service spoke very highly of Dr. Sharma and how he addressed with them the issue around excessive medication and its prescription.  It must be stated that the harm caused to young people in south Kerry CAMHS may not have been addressed without his courage.  I want to highlight that.</p> <p>  He said publicly that negative treatment he received after blowing the whistle on the issues of south Kerry CAMHS left him with no option but to resign from his role.  He said he was asked to take time off and was stripped of his role as the clinical lead and reassigned to administrative duties, on the basis he was in danger of burnout, even though he denied that he was.  This is one of several recent cases of HSE whistleblowers who have shown immense courage in their work and have alleged punishment from the organisation.  Will Mr. Fitzgerald tell me who in his local management team was responsible for reassigning Dr. Sharma to administrative duties?</p></speech>

In his work, not only did he raise the concern, he also worked extremely hard to identify children for whom there were concerns with regard to their over-medication or where incorrect medication was being provided to the children, especially while we were doing the audit of the 50 cases.  The outcome of the audit of the 50 cases helped us to fashion the overall look-back review terms of reference for Dr. Maskey's report.  I will not comment on specifics with regard to anything other than that.  I do not want to comment specifically about individual cases, etc.</p></speech>

Who was part of the selection process?  Were they chosen by HSE management or by others?  What was the selection process?</p></speech>

Dr. Maskey was an independent consultant.  We had put out the ask to see whether someone would support the process and he undertook it.  We had some discussions with him with regard to how we would undertake the review.  It is significant work.  It is necessary, of course, but it is a huge undertaking to start from scratch in order to review the files over a wide range of years.  Logistics, clinical and senior management were required to undertake it in a appropriate way.</p> <p>  We were led and guided by Dr. Maskey on the look-back review process as to how we would undertake it.  We chose people who had clinical expertise in order to be able to identify the issues that would be of concern with regard to the file review that was undertaken.  Behind that was an infrastructure of administrative and senior management in order to ensure that it was undertaken in a timely and appropriate manner and done in the context of data protection, etc.</p></speech>

There has been call for a new report that is fully independent of the HSE.  We are aware of that.  My time is up now.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

I have considerable regard for Ms O'Connor and the work she does but, I have to say, what has been revealed here this morning in terms of a management structure is breathtaking.  People were reporting to people but, clearly, no reporting was being done at all.  The structure was so over-managed that it was not managed.</p> <p>  The most breathtaking revelation here is that individuals who had supervisors were only supervised when they requested such.  Is that an accurate description?  Where else in the HSE do we have a situation in which somebody is tasked with the responsibility of supervising people, but only do so when those people look for supervision?  I have never heard of that type of situation existing anywhere.  Will Ms O'Connor comment on that?  How could it be described as being appropriate?</p></speech>

It is not okay that somebody chooses not to engage in supervision and that it is not followed up on.  From my own perspective and what I see across our system, there is a very proactive approach to supervision.  We have a model of clinical supervision and one has to remember-----</p></speech>

Generally speaking, it is not adequate.  What I see across our system in general is a very strong commitment to supervision.  It must be said that his is across all disciplines, it must be said.  Supervision is not just a medical factor; it is a clinical supervision model that happens in all of our clinical disciplines.  As I said, all of our clinical disciplines working in these services are professionally registered in their own right through the respective body.  In this case, it was not adequate.  Certainly, given the concerns that have been raised here around the governance and management structures, we acknowledge they did not work, which is something that, as Mr. Fitzgerald said, is being reviewed in Cork and Kerry.  We are also looking at it.  As I said, we do have operational guidance-----</p></speech>

The HSE is a big organisation.  I would be very concerned that that type of structure is prevalent in other areas of the organisation.  As a committee, we need to look at that.</p></speech>

What is important in this instance is to remember that the doctor in question was working and being covered by a consultant from another team.  In the ordinary run of events, there are junior doctors working on a team under the supervision of a consultant in the same area.  That would be normal practice and Dr. Amanda Burke has out set out some of the checks and balances that are in place in her area.  What is different here is that we had a consultant who was already managing her own team elsewhere, overseeing or cross-covering in effect, and that is not ideal at all.  That is where the flaws arose.  In general, a junior doctor will be supervised by the consultant.</p></speech>

In her answers to Deputy Colm Burke, she made the point that a couple of locums have come and gone and there was a particular locum who came but left because he had issues, to quote what Dr. Young said earlier.  Was an exit interview carried out with that locum and what were the learnings from that exit interview?</p></speech>

There were difficulties.  I understand it ended up with a referral to the Irish Medical Council on that point.  That was the issue I was talking around.</p></speech>

It is going to cost the taxpayer millions upon millions that could easily have been spent improving care.  That is appalling.  I will hand over to Deputy Griffin.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and I acknowledge the many people who are watching, particularly the families and people in south Kerry affected by this really outrageous sequence of events.  There are many questions still to be answered.  Serious improvements in services and interventions are needed given the people at the very heart of this issue are still not getting what they require.</p> <p>  I want to ask in particular about the complaints and the flagging of concerns that came from service users and their families over the years.  How many of those are there and are those records kept?  Given people were raising their concerns and highlighting deficiencies in the services, such as concerns about over-medication or that culture of medication as distinct from other types of interventions, are all of those records still there?  Has there been an internal review in regard to why those concerns that were raised were not acted upon?  What systems are in place now and what changes are going to be made?  Will the witnesses speak to that?</p></speech>

We have a complaints policy, Your Services, Your Say, which is the HSE&rsquo;s formal policy.  I do not have it to hand but I will make available the number of complaints and the years concerned with regard to the south Kerry CAMHS service.  To answer the second part of the question as to what improvements there have been, thankfully, we have a very significant and challenging but very important roadmap on the 35 recommendations to be put in place.  That will help us to improve the service and to take us away from the issues we have had here.  Again, whether they be the issues related to governance, oversight or supervision, each of them is dealt with in the key recommendations that are made by Dr. Maskey.  We have not waited to go about implementing those particular pieces and, very importantly, we have put in place a co-ordinator of services within the south Kerry CAMHS team, even on an interim basis while we fill it on a permanent basis going forward.  That was one of the key recommendations in Dr. Maskey's report.</p></speech>

Dr. Young, in her role as executive clinical director, referred the matters to the Medical Council, which is an appropriate oversight body with regard to the medical-related issues that are there.

In September of last year, my office was approached by the family of a young child who had presented at south Kerry CAMHS with the child's mother.  They were sent away and told they would be contacted but they were not contacted at all.  Two weeks after that, the child took their own life.  I flagged this subsequently with the HSE.  A review was initiated and it has now been going on for six months.  How long does it take to establish what happened in such a scenario?  To me, this is taking far too long and we need to have answers to this particular case.  As I said, it is a tragic case.  We have had discussions in regard to the wording of the report and whether there were catastrophic consequences or not for the children involved.  This was certainly catastrophic for this family and this child is no longer with their family.  Can we please have answers in regard to what happened with that case and what will be done about it?</p></speech>

We await the outcome of that.  There is a sensitive and very specific process of reviewing any such tragic outcomes.  That, in itself, will come to us over the coming period.  I am expecting that to come back to us over the coming months.</p></speech>

I am aware of the cases the Deputy has spoken about and I can assure him it is very much in my review process on an ongoing basis to ensure that will be completed.  It is important to acknowledge the fact the reviews undertaken by the look-back team and Dr. Maskey, which was of a significant number of files, as I mentioned earlier, was undertaken during a period when we had two major ongoing concerns, one of them being the ongoing Covid-19-related issues and the other being the cyberattack which downed our IT system for a period of time.  That look-back was undertaken as quickly as possible because we were sensitive to the requirement to try to provide answers to those who were affected in south Kerry.</p></speech>

I will put all my questions sensitively because there are families who are still grieving and hurt by what happened.  We must have that lens very clearly with us when we look at these issues and ask our questions.  Obviously, families want answers but they also want accountability.</p> <p>  I will start with Mr. Fitzgerald who is the chief officer.  In earlier discussions, there was confusion as to who was ultimately responsible.  Initially, it was the executive clinical director, ECD, but then Mr. Fitzgerald said he was ultimately responsible.  Does he report to the ECD or does the ECD report to him?</p></speech>

We go back to who was in the role previously.  This is the problem.  We have all these hearings.  Nobody takes responsibility for anything.  It is always somebody else's fault or somebody else's responsibility.  If we have a report that tells us very clearly there were failures in governance, supervision, oversight, clinical practice, administrative processes, then there were clearly failures in management and people need to step up and accept responsibility for failures in management.  It never happens.  It is not happening again today.  People are not accepting responsibility for failures.  I accept Mr. Fitzgerald came into his post in 2020.  Then we need to look at who was in the post before that.  Is that person accepting responsibility?  These failures had consequences for children.</p> <p>  I want to put a number of questions in regard to the treatment of the whistleblower.  If allegations are raised by the whistleblower and if actions are taken on foot of those allegations, whose responsibility is it to engage with the whistleblower?  Ultimately, at the top, whose responsibility is it?</p></speech>

We cannot get answers to that question.  This is the Oireachtas committee which is looking into these issues.  One of the issues which arises out of this saga is the treatment of a whistleblower.  It is in the public domain.  Many things have been said which may or may not be true.  We are here, as Oireachtas Members, to get to the truth of what happened and to establish the facts of what happened.  Mr. Fitzgerald, the man who is ultimately responsible for answering these questions, is saying he is not in a position to do so.</p> <p>  I will put all the questions I was going to put in regard to the whistleblower.  Was he asked, as a whistleblower, to take time off?  Was he reassigned from his clinical duties?  Was he removed from his clinical lead role?  I think they are reasonable questions to ask.  Here is a person who stepped forward and who outlined clearly what was wrong and many issues are in the public domain.  Is Mr. Fitzgerald in a position today to clear up once and for all if it was the case that this whistleblower was asked to take time off, was reassigned from his clinical duties or was removed from the clinical lead role that he was in?</p></speech>

We are asking questions on other issues when there are processes ongoing as well.</p><p>It strikes me again that this is the first opportunity members have had to put questions about what happened to this whistleblower, but we cannot get information.

When people say there is a lack of a culture of accountability and transparency in the HSE, I look to all of the good staff across the HSE and in our public hospitals and public services who do great work.  At the top and at management level, however, there is not a culture of accountability and transparency.  It is absolutely unacceptable that the questions I put cannot be answered.  I do not accept the logic of the response I received.  The whistleblower was treated very shabbily, and it is not the first time this has happened when a whistleblower has come forward about issues within the HSE.  It is completely unacceptable.  The quicker we have a new culture of accountability and transparency in our health services, the better.</p></speech>

I thank the chief operating officer for highlighting that Mr. Fitzgerald took up his role in 2020.  I acknowledge the awful findings to emerge from this report.  It is important that we have people of experience, including a psychiatrist with an eminent reputation, managing the report that has come out.  I hope it will be managed in a swift way because we need to see actions now.  I thank Dr. Amanda Burke from CHO 2, which covers counties Galway, Roscommon and Mayo, who is also on the call. </p> <p>  I will pose my questions to Ms O'Connor and Dr. Burke.  We in the west are always fighting for investment in our CHOs and primary care services.  The challenge in rural areas is that we cannot get multidisciplinary teams because we do not have centres of excellence.  When trying to encourage the recruitment of psychiatrists and other high-profile experts in health care, the challenge is that they want to be based in Dublin, Galway or Limerick city centres.  How do we get those experts and make change to ensure centres of excellence are spread around regional areas?  In that way, we would develop training around multidisciplinary teams that will be in place to support the recruitment of key roles.  I believe the challenges with recruitment are one of the real reasons we are seeing the awful impacts on families and children highlighted in this report.  This has always been an issue and is currently an issue in the HSE.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  Are there ways to streamline the recruitment process to get key people into position quicker when we identify them?  When I worked with people in the HSE I learned a great word, which I have mentioned before, namely, "backfill".  How do we manage when we cannot put a person into a position because he or she is already in a position somewhere else?  This needs to be tackled.  I put those questions to Ms O'Connor and Dr. Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.862" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022030200002#O00500"><p>Before I hand over to Dr. Burke, I will address the point made by the Senator about recruitment in rural areas.  Across the board, whether it is in our mental health services or acute hospital services, we are very challenged at times to get people to move into specialist services when they are not close to the big teaching hospitals.  We have seen that in this case and, unfortunately, we see it in a number of specialty areas.  This is a challenge we have in the system.  We must look at how we can work differently.  Telehealth has certainly supported this across a range of specialties, particularly building on the Covid experience.  There is an onus on us to work differently.</p> <p>  There is also an onus around the broader recruitment piece.  We have initiated a lot of work in the past 18 months with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, which carries out our consultant recruitment, to improve that process.  We are working very closely with PAS, which has put in place significant changes and great additionality in respect of recruitment capacity to speed up that process.  The Senator is absolutely right that we can identify people and yet it can take a very long time.</p> <p>  One of the key challenges too is that we must stop thinking about consultants in isolation.  Advertising for a consultant post on its own is no longer enough.  We must, in effect, sell the whole service.  For example, when establishing a new team that is funded through development funding, we would promote that as a team so that a consultant coming in knows that he or she has people around them.  One consultant on his or her own cannot deliver everything that we ask in the absence of having a team.  I will ask Dr. Burke to comment also.</p></speech>

There must be training for people who are located in that area who can then perhaps transfer into the primary care network or CHOs.  Unless we have that expertise in each of our hospitals, we will not be able to develop that sort of regional expertise that would feed into those other roles.</p> <p>  With regard to ehealth and investment in technology to support the telehealth aspects, is it feasible to have an electronic patient record that will integrate primary care and the hospital network?  We have seen great advances over the past year or two years.  Can we see this supporting the GP network, which is our first port of call with mental health?</p></speech>

We do, however, have a number of building blocks that we are developing.  For example, we have the newborn and maternity system.  That is very effective and has been brought in at a number of maternity sites.  We have a big process under way for our primary care information system.  In primary care services there are individuals tracking the records.  However, there is no single system and certain areas have makeshift solutions in place.  We are now developing, in line with the roll-out of the enhanced community care teams, a more comprehensive primary care information system.  A lot of the building blocks from a technological perspective will be in place and those can be built up as we develop an electronic health record.</p></speech>

It would be very useful of that were to happen again with Oireachtas Members in each area.</p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Burke about CHOs.  I expect the position in Kerry is very similar to that in Galway, Roscommon and Mayo.  What are the challenges with recruitment?  Are there one or two key areas we could look at, especially in rural areas and small towns with hospitals, such as Portiuncula University Hospital or Roscommon University Hospital and their equivalent in Kerry, Limerick and so on?  How do we drive the connection between our CHOs and expertise within the hospitals that might support recruiting people into our areas?</p></speech>

It is not about denuding - quite the opposite.  I will talk about our own area for the purposes of illustration.  We brought in a CAMHS connect model.  Essentially, this is to do exactly what the Senator described, namely, connecting all of our different pieces of the model.  Centres of excellence can be everywhere.  They tend to be in our urban centres.  It is important to recognise that most of the serious mental illness happens late in adolescence, and is now happening to young people into their early 20s.  These young people tend to be in urban centres attached to universities.  This is an important first point.</p> <p>  Consultants and consultant teams prefer to work in teams.  It is much easier to recruit to our urban centres.  As I said, the evidence base for treatments is around people who do treatments a lot.  Sometimes we do not have patient cohorts.  For example, if we take psychosis, one would only see a small number of those patients in a community mental health team in any particular year.  To get the real expertise to look after these people one needs to have a centre of excellence.  One can then provide to the spokes, and consultation into the spokes, via a combination of e-mental health and in person services.  Nobody is saying that e-mental health is a complete solution.  We are talking about an adjunct.  Certainly, the feedback we have received from young people as regards relationships is that we might see them face-to-face for the first appointment in an urban centre and then continue the appointments with e-mental health solutions.  They might also have a key worker in the local community supporting them.</p> <p>  We need to look at our clinical care programmes, for example, for deliberate self-harm, early intervention in psychosis and eating disorder programmes, in the context of a hub and spoke model going forward.</p><p>I would like to see more qualified advanced nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists working and supporting the network of teams there.  That is key.  I have a question for Ms O'Connor.  She mentioned the role of the national director, which she held prior to 2017.  She also mentioned the challenges between the way the systems were set up then and the way they are set up now.  Is there a timeline for that role?  If changes needed to be made to the remit of that role to accommodate the new changes within the HSE, what would those be?</p></speech>

What we are looking at is the design of the health system as we develop the RHAs.  The role of the national centre will be to look at the functions.  The national director role was a position for mental health that had not existed previously in terms of the visibility of mental health and the focus on it.  We have to ensure that those things are built into any future model for health service delivery.  As it stands, we do not have a role for a national director of mental health, and nor do we have a national director for primary care or social care as we had previously.  We had a number of national director roles based on siloed working previously.</p></speech>

We will not get where we need to be unless it is integrated into health services and unless we have equal access at a primary care level to mental health supports and our specialist mental health services work like that for people who are in need of tertiary specialist mental health services.  We have done a lot of good work but there is a long way to go.  As we roll out Sl&aacute;intecare, and as we look at the needs of populations, we have to build in that early intervention and early access to promote the mental health of the population.</p></speech>

There are nine chief officers responsible for the nine community health areas who report to that national director for community operations.

We have a process in the HSE around performance but equally, where concerns are raised around someone's performance there are a number of HR actions available to us, which ultimately include the removal of somebody from his or her post if that is what it comes to.

We all agree that this has been a terrible neglect or hurt of many children in south Kerry.  We all know that as boys and girls grow into men and women and their bodies change physically, many have mental health problems.  I regret what seems to have been happening in many instances, which I believe was going on beyond the numbers we have heard about since the report came out.  It seems as though what happened was that drugs were pumped into these lovely children, which greatly changed their personalities.  It slowed them down and could have had the effect of increasing their weight.  Their personalities totally change and they stop smiling.  I have seen it over the years.  It has happened in greater numbers in the past five years in south Kerry.  It is not acceptable.  We need more psychologists to talk to these young people.  They need to get time, rather than being given injections and being sent out the door.</p> <p>  There is a question of compensation for all the children affected.  I do not think they can ever be adequately compensated for what has been done to their lives over so many years.  It is terrible.  What will happen from today onwards?  Children are developing mental health issues, if that is the term, and they have to be seen to today by psychiatrists.  I still worry and am not satisfied that we will have a system in place where someone is looking over the shoulder of the person who is meting out the medication or whatever it is to ensure that these people get back on track.  There must be some control.  To think that someone was doing that work for four or five whole years and let so many people down.  The parents and the children did nothing at all wrong.  On whose instructions did this locum doctor think he was doing right?  There should have been a review of what he was doing on a weekly basis, if not even daily.  People only get one chance on this earth.  If they fail and go down on themselves it is very hard to bring them back up.  We have to ensure that some better structures are put in place.  In addition to psychiatrists, should we also have more psychologists?  Mental health issues can be helped by talking to people.  That is what psychologists do.  Do we have enough of those and will there be enough of them?  </p> <p>  From today on, how will we deal better with this than we have done?  I cannot understand why we cannot get a senior consultant.  But even then, I do not think one consultant is enough.  I heard Ms O'Connor say that there should be a team but we have to ensure that there is.  While we hear of massive sums being allocated to the Department of Health in the budget each year, it does not manifest itself in the treatment of mental health, or at least down in Kerry anyway; let every person who is representing other counties talk about their own counties.  </p> <p>  The structures by which this went on for five years are totally wrong.</p><p>I believe, and have believed since my father's time, that when the regional health boards were in place, there was more interaction with doctors and consultants.  If there was a local issue, like this one, in community care or primary care, it was discussed around the table and sorted out.  There does not seem to be the accountability that is needed.  What assurances can the witnesses give that from here on, we will have a proper service to deal with these mental health issues that develop in young people?  I ask that they ensure, without delay, that proper compensation is made available to these people whose lives have been totally ruined.</p></speech>

We are fully committed to implementing the recommendations in this report.  We accept them in full and will do everything we can to ensure that we develop a better service for everybody, particularly the people in south Kerry.  From our perspective, there are many considerations with regard to how we deliver our services on foot of this and the three pieces of work we are embarking on will help inform our thinking further.  The Deputy asked for assurances that we will have the service we all wish for.  While we will do everything we can on that, there is a very real challenge with workforce availability at this time.  There are growing numbers of people and doctors in training.  There are more CAMHS-qualified consultants coming out this year than ever and we are investing in more nursing and so on.  There is a finite resource available and our challenge is in making the best use of the resource available to us as we seek to develop our services and implement Sharing the Vision, which is the policy to which we are all working.  I will ask Mr. Fitzgerald to come in specifically on Kerry.</p></speech>

It has been a real concern since this started to unfold and throughout the look-back process.  I have been chairing those meetings weekly.  Last Friday, I met with a group representing the families.  It was a hugely constructive meeting from my perspective.  I hope it was of support and benefit to them.  It is one of many and we will continue to work with them on this.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's direct question on the children affected who need further supports, we will be setting up a clinical support liaison team who will work with individual families and the individuals themselves, if they wish to do so.  I will be writing to the families involved about that.  This team will work with them as key workers to support them and advocate on their behalf with regard to services and will ensure, where it is at all possible, that we provide them with those services in a timely manner.  That is an important piece and I made that commitment to the representative group we met last Friday.  I hope to write to the families on it later this week.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the oversight regarding what happened and why it went on for so long.  Dr. Maskey's report looks at that in great detail.  We heard earlier that the supervision of the NCHD was more for the NCHD to take up rather than it being a necessity for the person to do so.  That was a key issue and there are huge learnings in that for all services.  The children concerned will continue to be our focus.  They will continue to be at the centre of this and we will continue to work with them through the clinical support team, which will be place from Monday next.  That will ensure we can match them to the right services and, where at all possible, provide those services to them.</p></speech>

We know from previous submissions and witnesses that there are real challenges in rural areas and areas of high deprivation for many of these CAMHS teams.  The big question that people at home are asking is whether we can be assured that the failures and challenges that happened in the south Kerry area will pop up in other places.  That is one of the questions people will be asking.  Will we have similar problems, such as lack of full teams in some cases, or teams that are broken and not really delivering for those children?  Do we have to wait for other people or whistleblowers to come forward in respect of other areas?  Is it likely that there will be similar challenges in other areas?</p></speech>

That is a known challenge.  I referred to the three pieces of work that we are undertaking but we have not touched much on the third prong, which is the more qualitative piece of engaging with service users, families and staff to try to get in under what their experience is.  Ultimately, that is what is really important here.  It is a matter of people's experience of our services and whether they feel the services are having a positive impact on their health.  That piece of work will be very informative but the hard edge will be the audit piece in throwing up any issues in all our teams.  I would love to say that I do not think we have these problems in other areas but in the absence of some of that hard evidence I cannot be sure and the audits will give us that.  Those three pieces of work on which we are embarking will give us the assurance that we cannot definitively have here today.  We have excellent services and some very committed and hardworking staff.  We have a very highly qualified workforce in our mental health services and it is important for them that we have this assurance because people turning up today or tomorrow to mental health services need to know they are getting a service that is really going to make a difference to their lives.  Some of those people have been waiting some time for that service.  We are all hugely invested in getting this right.  That assurance will come definitively through the processes that we are about to undertake.</p></speech>

One recommendation in the report is that the clinical director for CAMHS should make sure that all junior doctors meet the legal requirement to show they are competent.  Why was it necessary to put this in the report?  Was this not the case before?  Why else would the report make such a recommendation?  Did we have untrained doctors working in the service?</p></speech>

That is why it was recommended that all junior doctors or NCHDs must be enrolled within a professional competence scheme and that it should then be checked and clarified by their line manager, the clinical director.</p></speech>

The HSE report states that this was due to lack of knowledge about the best way to do things.  Again, the question that must be asked is how such a doctor, with this lack of knowledge, can be placed in the role.  Is there not a requirement for a paediatric specialist to prescribe medication to children?</p></speech>

First, we should absolutely have people who are qualified for the role, and that applies to anybody undertaking a role.  CAMHS is a very specialist service.</p><p>In terms of assuring the skills and experience that are relevant to the role, we absolutely have to do that.</p><p>This report also throws up for us the following consideration.  This is a very difficult one for us and a very difficult one for all of the committee members as well.  I refer to the notion that any service is better than no service.  We often stretch our services to cover where we do not have the right skills set.  Many efforts have been made in this area to recruit.  In this case, we have certainly worked on the basis of trying to keep a service going because we felt at the time that was more important than anything.  When we look at what happened here, we have to ask ourselves whether having any service is better than having no service and the conclusion in this case is that it probably was not for some of these people.  This challenges us in terms of how we configure and deliver our services.  Unfortunately, that is not a simple question to answer.</p></speech>

How does the system cope?  We have mentioned the levels of under-staffing commonly experienced in CAMHS.  I return to my concern that it is not only a challenge for this area.  When there is no medical lead, for instance, how will the system manage that?</p></speech>

I want to reassure people that in the vast majority of teams there is robust governance around prescription of medication.  It is not arbitrary whether somebody can go to supervision or not.  In fact, if somebody is on a training scheme, he or she will not be signed off as a competent doctor unless there is documentary evidence of weekly supervision from a consultant colleague.</p> <p>  Standard practice would be that an non-consultant hospital doctor would only prescribe under the supervision of a consultant and in consultation with a multidisciplinary team and that all cases would be discussed at multidisciplinary team.  That gives an additional check in that you have other professionals discussing whether or not medication is appropriate.</p> <p>  To reassure people at home, medication is not prescribed lightly.  It is prescribed in line with the evidence base and we look at all other options before we prescribe medication.  This is a particular case.  I am confident that in the vast majority of teams this is robust and it is done under a specialist's supervision.</p> <p>  We have robust cross-cover arrangements in some areas.  In my own area, we have to do a cross-cover arrangement where we were unable to get a consultant but supervision is done on a weekly basis, both face to face and using e-mental health solutions.</p> <p>  As Ms O'Connor said, we may need to look at this across the areas.  It is not popular because people feel as if their service is being denuded but actually what we are doing is providing a safer service under consultant specialist supervision.</p></speech>

There is vital work going on daily.</p> <p>  It is common sense that all staff were trained in risk and crisis management given the service CAMHS provide.  The report states it is not a priority but I would have thought it would have been a priority at that time.</p> <p>  Anti-psychotic drugs were mentioned by some of the members.  One of the recommendations of the report is that guidelines should be drawn up.  What was the protocol for prescribing these powerful mood-altering drugs previously and were there any central guidelines that were not followed up?  One of my colleagues here mentioned a particular case but I am sure there are others.  Among these 227 children, there was a number of worries in relation to the drugs that they were prescribed.  What is the protocol for prescribing these powerful drugs?  What was it in the past?  What changes now or are there any changes in relation to them?</p></speech>

Consultants would look at standard practice.  We would look at guidelines such as those of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in terms of our prescribing practices.  You would prescribe in line with that guidance, for example, doses specific to weight.  You would monitor the physical parameters in terms of these.</p> <p>  There is clinical judgment though and this is why they are instituted by a clinical specialist.  One has to, first of all, diagnose and say that this is appropriate as part of a care plan.  This is rarely done in isolation by one person and usually done in a team approach.</p></speech>

I suppose people will have difficulties in trying to understand that.  That is new information that I was not aware of.  I would have concerns about that.</p> <p>  I really appreciate the time and effort the witnesses have put into answering the questions here this morning.  I particularly thank Dr. Young.  I realise Dr. Young is out sick but she took the time to come in and answer the questions from committee members here this morning.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses for their contributions this morning.

T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach bhfuil mo chuid Ghaeilge l&iacute;ofa go leor le lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh i nGaeilge.  Le cead an Chathaoirligh, leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla.</p><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to present details regarding An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga's report on the implementation of the Department's language scheme with regard to Gaeltacht placenames.  I am very disappointed representatives of GeoDirectory are not present at this meeting to answer any technical questions that may arise.  However, I will endeavour to get answers to any such questions the committee may ask today.</p><p>In 2015, the investigative report recommended seven actions to be undertaken by the Department.  The September 2021 implementation report presented to the Oireachtas acknowledges the Department has made a genuine effort to implement all seven of the recommendations.  However, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga concluded my Department has breached its statutory language requirements regarding its own language scheme by failing to ensure official placenames of Gaeltacht areas appear in Irish only in the Eircode system.  Despite this, I am satisfied the Department meets the requirements of its language scheme and, furthermore, that all seven recommendations of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga's 2015 investigative report were actioned and reviewed by the Department's management board.</p><p>My Department has put in place the necessary arrangements to ensure official placenames of Gaeltacht areas are used as the default for official purposes, in compliance with our official language scheme, the Official Languages Act 2003, the Place-Names (Irish Forms) Act 1973 and placename orders that have been enacted.  This extends to Capita's operation of the Eircode system in that the quarterly dissemination of new Eircode postcodes to Gaeltacht areas is carried out using only the Irish postal addresses provided by An Post and issued to Capita by An Post GeoDirectory.  This also extends to the Eircode finder website tool where responses will default to the Irish version of the address when searching by address or Eircode for Gaeltacht placenames.  In addition, where searching for Gaeltacht placenames is required, the Eircode finder website only utilises the latest maps published by Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, which shows the Irish version of Gaeltacht placenames through the OSI GeoHive web mapping service.  Finally, both the Eircode website and Eircode finder website are available in Irish, and customer queries to the Capita support desk received in Irish by email, post and telephone channels are responded to in Irish.</p><p>These measures notwithstanding, I acknowledge it is unfortunate that private companies use addresses and people's names in English rather than their original language, Irish.  However, I will clarify that the Eircode database does not, and never has, contained people's names.</p><p>With regard to complaints that individuals have received letters with their addresses translated into English, it is important to state the Eircode system is underpinned by the most current An Post postal addresses, which contain Gaeltacht placenames in both Irish and English.  This is to ensure that the Eircode system, which is postal infrastructure in non-physical form, aligns with An Post's postal network as the universal postal service provider.  Notwithstanding that, Eircode does not change existing addresses but can simply be added to the address normally used for the property.  Individuals and private companies are free to use different forms of address.  Indeed, private companies hold their own various forms of addresses in their own databases along with multiple forms of addresses for the same property.  To resolve this issue of multiple forms of addresses, companies simply append Eircode postcodes to their own existing databases or addresses, whether they are in English, Irish or both.  The use of addressing databases by private companies is an operational matter and a commercial decision for the companies themselves.  My Department has no role in this.</p><p>The provision of all postal addresses, including Irish-language addresses, in the Eircode system is solely derived from the GeoDirectory database.  This is the customer-facing product that combines address data provided by An Post and location co-ordinates provided by Ordnance Survey Ireland.  This database is provided under licence by An Post GeoDirectory, APG, a subsidiary company of An Post and OSI, to Capita, which operates the Eircode system.</p><p>An Post has advised my Department that it is not possible to remove English postal addresses from its mail sorting system for Gaeltacht areas as this could impact the quality of service metrics in regard to mail delivery set by the postal regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  ComReg has set quality of service standards requiring An Post to deliver 94% of single-piece priority mail posted in the State for delivery in the State on the next working day and to deliver 99.5% of such mail within three working days.  An Post advised that removing English postal addresses would give rise to serious technical difficulties in the sorting and delivery of mail.  This is because An Post's sorting equipment uses both English and Irish variations of addresses.  These are used to match the address of the incoming letter.  If no match is found, the letter will have to be manually sorted or returned to the sender.  Furthermore, An Post stated that removing English variations of addresses in Gaeltacht areas would impact negatively on the quality monitoring that is in place for the delivery of mail.  It is therefore not within the remit of Capita to change unilaterally the form of postal address in the Eircode system as An Post has responsibility for the assignment of postal addresses in the State.</p><p>Aside from that issue, private individuals have the option of using the Irish version of a postal address or another of the most commonly used versions in the Gaeltacht.  People can simply append Eircode postcodes to their preferred address.</p><p>In the design phase of the Eircode system, Capita, supported by my Department, engaged with Foras na Gaeilge and Conradh na Gaeilge to ensure compliance with all statutory obligations regarding the Irish language.  Since the issue of discrepancies in Irish addresses between the GeoDirectory and <i>logainm.ie</i>databases was raised with my Department in 2015, my officials have engaged with An Post, An Post GeoDirectory, Ordnance Survey Ireland, An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha and Capita.  This has resulted in Gaeltacht placenames that are the subject of discrepancies in the GeoDirectory databases being updated regularly.  An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha continues to supply An Post GeoDirectory with a file of Irish-language placenames that have been changed or updated.  APG has informed my officials that the GeoDirectory database includes official placenames data as supplied by An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha and that it updates this regularly with information provided by an coimisi&uacute;n.</p><p>The GeoDirectory database is provided to Capita on a quarterly basis for the assignment and dissemination of Eircodes.  An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha is also working alongside Ordnance Survey Ireland to update its online geohive maps portal with the latest Gaeltacht placenames.  This is used in the free Eircode finder.</p><p> My Department will continue to engage with an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga; An Post and the An Post GeoDirectory; Ordnance Survey Ireland; An Coimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha; and Capita on the use of official Irish placenames in Gaeltacht areas.  However, I am confident that my Department has fulfilled its obligations under the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 and taken all possible steps to ensure the official placenames of Gaeltacht areas are used.  I am happy to answer any further questions members may have.</p></speech>

The Department accepted all those recommendations and commenced the implementation of those actions.  They were all actioned and reviewed by the Department and the management board and in 2018 an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga sought an update on the progress on the recommendations, mainly on the resolving of the discrepancies in the use of placenames in the GeoDirectory database.  A new issue was also brought to the Department's attention regarding complaints received by an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga that private companies were using addresses and people's names in English rather than in their original language, Irish.  My Department contacted An Post, which advised the Department that this was not possible for it to resolve.  There are a number of issues as to why people might receive their mail in a Gaeltacht area with an English address on it and An Post advised my Department that it was not possible for it to remove the English postal addresses from its mail sorting system for Gaeltacht areas.  An Post has it in English and Irish in order for the efficient and next-day delivery of mail.  It said that if it removed the English from its database it would impact on the quality of the service and the metrics on mail delivery set by the regulator, ComReg.  ComReg has set quality of service standards requiring An Post to deliver 94% of single pieces of priority mail posted in the State for delivery in the State on the next working day and to deliver 99.5% of mail within three working days.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; ag breathn&uacute; ar an tuarasc&aacute;il agus ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; ar&iacute;s go d&uacute;irt an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga go bhfuil iarracht ionraic d&eacute;anta ag an Roinn ach in ainneoin sin go bhfuil s&eacute; ag s&aacute;r&uacute; a dualgas.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go raibh imscr&uacute;d&uacute; agus monat&oacute;ireacht &oacute; 2015 ar aghaidh agus i ndeireadh na d&aacute;la bh&iacute; s&eacute; "in vain" mar a d&uacute;irt s&eacute;.

Tuigeann an tAire St&aacute;it nach raibh an dara rogha ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga mar nach raibh s&eacute; s&aacute;sta leis an dul chun cinn a bh&iacute; d&eacute;anta.  Sin an rud at&aacute; mise ag iarraidh a ch&iacute;oradh.  C&aacute; bhfuil an Roinn maidir leis an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga?  Cuireadh an tuarasc&aacute;il os comhair na D&aacute;la i m&iacute; Me&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; go soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil s&aacute;r&uacute; dualgas i gceist.

In September 2021 the implementation report presented to the Oireachtas acknowledged that the Department made a genuine effort to implement all seven recommendations.  The issue raised by the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga was the official placenames of Gaeltacht areas appearing in Irish only in the Eircode system.  That is why the Department contacted An Post on the English names and I might let Mr. King in on this point.  Capita receives the information relating to Eircodes from GeoDirectory, which is a subsidiary of An Post.  The addresses that Capita requires come from An Post and it has to align with the postal delivery service.  An Post says it has to have the English and Irish addresses on its sorting system and on its software in the mail sorting office in order to align with a letter and match it.  That was the issue that was raised by the commissioner.</p></speech>

The Department&rsquo;s language scheme does not provide for the exclusive use of Irish in Gaeltacht placenames.  The Department, in line with the language scheme, ensures that official placenames of Gaeltacht areas are used as the default for corporate purposes.  In the design phase of the Eircode system, Capita, supported by the Department, engaged with Foras na Gaeilge and Conradh na Gaeilge to ensure compliance with all statutory obligations regarding the Irish language.  The Department also put in place the necessary arrangements to ensure that the official placenames of Gaeltacht areas were used as a default for official purposes.  Compliance with the Official Languages Act, the Place Names (Irish Forms) Act and placenames orders was also part of that and that extends to Capita&rsquo;s operation of the Eircode system and its quarterly dissemination of Eircodes.  If someone searches for a placename in a Gaeltacht area with the Eircode finder website tool, it will default to the Irish version of the address.  There has been and continues to be ongoing engagement with Coimisi&uacute;n na Logainmneacha and GeoDirectory in order to ensure that Irish placenames are kept up to date and regularly updated.  I will bring in Mr. King on this in case there is anything I missed.  He was in the Department throughout this process.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, the Eircode finder provides Irish-only addresses in Gaeltacht areas.  It gives people a choice whether to use Irish or English but it defaults to the Irish version.  Capita extracts the Irish language address only and uses that to disseminate new Eircodes.  When it sends out the form with the Eircode on it to Gaeltacht areas, it only contains the Gaeltacht name.  Those dissemination letters are sent by An Post, which delivers them on behalf of Capita.  Both the website and the finder site are in Irish and in English, so if someone wants to deal totally in Irish with Eircodes, they can do that.  Capita has employed two Irish-speaking agents so if queries come through about an Eircode or an address, the person can work directly with Capita through Irish from the initial correspondence right through to the resolution of their problem.  Capita has put these systems in place since we started the project.</p></speech>

N&iacute;or chinntigh an Roinn sa chonradh go mbeadh an dualgas maidir le seolta&iacute; agus ainmneacha Gaeltachta &aacute; chomhl&iacute;onadh.

As I said, An Post has to give both the English and the Irish address for its own sorting reasons.  That is given to Capita and then it is up to anyone to get the address through the Eircode finder.  If someone in a Gaeltacht area looks up their address, the default position is that they will be given the Irish address.</p><p>To go back to an important point the Deputy made about <i>logainm.ie</i>and the experts in GeoDirectory, there is a commitment and ongoing engagement with regard to discrepancies.  The Department does not want any discrepancies in this area.  There are regular updates and we are in constant contact with An Post, OSI and GeoDirectory in order to improve the system and make sure it is maintained.  This has been ongoing.  It is in the Department&rsquo;s interests that we engage with the likes of this committee and hear feedback on this matter.  This contract ends in December 2023 and the Department is reviewing the arrangements around a new contract and what that could entail.  That is why it is important that we engage with all stakeholders, including this committee.  Work is also being done around the dissemination of Eircodes and making that interval shorter.  The Deputy can be assured that the Department is meeting the requirements of the language scheme.  We are open to ensuring that this is working.  The fundamental point in relation to the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga was around having the English address and the Irish address being provided by An Post.</p><p>When the Department went to An Post about removing the English version, An Post said it could not do that for sorting purposes in the mail offices because it needs to be able to match a particular address to both the English and the Irish in order for it to be delivered in the context of its next-day delivery obligations under ComReg.  That was the response from An Post and that was the issue raised by an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  It was a new issue that the Department sought to rectify but, unfortunately, An Post is not in a position to do that because it needs to live up to its next-day delivery obligations.</p></speech>

In good faith, the Department contacted An Post, which is in charge of the addresses that are given to Capita, addresses which have to align with the postal service.  An Post said that it has to provide the English and the Irish versions and to keep them on its database to ensure next-day delivery.  That was the issue raised by an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  I appreciate the concerns and frustrations in that regard.  That is why I am here today to listen to the views of the committee.</p> <p>  As I have said, as part of the contract coming to an end, we will need to hear whether the Eircode systems, the delivery systems and the systems to ensure people are getting their mail delivered in their preferred language, particularly in Gaeltacht areas, are working well.  That is the reason I am here today.  I also wish to highlight, make visible and be very transparent about the issues within An Post with regard to the obligations ComReg has placed on it and which it must comply with to facilitate next-day delivery.  That is the issue here.  I am also here to outline the interaction and engagement between the Department, GeoDirectory, Conradh na Gaeilge and all of the stakeholders to ensure the GeoDirectory database is kept up to date in respect of Irish addresses.  Where there are discrepancies, people must have a direct line to ensure that information is updated and given to Capita to ensure we have the proper Irish placenames in Gaeltacht areas.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we are in compliance.  In his implementation report in September 2021, an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga acknowledged the genuine effort made by the Department and highlighted the specific issue with regard to Eircode having both an English and Irish version of addresses.  The default position for people putting in their addresses in Gaeltacht areas is for the Irish address to be used.  With regard to cases where that does not happen, that interaction with GeoDirectory and the Irish bodies is continually improving the system.  The issue with An Post relates to the obligations ComReg has placed on it.  That is what it is telling us.  It cannot remove the English version from its mail sorting database.  That is the key issue.  I am here today to answer those concerns.</p> <p>  Again, I am obviously also here to listen to all members.  I say that to be very clear.  I have colleagues and officials with me to discuss the progress of the Irish language within the Department.  We have an official Irish language officer coming on board next month.  We are here to listen to all of the genuine concerns, to make sure the Eircode system is fit for purpose and acknowledges the need to have addresses in Irish in Gaeltacht areas, and to look at what we can do around that, including in the future as we look at future contracts.</p></speech>

This was the concern the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga had in terms of the complaints he was getting.  During that meeting we looked at the options for how we could have Irish only in Gaeltacht placenames.  We agreed at the meeting that we would write to An Post and ask it if it could take out the English addresses and only use Irish addresses in Gaeltacht areas.  We hoped that would assist in the reduction of complaints to the Minister or the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga on communications with English addresses.  That is what we agreed at that meeting and we subsequently wrote to An Post.  An Post replied to us to say that was impossible because of its sorting system and how it worked.  It also mentioned a broader issue, namely, that there is no legal form for addresses in the State and that there are large variations of English and Irish addresses, not to mention that 35% of the addresses in the State are the same as other addresses.  To resolve that issue, An Post has variations of addresses and the English addresses in its database.  When a letter for a Gaeltacht area arrives in English, the scanning software is able to pick it up and automatically sort it.  We told the commissioner at that meeting that we would write to An Post to see if it was possible for the software to work with Irish only and that was the answer we got.</p></speech>

As I said, it was important for me to come to the committee today to outline the position of An Post, which explains the reason the Eircode system has both English and Irish addresses on it.  That is not to say it is satisfactory.  I am not saying that.  I completely concur with the members and that is why this is part of our engagement with the committee.  This engagement will be ongoing, particularly over the next 12 months as we negotiate a new contract.  We need to address how this can work best in the future, as well as the other issues around private companies using their own addresses or translating their own addresses, which is separate to the matter the Senator has raised today.  I will give her that commitment and will consider getting clarification on this to make sure everything is done correctly.</p></speech>

Where an address is not matched, there are approximately 20 people who will manually go through letters to make sure they are delivered and An Post knows exactly where they are going.  The software is one part of it but there are also staff there.  It is not a staffing issue but an operational issue for An Post.  It has said that it cannot guarantee next-day delivery.

We were informed at that meeting, like the Minister of State said earlier, that the automatic sortation software scans the incoming letter and compares it against the database.  If it finds a match, it gets sorted into a separate area.  If it does not get sorted, it goes into a manual sortation system where staff have to go through the letters one by one and manually sort them.  An Post also said that its database holds variations of different addresses to allow for a higher rate of matching.  That information is in both English and Irish and it needs both in order to hit its delivery targets.</p></speech>

I am very reluctant to do so in this committee but I want Mr. King to be clear about the question I asked.  We have heard this story about An Post&rsquo;s software about ten times now.  The Minister of State told us that there are around 20 people in An Post who will physically pick up the mail and sort and match it if the software does not.  The Minister of State has said that next-day delivery cannot be guaranteed if the system only uses Irish addresses.  If enough people were provided by An Post to manually sort the mail, why could it not guarantee next-day delivery where only Irish addresses were used?</p></speech>

We are talking about a Department failing in its legal duties.  Why has this question not been asked?  When An Post stated that its software system cannot pick up Irish addresses, did the witnesses just accept this answer and shrug their shoulders?</p></speech>

The technology is an operational matter for An Post.  It is the expert in mail delivery.  The Department would not have that expertise in terms of how the software works, why it works the way it does and how that ties in with its matrices of deliveries.  An Post also informed us that it is looking to introduce technology for postal workers whereby they would have a handheld device that would recognise the address itself.  We could seek further clarification and information on that technology, which would further automate the systems for delivery on the ground.  When we spoke with An Post, we asked for explanations of how the software and the sortation system work but we would not be experts in that, other than the fact that An Post said it would delay its delivery of mail.</p></speech>

That is the Department&rsquo;s understanding of it and that is what it has told us but now that we have asked further questions the witnesses are saying they do not actually understand it.</p> <p>  Will the non-appearance of the people who were asked to appear at this committee impact on any future tendering?  It is the height of disrespect, particularly when we have a report from the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  It is not often he puts a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  How will their refusal to come here impact any other contracts they may enter into?</p></speech>

As the Minister of State said, the contract expires at the end of next year and there is an option for the Minister to extend the contract to Capita for a further five years.  These issues that have arisen will be taken into account when we do the full review.  We worked with the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga at the beginning of the project and the 2015 report highlighted the fact that there was a poor level of translation of Irish addresses and some mistakes in the GeoDirectory database.  GeoDirectory and Capita worked together with <i>logainm.ie</i>to update the database on a regular basis.  Our understanding from GeoDirectory is that that process continues today, and was also continuing when the 2019 report by an Coimsin&eacute;ir Teanga came out.  GeoDirectory has received another update from <i>logainm.ie</i>which covers 2020 and 2021.</p><p>Those addresses will be updated by GeoDirectory and fed straight into Eircode, which will then update the database as soon as those data are received.  That information will be fed into the Eircode system.</p></speech>

That is a tiny amount.  It is not even 1% of the cost.  It is much less than that.  Does Mr. King think it is satisfactory to dedicate only &euro;200,000, out of a project worth &euro;35 million, to update the GeoDirectory database?</p></speech>

The frustrations around the address system are clear and the fact that the address has to be in both languages.  I commit to engaging again with the Department and the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga on this.  What we want to do is resolve these issues in the immediate term and in looking at the next contract.  The feedback will be very important for the drafting of that and I know officials are acutely listening.  We endeavour to make sure the Irish language is represented in relation to Eircodes, that people can get their mail addressed in the language of their preference.  That is what I commit to today.  I will go back and talk to an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga again about how we can progress this.</p></speech>

There was a huge amount of engagement with an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga as well as written correspondence between the Department and the coimisin&eacute;ir and, as Mr. King said, engagement with An Post about this.

T&aacute; na st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh, mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ina n-ainmneacha, mar st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh.  N&iacute;l aon mhaith a r&aacute; go bhfiafr&oacute;idh s&iacute; den Roinn.  Is ise an Roinn.  Is f&uacute;ithi at&aacute; s&eacute; cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh faoi seo.  Th&aacute;inig an coimisin&eacute;ir ar an tuairim, s&eacute; bliana &oacute; shin, gur s&aacute;ra&iacute;odh an dl&iacute;.  Is &eacute; an f&aacute;th go nd&uacute;irt s&eacute; &eacute; sin n&aacute; n&aacute;r comhl&iacute;onadh for&aacute;lacha plean teanga a bh&iacute; ag an Roinn.  Nuair a fuair an Roinn toradh an imscr&uacute;daithe, is l&eacute;ir nach bhfuair s&iacute; comhairle dl&iacute; &oacute;n Ard-Aighne agus nach bhfuil s&eacute; sin faighte f&oacute;s.  Ag breathn&uacute; ar na miontuairisc&iacute; a fuaireamar, is l&eacute;ir gur admhaigh an Roinn i dtosach b&aacute;ire go raibh an dl&iacute; &aacute; sh&aacute;r&uacute;.

Ag am ar bith, &aacute;fach, n&iacute;l aon fhianaise ag aon duine go bhfuarthas comhairle dl&iacute; &oacute;n Ard-Aighne.  Is cleachtas dochreidte dona &eacute; sin do Roinn ar bith.  Aon uair a rinne l&iacute;omhain in aghaidh aon Roinn, a raibh eolas agam air, fuarthas comhairle dl&iacute;.  N&iacute;l aon ghealltanas &aacute; thabhairt go lorg&oacute;far comhairle dl&iacute; sa ch&aacute;s seo.</p> <p>  N&iacute;l mise a r&aacute; go gcaithfidh go bhfuil ceart ag tuairim an choimisin&eacute;ara.  Is cuimhin liom c&aacute;s a bh&iacute; s&aacute;ch gearr don bhaile don bheirt againne at&aacute; mar Theachta&iacute; D&aacute;la do Ghaillimh Thiar nuair a thug an tOmbudsman tuairim n&oacute; breithi&uacute;nas agus d'fhoilsigh s&iacute; imscr&uacute;d&uacute; a pl&eacute;adh sa D&aacute;il.  Ba &eacute; tuairim an Ard-Aighne go raibh an tOmbudsman m&iacute;cheart agus go raibh an rud a bh&iacute; s&iacute; ag moladh in aghaidh an dl&iacute;.  M&aacute; deireann an tArd-Aighne, mar chomhairleoir dl&iacute; an Rialtais, leis an Roinn go bhfuil an rud at&aacute; ar bun dleathach agus go bhfuil an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga m&iacute;cheart, glacfaidh m&eacute; leis sin.  Sa ch&aacute;s go ndeireann an tArd-Aighne, go teicni&uacute;il agus b'fh&eacute;idir tr&iacute; dhearmad a rinneadh sa Roinn, go bhfuil s&eacute; m&iacute;dhleathach, t&aacute; dh&aacute; bhealach leis seo a r&eacute;iteach.

I am pleased today to continue our discussion of the priority item on the committee's work programme, which is our continued consideration of the proposed national action plan on the development for the islands from the Department of Community and Rural Development.  The coastal islands and communities are a crucial part of our history and heritage.  Our committee wants to hear the voice of islanders and get their opinion on what is needed to stop population decline, to reduce the downward trend and to build and sustain vibrant communities.  Key issues that will be discussed include vital transport and social infrastructure needed by islands including education, childcare, transport, housing and broadband, and key supports needed for industry such as tourism, fishing and farming.  In this regard I welcome board members of Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann for our second engagement with the federation.  In particular I welcome, joining us remotely, Ms Aisling Moran, an cathaoirleach from Sherkin Island, Mr. Simon Murray from Inishbofin and Mr. John Walsh from Bere Island.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Witnesses participating remotely and from outside the precincts of Leinster House today, are reminded that parliamentary privilege does not apply in their case and the same level of caution should be applied as previously mentioned.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  I now call on Ms Aisling Moran to make her opening statement. </p></speech>

We welcome his comments on it.  The opportunity to highlight some of the challenges facing offshore islands is very much appreciated today.  As the Chairman stated, this is our second appearance before the committee.  We welcome the policy document, Our Rural Futures, in particular chapter 10 which deals with supporting the sustainability of our islands and coastal communities.  To recap quickly for those who do not know, Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann was founded in 1984 and represents the offshore inhabited islands.  The organisation&rsquo;s aim is the social, economic and cultural development of the island communities through representation at local, national, and EU levels.  Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s overarching aim is to maintain and develop the islands, which is in line with our Our Rural Futures policy document.  While islands have much in common, it is important to remember that there are many nuances and bespoke approaches may be needed for certain challenges.  As the chair of Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann I represent islanders.  I am the project co-ordinator for Sherkin Island Development Society and act as an island advocate.  For the past decade  I have been working with the islands seeking comprehensive means to live sustainably on our offshore islands.  My colleagues here are Simon Murray from Inishbofin and John Walsh from Bere Island.  Simon has spent his entire life working with and for island communities, ensuring key concerns are continuously addressed.  Many members will know him from his continual addressing of key concerns of the islands.  John Walsh is project manager for Bere Island Projects Group and is the chair of the European Small Islands Federation, ESIN, and an islands advocate.</p> <p>  Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann finds it necessary at the start of our opening statement to reiterate the shocking population statistics.  In 1841 there were 34,219 people living on our offshore islands.  By 2016 there were 2,627.  No other community has experienced such a decline.  That is pointed out in the national action plan.  These figures have not improved and some islands have moved closer to the edge.  Serious and continued Government support is needed to ensure the long-term viability of our offshore islands.  We can see the way this trend is going and where we are going to be in 20 or 30 years' time if it continues.  </p> <p>  Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann would like to highlight four areas of concern and if time allows, address other areas the Chairman addressed also.  The first area of concern is housing.  The social context in how we live has disproportionately impacted the housing situation on the islands.  Updated laws on planning policy limit the ability of islanders to be able to build on their islands.  Ireland has seen an increase in second-home ownership and this demand has driven the price of existing island housing stock out the reach of islanders.  Like no other area, islands are finite spaces.  Therefore islanders need to be able either to afford to build or buy homes on the islands.  Alternative mainland housing options are not a solution to the island housing crises.  The housing situation on the offshore islands is urgent.  It is an area where there has been very little research carried out to date.  University College Cork, in conjunction with Comhar na nOile&aacute;n and Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, is currently engaged to conduct a comprehensive housing survey on all the offshore inhabited islands.  The outcomes of this survey will result in a report and housing recommendations for the offshore islands.  </p> <p>  In September 2022 Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann will host its annual general meeting, the main theme of which will be housing and the outcomes of this report.  All members are welcome to attend that and invites will go out at a later stage.  Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann is hopeful that this report will be an input into Our Rural Futures, as one of the policy measures is the ten-year island policy document and it will also be an input into that.  This will be a substantial evidence-backed research document. </p> <p>  The second area of concern we need to look at, which the Chair also mentioned, is connectivity and broadband.  The past two years have been challenging and very different for the whole world and islanders are no different.  One of the main results of the Covid-19 pandemic is that people want to and sometimes must work from home.  There is a new age of remote working already building in Ireland.</p><p>Comhdha&iacute;l Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann sees this as an opportunity for islanders to attract emigrant islanders and new residents to the islands.  To do this, we need sufficient housing and reliable high-speed broad systems in place.  As we stated in our previous presentation to the committee, in exploring the opportunities for Gteic digital hubs, broadband connection points, BCPs, and enterprise hubs in our communities, it is vital that the national broadband plan, NBP, provides islands with fibre optic cable connections from the mainland.  We must stay in step with the mainland all the way along.</p><p> The national action plan, Our Rural Future, notes that 58% of people on the islands have access to computers and 55% have access to broadband.  This is considerably lower than on the mainland, where 73% of the population have access to a household computer and 72% to the Internet.  While the NBP is meant to deliver high-speed broadband to all areas of Ireland, and several islands already have BCPs and have developed Internet hubs that are proving very successful, there is much more to be done and it must be done at a faster pace.  People cannot and will not put their businesses and lives on hold waiting for the infrastructure to catch up with the technology.</p><p> The third area I want to speak about today is infrastructure, lifelong services and capital funding.  The islands capital budget programme funds infrastructure projects, lifelong services and capital works.  We believe there is definite scope for an increase in this budget to reflect the real needs of the offshore islands.  Our Rural Future states that the Government will invest in vital infrastructure on the islands over the lifetime of the policy to ensure safe access for islanders, service providers and visitors alike.  For us, infrastructure is not only about safe access; it is about the everyday lives of islanders and the future sustainability of the islands.  Comhdha&iacute;l Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann would like to see a consistent budget that can meet the needs of the offshore islands, working in conjunction with the interdepartmental committee on islands development, island inter-agency groups and local authorities.  The islands capital budget programme is crucial to the sustainability of the offshore islands.  The success of the island policy document depends on real financial support and backing through its implementation.  The budget has, in the past, proven to be capable of covering a wide range of vital areas of island life integral to the future of the offshore islands.</p><p> The final issue I want to raise, which is part of a broader current debate, is energy.  Sustainable energy is the way forward and a key consideration for the whole country at this time.  As islanders, we are really keen to be at the forefront of these new developments.  We are already working at this on an EU level through its clean energy for EU islands secretariat.  My colleague, Mr. Walsh, may say more about that presently.  Working with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, there is major potential for all offshore islands to work at a local and national level.  The recent Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, national home retrofit scheme was welcome.  However, that scheme is a key example of how things do not translate to the islands due to the higher costs of works and the requirements on contractors.  It is an example of where island-proofing would aid in the understanding of these nuances.  We are hopeful that through engagement with the interdepartmental committee and the Minister, we will get resolution on this.  Islands are ideal test beds for energy pilot projects.</p><p> The issues I have touched on by no means amount to a comprehensive list of those relevant to offshore islands.  We certainly would welcome an expansion of the conversation to include policies around health, education, agriculture, marine access, childcare, enterprise, employment, fire and emergency services, waste management, tourism, youth and older people, many of which are considered within the 12 policy measures of the national action plan.  One of the most important policy measures in that plan is the ten-year islands policy development plan, which will allow us to expand on all these areas.  We recognise that being here before the committee today is a great opportunity.  We see great potential and great opportunities in our working together.  We acknowledge that the work on the islands policy document being done by the Department is central to our rural future and our success and sustainability into the future.  We request that a draft version of this document, along with an implementation plan, be presented to the island communities before its final publication.  We recognise the real importance of the interdepartmental committee, alongside the Department, in the process of writing the policies document.  As representatives of Comhdha&iacute;l Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, we are grateful for the opportunity to speak here today.  We see these opportunities as key to the delivery of Government policies and the means to secure the future of Ireland's offshore islands for coming generations.  We can turn the tide on the numbers and ensure we have sustainable living on the islands.  I thank members for taking the time to listen to me.</p></speech>

I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1097" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022030200002#C00300"><p>It is good that the witnesses could join us today.  One positive development that has come out of the Covid period is the acceptance within the Oireachtas that things can be done remotely when necessary.  A large number of issues have been raised and we could say a lot about them.  I am appalled at the lack of progress in regard to the islands in the past 12 years.  I got the figures from the Department on the contracts that have been entered into, showing that the infrastructure on Inis Me&aacute;in was built but there was some money still to be paid and Inis M&oacute;r was under construction.  In the 11 years from 2000 to 2010, &euro;128 million was spent on infrastructure for islands.  In the 11 years since, &euro;12 million was spent.  Despite all the planning, we are not getting delivery.</p> <p>  I looked at other issues during my time as Minister.  For example, in 1997, there were ferry services only to Gaeltacht islands and there was a hotchpotch of different systems.  All of that was unified into one system and every island with any significant population got a ferry service, irrespective of which language is spoken there.  The social welfare allowance was introduced in that period, giving an extra provision per week for people on an invalidity pension and other pensions.  The special island tax on cars was introduced and a doctor was allocated to Inis O&iacute;rr.  All of that happened by 2010 and other things were done as well.  Since then, the most significant positive change I have seen for the islands is the decision that all schools must have two teachers, which I utterly welcome.  However, it seems to me we are not really going forward at the moment.  One of my main concerns is that we will lose years to all this planning.  The plan I had at the time was written on three pages and we just went and did the things.  I am not boasting because it was done; I am saying this because, to me, the train stopped with a jolt and it has not started again.</p> <p>  I will concentrate on a few points and ask the witnesses whether they consider them to be major issues.  First, should everybody who lives permanently on an island and does not have a home automatically be considered, which they are not in many counties, to have a housing need for the purposes of planning permission?  Very few of the islands have towns.  That is the number one issue if we are talking about housing.  Second, should local authorities be obliged to house island applicants who want to stay on islands rather than putting them on lists on the mainland against their wishes?  Third, do we require the provision of affordable housing on the islands?</p> <p>  Broadband provision is being rolled out but it is happening very slowly at the moment.  The NBP has undertaken to provide broadband speeds of 30 Mbps or more.  I credit the Chairman with much of the work that was done in this regard.</p><p>The problem is it does not specify fibre-optic cable to each island, so they can provide radio broadband over 30 Mbps and they would be out the gap.  That is not acceptable.</p><p> I will tie this to my next brief point.  In my experience there is only one way to deal with capital deficits on islands, and that is for the island fund of the Department dealing with the islands to be significant and the Minister to have freedom with that fund.  This is not part of the national broadband plan so National Broadband Ireland has no obligation to put in fibre to every island.  The fund should be for matters such as installing fibre cable, sewerage and water infrastructure, as well as power and new electric connections to the mainland, telecommunications, health and leisure facilities, piers, roads and anything else requiring a capital input over and above what would be required on the mainland.  It would also overcome the cost-benefit problems.  For example, Irish Water would argue it is a commercial entity and it must have priorities so if there is a location with over 1,000 houses versus an island, with the cost of work on the island being greater, the cost-benefit analysis would send it to the bottom of the list.</p><p> We overcame this before because the island fund would provide the money.  A company would be contracted to run the service and put in an amount of money equivalent to a service on the mainland, with the Department making up the difference.  Do the witnesses agree we must go back to that process of getting the job done with the expenditure?  It is not only about the money but the freedom to spend that money on any deficit that the islands Department sees and where people are arguing the cost-benefit analysis does not justify the work?</p><p> I can get into specifics on the energy question.  I understand the witnesses have already sought a meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I have raised the matter with him.  I am not getting much satisfaction but I understand the requests are very simple.  As before, the upper limits on expenditure should be higher than on the mainland, and the Minister gave some hope in that respect.  The &euro;50,000 figure would be &euro;60,000, &euro;65,000 or whatever on an island because it costs more to do the same thing when we consider cost of materials, labour etc.  A second request is that grant percentage rates would be higher, so 50% would become 60% and so on.  A third request is that there would not be a requirement for island-based contractors to have a turnover of &euro;1 million per year.  It is hard enough for that to happen on the mainland but it is impossible on islands and it will exclude island contractors.</p><p> I have probably said enough for this round, although I could say much more on the topics being discussed.  When we are looking at drafting our document, we must continue improving ferry and air services, education, health, fishing, childcare, ambulance and fire services.  Nothing should be excluded from what we write and the fact that we might not necessarily discuss everything here today should not be seen as an indication that this committee will not look at all facets of life and come up with cogent proposals on them.  I have utmost faith in the committee and it has the freedom to put whatever it thinks fit in the report.  A matter does not have to be mentioned here today to go into the report.  It is a committee report and not just about us transmitting what witnesses might manage to say in a very short time.</p></speech>

I will start with housing and I agree wholeheartedly with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said.  Everybody on the island looking to build or move has a housing need and we have a position where people are living with gracious family members.  There is nowhere else for them to live, however, and sometimes they are being told there is no housing need because they are living with brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers or cousins.  It is not sustainable or acceptable in the long term.  If people want to have their own home and can do it, they have a housing need.</p> <p>  One of the biggest issues we see is people being on the local authority housing list but if there is no housing on the island, they are offered houses on the mainland.  We mentioned in our opening statement that islands are finite resources.  We see all the planning going into trying to make islands sustainable so when something like this happens, the Government policy seems to be driving people off the island.  People might be given the option of a house but they cannot have it on the island and it is on the mainland.  That does not do anything to sustain our population.  If somebody is an islander, is on the local housing list and wishes to live on the island, a house on the island should be offered to that person.</p> <p>  There is definitely a need for an affordable housing system within the islands.  We need all sorts of people living on the islands and we must also be cognisant of the fact that the price of housing on the islands has been driven up due to the demands of society.  We need a system of affordable housing on the islands where we have hard-working people who want to stay on the islands and would be willing to build or buy houses.  There is a definite need in that regard.</p> <p>  We cannot say what the report or surveys will bring over the next couple of months but we are very hopeful that research will be weighted.  It has gone through an ethics board.  As the Deputy has said, we as Comhdh&aacute;il na h&Eacute;ireann recognise that these are solutions but there will be academics indicating the problems and survey findings, and we are very hopeful that we will be able to make real requests based on what people want on the island and the research has proven.  We hope to bring that to the Government so it can formulate policy.  We hope the committee can look at that and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has already said she will look at it.  We hope the housing Department will also consider the matter.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray might speak to the fund and Mr. Walsh might speak to the energy question.  Again, I agree with the Deputy's comments on broadband and some of my colleagues might want to speak to it.  Fibre-optic broadband must go to our islands or otherwise by the time we get the radio signal, we will be behind already.  That is what is happening.  The Deputy is 100% correct that the national broadband plan contains no obligation to bring fibre to the islands and it is not part of the deal.  We need a way to get that fibre to our islands.  By the time the radio signal gets to our island goes around all the houses, we will be so far behind the mainland we will be back before the committee in five or ten years saying that our broadband is not up to scratch in comparison with the mainland.  If we are going to do it now, let us do it right and in a manner that will keep us in line with the mainland.  That is just common sense from our perspective as islanders.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray and Mr. Walsh might speak to the other topics or even those on which I have commented.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022030200002#D00400"><p>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's points.  On the question of broadband, if we get a radio link with 30 Mbps, in a year or two years we will be looking for fibre.  If we had to attend a meeting today in Leinster House, we are probably the only community in Ireland that would have to have two overnight stays.  Our first ferry this morning was 7.45 a.m. and I would not have made the meeting for 9.30 a.m. in Dublin.  Our last ferry last night was 6.30 p.m. and if I had to get that going home, it would not be doable to get it from Dublin.</p> <p>  We really need proper broadband and the only solution to future-proof the islands for 30 years is fibre broadband.  An expert on broadband said to me once that the radio link is like a water connection in that if one or two people use it, it is very good, but if 50 or 60 people start using it at the same time, it is useless.  That is what would happen and we already know 30 Mbps was probably not good enough two years ago, never mind two years from now, when it will be behind.</p><p>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's points on infrastructure.  In the past it worked.  On my island, Heir, the islanders were key partners in whatever projects were going ahead.  We were partners with the local authority, Cork County Council, and with the islands division.  They work very well.  Lately there has been some slippage and the islanders are not really getting a say in what is going on.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, very little is happening which is disappointing.  In Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's constituency, issues with the pier in Inis O&iacute;rr have been going on for many years.  I was there myself.  It is vital infrastructure.  I cannot understand why that has not been done.</p><p> On housing, as Ms Moran said, some people are living with their parents and living in mobile homes.  They are the unseen homeless people.  We are trying to encourage people, particularly young families, to live on islands.  I know young families here with babies living in substandard accommodation.  They do not make enough to get a mortgage and they make too much to get social housing.  Local authority housing is not an option for them.  They need affordable housing.  We need to come up with schemes.  Hopefully, the study being carried out at the moment will give us some answers to that.</p><p> On energy, I am chairman of the European Small Islands Federation.  It was set up in May 2001 and has 11 members ranging from Scotland, France, the &Aring;land Islands off Finland, right down to Croatia, Greece and Italy.  We work at a local level.  We share best practice and we also work at a European level trying to influence EU policy.  We represent 1,640 islands and approximately 360,000 islanders.  We have built up key partnerships over the years with, for example, the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions, CPMR; Greening the Islands; and FEDARENE, the federation of energy agencies.  We are partners with all of them.</p><p> Over the years we have built on our work.  We have done considerable work on energy.  We were instrumental in setting up the clean energy for EU islands secretariat and also the facility for funding energy projects for islands, New Energy Solutions Optimized for Islands, NESOI.  We are delighted that Inishbofin in Galway is a beneficiary of that.  Cape Clear, Bere Island and Inis M&oacute;r were beneficiaries of the clean energy for EU islands.  That secretariat is set up to support islands in their energy transition.</p><p> We need to convince the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to do something with the islands so we are not left behind.  If we get the same rate as the mainland, it is actually a step behind for us because on islands costs are 30% to 40% higher.  I do not understand why he does not do what the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine does when it comes to building agricultural sheds.  If a shed costs, for example, &euro;10,000 on the mainland, it adds the extra amount it costs on an island.  It may add 30% indicating the shed on the island will cost &euro;13,000 and then the grant rate remains the same.  That was the approach the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took to solve it for islands.  That scheme was successful.  Many buildings were built on islands.  We would welcome a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on that.</p><p> If islands do not get their energy plans in order, we will be in serious trouble.  We recently had a visit from Soren Hermansen from the EU energy island of Sams&oslash;.  He pointed out how important energy is for the future of islands.  Living on islands is already costly enough.  As we know, there have been three increases in energy in the recent months.  If that continues, it will force people from the islands because we simply will not be able to live on the islands with the extra costs of energy on top of the extra cost of living on the islands.  That is all I have to say for the moment and I would be available to answer any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon Murray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022030200002#E00200"><p>On the housing issue, no more than on the mainland it is a very complicated situation.  Turnkey properties are often available for sale on islands.  The local authorities never purchase these properties to solve housing needs across the islands.  They always seem to want to take the long route of securing sites and building which is considerably costlier as a rule.  There may be a block there in local authority rules, but surely it should be changed for islands which are geographically confined and there is only so much room on an island for housing in the first place.  It is a major issue because, as Ms Moran said, if people cannot live on the islands the domino effect from that is that everything else is in the negative.  If an island cannot maintain its population, everything else falls apart after that.  Keeping our communities on the islands is crucial; that is Comhdh&aacute;il's main aim.  Hopefully, that is also the Government's main aim, but sometimes it is questionable.</p> <p>  On the infrastructure budget, I know money was tight in the country a few years ago but still I do not think there was any excuse that no money was requested by the island section from the Department - at least that is what I was told at the time.  I was shocked at the time because regardless of the overall budgetary constraints across Departments, a request should always go in to seek funding for the islands.  I would hope there will never be a repeat of that again.  The thinking on that needs to be expanded so that budgets that are sought are realistic to achieve all the aims and objectives we are talking about here today.  Hopefully that mindset will shift.  I believe the work of this committee will have a significant part to play in that.</p></speech>

I wish to follow up particularly on housing.  I am aware of the requirement to demonstrate a local need with planning applications.  When people get to the stage of applying for planning permission, what are the factors leading to refusal in the first instance?</p> <p>  I welcome the work that UCC is doing.  I presume that will look at housing stock overall, including local authority houses, houses available for rent and vacant houses.  When is that research due to be finalised?  I know Ms Moran said she is hopeful that the Minister will look at that in the context of the upcoming policy plan for the islands again, which I believe has been delayed again.  Based on a reply to a parliamentary question that I got about two weeks ago, I was told that the Minister expects a draft to be ready for her consideration by the middle of this year.  Obviously, the witnesses want that draft to be made available to them.  This is not the first time they have asked for that.  Have they requested that from the Minister or the Department and what was the response?</p> <p>  Broadband is obviously very important for all of us.  It is just as important for the islands.  The witnesses have said that broadband connection points, BCPs, are already available on several islands.  How many have them?  Is any work under way on the further roll-out of BCPs?  Ms Moran mentioned the need to accelerate the broadband plan which does not seem to be happening now.  We are concerned that last year's revised target was also missed.</p> <p>  Regarding the policy overall and all the issues outlined today, what level of engagement do the witnesses have directly with the Minister?  Have they met her?  How many times have they met her?  </p> <p>  On energy, if a request has gone in for a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, this committee can certainly push for that to happen.  To date that meeting has not taken place.</p> <p>  If the islands policy is published and includes the need for island proofing, we should not have these issues with schemes that are introduced.  We should not have these issues if island proofing was there in the first instance when schemes like this come forward which do not consider the added barriers and challenges for island communities, particularly when it comes to grants.  As Mr. Walsh outlined, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine did this and it could very easily be done for energy, housing grants and everything else affecting both the mainland and the islands.</p></speech>

I will try to answer them as comprehensively as possible.  We are hopeful on the UCC research.  We are finalising working groups around the survey.  The guideline is to have the survey completed by the start of the summer and UCC would begin to analyse the data thereafter.  We hope to have it for the middle of the summer or towards the end.  Our annual general meeting is in September so we will definitely have it for that.  The data will be collected by the end of May because there is no point in doing research or data collection on islands in the summertime.  We hope to have that done and UCC will collate and analyse the data and have the report soon after.  We are in line with the timeline for the policy document also, which will be useful.</p> <p>  On sharing a draft, I believe, unless somebody corrects me, that we have not had an official response in writing but it was mentioned at the joint Oireachtas committee when officials from the Department were before it.  I think it was said they would share a draft with us.  Maybe somebody could clarify that.  We keep asking because there has not been anything in writing but we have had good engagement with Department officials Bairbre Nic Aongusa and Br&iacute;d N&iacute; Chonghaile on the policy document.  Comhdh&aacute;il has not met with the Minister on the policy document but we met with her officials in the summertime.  Br&iacute;d N&iacute; Chonghaile is always available and I think they are going to one more island now that things have opened up again.</p> <p>  BCPs are working quite well.  We need acceleration.  BCPs are fantastic.  I do not have the exact number of hubs but perhaps one of my colleagues has.  I do not want to give a figure that is not 100% correct.  We need it going to houses to keep us in line with the mainland.  Some of the buildings on islands are substandard when we look at the communal spaces, while some small islands do not have a communal space.  There are challenges around that.  We welcome the BCPs.  It is great to have something but we need something more.  People are looking for stuff to go to their houses, as well as having BCPs to come out and work at.  That is the same all over the country and we are hopeful we get the same response on it.  </p> <p>  That is as well as I can answer those questions.  If any of my colleagues want to come in on any of those, by all means do.</p></speech>

If not, what are the barriers when people go for planning permission?  Why are people being refused, or is it that people are not going for planning permission in many cases?</p></speech>

People are going for planning permission.  There are environmental issues.  Many islands are now in special areas of conservation, SACs, and there are many environmental reports which drive up the price of planning.  I know of properties close to each other on one island, one of which had to get an environmental report and one of which had to get an archaeological report.  Each such report costs no less than &euro;1,500.  One of the reports was done in March and they were told they had to do it in bloom in May.  These things do not get stated beforehand so if you want to build, the timeline is that all the environmental reports have to be done in May.  This is a nuance to that particular island.</p> <p>  When we look at local need, an adult member of a family of four had lived in England and stated that he owned a house there, so he was told he had no local need even though he had been living on the island for the last eight years and had returned home to work in and be in the area.  He had to sell the house he had in England to make sure he could prove local need.  That increased cost and delayed the process when logic would tell us there was a local need.  His kids were in school there, he was an islander by birth, had come back to live on the island and did not realise this would be an obstacle.  People are going for planning and there are many nuances and costs incurred.  One of the fine balances is we all want to protect the environment but if there are no people living on it, we will have wilderness.  We have to find the fine balance between protecting the environment of the islands as special places to live and ensuring people can build on the islands in a respectful manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022030200002#F00500"><p>There is the opportunity to use our islands as pilot templates for challenges we have on the mainland in terms of ehealth.  I was on Inishbofin approximately 20 years ago dealing with health issues out there as a member of the Western Health Board.  There is an opportunity with the development of broadband to provide innovative new health tools and the islands are an ideal template to use for the development of such technology.</p> <p>  While there is an issue with housing on the islands, there is also a challenge with existing vacant properties.  We all see that first-hand in our rural communities.  The islands could be used as a template to look at overcoming this challenge and replicating that knowledge on the mainland.  There is huge opportunity in the area of energy, and I will come back to that.</p> <p>  In relation to broadband, the comment was made that there is no obligation to bring a fibre-optic cable to the islands.  Let me make it crystal clear that under the national broadband plan contract, the default is fibre to every home regardless of location.  The contractor must justify why fibre is not being used in a particular scenario.  The standard offering at the moment to every home is 500 Mbps, which means that whether people are on an island or the mainland, they have to get a minimum offering of 500 Mbps.  That is absolute in the contract.  It will be difficult to provide that without doing it through a fibre-based technology.</p> <p>  The offering being delivered to every home at the moment is 10 GB.  Potentially, any home connected to the national broadband plan fibre cable today can, if they are willing to pay for it, get a 10 GB service.  I would expect people on the islands to get the same opportunity to avail of that if they wished.  That can only be provided through a fibre solution.  We as a committee will hold the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to that commitment.</p> <p>  I will address my questions to Mr. Walsh on the area of energy.  It is an issue close to my heart.  When I was appointed Minister with responsibility for energy in 2016, one of the first challenges we had to deal with was the loss of electricity supply to Inis O&iacute;rr and Inis Me&aacute;in.</p><p>I was on Inis O&iacute;rr and saw first hand the challenges that were there and the generators that had to be brought in.  As Minister, I insisted, against the advice, on Ireland being one of the signatories to the EU clean islands initiative.  Thankfully, and Mr. Walsh and Ms Moran referenced it in their initial contributions, there is a great opportunity to develop this initiative with the support of the European Union.  Will Mr. Walsh elaborate on what is happening on the islands with regard to this initiative?  What type of technology is being used?  What are the opportunities there for the other islands?</p><p> In this context it is also important when we look at electricity supply to our islands that we do not just look at the supply coming from the mainland out to the islands.  With the development of our offshore renewable energy potential there will be a significant amount of supply coming from the islands back to the mainland.  It is imperative that we look now at developing the cable network to our offshore islands that has the capacity to supply the mainland rather than, which was historically the case, only supplying the demand on the islands.  I would appreciate it if Mr. Walsh could come back on this.</p></speech>

It is very close to our hearts in Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann.  We believe the islands will be excellent test beds for energy.  We are now on the second clean energy for EU islands team.  The first team ran its three-year contract and there is now a new team.  We did a lot of work with the team on the first round.  On the west Cork islands we had a number of webinars in 2020 to get the seven west Cork islands to work together.  We are working on this at present.  It brought a partnership together and a focus on the islands.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland worked with us as did the energy staff of Cork County Council.  There was also the clean energy for EU islands initiative.  When the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland or the council sees a European partner involved, such as clean energy for EU islands, it is easier for them to step up.</p> <p>  S&oslash;ren Hermansen is the manager of Sams&oslash; Energy Academy on Sams&oslash; Island in Denmark.  This island is seen as the energy island of Europe.  S&oslash;ren Hermansen is seen as one of the leading advocates for renewable energy in the world.  He has said that while in the past making islands sustainable was viewed as a good thing, it is now an imperative.  The cost of energy is soaring as we all know.  We have to bring this to islands.  We work with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on the technology.  It is a great organisation to work with.  It has fabulous people who know what they are doing.  We did an energy management plan and we were supported by an energy mentor to do so.</p> <p>  On the EU side, we applied to the clean energy for EU islands secretariat.  Instead of a cash payment it provides experts in procurement and various technologies.  The first thing we have looked at is houses.  We did a range of BER studies on houses on the island in recent months.  We are taking the information we got from this to retrofit houses.  The grants have come at the right time.  To make it justifiable on islands, we need that extra bit to make it work.</p> <p>  We have a dry dock on Bere Island that takes in boats up to 50 m for maintenance and painting.  It has come on board with us as a partner.  It involves the entire community between local authorities, energy and the business community.  UCC is also involved, as is the clean energy for EU islands initiative.  We need this mix working on the islands.  It is not something one organisation can do on its own.  The dry dock is looking at a combined heat and power plant.  It has put 15 MW of solar on the roof and it will do more of this.</p> <p>  We are also looking at wind and technology whereby heat can be taken from the sea through a heat pump.  These are the technologies we are looking at.  There is talk of electricity cut-outs over time.  We are looking at microgrids.  It was great to get the support of Sams&oslash; Energy Academy.  It has done studies on microgrids.  There are microgrids on the marina on Sams&oslash; of a type that suit a small island having its own grid.</p> <p>  I agree with the Chair that we should not always be looking at bringing in power.  We should also be looking at sending power out.  The cable system going to the islands is out of date.  It has to be upgraded if we are to be allowed to produce power and sell it the communities.  I visited the Orkneys and islands in Denmark and Sweden that sell power.  There is one community in the Orkneys that sells power and the revenue pays for an out-of-hours ferry service and various projects on the island for community and leisure facilities.  It is a great way to sustain the islands.  If there are any questions I would be delighted to answer them.</p></speech>

The numbers are stark and jumped out at me, particularly the reduction in population from 34,000 to 2,627.  The root of the problem with getting representation is the small number of people that live on the islands and how fragmented the islands are across local authorities and in different areas.  It makes it difficult to make the case stand up.  In a previous session someone, and it could have been Mr. Walsh, recommended that committee members watch "Inis Airc - B&aacute;s Oile&aacute;in" on the TG4 player.  I took that recommendation.  It sets out in the starkest terms the challenges of maintaining life on the islands.  It is well worth watching.</p> <p>  A number of issues jump out and I will start with energy.  It may be the issue that sits most comfortably with me.  There are opportunities.  Mr. Walsh spoke about microgrids.  I am interested to know whether he is looking at vehicle-to-grid options to run power.  Storage is always a problem with renewables because of the intermittency.  One thing the islands have plenty of is wind but perhaps not always.  Are the witnesses looking at vehicle-to-grid storage?  It would mean that if there were a couple of electric vehicles, EVs on the islands, they would provide that kind of backup.  The islands should be energy exporters but the most valuable thing they can do is keep the energy on the islands as much as possible.  This is the greatest value-add.  It is something I am interested in hearing about.  The Chairman referenced the potential for e-health.  There is potential for e-health, e-pharmacy and e-prescribing.</p> <p>  To come back to housing, at a previous meeting the witnesses referenced the housing approach on the Scottish islands.  I had a look at this.  I am not sure it directly maps but certainly there is an awful lot that could be learned.  The idea that jumped out at me was the empty homes officer.  I started by speaking about fragmentation.  Each individual council has somebody in its housing department that looks at this.  Would it make more sense to have somebody in a role that looks at all of the islands in terms of housing rather than it being split into the various councils?  Would this be of benefit?</p> <p>  We are here to discuss this in the context of the Our Rural Future document.</p><p>I think there are three policies that sit together like the legs of a stool: Housing for All, Our Rural Future, and Town Centre First, which was launched a few weeks ago.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to apply that thinking to the islands.  The fact that the policy is entitled Town Centre First seems to exclude most of the islands.  That whole structure of building town teams could be easily replicated with island teams.  I imagine they probably already exist on each of the islands.  I wonder if that could be a way for the islands to access the type of support that is going to be available in Town Centre First, particularly the support of a town centre officer, which is going to be a key role within the Town Centre First structure at a council level.  Perhaps that is something that would be useful for the organisations represented to pursue in order to make a bit of elbow of room in the Town Centre First policy so that they can access that level of supports.  Certainly, the community networks are already in place.  It would be a shame if that third leg of the stool in terms of rural redevelopment was missed out on because islands do not necessarily have town centres.  </p></speech>

Our plan, first and foremost, was to use the energy on the islands.  Thinking about it, if we are producing energy and we can offer people living on the islands cheaper energy or if we can offer businesses cheaper or free energy if they set up business on the islands, it would be a great way to attract new people and businesses to the islands.  That was one of our aims.  On electric vehicles, I know that over the last number of years electric buses have been used on Cape Clear as part of the Local Link scheme.  It has been very successful.  It is very good for the environment and it avoids the hassle of brinGing petrol or diesel to the island, which is great.  </p> <p>  We were very happy to see, under the CL&Aacute;R funding announced last week, that there is now a scheme for islands to purchase electric vehicles for community use.  As part of that scheme, funding is also available for PV panels or some technology to produce electricity.  That is going to be an excellent scheme for the islands.  They are the type of schemes that we look for.  We are delighted that the Department introduced that scheme after consulting with islanders about it.  To answer the Deputy's question, yes, we would be delighted to look at all sorts of technology for the transport system, especially green ferries.  The Danish Government ran a competition for people to come together to develop a green ferry.  We are looking at green ferries on the islands.  We are actually looking to do a test case at the dry dock that I mentioned previously.  We are looking to build a small electric ferry and perhaps a small electric potting boat for fishing.  There are a lot of benefits coming down the line with renewable energy for the islands.  We just have to be set up and ready for it.</p></speech>

He referred to his visit to Inisbofin, which was longer ago than we care to remember, as we met up when he visited the island.  I showed the Chairman the shoe box that was our health clinic, the disgraceful clinic that it was.  I must say that the same clinic is still there today.  We got a small bit of money to do it up because asbestos was discovered in the ceiling.  Why do things like that take so long?  Planning permission was granted for a new clinic, which was allowed to run out by the HSE.  We are now shopping around for another site.  Going back to the housing issue, when the Chairman visited the island, there was a turnkey property up for sale but the council would not purchase it.  Why can the council not buy a turnkey property and house people immediately rather than going down the planning route?  Excuses are made about trying to find funding and the house never gets built.  It is a never-ending story.  There is a touch of Groundhog Day in some of the conversations we are having.  As islanders and representatives of islanders, we have been saying many of the same things for a long time now.  We are looking for ongoing solutions to these problems.</p> <p>  I am delighted at what the Deputy said about the fibre-optic broadband and that it is the preferred option.  My fear is that they will find every excuse in the book to tell us that they cannot manage it for some reason.  However, as the Deputy is aware, fibre-optic broadband is the solution.  Broadband through wireless will always have its limitations, it its capacity, first and foremost, and under also under difficult weather conditions.  What we are trying to achieve here in the main, and the expectation at this stage, which may be an expectation that is wrongly held on our behalf, is that when we are dealing with the islands division or any bodies that have a responsibility over the islands, including the Minister and Ministers of State and everybody, there is a grasp of the understanding or a wish to grasp that understanding of island life and the difficulties and costs that are associated with it.  The question is whether we want people to continue to live on the islands or not.  If we do, there is a hidden cost from the State's perspective.  It will take funding to continue life on the islands, but you could argue that about any way of life across the country.  Our case is unique, because what is the option?  Looking at our neighbour island of Inishark, it was depopulated in 1960, as were many islands up and down the west coast.  Reference has already been made to the population collapse and how shocking that is.  At the last meeting I recommended that members watch B&aacute;s Oile&aacute;in "Death of an Island".  For anyone who has not seen it, I strongly recommend it, just to give some hint of what it is like for life on an island to end.  We are in the position of trying to keep islands alive.  It is a documentary about what happens when life on an island comes to an end.  It is something that needs to be in the mindset of those in Government authorities of any description in relation to trying to help.  The objective is to ensure that it does not happen again.  I would hope that that mindset is there and that there is a willingness to help the islands, and to keep the populations alive on the few that are left.  Once they are gone, they are gone forever.  </p></speech>

There is huge potential with e-health.  One of the best documents that has come out of Government in recent years is the 2017 document on primary care on the islands which was produced after a huge HSE consultation.  It has been slow in its delivery.  However, on the west Cork islands, a health forum has been set up by the HSE and there is movement on that.  The areas that we are focusing with the west Cork islands are e-health and emergency management planning.  This touches on one of the other topics raised by the Deputy, namely, fragmentation.  We seem to be moving at a bit of a quicker pace than some of the other regions.  As Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, we would like to see all islands move forward and progress on these kind of issues at an equal level and pace.  One of the things that is so good about the primary care document is that the consultation was very detailed.  A consultant was sent out to each island and an implementation plan was also developed.  There seems to be a budget to back up what they are doing at the moment.  We welcome the progress made on e-health.  As the Deputy has said, it will make a difference in areas such as prescriptions and ways of delivering different services.  One of the concerns of islanders is that the e-health programme should not replace the local nurse or doctor.  It never can.  The HSE has stated that the nurses and doctors need to be physically present indefinitely.  However, e-health can offer a greater range of services to the islanders.</p> <p>  On the issue of fragmentation, in terms of the housing, it is a new and welcome idea.  These conversations are good for us gaining information from the members' knowledge in terms of a vacant housing officer post and also in terms of the Town Centre First policy.</p><p>Maybe we can look at creating an island centre first document or some way of adapting that to suit the islands' needs.  We are very grateful for that and will take it away and touch base with the committee afterwards.</p><p> We saw through the Leader programme that when the islands are treated together, we do really well.  There are nuances but a programme dealing with all the islands together works well.  In previous Leader programmes there was a dedicated lot for the islands and we saw great delivery and a high level of funding drawn down.  Unfortunately in the last Leader programme these lots were broken up into regions with different county councils.  Luckily for three of the islands a company that dealt specifically with islands won the tender but in one of them it did not.  It broke up the funding and the islands did not access as much money.  We are requesting a single lot for the upcoming Leader programme.  We have seen that it works better in every area, be it agriculture, marine or housing, if the islands are dealt with solely by a specific person who gets a better understanding of it.  The same is true for the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which is delivered on the Cork islands.  It is a great programme.  It is not a high level of funding but it definitely increases the standard of living really well, giving additional access to education and programmes that enhance quality of life.  An islands SICAP programme or lot would be very welcome.  If we can keep things together for all of the islands we do a little bit better out of it.  We may not have looked into applying that to housing.  We never know what will come out of the report but it is something we need to consider and I welcome Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's thought on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022030200002#J00200"><p>Housing can be divided into two issues.  There is local authority housing and the issue of planning.  The quickest way we can deal with planning is through the rural housing guidelines that are to come out soon.  We should take that up with the Minister.  On the islands, unless they own a house already, permanent dwellers should be considered to have what is termed a housing need for planning purposes.  That should apply across all islands and local authorities.  The local authorities have to work within the national guidelines so if we do it nationally, even though there are different plans for each county, it would have to be incorporated.  It could be done within existing structures.  We talk an awful lot in this country about changing structures but often we waste a lot of time changing them rather than making the existing structures work to deliver what we want.</p> <p>  We would support the proposal that Leader and SICAP be done as previously through Comhdh&aacute;il na nOile&aacute;n or on a bid basis but as an islands lot.  That is important.  On another matter, the biggest cost of putting cables into islands is the dredging cost.  Would the witnesses agree that there should be a co-ordinated approach to provide extra energy connectivity through electricity cables, the fibre cable and in some cases even the water pipes at the same time?  It should be possible to get the one dredger in, survey the whole thing, dredge the seabed, put the cables or pipe in and then have the job properly done.  Central Government through the Department with responsibility for the islands is the only body that can put all of that together.  Any necessary funding over and above what the agencies put in will be provided by the Government through that Department.  That is what it was set up to do.</p> <p>  I was very interested in what Ms Moran was saying about local networks.  There is only one way of transporting electricity off an island, through the cable.  EirGrid, which controls the whole flow of electricity through the country, could arrange with islands that when it does not want island energy, rather than turning off the wind generators or whatever means of energy generation is on the island, the electricity generated could be stored internally on the islands in very simple ways.  It could be used to charge all the electric vehicles on the islands in the down periods with very cheap electricity.  Effectively they would have their own electricity if they controlled their own generation.  It could be used to heat the water and houses in winter by storage at times when the island had literally free electricity and when it is a choice of turning off the wind generators because they do not need the energy on the mainland or using it on the island. </p> <p>  I understand a pilot project is being considered on one of the islands for the use of hydrogen.  That is a way of storing energy.  I understand there is a project exploring the production of hydrogen from solar energy.  We already have buses in the city here and in lots of places operating on hydrogen.  The technology is going to develop quite rapidly.  It is a possible future energy source for aircraft, ferries and other vehicles.  If the islands controlled their micro-generation, they could export energy when they had surplus and the grid needed it and could also store energy on the island and have very cheap electricity.  If we have to turn all the generators off they will just be sitting there doing nothing.  This could provide for people to really dramatically reduce their heating and transport costs.  The other big advantage is that very little would have to be brought on to the island in the form of diesel, kerosene or petrol compared to now.</p> <p>  Are the witnesses as shocked as I am by the reply a Minister gave to a parliamentary question I tabled which suggests the islands are not automatically included in the 20% reduction in public transport costs?  I would have assumed the islands would be at the top of the list for that since people cannot get in and out except by public transport.  I would have assumed air and ferry fares would automatically drop by 20% on 1 April.  It seems like an early April fool's joke that it was not automatically included in the decision.  I suggest to the Chair that we write to the Minister after this meeting and demand that there is equity of treatment for islanders in this case as there will be for all the rest of the people in the State.</p></speech>

They allow for electricity in and electricity out and can be controlled remotely.  They require broadband as well, of course.  It might be an issue worth exploring, however, in terms of providing storage on the islands in specific heaters in everyone's own homes.  It might be a unique way to manage the excess electricity.</p></speech>

The first thing it will do is power the house during the day so people can use their fridges, televisions or whatever.</p><p>It would then go out and charge the battery storage for the night and if there was an electric car, it would also charge that.  There are now two or three people on the island using that system.  For example, to go to Cork city from Bere Island, which is 85 miles each way, it is &euro;2 or &euro;3 to run an electric car but it is free from the sun.  That technology is definitely there and hydrogen is coming down the line.  I am aware of the projects that are going on in the Aran Islands and a number of islands throughout Europe are involved in that, including Rathlin Island.  It is great to see that.  The islands are great as test beds and we will all learn from the work they are doing.  Hydrogen is a small bit off yet but there are other solutions.  We see on other islands that at night they pump water up on the cheap electricity and let it down again in a kind of hydro system, so that can work.  Even with the heating systems, I know of houses here that have a heat pump heating system, again, all worked from the sun and from storing electricity in batteries.  The battery technology is changing to make things better again for us.  The future is definitely bright for electricity generation and I think it will transform the islands.</p><p> To back up the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about transport, when we did our energy masterplan here, the ferry services and marine transport services that are used on Bere Island accounted for about 75% of our overall energy usage, which definitely backs up the point.  We had that done by an independent consultant and it backs up the point about the transport fares.</p><p> On the point made by the Chairman, we met representatives of National Broadband Ireland, NBI, as Comhdh&aacute;il na h&Eacute;ireann, and they said that, yes, they are supposed to put fibre to the home and they will do that on the islands, so every house on the island will be connected to fibre, but the connection between the island and the mainland will not be fibre, or that is what they told us.  That might need to be looked at because we have to have a continuous line of fibre to get the 10 GB which will be needed for the future.</p></speech>

We are aware of that issue.  They are talking about a point-to-point wireless service from the mainland to the island.  The committee is unanimous in its view that that should be done by a fibre-optic cable directly to the island, not by a point-to-point service.  I call Mr. Murray.</p></speech>

Two of the issues have been touched on, namely, the 20% reduction in travel, which, bizarrely, did not translate to the sea and air services to the islands, and also the SEAI retrofit grant, which did not take into account the associated costs.  Considering the pressures on construction in this country and how hard it is to get people to do anything in the first place, this grant is going to make that even harder.  We would start with the obvious thing, which is the contractors on the island, who are on the ground and are local, and there might be some chance of getting that work done, but they are excluded with the &euro;1 million cap and the lack of a top-up to take into the consideration the extra costs of islands.  They are two prime examples that have been touched on in this meeting where island thinking is not being used.</p> <p>  We need to be considered.  It is the work of the islands division to make this part of everything that is happening through different grant systems and the availability of any regulations in regard to island living, to encompass the islands as one lot in the same way as with the LEADER programme.  It needs to be thought of in the context of whether this works for the islands or whether there is a nuance that needs to be adopted to make this work for the islands.  We need to have that thought process at the start rather than always having to come in at the end, which is what we are doing now yet again, to try to backtrack what has just been done to make it adaptable in the island context.  It is frustrating for islanders.</p> <p>  We are looking at the islands development document which came out in 1996.  It is now 26 years later and we are trying to do the next phase of that, to update it, so to speak, when that is a huge gap in itself.  It has to be to the forefront of the thought process, where islands are dealt with in a lot capacity.  Like the SEAI grant, like the 20% reduction, why was it not automatically understood that this is going to be a problem on the islands?  If the contractors cannot meet the threshold, then it can be adapted and, as Mr. Walsh mentioned with regard to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine grants, it does not take a lot to do it.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said it.  We do not have to change all of the regulations and we just need to do a little bit of tweaking of the regulations that are there to bring them into the context of island living.  That is across everything - across planning for housing, across the health situation and across what the Chairman, Deputy Naughten, knows in regard to communications and especially in regard to broadband.</p> <p>  If, through the work of this committee and the interdepartmental committee, that is driven home and that is one of the main legs of the stool that comes out of this whole conversation, namely, that islands are thought of in all of the processes in regard to anything that is required, that is probably the best achievement that can happen.  We do not want to go back to another 25 years of always trying to remind people that, hello, there are islands off the coast, there are people living on them and we would like that to continue.  That is kind of where we are at the moment.  There has been a lot of work done, a lot of talk and then a big gap with nothing.  Now, we need to get back to getting work done across the islands in every capacity.  The powers that be, whether it is Government Departments or county councils - it does not matter where it is coming from &ndash; need to consider the islands in the context of whatever is coming forward at the time.  Hopefully, we can drive that home, get that thought process going and get it to continue so islands will be constantly thought of and not forgotten again.</p></speech>

I do not expect to have an answer now but if Comhdh&aacute;il could come back, I would appreciate it.  The question concerns the utilisation of infrastructure when it is put in place.  While this is not unique to the islands, there was a golden opportunity to exploit this on the islands and I do not know whether that has happened.  My predecessor as Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, rolled out the high-speed broadband network to every single post-primary school in the country, including on the islands.  I have spoken with some of the teachers on some of the islands and asked them whether the range of subjects has increased as a result, allowing for remote teaching.  I accept it cannot be done in terms of practical subjects but it does provide an opportunity for students in second level schools on our islands to have a broader range of subjects.  I have a particular problem in east Galway, where there are many small second level schools, and it limits the range of subjects that students can have.  On the islands, with the introduction of high-speed broadband in the post-primary schools, have we seen an increase in the range of subjects being offered to pupils in the junior cycle and senior cycle where they are being taught remotely?  The witnesses might come back to the committee with an answer to that in the not-too-distant future.  From my experience, this has not happened on the mainland.</p><p>It needs to be driven by the Department of Education, working with the education authorities and the ETBs, to ensure a broader spectrum of subjects is offered to students in smaller second level schools.  </p><p> Do the witnesses wish to make any final comments?  No.  In that case, I thank them for their contributions to this constructive and positive engagement.  The joint committee will discuss in private session after this meeting a number of the issues the witnesses raised and we will follow those up.  We will get back to them with the response we receive.  The committee has also invited the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her officials to a future meeting at which we will raise these very points again, as well as the concerns the witnesses raised with us this morning.  Furthermore, it is my intention, as Cathaoirleach of the committee, to arrange a visit to one of our offshore islands where we will hold a formal meeting.  We will meet people on the ground on a number of the islands and get a first-hand feel for their concerns before we prepare our final report for the Minister.  We hope this will feed into the Department's action plan for island development when it is published.  I hope that will be done as soon as possible.  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ith.  I thank everyone for their time this morning.</p></speech>

Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members and all those in attendance in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I ask the witnesses to limit their presentations to approximately three minutes.  They will have to present a summary.  This is to allow members to ask questions.  The time for questions will also be limited.</p> <p>  I call Ms Springthorpe to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

Bird is a last-mile electric vehicle company dedicated to bringing affordable, environmentally friendly and safe transportation to cities and towns across the world.  As the company that founded the industry of e-scooters, we are trusted to operate in more than 350 markets, half of which are in Europe.  We manage shared micromobility programmes through our electric scooter and electric bike partnerships with local authorities.</p> <p>  The company believes that shared micromobility helps communities strengthen the local economy, alleviate traffic and parking congestion, reduce harmful emissions and enhance transport access.  Bird is one of the few shared micromobility companies to research, develop, design and manufacture our own scooters.  Our team of former automobile and aerospace engineers build vehicles to incredibly high standards.  Our goal is to create the safest and most sustainable vehicles in the industry.</p> <p>  We welcome the legislation and applaud the Irish Government, in particular the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, for creating a new category of powered personal transport, through which electric scooters will be legalised on Irish roads.  In particular, we believe the specifications set out in the legislation, with a maximum speed of 25 km/h and a maximum weight of 55 kg, are appropriate to ensure electric scooters are a viable alternative to private car use in Ireland.</p> <p>  We also welcome the statement made last week by the Minister and the Minister of State that the proposed maximum power rating of 250 W for electric scooters could be adjusted through secondary legislation to account for technological developments as well as their safe and efficient use on hilly terrain.  We are encouraged by the fact the Minister has proposed outlawing the use of electric scooters on footpaths.  Our view is that electric scooters, like bikes in Ireland, belong on the roads and cycle lanes.  Local councils should decide specific areas in which e-scooters should be used or restricted.</p> <p>  As an organisation, our number one priority is the safety of our riders and the safety of the general public.  We welcome the strict prohibition and appropriate sanctions against the consumption of alcohol while operating an electric scooter.  However, studies have shown that legislation requiring helmets and high-visibility equipment is ineffective and significantly reduces modal shift.  We wish for this to be excluded from the legislation in Ireland.  Instead, it is essential that providers and governments educate the public on the importance of wearing protective equipment and encourage them to do so.</p> <p>  Our safety approach in running micromobility is why we recently announced a first-of-its-kind partnership in Ireland.  Our partnership with the Irish School of Excellence will see 80% of all secondary schools in Ireland have access to best-in-class e-scooter safety training for those aged 16 and older.  We are delighted to invite committee members to attend this training in their locality</p> <p>  We are thrilled by the potential Ireland holds for the uptake of shared micromobility.  While Ireland remains heavily reliant on car use as the primary mode of transport, even for journeys under 2 km that are ideal for micromobility, we believe this could be the dawn of a new era of sustainable travel across the country, complementing existing and planned infrastructure.  I thank the committee again for inviting us today.</p></speech>

To cut straight to the point, we very much welcome the Government approval of the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 and commend this committee on the recent legislative actions taken regarding the definition of personal powered transporters, PPTs.  As I understand it, the proposed definition of PPTs has been recently amended so that the weight, speed, and power output of e-scooters can be varied through future regulations.  We believe this nimble and forward-looking approach is particularly sensible in the context of innovation in the micromobility sector.  E-scooters are a young and rapidly evolving form-factor, where vehicle design changes are continuously taking place to improve public safety, sustainability and reliability.<br/><br/>Consistent with previous discussions I have had with members of this committee, Spin strongly supports the efforts to legalise e-scooters in a manner that prioritises safety and a level playing field from a market point of view.  To that end, we strongly urge the Minister and the Department of Transport to move forward with developing regulations for e-scooters that are squarely in line with safe and tested international precedents.  When it comes to minimum design standards, such as vehicle weight and power output, there are clear evidenced-based standards from other countries to draw upon.  We recommend that the Department look to countries such as the UK, Germany and the US to put in place e-scooter vehicle standards that have already been proven to be effective and to lead to widespread public use.<br/><br/>To share one lesson learned from the last five years of the continuous development of micromobility, through our close partnerships with cities and community stakeholders, we have seen first-hand that public engagement and rider education are the most important factors for making e-scooters a safe and reliable mode of transport.  In other words, it is not the device technology <i>per se</i>, but rather the performance of shared e-scooter operators that makes the biggest difference.<br/><br/>While Spin supports the legalisation of private e-scooters, it is important to keep in mind that shared e-scooter operators provide the additional benefits of ongoing rider education and access to best-in-class vehicles.  Every time a rider wants to ride a Spin scooter, for example, they are presented with locally-specific educational content to ensure that riders know the rules of the road and understand expectations regarding parking and riding behaviour.  With this in mind, we urge local authorities to carefully consider not only the onboard scooter technology, but also the well-documented performance histories of operators in the future development of shared rental schemes.<br/><br/>Once again, we appreciate this invitation to offer our experience and our recommendations for maximising the public value and potential of e-scooters in Ireland as a safe personal mobility option.  The Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 represents an exciting opportunity to advance sustainable mobility options and to deliver a range of benefits, both individual and societal.  We strongly support this legislation and are always happy to offer additional input and guidance as this legislative process moves forward.</p></speech>

We currently provide shared e-scooter and e-bike services to cities and towns across Ireland, the UK and mainland Europe.  We are an Enterprise Ireland client company and have been awarded high potential start-up status.  Since our founding in 2019, we have grown to a team of 25 people and we hope to create 50 more high-paying and skilled jobs in Ireland over the next 18 months.  At Zipp, we believe in mobility done right.  This means it is our mission to do everything we can to help decarbonise transport, but it must be done in a principled way that respects the needs of our entire communities.</p> <p>  Before we discuss electric scooters, it would be worth contextualising this conversation by reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s transport-related greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions.  Transport is the second largest contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.  Additionally, the transport sector has been Ireland&rsquo;s fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions since 1990, with the sector's emissions having doubled in that time.  When this is broken down further, it is clear that private car usage is the leading cause of transport emissions, contributing to nearly 50% of total transport emissions in some years and consistently being over twice the size of the next largest emissions category.</p> <p>  Ireland has set the ambitious goal of reducing its emissions by 51% by 2030 and getting to net zero by 2050, which means we need a 7% reduction in emissions annually for the next eight years to achieve these goals.  In 2020, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and an economic slowdown, we only achieved a reduction in emissions of 3.6%.  This illuminates how great a task we have at hand.  It is vital that we consider every solution possible when seeking to decarbonise transport.  We can start by looking at our cities, where more than 60% of our population lives.  We can provide those people with safe and sustainable transport options, like e-scooters.  E-scooters could be transformational for reducing our reliance on private cars.  For a young person who cannot afford a car, an e-scooter could be a safe and sustainable alternative.  For people who live too far away to walk to a public transport link, providing shared e-scooters could help people to get those links and improve public transit usage.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair and members of the committee once again for inviting me to speak.  I hope to give the committee my views as a representative from the shared micromobility industry and also as a young Irish person.  I hope to communicate how passionate we are about ensuring Ireland becomes a world leader in climate action.  Legislating for e-scooters may seem like a small step, but with a task this big ahead of us, it is not about silver bullet solutions but about the myriad of small steps we take together as a nation in our quest to conquer the greatest problem of our age: climate change. </p></speech>

Lime is the world&rsquo;s largest and most experienced micromobility provider.  Founded in 2017, our mission is to build transport systems that are shared, safe and sustainable.  We operate e-bike and e-scooter sharing schemes in more than 200 cities across 30 countries globally and we are contracted to run services in many of Europe&rsquo;s major capitals, including Paris, Rome and London.  To date, we have safely delivered more than 250 million sustainable rides across our global operations.  This amending legislation will see for-hire and private e-scooters legalised in Ireland.  It is vital we use data and shared experience from countries with existing regulations to get this right, for riders and non-riders, and to deliver on the safety and sustainability aims that underpin this legislation.</p> <p>  We can use this data and experience because Ireland is well positioned as one of the last European countries to regulate e-scooters.  This presents an exciting opportunity to learn from existing regulatory regimes and to help deliver this innovative new transport technology in a controlled way that works for everyone.  Following the Government&rsquo;s approval of this draft legislation, we have made a significant investment in our Irish operations that will be delivered over the next 18 months.  This is aimed at helping us to develop our business and to serve communities across Ireland, including in Dublin, where our European headquarters are already located.  Effective e-scooter regulation puts cities and people first.  We are focused on using our global experience to launch and run well-managed services that work for cities by delivering a long-term impact via a focus on safe riding, responsible parking, environmental benefits, equitable access and data sharing.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee members for their time.  I look forward to discussing their views on this amending legislation in more detail and to working together to ensure that we can use this Bill to help create green, shared and affordable transport systems across Ireland.</p></speech>

We will proceed to members.  We have approximately 45 minutes remaining, so I propose that each member has five minutes.  I suggest that two minutes, at most, be used for questioning to allow three minutes for the witnesses from the representative bodies to answer.  I ask for key pinpoint questions to be asked that will allow us to go to the representatives of all the groups to see what their views are on each aspect.  I call Deputy O'Rourke.</p></speech>

I call Ms Springthorpe from Bird.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Victoria Springthorpe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#F00900"><p>I echo the comments made earlier.  We all agree, as an industry, that engagement and training are vital to e-scooters being successful.  Regarding the training aspect, as a company we undertake that technologically and in person.  Every rider who signs up to the app in Ireland will be told the rules of the road and will then undergo safety quizzes and be requested to take safety pledges, which will be pushed out to them every two to three rides.  Additionally, we invest around 100 hours in in-person community engagement and training in every city in which we launch to help the public to get used to the vehicle.  We appreciate that it is a new mode of transport in Ireland, and one that not many people have experienced unless they have been to other markets on holiday.  Therefore, we ensure that we have that in-person element in every town pre-launch.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, we also have a partnership with the Irish School of Excellence to deliver training for those aged 16 to 18 in schools.  We typically find that age group is the most problematic in respect of riders.  We are focusing that aspect on educating those aged 16 to 18 in respect of how to use an e-scooter properly and how to park compliantly.</p><p>There are many different parking options with e-scooters so we must ensure they understand every option in detail, including how to dismount a scooter properly.  You need things like geofencing, electric throttle and training for younger age groups so that when they reach 18 or whatever the age limit will be, they will be fully educated by that time.  To reiterate, we think education is the most vital piece of getting this right in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1147" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brit Moller" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#G00200"><p>Similar to what Ms Springthorpe mentioned, we do both in-app education and in-person education.  I want to highlight the value of public engagement specifically with community stakeholders.  For example, Spin has held a few in-person e-scooter demonstrations in Ireland with the National Council for the Blind and for members of this committee.  This feedback is important so that we can make adjustments to our service.  Maybe we can add a sound to e-scooters to make them more noticeable to the visually impaired.  When it comes to rider education, we hold several in-person demonstrations to explain how our e-scooters work and emphasise the local rules because we find that repetition of this information is critical to getting this right.  In addition to the in-person education, we also will repeat these rules in the app every time a rider takes a trip to ensure that he or she at least knows the rules and that we take the appropriate steps if the rules are not being followed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Will O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#G00300"><p>Similar to other speakers, we do in-app and in-person training.  Before we launch in a city or town, we typically do a few weeks of training-only events so that access to e-scooters will only be from within the safe confines of a supervised area.  We take a place such as a carpark and have a number of members of the Zipp team showing people how to use the e-scooters, and handing out free helmets, high visibility jackets and giving them promotional materials to thank them for coming.  In addition, complementing the communications we provide in-app, our social media regularly runs competitions to promote safety messaging.</p> <p>  On the engagement side, this is by far one of the most critical things to get right in Ireland.  We need to introduce e-scooters to communities in a way that is acceptable to them, not to just come in overnight and drop a few hundred or 1,000 scooters in a city and leave.  It is critical that we talk to residents' groups and members of the visually impaired and disability communities and get them on board, making them a key part of the design of the trial, taking on board their feedback both pre- and post-launch as we iterate through the trials.  As I mentioned, in our operations in the UK, we meet monthly with a wide group of stakeholders, including residents' groups and members of the blind community, and work with the local guide dog teams to report on any incidents.  Ensuring there is a feedback loop there is critical so that when they report problems to us, we are able to make the amendments.  One of the great things about these shared e-scooter programmes is that because there is an operator above the system, if change is sought, it can be introduced.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hal Stevenson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#G00400"><p>Ours is a very similar set up which includes mandatory in-app training and in-person sessions that we run for our riders.  Across the panel the benefits of the higher services that we provide are visible in terms of having that constant touchpoint with the rider.  What is interesting about this amendment is how it applies to how private e-scooter users will be regulated or legalised, where there is not the same touchpoint.  People are able to buy something over the counter.  How do you regulate who uses that and how much training they get?  If we take it back to base principles, what we are trying to deliver is hopefully something that is safer than the current situation but also delivers something that provides a meaningful modal shift and a sustainable way for people to get around.  There is going to be a tension or a balance between wanting to introduce some form of organised, official training without creating unnecessary barriers to usage.  Perhaps it could be some form of standardised online training that stops short of a provisional licence or a driving licence requirement.  Whether getting on a for-hire e-scooter or a private e-scooter, a person needs to know how to use it and need to use it safely.  What we do not want to do is dissuade people from taking that step if there are onerous training or requirements that are not in keeping with the technical specifications.</p></speech>

We are in a bit of a vacuum in that we have not seen the full detail of the legislation but the witnesses have experience of dealing with legislation in other countries and what works and what does not work.  From that experience, are there things that the witnesses consider essential that must be in the legislation?  There is an issue around engine size, battery size, the power of the vehicle and so on.  Equally they might reference the fact that we had a committee meeting with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, of which most of them are aware.  How would they respond to the concerns of NCBI about footpaths, the noise, how doable it is to add some kind of a noise so that people are aware of the e-scooter's existence?  Is that doable?  They have far more experience in this industry than we have but it is coming and it needs to be implemented well.  They all have great experience of doing that but what do we need to have in the legislation that may or may not be there or is being talked about?  What do we need to do to be an example of best practice because there are cities in which it has worked very well but equally there are cities where it has not worked well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brit Moller" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#G00700"><p>I thank the Senator for the question.  The approach taken so far by allowing the Department to revise the standards when it comes to vehicle weight or power output is the right way to go.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, following international precedent is important so that there are not new standards being pulled out of a hat.  Specifically, when it comes to power output, 500 W as a maximum continuous rate of power is the standard.  Companies can always do their part to regulate the actual maximum speed of the vehicle.  Even if the power output is 500 W, the maximum speed can be 12 km/h or 15 km/h, as deemed appropriate by a local authority.  When it comes to vehicle weight, we recommend, also in line with international precedent, around 50 kg.  That allows a wide variety of vehicle and for more safety technologies to be put on the vehicle.  Lastly, one other vehicle specification point worth considering is the number of wheels on e-scooters.  This is form-factor is evolving quickly.  Some e-scooters now have three wheels which can make them more appealing to people like my mother who might not want to get on a two-wheel e-scooter because she would feel the balance is not great.  Allowing for multiple, maybe three-wheel vehicles also might broaden the field to the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Will O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#G00800"><p>On the regulations, to echo what Mr. Moller said, it is quite important to leave the power with the Department to constantly iterate and update these things in regulation.  However, the three critical areas that you probably need to get right are weight, power and speed.  Looking at best practices, we have the opportunity to cherrypick them.  Looking at weight, in Germany and the UK, the maximum limit is 55 kg, not including driver weight.  That is reasonable and allows for a degree of innovation on the current vehicle types.  The sector is moving quite quickly so that if there are extra technologies that need to be added to the e-scooter that can add weight.  On the power side, more than 500 W would definitely be required.  Some countries have that.  Austria has an upper limit of 600 W, Estonia 1,000 W, Finland 1,000 W and the US 750 W, which is quite common.  On speed, 25 km/h as an upper limit is what is being done in the UK and a number of other countries.  Moving towards how we are working with the disability groups, speed is a big concern, but with the geofencing technology, we have the ability to set specific speed zones in different areas in a city.  You definitely would not want e-scooters going down pedestrianised streets, so we can block them off on our back end and ensure e-scooters do not go there.  There are other areas where you might set a slow-speed zone as well.  We are working with these groups regularly to bring these sorts of measures into our operations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hal Stevenson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#G00900"><p>I thank the Senator for his question.  I completely agree with Mr. O'Brien's remarks in terms of how we can legislate for this, so that this maintains a functional purpose and can deliver the modal shift and get people out of cars and onto e-scooters.  Of the three, speed is probably the most important.</p><p>Lime independently designs and develops all of its vehicles.  They are built for roads and have had the level of investment to ensure that they are safe for use on roads.  If we start limiting vehicles to speeds of around 12 km/h, they will not be safe for use on roads because of the speed at which other vehicles travel.  We are looking at a speed of approximately 20 km/h to 25 km/h.  We want that speed and we designed our vehicles or scooters for use on roads, so we would really push for legislation around the use of electric scooters on pavements.  That is not an appropriate place for them to be used and we completely understand and sympathise with the views of groups like the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.  That should be in place.</p><p> The only additional point is that when we consider national legislation versus local authority regulation, there are interesting points around issues such as mandatory parking zones, which we absolutely support and should be in regulation.  They probably do not need to sit at this first stage of national legislation and they can probably be done on a city by city or town by town basis based on the layout and format of the service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Victoria Springthorpe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#H00200"><p>Senator Horkan asked about addressing the concerns of disability groups, as a company we have engaged in many of these groups in Ireland, including the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association and Age Action Ireland.  As Mr. O'Brien indicates, the main priorities are noise and speed when the vehicles are used on footpaths.  We would welcome seeing things such as bells being mandatory according to legislation, as they are in the UK.  They are a way to alert other road users.  There is an active group in the industry to look at a noise solution currently and it is being researched as a cross-industry effort.  As with electric cars, it is considering what the minimum requirements should be.</p> <p>  With regard to speed, there is an industry standard of geofencing, which can prohibit the use of these vehicles in certain areas, as Mr. O'Brien has indicated.  As a company, our vehicles have accuracy of between 10 cm and 20 cm, and we ensure the technology is top of the class to prevent issues.  On the use of vehicles on footpaths, we strongly agree with what has been set out in terms of not using the vehicles on footpaths.  We really think those are a protected space for different community groups.  As an industry we are also constantly looking at technological ways to prevent problems in that regard.  We are testing in America and Madrid in Europe a prevention technology that would not allow a scooter to use a footpath.</p> <p>  On the question of legislation and what is or is not missing, the rest of the team set out restrictions on 250 W systems prohibits the most modern vehicles in the market.  We are happy with the 55 kg element, as it is appropriate weight usage, and the speed of approximately 20 km/h or 25 km/h is appropriate.  Mr. Padden, who worked with the UK Department of Transport, might speak more to this.</p></speech>

It would agree about some of the ratings around mass and similar characteristics.  Aim at top speed but do not worry too much about power because speed can be limited.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for being here.  It is important that this engagement and that which we have had previously can set the scene for what is very important legislation.  Having used electric scooters on a trial basis, albeit in a very controlled environment, I know that the safety issue is absolutely paramount.  We had representatives from the National Council of the Blind in Ireland in with us.  In the context of the safety element, how do we get the balance right between the pedestrian and vulnerable user on the footpath, cyclists in cycle lanes and the public road?  How do we get the safety aspect right in considering the most vulnerable users?</p></speech>

We all accept the argument about reducing congestion and we are all in favour of climate action.  We must consider how to address parking problems as well, as we do not want our footpaths or pavements littered with electric scooters.  There is also the question of speed, age verification and helmets.  A fundamental concern of mine is illegal riding on footpaths and dangerous driving.  How can we get that right?  This is important.  Our gentleman friend from California, Mr. Moller, has spoken about the work done there.  In developing the regulations and legislation, public safety is important.  This is about protecting our vulnerable road user and illegal riding on footpaths and dangerous driving.  We all accept the need to have and promote a modal shift in public transport and private car use, and an electric scooter will play a significant part in that.  With regard to costs, how do we incentivise reduced costs for those who might potentially use electric scooters?</p></speech>

The first concerned the older person or vulnerable pedestrian.  How can we give them a level of security with safety precautions in electric scooters?  There was also a question of cost.  It is only fitting that Mr. O'Brien should lead us off on this.</p></speech>

To simplify the matter, there is the proactive and reactive approach, and we need a bit of both.  We need to be preventative in the first instance in order to stop collisions and such incidents happening and then afterwards we must be prescriptive and react, making changes that seem to fit.</p> <p>  On the question of preventing incidents in the first place, technology is coming on in the industry in leaps and bounds.  The scooters we have this year are very different from those we had last year.  Every operator in this industry is committed to reducing collisions.  This can happen through technology in a number of ways and GPS is going to be the main tool by using targeted geofencing and getting it really accurate.  All operators are working on that.  It is about working for quite a considerable number of weeks ahead of a launch so we can find the right places in Cork city that can be geofenced in order to prevent collisions.  That will be critical.  Much of that will be on the operator side and happen at a local authority operator level.</p> <p>  On the cost side of things, it will again likely happen at a local authority level between local authorities and the operators they select.  It may be part of procurement to ask operators what their pricing model will be, and that is something we saw in the UK, which favoured operators coming in at lower prices.  It is one option.</p></speech>

It is important to remember there is also a quality element and it is not just about who can provide the cheapest service.  It is about who can provide a service that works for everyone in the community.</p><p>While cost certainly is something we need to look at, there must be a balance.  All of that can be considered as part of the procurement with local authorities.</p></speech>

I agree with him on the importance of contributions from groups like the National Council for the Blind of Ireland.  It is vital to have its feedback when it comes to introducing the legislation and making sure it is working for everyone.  We have engaged with the organisation previously and invited it to join our newly formed Irish disability advisory board.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to the need for balance in how we manage pavement space.  From our perspective, we do not see a need for balance.  For us, e-scooters are not toys but road vehicles and should be used on the road.  There is no need for a balance in that regard.  Pavements are for pedestrians and we have technology that can deal with that.  Legislation can also help with it.</p></speech>

As I said, we have the technology to deliver that and legislation can make it enforceable.</p> <p>  In terms of the balance between cyclists and e-scooter users on cycle lanes and other cycling infrastructure, Lime is the world's largest provider of shared e-bikes and e-scooters and, again, we do not see that as a conflict requiring a balance.  As far as we can see from our data, users of Lime are regularly switching between the two different modes and like to use that type of infrastructure for both.  We are not seeing issues in that regard.  It is great when the infrastructure is put in place and we have seen huge progress in that area throughout Ireland in the past 12 months or so.</p> <p>  On cost, our mission is to provide affordable green transport systems.  It is crucial that we do not price people out of our services.  There is no point in trying to deliver a sustainable initiative like this and having people walk past because they cannot afford to use it.  We offer a standard pricing, with a cost of approximately &euro;1 to unlock a scooter or bike and a 15 cent per minute fee to ride it.  Users are looking at a cost of around &euro;5 for a 30-minute trip.  Beyond that, we also offer affordable rates via our Lime access programme, which gives a 50% discount on all rides for concession pass holders.  In addition, where people have a discounted pass to use the Luas, for example, that discount will automatically apply to their Lime rides.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Victoria Springthorpe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#J00600"><p>We generally have a one-size-fits-all approach to pricing.  Within markets, we tailor our permanent pricing to the average regional income.  We offer discount pricing for HSE workers and students, for instance, and a large number of free rides for jobseekers and so forth.  We see ourselves as being accessible in the mobility sense but also the financial sense.  In addition, we offer a weekly and monthly pass for regular users.</p> <p>  On the pavement space issue, we all agree that we do not want to see e-scooters on the footpath in Ireland.  There are three approaches to preventing this.  As already mentioned, the first is technological.  There is geofencing technology and we are testing out our blocking technology to prevent footpath riding by scooter riders.  When they approach a footpath, the scooter will slow down and then stop.  Education is another important factor.  Once we agree what the rules of the road are in Ireland, we all, both providers and local authorities, need to educate as many people as possible through campaigns, advertising and in-app and in-person training.  The third factor is punishment.  We all need to have a zero-tolerance approach to any attempt to footpath-ride.  For us at Bird, if any of our users are caught on a pavement in the UK, they are banned from our service.  We have a very high-tech identity detection system that prevents anyone from opening a second account.  If someone is banned from our service, he or she is banned for life.</p></speech>

On protecting pedestrians, many companies now have anti-footpath technology that can detect in real time whether scooters are being illegally driven on a footpath.  A point for local authorities to take on board is the importance of data sharing, which includes being able to continuously share on a monthly basis how often footpath riding is occurring and information on the active deterrent steps taken by operators, whether that is automatically reducing the vehicle speed or banning those users in order to limit repeat offending.</p> <p>  On pricing, similar to the other companies, we have equity-based pricing.  We encourage local authorities to consider setting equity-based standards and encouraging operators to provide discounted rides, either based on location or individuals' income status.</p></speech>

Everything my colleagues said is absolutely right.  The legislation that is brought forward will have to include sanctions.  The committee cannot rely on e-scooter operators to take sanctions against people using private vehicles.  That is where the work Bird has done with the Irish School of Excellence is really important in terms of setting the norms with young children.</p></speech>

They have managed to get through a significant number of the questions.  They spoke about geofencing and technology fixes.  Thinking of some of the roads in Irish towns, we have an imperfect system as it is.  When I visited Strasbourg some time ago, it was necessary to be watchful of getting run over by a bicycle or e-scooter but there was a significant amount of space on the roads and, to a degree, on the pavements, where riders were sectioned off.  There are cycle lanes on pavements in some towns in Ireland.  It is probably the case that a huge number of <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements have happened.  On some level, we might want to start all over again but we cannot do that.</p><p>I get what the witnesses are saying about riders experiencing a slowdown as they approach a pavement.  Even in Strasbourg, with all its fabulous road networks, I noticed that riders just crossed over the pavements.  There probably is an element that people have become accustomed to doing it.  There is the question of what the operators can do and the reality of what happens in terms of private purchasers.  There are young fellows buying e-scooters who go out on them dressed in black and without any lights on the vehicle.  That is the type of behaviour we are getting complaints about at this point.  What do the witnesses propose in this regard?  What is absolutely necessary to be done in order to ensure safe use?  I get the point about education and telling people what they should do, but how do we ensure all vehicles are sufficiently lit and are noisy enough, in line with what the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and other organisations are seeking?  In reality, those organisations are probably looking for speed limits that are a lot lower than what the witnesses want.  It is a question of how we can deliver all of that, accepting that we all want it to happen.</p></speech>

Noise is a big factor for people, particularly when it comes to scoops in speed.  People do not want a situation where they feel utterly exposed.  Pinpointing Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s question, what specifically can be done to give security to vulnerable groups?</p></speech>

Geofencing is a really useful tool but it is not a silver bullet.  It is implemented by GPS, which means there is some level of drift.  It is very appropriate for things like preventing people from riding in crowded squares where there are a lot of pedestrians or passing foot traffic.  It is much less well-suited, and we do not use it, on pavements that are perpendicular to roads because the level of certainty needed to interfere with the rider in terms of slowing or stopping the vehicle is not appropriate to what can be delivered with GPS.</p></speech>

It is all done remotely on our system, which, again, is one of the huge benefits of for-hire services such as the ones we provide versus a privately owned vehicle where once it has been bought over the counter, beyond having minimum hardware or speed requirements, it becomes very difficult to regulate usage, which is where things like rider education, road signage and enforcement will come into play, which will definitely be part of considerations.</p> <p>  Regarding noise on approach, the Chairman is right.  It is a concern that has been raised across all our disability advisory boards and we have regular conversations about it.  Our view is that all vehicles should have a noise-emitting device.  We have bells on all our scooters as standard.  You need to be able to alert pedestrians to your presence.  We are involved in a pilot research process on a continuous audible warning because while there is clear appetite for, there is no significant amount of concrete data about what we have at the moment that sets out how you do it but also demonstrates the benefits - things like the directional nature of a continuous noise.  We can put a noise in our scooters in our warehouses tomorrow, but it is very difficult to turn that into something that has a positive impact on the ground in terms of what that noise sounds like, how we make it directional and how we standardise it across markets.  It is something we are working on with other providers and we have a road map to delivering something but for us, it is somewhat of an unanswered question and there is more research to be done before we would want it written into regulation.</p></speech>

It is an industry-first integrated sensor fusion system on what we call the brain of the scooter whereby we store maps that capture the rules relating to the road.  These upload in real time from a distance, not manually on the scooter, so that can dictate in real time where the footpath is and prevent that from approaching.</p> <p>  To go back to noise, speed and visibility, we very much agree with what Mr. Stevenson said about the noise approach.  He mentioned the research being done by industry.  As an industry, we need to agree what this noise is and rather than have piecemeal operators with lots of different ones, agree what the industry standard should be.  We are excited for this research to happen, but bells should be compulsory on scooters as a form of alerting pepole.</p> <p>  I do not think anyone has touched on visibility yet.  We agree there should scooters should have high visibility.  Our scooters have lights on the front and rear and plenty of reflective tape.  In the UK, we operate partnerships with the blind association over there.  As a result of that partnership, we adapted our vehicles to have more reflective tape.  We should see this mandatory visibility of the vehicle in regulations but maybe in councils.  We do not think high visibility should be mandatory in legislation but we encourage riders to wear high-visibility clothing as much as possible.  We have what we call a helmet selfie whereby if people take a selfie wearing a helmet or high-visibility clothing, we can give them credit off their next ride to incentivise their use.  Part of it involves technological developments while part of it involves education.</p></speech>

We believe that anti-footpath technology is the most promising tool for correcting pavement riding in real time.  We use a downward facing camera that can read the topography of roads and detect almost instantly whether a rider has gone up on a footpath and make the necessary intervention such as slowing it down, emitting a sound or even bringing the scooter to a complete halt within a few seconds.</p> <p>  The other thing that has not been mentioned is the importance of precision parking.  Scooters can tip over and pedestrians can trip over them so having tools to enforce very precise parking in designated zones is another safety recommendation we have for local authorities.</p></speech>

It has heard about geofencing.  If a user is not using the service properly, what can you do to minimise the risk even further?  You then start looking at the scooter.  As Ms Springthorpe mentioned, the visibility of it is critical.  Our scooters are bright yellow so they stand out like a sore thumb in that regard.  Reflective tape is another very easy measure to put on to scooters.  Again, local authorities can talk to operators and say the standard for their scooters is a certain amount of reflective tape.  That is an easy thing for us to add if they want more.  We have front, back and side lights on all of our scooters.  We are also looking at indicators to give that visibility and an indication to other road users of which way riders are going and how they are using the road.  The bell is critical.  It is such a simple thing.  Everyone knows how to use a bike bell and knows the context in which to use it so ensuring that is on every e-scooter is a good idea.  I think the bell could be in the regulations.  It is quite a common standard.</p> <p>  We are researching other things around lighting in UCD where we have a project looking at adaptive lighting systems - not just having a static light on all of the time but a lighting system that lights out and put lines down the front to show the oncoming track of the scooter.  For example, in London, there is a light on the front of Boris bikes to allow someone who cannot hear them to see them on the road in front of them.  Another thing is looking at light that does not just project backwards but also on to the back of the user so it would come up from the back wheel of the scooter and illuminate the user's back.  We are looking to progress things with Irish researchers.  We are progressing a noise device project similar to other operators so there is a whole range of things.  After you have done all these things and if there is an accident, it is critical riders are banned, which is something we do if there is ever an incident like this and we have a report.  We have registration plates on all our scooters so if they see registration 101750 at 2.15 p.m. on Ballincurr Road and pull out that, we can go back at our back end and see that Will O'Brien was on that scooter and involved in that accident and can ban him from a service.  I ride quite sensibly.</p></speech>

He runs the Irish School of Excellence, which has run a pilot scheme with Bird.  For me, this is about user safety and the safety of others.  In fairness, all the groups here today have touched on that.  The collaboration between the Irish School of Excellence, which is based in Ennis, and Bird about going into schools throughout Ireland to deliver a training programme for pupils within the school setting is a wonderful initiative.</p><p>Will the representative from Bird elaborate on that aspect?  The representatives from the other companies might indicate if that is something they are considering.  Equally, is this something that is done in other jurisdictions and that should be replicated here?  Should a provision be inserted into the legislation to require people to have completed a mandatory training regime before they can get control of one of these e-scooters?</p></speech>

We take similar steps in cities across the US.  We see the value of in-person demonstrations and training, especially at the beginning of a rental scheme when members of the public are not familiar with the devices.  Many in-person events must take place to emphasise the rules on how to use these devices safely.  We have also done demonstrations with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland to get more critical feedback on its concerns because we know that vulnerable populations might have more safety considerations in mind when it comes to the sound of the vehicle, as we mentioned, and where these vehicles should be parked.  Keeping all that feedback in mind is important to crafting a tailored service in each local authority.</p></speech>

Everyone will have one in their constituency, and members should feel free to get in touch for our demonstrations.  The programme will be available for those aged between 16 and 18.  The reason we are undertaking this partnership is that we find this younger age group the most problematic.  They are less likely to read the in-app training information and things like that.  We find it essential to speak to as many of the in person as possible.</p> <p>  The course is split between theory and practice elements, like a driving school would be, and it will cover all sorts of topics, including what the rules of the road will be in Ireland once these vehicles are legalised and how to ride properly.  E-scooters are a unique mode of transport, especially concerning the balancing element, which is unique to any kind of bike or anything like that.  One aspect, for example, explores how riders should bend their knees properly and where to place their feet on the footpath.  We were talking about geofencing, which is unique to e-scooters, and we inform people how to interact with those geofences when they encounter them, because many riders do not know what to do the first time they are on an e-scooter.  How to park properly is another aspect covered in this regard.  As was mentioned, there are four types of parking: free floating; virtual docking; hard docking; and the lock-to-Bluetooth tethering cables.  This aspect of training concerns what to do in the context of all those parking solutions.  Another aspect is how to ride safely.  Beginner mode is a slower speed than what the national average would be to allow new users to get used to training at that speed on private lands away from roads and cycle lanes.  They can get a feel for the e-scooter first before going elsewhere.</p> <p>  Touching on the comments made previously, regarding the content we are using, we are engaging with the Road Safety Association, RSA, and different disability groups to highlight, from their perspective, how to interact with vulnerable road users and other transport modes and vehicles, such as bikes and lorries.  E-scooters have a unique blind spot in respect of bikes, and I wish to highlight that aspect.  Not only will we be teaching that from our point of view, but the Irish School of Excellence will be teaching those driving schools how to spot an e-scooter from the perspective that is unique to a bike as well.</p></speech>

Generally, there are two groups of in-person training.  There are the targeted in-person training sessions, where a specific community is picked and go out to them.  Before we launch, we will engage with transition-year-type programmes and aspects like that in a local area.  We will seek to get training brought into the curriculum prior to our launch.  That is the targeted training aimed at those aged 16 to 18.  Additionally, there are also general training days that we might do in a town square on Saturday and Sunday mornings in the three or four weeks pre-launch.  We will seek to do that in every town and city in which we launch.  The only place people will be able to use these e-scooters before we launch will be in a ring-fenced area, which will have promotion, hand-outs, all the guidelines potential riders need to know and hi-visibility vests and helmets.  Those are the sorts of things we wish to provide to people to ensure they ride scooters in the safest way possible.</p> <p>  It is also important to remember that this is not just a one-off thing that we will just do before we launch or for a month or two afterwards.  It must be continuous.  We are nearing the two-year mark now in some of our UK-based operations and we are continuing to do these training days and demonstrations.  We have one seaside location which it seems is going to be very popular again this summer, so we are already planning how many training days we need to do there and trying to ascertain that we get enough people to attend.</p></speech>

Talking about safety in the context of this amending legislation, some of the key things to consider include scalability, and that applies to some of the innovations we talked about in respect of camera-based pavement detection, and the communication of safety measures to private e-scooters as well.  Training is something that we, as responsible operators, provide as standard and as a matter of course to our users, as the committee has heard.  If we are considering how that is translated into national legislation, it also applies to private e-scooters.  There might be different answers if two or three retailers were on the panel regarding what they are going to offer their customers buying products over the counter, which is an important consideration.  Ultimately, that ends up in a situation where it is necessary to ensure that most of these requirements are written into formal tendering or procurement processes undertaken by local authorities.  That is intended to ensure when we set about bidding on services that there is a focus on safety in those responses submitted and a requirement on those tendering to commit to a certain number of in-person training sessions and-or mandatory in-app training and whatever else.</p></speech>

I have a few quick questions.  Staying with the power and speed of these e-scooters, the legislation provides for an upper speed limit of 25 km/h.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  The legislation also provides for a power rating of 250 W.  Again, what are the witnesses' views on this point?  It is a big issue for us.  We have covered everything else, so in the time remaining, these are the two of the key components of the legislation that I see in need of further examination.

The reason we asked for a higher power rating concerns durability in hilly terrain.  We do not want to have situations where lower-powered e-scooters cannot go up certain hills.  It is problematic because it is a safety issue.  It would also prevent feature innovation in respect of safety technology.  Only two countries in Europe have 250 W as a power standard.  None has done that though primary legislation, but through secondary legislation or as a legacy from bikes and e-bikes.  Those jurisdictions still allow operators with larger vehicles to operate.  Therefore, we recommend taking an approach similar to France, which allows unlimited wattage but where there are restrictions on the permissible speed and acceleration, or adopting what is done in markets like Spain and allowing a higher rating of 500 W or 750 W.</p></speech>

We agree with the 25 km/h upper limit but we can, as mentioned, regulate the speed in specific areas of the city so that it is a reduced speed in a highly pedestrianised zone where a 10 km/h or 15 km/h limit is maybe more appropriate.  A speed of 25 km/h should be the upper limit.  In regard to the wattage, we recommend a minimum of 500 W.  I am based in San Francisco and the e-scooters certainly struggle to make it up some of the hills so really a 500 W minimum level allows for riders to go on varied terrain without encountering difficulty in making it up a hill.  As mentioned, there is an important distinction between the motor watt limit and speed.  Those are not the same thing.  Even if the wattage is 750 W, the speed can be kept at 25 km/hour or less.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Will O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#M01200"><p>Some 25 km/h is perfect and in line with international norms but a 250 W limit is too low.  There has been an industry effort in getting this changed.  It needs to be at a minimum of 500 W.  We are looking at 1,000 W, as is the case in countries like Estonia and Finland or the French model where it is uncapped but speed is limited.  It is about hills where this can be a real problem.  The problem is that if it is 250 W and the e-scooter is not enjoyable to use, people simply will not use them and then we will not get the modal shift which is the reason we are here in the first place talking about reducing the number of car journeys.</p> <p>  In the two countries that have 250 W, Portugal and Sweden, it is openly flaunted.  Other problems arise because if there is an accident and insurance is involved, although the operators all have insurance or the riders are insured, the insurer might not pay out on a claim to a user because the operator was breaking the claim.  That is what happens in these markets where there is 250 W.  The operators openly flaunt it.  There could be exposure on insurance.</p></speech>

Depending on where they are coming from, it is either because they see what is happening at the moment, which is essentially unregulated usage all over towns and cities, or because there are clear sustainability benefits.  Those sustainability benefits are only delivered if this is regulated as a viable transport alternative.  On speeds, the current gross speed of 25 km/h is great.  We would be happy with 20 km/h but we really could not live with a speed of about 12 km/h.  That does not work.  Being completely transparent on power, we would not want to but could live with 250 W.  We would prefer it to be 500 W but between the two, the speed completely undermines the aim of the service if we get into those low teens.  For us, speed is good at 25 km/h and we would still be at 20 km/h.  We could live with 250 W but would prefer 500 W.</p></speech>

It seems he brought in e-scooters.  It is now going to be firmed up in legislation.  What has he learned, given that he was on the other side of the fence for a period?  In terms of the roll-out of the changes in the UK, what has he learned in terms of the legislation?</p></speech>

I was there for 12 years, which was a long time.  It is fair to say that when we brought in the trials, we did it quickly because of Covid-19.  Many people were uneasy about this new mode being introduced into 52 areas across England.  We found that cynicism was set aside.  We saw a modal shift from the private car and taxi of a third.  We saw that safety was comparable with bicycles both in terms of the inherent safety of the vehicle and how those vehicles are ridden by users.  We saw that people used them for valuable journeys, and not just for joy rides and not just for fun.  They were going to school, college and education.  We saw that over-regulation can kill the service.  If you have overly strict geofencing in an area of speed limits kicking in and no-go areas, it is confusing for the user and becomes less safe, ironically.  We saw that it is crucial to have standards around the vehicles themselves.  I would urge members to look at the vehicle standards that will come out in the UK and that existed for the trials in the UK.  They were introduced by the German federal government.  I urge members to look at batteries as a safety feature-----</p></speech>

The prize here is not just for e-scooters.  It is for wider micromobility.  If in primary you set a speed limit and keep a broad set of choices for the future, because you have powered personal transporters, PPTs, in the secondary, then put a speed limit in, perhaps a maximum, where you do not want to go above a certain maximum.  The devil is in the detail of the secondary because it allows you to be innovators in the last mile delivery space, for example, where you see people on e-cargo bikes, where you have to have pedals and have to put some effort in and it goes a 250 W maximum-----</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Duncan Robertson, general manager, Ireland and the UK, Dott; Mr. Matthew Pencharz, head of public policy for the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, Voi; Ms Aisling Dunne, head of policy, Ireland, Bolt; Ms Jean Andrews, policy director, Ireland and the UK, Superpedestrian; and Ms Jessica Hall, head of Ireland operations, TIER Mobility.  I thank them for their patience.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful that domestic law could be applied to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are also reminded of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement and any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams, prior to making a contribution, to confirm  they are on the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to confine their contributions to approximately three minutes because we are time limited.  I call on Mr. Robertson to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Dott is a European micromobility operator and safely operates shared e-scooter schemes in more than 35 European cities.  We are pleased to see the legislative process moving ahead in Ireland and are excited by the possibility to bring Dott&rsquo;s e-scooter technology to Dublin and beyond.</p> <p>  Dott is a safety first e-scooter provider.  We established an Irish safety advisory board, which includes groups representing vulnerable road users, the visually impaired, the business community and transport researchers.  The introduction of e-scooters on Irish roads has generated valid concerns among the disability community about the continuing safety of people with disabilities.  Our safety board was established to ensure the voices of disabled pedestrians and those with mobility needs are understood by providers.  Dott is happy to share any of the board&rsquo;s feedback with the committee should it be helpful.</p> <p>  Dott has developed technology and research partnerships with companies such as See.Sense and Luna, as well as the University of Salford, which focus on improving safety for vulnerable road users.  Through our partnerships, we are able to deliver first-hand data and insights about accident hot spots and the effectiveness of safety measures.  Our operations across Europe enable us to draw on a broad range of experience, research and case studies to constantly help improve the safety and experiences for riders and the public.</p> <p>  I know the misuse of e-scooters is a concern.  In managing illegal riding on footpaths and dangerous driving, we use unique e-scooter licence plates to identify individual riders and make it easier for the public to report bad driving and misuse, theft or misplaced scooters.  We ban users who violate our safety policies.  We understand the committee has concerns in these areas in terms of the use of private e-scooters but from the perspective of creating a shared-scooter scheme, flexible regulation is very important.  Therefore, we recommend keeping the primary legislation as high level as possible.</p> <p>  With regard to speed, we welcome the committee&rsquo;s focus on the regulation of speed.  Dott previously wrote to the Minister of Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to recommend a number of mandatory safety measures, which included an upper-speed limit of 25 km/h.  Our e-scooters would be capped in order that they could not go above this speed.  We would also create gradually-reducing speed zones and adjustable speed limits in areas with high numbers of pedestrians or where riders need to drive extra carefully, for example, near schools.</p> <p>  If managed well, with the right safety measures in place, e-scooter schemes can reduce congestion, increase mobility and make our cities more liveable.  One of the benefits of being second movers into the micromobility and e-scooter space is that Ireland can learn from the mistakes that have been made, and resolved, in other cities throughout Europe and the world.  Dott will continue to engage with all the key stakeholders as Ireland moves forward in this space and share our insights and learnings from our operations abroad.</p></speech>

We are Europe&rsquo;s leading micromobility operator, offering shared light electric vehicles, EVs, in 70 European towns and cities in 11 countries.  Voi's vision is towns and cities made for living, free from congestion, noise and pollution.  Voi's founding belief is to work with towns and cities to help deliver their policy goals and deliver safe, sustainable micromobility to everyone.  Every scheme in every town is delivered in partnership with our towns and cities.  We have had zero rogue launches, where vehicles have appeared seemingly from nowhere without permission from the local authorities.  These operators have sadly given micromobility a poor reputation.  Voi is the antithesis of this.  Voi has worked with EY on our life cycle carbon analysis and succeeded in driving down those emissions by some 85% in a year.  Since January 2020, our service has been certified as carbon neutral.  Working with our supply chain partners, we committed, at COP26, to become net climate-positive by 2030 without relying on carbon offsets.  As Europe&rsquo;s largest micromobility provider, Voi has experience operating in very different regulatory environments, from the more free-market Nordic approach to the highly regulated trial environment in the UK that members heard about in an earlier session.  With four years' operating experience, Voi has learned the lessons of what works and what does not, and how to deliver the very best service whatever the regulatory environment.</p> <p>  Voi would bring these learnings to Ireland to deliver the best scheme that meets the policy outcomes of modal shift away from single occupancy cars to reduce congestion and pollution and meet the carbon mitigation targets set both locally and nationally.  Voi's operational experience has made ours the most efficient service, leading the industry, ensuring maximum utilisation of our vehicles, to deliver a safe, sustainable, convenient and affordable service to lure people out of cars.  We are working with visually impaired charities, such as the Thomas Pocklington Trust and the Royal National Institute of Blind People, RNIB, in the UK and the Norwegian Association of the Blind and Partially Sighted, to eliminate the impact of our service on other vulnerable road users.  We have co-designed our parking racks with the RNIB in order to make them more noticeable for those who are visually impaired or blind.  Voi is also working with the RNIB to be the first operator to test a sound the vehicle makes while moving.  We are also working with Irish technology company Luna on a pavement riding detection system, which is currently being piloted in Stockholm and Northampton.  Across all our markets, Voi has seen 14% of our rides replacing car trips.  In the UK, which has similar levels of car dependency to Ireland, we have seen 39% of rides replacing car trips.  The legislation currently being considered with the establishment of a new vehicle category for powered personal transporters, through the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021, is a huge step forward for Irish transport, helping towns and cities to vastly reduce their carbon emissions, pollution and congestion through modal shift away from car use, as well as helping to support the recovery of public transport with micromobility acting as a true first and last mile solution.  We commend the Government and the committee on their work on this legislation. After listening to the previous session, we largely agree with most of our operator colleagues on the Bill and regulations.  We believe it should be progressed as quickly as possible to empower towns and cities to set the finer detail in their tender, as appropriate, for the individual conditions.  </p></speech>

Bolt's mission is to help build cities for people, not cars, with enough on-demand transport options available so that people do not need to own a private vehicle.  We are currently providing sustainable mobility solutions to more than 100 million customers in 45 countries across Europe and Africa.  The services available include taxis, electric bikes, scooters, car sharing, food delivery and fast grocery delivery.  In Ireland, we currently operate our taxi dispatch service in Dublin and we plan to roll it out in Cork in the coming weeks.  We intend to considerably expand our transport offering here, with electric bikes and car sharing both potential schemes for this year.  Obviously, when this legislation is in place, we plan to offer a scooter service.  Our approach works best where we can provide a multimodal offering in order that our users can access multiple forms of transport easily through one app.  They might choose to cycle or scoot out, perhaps picking up public transport on their way and then perhaps to get a taxi home in the evening, all the while avoiding private vehicle car use.</p> <p>  Our analysis shows that there is no time to lose in developing these sustainable transport solutions.  Consumer analysis that we conducted with Bounce Insights last week shows that with current alternative options, only one in ten Irish car owners see it as possible to give up their private vehicle in the next five years.  Six in ten Irish car owners use their vehicle every day, and eight in ten use their vehicle for recreational journeys that are the most suitable to making the switch.  There is a growing willingness to switch if options are available, with rising fuel costs, environmental concerns and concerns over parking and congestion at the forefront.  The time is right to switch.</p> <p>  We welcome the recent decision of the Cabinet to approve a range of amendments which will soon come before the committee for its consideration.  With regard to powered personal transporters, PPTs, we particularly commend the Minister on listening to the industry and advocacy groups, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, and the NCBI, and proposing to remove the maximum power and maximum speed provisions from the Bill, as contained in section 16.  We agree that these provisions are best dealt within the secondary legislation, which will allow the Minister to consider best practices at present, but also maintain the ability to have flexibility as the technology changes.  I hope the committee also agrees with this approach.  We are available to any questions members may have on it.</p> <p>  In terms of areas for further consideration, Bolt hopes to engage with all parties as the regulations are drafted to ensure that the future shared electric scooter schemes truly prioritise multimodality.  We recently undertook some research with the Norwegian Institute of Transport Economics, T&Oslash;I.  We released research which shows that 60% more users will shift from taxis to scooters for short journeys if nudged in that direction.  The implications of the findings are significant and reinforce our view that through the provision of a range of services, people easily can be encouraged to make that change.  Across Ireland, nearly half of all car trips are less than 4 km, with this figure even higher in cities.  Figures show that 40% of Bolt taxi trips taken in Dublin in the month of February were 4 km or less.  That is an area where users can be encouraged to transition to taking a more active mode of transport, such as electric scooters and electric bikes.  Ultimately, one issue unites all the operators that appear before the committee today, as well as members of the committee, namely, a desire to help transform the transport offerings in Irish cities and do so in a safe and sustainable manner.  We might disagree on who can do it best but we are striving towards the same goal.  I look forward to answering the members' questions.  </p></speech>

I wish to introduce Superpedestrian briefly and then share a few thoughts that may help this dialogue.  Superpedestrian is the thoughtful mobility company.  We were spun out of MIT, the world-renowned research institute in the United States nearly a decade ago.  Superpedestrian now operates shared mobility fleets using our LINK e-scooter in 60 cities across ten countries.  Our smallest fleet is 25 scooters; our largest is 5,000.  We also hold two thirds of all the patents in the micromobility sector.  We have thought a lot about safety, which is why we are pleased to participate in constructive dialogue about e-scooter safety and technology.  I would like to explore three themes with the committee that will help this discussion: whether shared e-scooters help reduce car use; how we can make sure that e-scooters are safe; and what we can do about pavement riding and other dangerous rider behaviours.</p> <p>  Do shared e-scooters help reduce car use?  The short answer is "Yes".  We operate the shared e-scooter trial zone in Nottingham in the UK, which is a city similar in design to many of our Irish cities.  It is the most popular programme in the UK.  In January this year, our Nottingham users travelled 150,000 km on our shared e-scooters.  We know from our customer surveys that at least 30% of all rides replace short car journeys.  Our shared e-scooters replaced some 45,000 km of short car journeys in Nottingham in January.  This demonstrates that, when given the choice, many people choose to replace short car trips with e-scooter journeys, even in the winter.  If the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 is enacted, Irish people will soon be able to choose to travel by e-scooter rather than by car.  This will help to reduce congestion and improve air quality in our towns and cities, which benefits everyone - not just those who use e-scooters.  We commend the approach in the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 of introducing a proposed maximum speed of 25 km/h, which aligns with the maximum speed permitted for e-scooters in most EU states.  E-scooters travel on the road alongside motor vehicles.  If the speed difference between these different vehicles is not minimised, riders will be placed at serious risk.  Of course, 25 km/h is a maximum permitted speed.  Shared micromobility operators can control and enforce lower speeds that are set in collaboration with local councils, through no-go and go-slow zones using geofencing technology.  For example, in Nottingham, our scooters can only travel at 8 km/h in the designated go-slow zones, but can travel at 25 km/h in other areas.</p><p>How can we ensure the vehicles are safe?  As one of the last countries in Europe to legislate for e-scooters, Ireland can benefit from recent advancements in scooter design and technology and require the highest standards, setting a global benchmark for safety.  We commend the recent proposed amendments by the Minister to the Road Traffic and Roads Bill to ensure that certain characteristics of PPTs may be varied in the future.  Companies like ours are constantly investing in new technologies to enhance safe micromobility offerings and the Minister's proposed amendments should help to future-proof the legislation to ensure Ireland can benefit from these advances.</p><p> We believe safety starts with the vehicle.  That is why we took two years and invested much in developing the safest electric scooter possible.  One key feature is our patented vehicle intelligence system, which we call VI.  This runs 1,000 vehicle health checks every second and fine-tunes performance to avoid failures.  VI also helps us to avoid battery fires by constantly checking battery health, including temperature of individual cells.  In more than 16 million km of operation, we have never had a battery fire, an issue that has recently affected other popular shared electric scooter models.  We call VI the "seat belt" moment for e-scooters.  Just as seat belts are mandatory for cars in Ireland, we recommend that all electric scooters in Ireland should be fitted with an active safety system, like VI, as standard to ensure vehicle safety.</p><p> What can we do about pavement riding and other dangerous rider behaviours?  There has been huge investment and innovation by the micromobility industry to solve some of its early challenges, and Ireland is well placed to take advantage of these new methods and technologies that are proven to ensure safe shared schemes.  As an example, pavement riding and associated dangerous rider behaviour remains a key area of concern for many cities, from Chicago to Paris.  Superpedestrian has developed a new technology that can detect and correct pavement riding and other dangerous behaviours, such as wrong-way riding and intoxicated riding, in real time.  If we imagine a rider trying to ride along the pavement on busy O&rsquo;Connell Street, our system would detect this immediately and automatically bring the vehicle to a safe stop.  It is the first system to do so and we call it Pedestrian Defense.</p><p> This legislation is a really exciting opportunity for Ireland to enhance its transport networks and I look forward to seeing shared e-scooters operating safely on our streets in the near future.  I thank the committee for its time and I am very happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I am head of operations for Ireland at TIER Mobility.  TIER is Europe's largest e-scooter operator, with live operations in over 180 cities, including operating Ireland&rsquo;s first live electric scooter trial at Dublin City University, DCU.</p> <p>  My role at TIER is all about operations and how a successful e-scooter scheme is designed, devised and implemented.  I have overseen the launch of e-bikes and e-scooters in York and London, and more recently our trial on the DCU campus, which has been operational for about nine months.</p> <p>  As head of operations, I come to the committee today grounded in the knowledge of how a successful e-scooter scheme works from an operational perspective.  I know first-hand how to put in place the safest possible e-scooter operation in a practical way and how important partnerships like our Ireland safety board are to the success of any e-scooter scheme.</p> <p>  TIER watched the committee's previous hearing with interest, when we saw representatives of some great organisations speak with real knowledge and insight about their concerns with the current legislation, and the difficulties that e-scooters can pose if not managed correctly.  We welcome such thoughtful scrutiny and the work of the Chair and the committee in highlighting these challenges.  We also welcome the prospect of working together to solve these challenges.  It is this drive to face such challenges that led us to partner with two organisations that have appeared before the committee previously, namely, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the NCBI.  They sit on our Ireland safety board, along with the Disability Federation of Ireland, Walk21 and Age Friendly Ireland.</p> <p>  This safety board has been in place since the beginning of 2021 and has met six times in substantive sessions organised around themes to discuss very real challenges posed by electric scooters in an Irish context.  Like the witnesses at the previous meeting, I have seen what bad e-scooter regulatory frameworks look like, and specifically cities where there is little shape on an e-scooter scheme or where unlimited operators were allowed to operate.  Such schemes are chaotic, messy and overly competitive and ultimately damage the image of e-scooters for everybody.  That is not the type of thing we want.  We do not want e-scooters without adequate regulation and instead we want to introduce services to Ireland, provided we can do so in a safe and sustainable way, learning the lessons from these hearings, from our own safety board hearings and from other cities.</p> <p>  Ireland is in an advantageous position and there is potentially a second mover advantage here.  This country can now see what good e-scooter schemes look like in many jurisdictions and can also see what bad practice looks like.  Ireland can ultimately very much shape a safe, sustainable scheme that works for everybody in the community.  Ultimately, we want Ireland to have the safest e-scooter schemes in the world from day one.</p> <p>  I am responsible for the operation of our live trial on the DCU campus and I am proud of our results and progress to date.  We have had e-scooters operational for more than nine months now, maintaining high levels of parking compliance thanks to our camera positioning system solution, which ensures centimetre-level accuracy on parking.  This means scooters stay in tightly-defined parking bays and do not pose a hazard to anyone on the campus.  We have also had a 100% safety record at the university and we feel that things like our foldable helmets being included with each journey is part of the reason for this.  Most of all, we feel our DCU trial and our Ireland safety board demonstrate a real commitment to Ireland, and it is one that we are keen to solidify in the years ahead with a commitment to safety always being at the core of what we do.</p> <p>  Once again, I thank the Chair and committee.  I look forward to the questions.</p></speech>

My concern is that we will have some control and a degree of standardisation and professionalism with shared schemes but, potentially, will have chaos arising from the private market, with one having an impact on the other in respect of how this new regime hits the ground.  My question is not for the shared schemes <i>per se</i>but what would the witnesses advise the Government to be aware of, put in place or address for the private schemes or for the market more generally?  Ms Andrews spoke to the seat belt moment in respect of standards but I am sure the private market standards are not the same as those for the shared schemes.</p><p>When we speak about minimum standards for e-scooters, do we need to address education programmes or engagement?  We have spoken about programmes in primary or secondary schools across the country.  Is this about enforcement when both shared schemes and formal regulation for the general population go live?  Should we see members of the Garda becoming more visible in enforcing rules around these vehicles?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1278" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Duncan Robertson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#P00800"><p>It is a great question and it is clearly a significant issue.  I work predominantly work in the UK and we are seeing a similar issue with private scooters currently being illegal and the British Government is in a similar position in trying to work out what to do.  One of the key things to note is that the standard of shared e-scooters is incredibly high and we are able to do maintenance to ensure the vehicles are safe and keep an eye on how batteries are acting.  All these actions are part of a suite that makes shared scooters so good.  We should ensure that some of those elements come across into private scooters, including making sure a top speed and maximum weight is legislated for.  Good quality lighting must also be assured so that vehicles and people can be seen.</p> <p>  The other advantage of introducing shared scooters is in the training schemes we can offer on the street or in the app.  That is online, as well as going into schools and bringing people to our warehouses and educating them that way.  A person may be on a shared scooter but the education transfers to private scooters as well.  We would bring an element of formalised training to a much wider audience.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned enforcement.</p><p>In terms of enforcement we have seen in the UK that police enforcement is useful initially to make sure the rules are understood by the general public, and that it usually tapers off.  That is probably the best way to do it without consuming too much resource.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Pencharz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#Q00200"><p>As members might expect, the operators are going to largely agree on this.  I agree with what Mr. Robertson just said about differentiation between the shared schemes and private e-scooters.  We are regulated.  Local authorities or governments can control where we operate with slow speed zones and normal speed zones, where the riders may park their vehicles and so on.  We believe private e-scooters are also a tool when it comes to decongesting and decarbonising our cities.  It is very important that they are seen to be on a level playing field with the shared e-scooters.  Some of the regulations should be very simple when it comes to standards, for example power outage, power rating and, more important, speed, so that these vehicles are essentially type approved in the same way as the shared e-scooters are.  Members could look at some of our European neighbours.  The Germans have type approved their vehicles and the Department for Transport in the UK has type approved the trial scooters.  We believe that should be extended to private e-scooters in due course.  Insurance requirements should surely be the same for private e-scooters.  Registration plates for scooters in shared schemes have worked very well in the UK when it comes to enforcement and safety.  There should be a similar requirement for private e-scooters.  They are definitely part of the story and probably quite an important part.  However, it is very important that there is a level playing field and that regulations are the same for shared and for private.</p></speech>

A lot has been said on vehicle standards already.  About two weeks ago one of the large supermarket chains was selling electric scooters.  That is very worrying because there are potentially very low standards for the vehicles that are being sold there, putting a lot of riders and other road users around them in danger.  There is a need for high standards to be imposed for private use.  Awareness and education are needed for private vehicle users as well as for those using the shared scheme.  A lot of the operators run education schemes as people start using their scooters.  That obviously does not apply when someone is purchasing a scooter privately.  We would like to see the Road Safety Authority get involved.  Many scooter users will have provisional or full driving licences.  If as part of the provisional driving licence process and the theory test or the full driving licence test they are required to understand how and where to use a scooter and the dangers and responsibility that come with it, this would result in a good step-change in behaviour.</p> <p>  One of the most dangerous behaviours I see around the place, apart from not wearing sufficient high visibility gear - something on which the Road Safety Authority could raise awareness once they become legal - is tandem riding.  That often involves children, which is particularly worrying.</p></speech>

We have a patent pending for new technology to detect when there is more than one person on a scooter.  This is for the shared scheme.  In running the pilots for that, we have found that when we alert people that we are aware there are two people on the scooter, the dangers of it and the reasons it is a bad idea, they do not do it again.</p></speech>

From our perspective, when we speak to councils about their plans, they say that we are only at primary legislation at the moment, which is very macro, that they do not know the details and cannot progress with even considering how a shared scheme might look.  From an operator's perspective, we would love to see the Department working with the local authorities as the regulations are being drafted, facilitating the councils to commence their deliberations and work on the by-laws.</p><p>In that way, hopefully by very early next year, the councils might at least be in a position to start considering operators.</p><p> There is real urgency to private use, an issue the Chairman raised.  That is the element that is active.  People are operating in a legal lacuna, without any guidance.  There is also an urgency to trying to help people to make this modal shift.  We would love to see both elements progress in tandem with each other in order that there is not this stop-start-----</p></speech>

The RSA could potentially introduce a countrywide education programme such that anyone operating an e-scooter would need to go through training, whether online or offline.  We have done quite a lot in Nottingham, as I mentioned.  In the UK we operate billboards with messaging for riders about not riding on the pavement and about wearing a helmet, parking considerately, etc.  Operators can take on training to make people aware of how to ride safely.</p> <p>  I will make a final point about cycling infrastructure.  The Government has announced &euro;158 million in investment in cycling infrastructure in recent weeks or months, and that needs to be spent.  The draft legislation envisages that e-scooters will be treated as bicycles and permitted to use cycling infrastructure.  We all know that cycling infrastructure is not up to scratch not just in Ireland but in other places too.  There is now a lot of money to invest in cycling infrastructure to improve and to enhance it.  We talked earlier about pavement riding.  Often, much of the reason people ride e-scooters and bikes on the pavement is that they just do not feel safe on the road with other traffic.  Therefore, the sooner local authorities can spend that money and improve and enhance cycling infrastructure, the better and the sooner we will have a safer environment for not just e-scooter riders but also cyclists.</p></speech>

I will not repeat them.  The one thing I will add is that Ireland has the opportunity here to make shared scooters more attractive than private ones.  If the service is in a city that has great parking and is very accessible and stretches into the rural areas, there will be no need to buy a private-use scooter.  Therefore, if the Government goes properly at these shared schemes, it will reduce the requirement for people to buy private e-scooters.</p></speech>

We teased out a lot of them.  There is a lot of unanimity, it seems, among the operators on geofencing, not riding on footpaths, power limits, speed limits and so on.  I can see that this is a fast-moving technology that is being constantly upgraded.  I assume there is, if not a kind of EC mark-type product rating in the same way there is for toys and electrical goods, something for scooters, not that they would all necessarily be to the standard of the companies represented by the witnesses.  I would have thought, however, that something involving batteries, power and so on would have some basic electrical and CE-type mark.  I do not know that.  We should find that out.  I am not saying many scooters are well below the standard of the witnesses' robust machines that get many hours' and days' use by many different users, but I would be very worried if that were the case and if private companies and supermarkets could just sell anything with no regulation.</p> <p>  I am interested in some things we have not talked about so much.  There is the technological argument as to whether there should be a kind of black box recorder inside scooters that records information on what people are doing all the time and sends it up into the cloud.  There is the issue of insurance.  We are talking about hire schemes versus private use.  The latter sounds like it will be the harder to regulate because the witnesses' companies have users, they are registered, the companies can see what they are doing, the technology will probably be of a higher spec and so on.  Should people need licences and insurance?  Is there a need for a kind of black box recorder?  How can we stop the people riding scooters while intoxicated?  Can alcohol be detected through people's pores?  Should riders have to wear special gloves or breathe into something before they start riding their scooters?  These are not the biggest issues in the world, but maybe e-scooter schemes just do not work between the more high-risk times of 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.  I do not know.</p> <p>  The witnesses are the guys and ladies all the expertise here.  In cities, what has worked best and what has worked really badly?  The witnesses will all tell me there has never been a problem anywhere, but clearly there have been problems.  As previous speakers have said, we are coming to this a little later than some places.  What has worked particularly badly but has been resolved?  What has worked well?  What should we watch out for?  The one question I do not think anybody has asked is this: typically, what is the optimal number of operators in an environment?  Should it be two or ten?  The witnesses will all say that if they get the contract, they would want it to be just them, but would it be better if there were four, six, eight or ten companies operating?  I presume they are not interchangeable.  Maybe some of them will buy one another up.  We have heard from representatives of nine different schemes.  Everybody seems very professional.  Everybody seems excellent.  That is all to their credit.  However, I am not sure the four Dublin authorities or Limerick City and County Council will offer nine operators the opportunity to compete with one another.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  Those questions are to any and all of the witnesses.</p></speech>

Certainly, Voi does record driver behaviour: speeds, where they have gone, etc.  That is on our system in the cloud, which gives lots of interesting data insights on driver behaviour to transport planners as to what the most popular routes are and where, for example, cycling infrastructure could be put in.  It gives quite interesting information to the people thinking about modal shift.</p> <p>  As for driving licences, this will be, for once, a moment of disagreement among us because I think one of my colleagues said she quite liked the idea of driving licences.  Like somebody on the earlier session, Voi does not believe that a driving licence, certainly a provisional licence, is proof of roadworthiness or road sense.  However, it certainly is a block to modal shift.  It gets people on the road to car ownership.  Surely, the longer you delay a younger person getting a driving licence, the more you will embed the modal shift behaviours of not owning your own car and single-occupancy journeys.</p> <p>  As for intoxication, I do not yet know of a technology that can detect alcohol intoxication through handlebars.</p><p>What Voi can certainly do is a kind of reaction test in the app off certain hours in order to see if the rider might be intoxicated and advise on connecting him or her to other modes of transport.  It is up to cities to decide the hours of operation.  In the markets that I look after in the UK, some markets are 24-7 and others are not.  The system is turned off at a particular time of night where there are levels of people who are more likely to be intoxicated.  That is up to the cities and an important message I would like to give is that every city is different and it is really up to them as to how they design the services, including the timings of operations.</p><p> When it comes to operators, Voi is very lucky in that we have a great number of exclusive licences in the UK.  What is keeping the number of operators fairly low is that these companies are going to invest to stay in that city.  If we have a concession for two, three or four years, we will invest to really improve and optimise that service through putting in the racks, for example, if that is what the city wants, integrating into the other transport providers to offer that multimodal operation if that is, for example, Dublin transport or Cork transport, or whatever the city transit authority is.  If one has many operators, there is inevitably going to be too much competition and a race to the bottom.  What one wants to see is operators competing, like we will all be competing for the licences when they come forward in Ireland, to offer the best service and technology offering, the best integration into other transport operators and the best partnerships with some of the bodies and civil society groups in Ireland&rsquo;s cities.</p><p> For that, the number of operators should be kept very low.  In Voi&rsquo;s view, it would be one or two.  When one gets more than that number, one falls into the danger of potentially too much competition, too much confusion for users and more difficulties for the cities to manage us as a transport partner.</p></speech>

It is good for the users and ultimately this is about providing a good service for the users to get them to make that shift.  We have seen in some of the trials in the UK where there is just one provider that there is no incentive to provide a good service at an affordable rate and that there is no motivation because they have a captive market.</p> <p>  In general, as is the case across business the world over, competition is a good thing.  For somewhere like Dublin, especially if the councils are going to work together and do a joined-up scheme, it would be better for users there if one did not have operators for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council, DCC.  We would therefore be advocating that the councils work together and do a joint tender or process and that this would be the best for the users but probably not as good for the operators because there is less opportunity to service Dublin then.  </p> <p>  If they do that, there needs to be three or perhaps four operators who cover Dublin.  That provides that level of competition and the need to provide a strong service. </p> <p>  One of the things that my colleague mentioned there was that if one was the sole provider, one is more incentivised to provide infrastructure such as charging racks.  Bolt provides charging racks in a number of cities and we have just launched them in recent months.  They act as an incentive for parking and while they are parked, they are also being charged.  This is a very efficient way to charge them without the need for an operations team to do it.  These are very easily installed and removed.  </p> <p>  The fact that one has competition should not be a reason why one could not do that in a city and make that investment.  Bolt&rsquo;s perspective also is that we are not just here for six months, a year, two or three years, but that this is a long-term commitment to the country to provide a range of services and we see competition as a positive. </p> <p>  I do not want to repeat some of the things but I do agree-----</p></speech>

If they fail it, what we do in other cities is that we nudge them towards a taxi or a safer mode of transport.  The value of having the services continuing to operate in the evening is that they provide an affordable way home for people who have to work shifts or must work at night and that is what we are trying to do.

Competition is healthy, good and gives the best service for users and allows the councils to have a level of oversight as well.  One does not want to have too many operators and perhaps three or four is probably the sweet spot in the Dublin context but that is for others to decide.</p> <p>  On intoxicated riding, I mentioned the Pedestrian Defense technology that we have, which detects whether a scooter is on the pavement.  It builds on the global positioning system, GPS, technology and the geofencing technology that is already on the scooter.  We are actually building new sensors into our scooters so that we can understand at all times not only where the scooter is but how it is being ridden.</p></speech>

The floodgates opened with nine different operators and scooters everywhere, and there was no regulation.  Paris then retracted, had a tender process, so we already are ahead of the game in terms of listening, learning and adapting in the Irish market.</p> <p>  One of the other kind of approaches that can lead to a lack of order in a city is when scooters can park anywhere.  We promote mandatory parking bays and this could be combined with free-floating scooters in the rural areas, where there is less of a trip hazard issue.  Getting that parking right means that the cities are then orderly.  Another flag here is that GPS is not that accurate, especially when there are very tall buildings.  Here we deploy a camera-positioning system which uses a scan of one&rsquo;s surroundings to anchor one in the exact spot on which one is standing, as we have been out to that parking spot beforehand and have mapped the area and have made a 3-D model of it.  If one deploys clever technologies like that in those really dense areas, one knows exactly where the scooters are parked at all times rather than the GPS signal bouncing between the tall buildings. </p></speech>

That is a critical one.</p> <p>  The second one is parking, which has just been mentioned.  The chaos that we have seen before in dockless bikes and scooters in the past is something that we do not want to repeat.  The technology is now out there to ensure the people can park in parking bays.</p> <p>  As far as I am aware, in all of the trials that have gone on the UK that started with completely free-floating, if it they have not moved to dedicated parking, they certainly are moving towards it because it is the best way to ensure orderliness and tidiness within our cities.  </p> <p>  The third point is that competition is 100% required in a city.  Having one operator breeds complacency, the price goes up and it becomes a weaker quality product.</p><p>Most cities can deal with at least two operators, so that is crucial.  The third point is the long-term aspect of this enterprise.  We cannot do investments that have too much of a short-term view and look at contracts that are less than a year.  As has been previously mentioned, we need to be able to commit to three or four years down the line so that we can make sure we have high-quality warehouses.  We often need a lease that is at least three years long.  We need to make sure that we can employ staff and give people certainty.  Having a longer-term contract is essential as part of doing shared scooter schemes.  They are four learnings from my rather long and bruising experience in the world of dockless scooters.</p></speech>

I welcome all the witnesses and thank them for being here.  I will start with Mr. Pencharz.  In fairness to him, he is probably no stranger to parliamentary committees.  To be fair to him also, e-scooter safety is something he has pioneered in the context of his company.  He has an app that has been very good, which I have looked at in advance of today's meeting.  I am very impressed by it.  It is unique in that it tells people how to use e-scooters.  First, could I ask him about making the app more widely available and how he would promote its use?  Some people who might want to learn more might be a bit reticent about using the app.</p></speech>

It sounds like the Senator is good to go.  Before they go on their first ride, they have to go through an e-training module and every time they fire up the app there are reminders about pavement riding or twin riding and all the issues that we have raised.</p></speech>

One of the great things about micromobility is that we can deploy very quickly.  I have visited Dublin a few times and I know that building a new tram line can take a while and is quite disruptive.  Deploying micromobility can be done extremely quickly.  Most of us here on this panel could deploy it within a few months, once we buy a tender and have permission to operate.  The geofences can be tweaked very quickly.  To echo my colleague's point, our experience in the UK is that nothing is perfect, and it can always be improved at the edges.  That could mean tweaking some of the slow-ride zones and mandatory parking zones.  For various reasons, there may be a need to bring in new slow-ride zones, but the truth is that some may need to be taken out because they are unsafe due to the way that the ride is attracting the traffic.</p></speech>

It impressed me that the operation of the scheme was suspended from a safety point of view between Christmas and New Year.  What have the learnings been from Bristol?  There were 90 accidents over a four-week period.  We can learn from the experience in the UK in terms of safety and rider behaviour.  Could Mr. Pencharz give us an insight into what he has learned from Bristol as an example of a pilot?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Pencharz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#T00700"><p>Most of the accidents the Senator mentioned were on private e-scooters.  The shared schemes are quite safe.  Mr. Padden stated, and it is our experience as well as an operator, that e-scooter safety on the shared schemes is broadly the same as cycling.  It is a pretty safe form of transport.  In fact, we have a serious accident approximately every 28,000 rides.  It is essentially a safe form of transport.</p> <p>  Bristol is a great example of where micromobility in England and the UK has delivered a transformational experience.  There was a question about where it has gone wrong for micromobility.  We had the example of too many operators, too many scooters, too much clutter, too much chaos and it was not regulated enough.  We could also point to examples in the UK where it is the exact opposite: where the schemes are not big enough, so we do not get the modal shift or there is not enough density of vehicles, because it needs to be convenient to get people out of their cars.  People need to get their phone out and know they can get a scooter within a two-minute walk.  Once it gets to four, five or six minutes, it becomes inconvenient, and people are going to get back in their car.  That is another example of finding the sweet spot of not going to chaos, which has been seen in some markets, for example we heard about Paris earlier, and perhaps in some of the Nordic countries recently.  If there is an overly onerous regulatory environment, you do not get the convenience for the users, which means you do not get the benefits for the service.</p></speech>

I have been watching the pilot in Bristol with interest.  I congratulate him on his proactivity.</p> <p>  My colleagues and I have met with various people and engaged on safety, which is an issue of great concern to me.  In Mr. Robertson's presentation, he mentioned case studies in London and Barcelona as part of his work in this area.  It is fair to say that from a carbon-neutral point of view, a climate-change perspective and in terms of a modal shift in transportation, we are all on board and welcome this new type of public transport.  Based on today's meeting, we are very much moving towards that shared model.  In the context of the population bases outside Dublin, is there sufficient population to have competition in a shared e-scooter regime?  I wish to ask him about his perspective in respect of the case studies in London and Barcelona and from the enforcement and safety perspective.  I am focusing on safety because I have bought the argument from the point of view of sustainability and other factors.  How can we take the safety perspective from the learnings from Barcelona and London and adapt it to Ireland?</p></speech>

We have three operators there, so it is very competitive.  Some of the key learnings there include the significant engagement with stakeholders, including the police.  We work very closely with the police.  We have contacts with the key central police functions within the metropolitan police service but also in regional areas within London.  If there are any issues from our side or<i>vice versa </i>then they have phone numbers and email addresses for all of our operations team who are on-call 24 hours a day, so they can come to us at any stage, and we can work with them.  The kind of things that we do include dealing with cases if someone is reported for misbehaviour, for example.  When we learn of the incident, we can work out who they were by the journey that they were taking based on the time report and we can call them up and either explain that they were doing something wrong or if it was appropriate we could ban them from the system.  We have done that on numerous occasions.  It is something that we are not afraid to do because it is essential for maintaining high standards.<br/><br/>Smaller scale operations are doable.  We have worked on university campuses and with sports grounds as well, and large employers.  We look at each market specifically.  We go there, assess it and we work with either the local authority or the private landowner and establish what the service might look like and how it would best serve the people it is supposed to serve.  We have got many ways of working within larger cities, but also much smaller areas.<br/><br/>A point was made about training.  We teamed up with AA DriveTech in the UK to create an online module.  While we have in-app safety quizzes and safety reminders, the point of sale is the key area where we want to encourage people to understand the safety of aspects of riding a scooter.</p><p>We also have another module, which is freely accessible to anybody.  We promote it through our app.  We also promote it through our website.  We promote it more widely as well.  That would be useful for private riders, either our own or anyone else.</p></speech>

This is in the current draft of the Bill, but it proposed that it will be removed on Committee Stage.  We support the decision to remove it and to deal with that in regulations.  We would like to see it higher.  We think there is a key distinction between watt power and speed.  They sometimes mistakenly get linked.  However, they should not be, because of different terrain and different safety features that can come on the scooters which require watt power.</p></speech>

I think 25 km/h should be the upper limit and should be available only in streets where there are segregated cycle lanes.  If bikes are to travel at a certain speed and if a scooter was prohibited from travelling at that same speed----</p></speech>

While that would not be on paths, there can be interaction.  We are keen to see that at the lower end here as well, as appropriate.</p></speech>

We operate in Nottingham, as I mentioned, which has the same maximum speed.  The scooters observe an 8 km/h per hour speed in go-slow areas that are busy with pedestrians.  That works very well.  That is common across European jurisdictions.  If the scooter is in traffic with cars, the scooter should be able to keep up with traffic.  To go any slower, or not to have the capability for that maximum speed in traffic is dangerous.</p> <p>  On the wattage, I would agree with previous contributions.  I think the 250 W is too low for the scooters that we have today.  In order to be able to get up hills and to have the degree of pick-up that is needed for a safe ascension of a hill, in excess of 500 W and up to 1,000 W-----</p></speech>

The motor output power and the speeds are not synonymous.  The motor power is about having that pick-up and exhilaration, on a hill, for example.  It is important to have adequate power.  However, speeds can be capped.</p></speech>

An upper limit of 25 km/h enables the authorities to reduce that as a local level, if a council decides to do that.  On the wattage, an upper limit of 1,000 W allows for vehicles to improve over time and to not be capped by the legislation.</p></speech>

VOI was also one of the companies that wrote to the Minister.  It is important to disentangle power outage to speeds because they are completely separate things.  We operate in two hilly cities in England.  We have been talking about Bristol and also Bath.  If we were to have low-wattage vehicles there, they would arguably not be able to safely and reliably pick up speed while going up these steep hills.  I know that Cork is pretty hilly, so I can imagine that there would be a similar problem there if there were lower power outage machines------</p></speech>

I would suggest that there should be an upper limit on speed of 25 km/h per hour.  That can be changed at a local level as per city and the operators&rsquo; requirements, particularly over time.  Maybe it could be started in the city at a lower speed, as people are getting used to it, and then it can be increased.  The point that has been mentioned before is around the conflation of power outage and speed and acceleration.  They are not necessarily fully linked, and we need to be aware of that.  We can control the speed and we can control the acceleration, almost regardless of what power is.  However, we need a certain amount of power to be able to deliver on the speed and acceleration, particularly in hilly areas.  Therefore, I think that an upper limit of 1,000 W, but very much at least 500 W in power is needed.</p></speech>

I was in and out of the meeting.  I imagine that a lot has been dealt with.  There is a difficulty with personal versus the shared schemes.  Witnesses are talking about reduced speed in certain areas.  Are they talking about that being enforced by geo-fencing?  I keep using the example of my son who bought one of these.  Obviously, he does not have that restriction, so that is a difficulty for some from an enforcement point of view.</p> <p>  I imagine this has also been brought up, but if it has not could the witnesses comment on batteries and battery safety?  When my son bought it, I was actually very glad that it actually broke straight away, so that no one would be coming to me complaining about him.  I have not fixed it, but that is not because I am against e-scooters.  I think they are here to stay as part of active living and active travel.</p> <p>  The witnesses have said what they have said on the speeds.  I think we can all get on board with that.  This is probably not quite the speeds that some of the disability groups wanted, but I suppose this has to be workable.  Some of this will come down to that point I made earlier that our roads are imperfect, and our pavements are imperfect.  We are starting from a bad place.  Bespoke solutions will be imperfect even in places. </p> <p>  Insurance has been thrown up at us.  I know what they witnesses will say.  The logic is that if drivers have to wear a helmet, and if they need insurance, there will be too many obstacles to them.  However, it is just one of those questions that have been put to us.  Could I throw all of that at the witnesses?</p></speech>

The shared scooters are much more heavily regulated where they operate in other jurisdictions and where geo-fencing technology enables reduced speeds and top speeds to be managed.  That is just not there, at least currently, with the personal scooters.</p> <p>  Battery safety is an important point.  There have been some fairly serious battery fires involving e-scooters recently.  I mentioned that Superpedestrian scooters has an on-board self-diagnostics technology that checks battery temperature all the time, before the ride, during the ride and after the ride.  We have never had a battery fire.  That sort of technology is important in making sure that e-scooters are safe and that we do not have incidences where scooters are going on fire in warehouses, out on the streets on their own or in someone&rsquo;s home.</p></speech>

We would argue that it would be really important to have a self-diagnostic system like that in order to make e-scooters safe.</p> <p>  On battery safety, the maintenance regime is important in terms of how often the scooters are checked, are bought into the warehouse and are examined by mechanics, etc.</p><p>It is about maintenance rating, plus having the technology and onboard diagnostic capability.</p><p> In terms of insurance in the shared schemes, for example, in the UK where we operate in Nottingham, the Department for Transport requires that the operators have insurance, and this is the same in other markets as well.  That is something all operators will have for the shared schemes.</p><p> I refer to the Chairman's questions around helmets and high-visibility jackets.  In terms of helmets, I know the approach taken in the draft legislation is the same as bicycles essentially in that helmets are not mandatory, and that is a sensible approach.  In the scheme we operate in Nottingham, there was an integrated helmet in the previous model of scooter, in which there was a helmet attached to the scooter.  We found that only 4% of people used that integrated helmet.  That was potentially because of hygiene issues and they did not feel comfortable using it, as well as safety issues.  It may not have fit properly.  Maybe it had an impact previously.  Therefore, we recommend that it is better to bring one's own helmet that fits better.  We and other operators hold events at which we give away helmets.</p></speech>

If people want to wear high-visibility jackets that is great, but we would not argue that it should be mandatory.  It is better to invest in safer cycling infrastructure, as I mentioned earlier, and make the roads safer for people.</p></speech>

Certain scooters use swappable batteries.  This means that if the operations teams on the ground are replacing those batteries every day and putting them on charge every day, the physical handling of the batteries is the check, which is why we have no battery fires in our UK operations.  On that, it is also important that the operations teams are not outsourced.  It needs to be an in-house operation and they need to be trained by the operators to make sure the level of training is consistent throughout the entire team.</p> <p>  We make helmets available on every scooter.  There is a box on our scooters with a foldable helmet inside.  We have seen slightly higher helmet usage, with a peak helmet usage of 30% in our DCU trial for scooters at the university.  Helmets should not be mandatory but making them available to people using the scooter is a very good approach to take.  The same goes for high-visibility jackets, as was said before.  The scooters are very visible, usually in bright colours - we can agree on that.  The lights are always on and that is the key.</p></speech>

We are trying to put in place the best, safest and most affordable service, thereby, as one of my colleagues said, motivating people away from private ownership where there are fewer controls and there is less potential for regulation.  It has allowed them to see that renting a scooter to get them to the DART station or the bus allows them to leave the scooter and not have to lug it with them and bring it in and out to work.  That provides a level of convenience that private ownership does not allow.  We need to get to the stage where the shared scheme is affordable, easy, sustainable and well regulated.</p> <p>  On the question of helmets and high-visibility jackets, I agree with some of my colleagues.  We do not believe making helmets mandatory in this case is the way to go, just as they are not mandatory for cycling.  However, we operate with free helmets for our users.  In the weeks when we launch in a new city, we tend to run engagement and educational events, teaching people how to use the scooters and providing them with free helmets.  We work with the councils to structure that accordingly.  The same goes for high-visibility jackets.</p></speech>

When it comes to the mandating of helmets, there is a danger that it could become a blocker to mode shift and getting people out of cars and on to micromobility.  In our user surveys, there is quite a lot of rider pushback on shared helmets.  Maybe some of that is driven by Covid concerns and it may stick with us for the longer term.  They are not terribly keen on using a shared helmet.  However, we encourage helmet use, just like our colleagues, with the handing out of tens of thousands of helmets in the UK, for example.  We have events during peak riding season in the summer, and when we launch schemes, at which we hand out helmets and educate people.  We also award people with credit.  If they take a selfie at the start of their ride while wearing a helmet, we give them credits to financially reward our riders to ride more safely.</p> <p>  When it comes to insurance, VOI has complete third party insurance in all our markets.  In the UK, it is motor insurance because, legally speaking, a scooter is a motor vehicle in the UK, as it should be.  That might not be the case in the longer term from what Mr. Padden has said and, similarly, in Ireland it is a third case.  It is absolutely vital that we are insured.  It is important to protect both the rider and third parties if there is an incident.  It is also important, going back to the level playing field discussion we had earlier, that private e-scooters are insured when the legislation goes through.  It is important in regard to what we are saying here, that is, to encourage the use of shared schemes.</p></speech>

Much of this has been known for three years.  I have been riding the e-scooter story for four years since my time as spokesperson on Dublin when in opposition.  The argument for the shared scheme is compelling.  The argument is very clear in my mind that the State should start with the regulation of the shared scheme in order to build confidence in regard to personal use.  That is what was done in the UK, but it was done two years ago, in part to obviate the problem created by the reduction in public transport because of Covid and to provide alternative modes.  As a result, there has been a significant amount of licensing by local authorities.</p> <p>  As the Chair knows, the British Government did not legalise it; it regulated for it.  We are here, two years later, still discussing it.  That is not an issue to do with the committee.  It is an issue to do with the Minister and the manner in which he has gone about this piece.  He could have simplified the process and regulated it on his appointment or shortly thereafter.  Regulating it for shared schemes would have been quite a radical thing to do in Dublin, and other cities and towns, while the streets were quiet.  This would have allowed e-scooters to bed in.  That is the first point.  It was a huge missed opportunity.  I am sorry, but I have said it on the record before and I am keen to put it on the record again.</p> <p>  Second, e-scooters would have bedded in by this stage and people would have had the chance to use them.</p><p>If that had happened, it is possible that fewer commuters would have had to resort to their cars, as many did, because they were uncomfortable using public transport during the Covid period.  In the past three or four years, I have met all the providers.  Indeed, almost all of the witnesses are familiar to me.  There was a failure on the part of the previous Minister for Transport to make progress in this area.</p><p> The arguments are compelling for moving forward with shared schemes.  The whole system can be simplified in that it is possible, to some degree, to govern how the vehicles operate under shared schemes, whereas that is not possible with personally-owned ones.  The speeds can be governed, depending on whatever is agreed upon.  I have been on these scooters and I am happy with the 15 mph limit for which the UK opted.  When one gets up to approximately 25 mph-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-02a.1423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030200002#W00300"><p>In fact, 15 mph is approximately 20 km/h; 25 km/h is quite fast.  As I said, it is not possible to govern the speed limit for privately-owned vehicles.  Someone will import one from somewhere that can go up to 40 km/h.</p> <p>  Shared schemes also allow us to govern the standard and robustness of vehicles, in which I have seen an exponential improvement over the past three or four years.  The standard of kit offered and the health and safety aspects have really improved.  The vehicles are much better built and a great deal more comfortable and robust, with a much greater emphasis on safety, lighting, technology and all of that.  I would like to see some facility that allows for the positioning of a light on the back that is elevated rather than being lower.  However, I suppose the use of a high-visibility jacket does away with the need for that.  Shared schemes also allow us to govern where vehicles can be parked, which cannot be done with private scooters, although nobody is likely to leave one hanging around the place.</p> <p>  Last week, the Minister said he will not impose age limits on users of e-scooters.  It is possible, however, to impose a minimum age limit on a public shared scheme because users need a debit or credit card to access the service, which immediately limits who can do so.  I am not at all against private ownership but we need to allow the shared schemes to bed in and the public to develop some confidence in using the vehicles.  There is also the question of non-standard builds.  Previous speakers referred to parents buying the flimsiest models for children, which break or do not work properly.  There is also concern about a free-for-all situation in which privately-owned vehicles can go anywhere, including on any footpath, street, one-way street, pedestrian zone, school or campus, and users cannot be prohibited from doing so.</p> <p>  I disagree with the witnesses on the commercial aspect.  There is enough pie for 20 providers in this country.  In the case of Dublin City University, for example, which I understand has the same population as Kilkenny city, the college is ready to do, or has done, its own deal with Blue Duck, which involves special technology for use on the campus.  There will be lots of other similar schemes.  Industrial estates, for instance, and colleges such as the University of Limerick can use private providers to design services for use on the their site or campus to enable workers or students to commute here and there.  I see a huge amount of use for that.</p> <p>  I want to put on the record that I prefer the shared schemes model because it instills public confidence and gives people an idea of what they can do and the build they can expect.</p></speech>

With a view to the learning deriving from that experience, the question then is how we can bring in a personal scheme, make it safe and allow micromobility to play a role in it.  My concern is that the Minister will launch everything, the shared scheme and private ownership, and it will be a mess, the public will not like it and we will have a Paris situation or something like what happened on university campuses in the US when Lime first introduced the schemes, with accidents happening.  The anecdotal evidence is that the majority of accidents involve privately-owned vehicles.  However, if it works right, it can be useful.  Several constabularies in the UK are using these scooters.  The added mobility they could give to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is something to consider.  I want this working right.  It is not that I have any particular gr&aacute; for private companies pushing it or anything like that, but they have invested a lot of money in the technology and in improving it.  I am impressed by that.</p></speech>

When we took over the Nottingham scheme, that was the minimum age that applied.  I understand that is the limit allowed for in the legislation in the UK covering the trials.  However, many operators have chosen to operate on an 18-plus basis.  In fact, we revised the age limit upwards to 18, which applies across all our markets.  I understand it is much lower in some other European countries, including a minimum age of 14 or 15 in Italy.  I would need to confirm that.  We find that 18-plus works well.</p></speech>
