Members and all those who are in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of a medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation in this.</p><p>Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence by witnesses who are physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p><p>Today we are continuing our work on the stability programme update, SPU.  The report is due to be published in mid-April by the Department of Finance.  It will set out Ireland&rsquo;s medium-term economic outlook and fiscal plans.  Its publication will indicate the beginning of the budgetary preparation for budget 2023.  The committee is undertaking <i>ex ante</i>scrutiny of the SPU in order to understand the current fiscal context, difficult though that is at the moment, to engage with stakeholders on these issues and to allow for greater parliamentary engagement and transparency to the budget process.  This is the committee&rsquo;s second engagement on this topic.</p><p>Today the committee will meet with representatives of the Central Bank of Ireland to discuss topics that include, but are not limited to, the following subjects: medium-term fiscal and economic outlooks, Exchequer and general Government developments and outlook, general Government debt, risks facing the economy and long-term sustainability of the public finances.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Mark Cassidy, director of economics and statistics, and Dr. Martin O&rsquo;Brien, head of division, Irish economic analysis.  I thank them for being here with us today.  I will hand over to Dr. Cassidy for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#A00300"><p>We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss with the committee the economic and fiscal outlook.  In my opening remarks, I will refer to our latest assessment, which was published in the Central Bank bulletin at the end of January.  I will also reflect on the implications of more recent events.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is shaping current and prospective developments in the European economy, as well as adding risks and uncertainty to the outlook.  During the first week of April, we will be publishing our next quarterly bulletin, which will include an updated forecast that will incorporate available information.</p> <p>  The economy overall has proven resilient through Covid-19 and, prior to the war in Ukraine, robust growth was expected over the coming years.  Modified domestic demand, MDD, is estimated to have grown by 6.5% in 2021, bringing the domestic economy broadly back to pre-pandemic levels.  Our latest forecast is for domestic demand growth of 7.1%, 5.2% and 4.8% in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  If these growth rates were to emerge, by 2024 the domestic economy would be back to where it would have been expected to have been, had the pandemic not taken place. </p> <p>  The economy is expected to be operating at its potential level of activity over the course of our forecast horizon.  The extent of the labour market recovery has been encouraging.  The standard International Labour Organization, ILO, rate of unemployment is now approximately 5%, with the Covid-adjusted rate at approximately 7%.  Employment and labour force participation has increased relative to 2019, especially for females and younger workers.  We expect the labour market to tighten further, with employment growth continuing, but at a slower pace than last year, and the unemployment rate remaining relatively low out to 2024.</p> <p>  While the official earnings data are not straightforward to interpret at the moment and come with a lag, it is reasonably clear that sectors that have experienced consistently high demand for labour have also witnessed strong wage growth.  As the labour market tightens, it can be expected that wage growth would become more broad-based.  According to the latest available data, consumer price inflation in Ireland as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, rose to 5.7% in February 2022.  This is the highest rate since late 2000.  It is in stark contrast to the experience over the decade preceding the onset of the pandemic, when inflation averaged 0.5%. </p> <p>  The experience in Ireland reflects common global drivers of inflation being witnessed to a similar extent in the euro area as a whole.  Specifically, the current rates of inflation are driven by higher global energy prices and supply bottlenecks, with some knock-on implications of the energy price rise for the prices of other consumer goods and services.  The energy component of the HICP rose by 30% over the year to February, with the most significant increases recorded in home heating oil, whose price is up by 53.8%.  Relatedly, the cost of motor fuels rose by 31.3%.  Excluding energy, HICP inflation in February was 3.7%.  More domestically determined inflation is most evident in rents, which increased by 8.5% over the year to February.</p> <p>  These increases in official consumer prices for energy and fuel, which are for February, are yet to reflect in full the developments of recent weeks and the implications of the conflict in Ukraine.  Both the spot and future wholesale price of oil and gas have risen substantially since the Russian invasion began and have also been volatile on a day-to-day basis.  In addition, wholesale prices have increased for products where Russia and Ukraine are prominent suppliers, such as coal, wheat and other cereals, fertilisers and certain metals.  The impact has already been seen in reported consumer fuel prices across Ireland, and will eventually also be reflected in higher than previously anticipated consumer prices for gas, electricity and food.  Our January forecast envisaged HICP inflation averaging 4.5% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023.</p><p>While there is substantial <font color="#363636">uncertainty as to the actual outturn, inflation will likely be significantly higher than this in 2022 and could remain elevated for longer than previously expected as a result of the war.</font><br/><br/><font color="#363636"> The economic effect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine can be primarily characterised as a supply-side shock, leading to higher prices and lower availability of energy and other commodities generally.  Direct trade between Ireland and Russia, as well as that between Ireland and Ukraine, is very low overall but exposure on the import side is relatively important for coal, fertiliser and some cereals.  However, the two countries are important in the supply of energy, metals and food commodities to the European market generally.  This will lead to higher inflation and slower growth in many of Ireland&rsquo;s main trading partners and affect economic conditions here.  Higher inflation, likely driven by energy and food components, will place increased pressure on household&rsquo;s real incomes and operating costs for businesses in Ireland.  Alongside a general increase in uncertainty, this can be expected to dampen domestic consumption and investment growth to a degree.</font><br/><br/><font color="#363636"> Regarding the public finances, the pace of recovery given the extent of the Covid shock has been remarkable.  We estimate that the 2021 general Government deficit to have been &euro;8.7 billion, which is  equivalent to -2.7% of GNI*.  The better than expected outturn for 2021 reflected the following: higher than anticipated domestic activity leading to better income tax and VAT receipts; lower than expected Covid-related expenditure; and positive surprises in terms of corporation tax receipts.  With the economy performing strongly as the effect of the pandemic eases, our January forecast was for a deficit of &euro;3.8 billion to be recorded this year, and a surplus of &euro;3.4 billion to emerge in 2023, which will be the equivalent to 1.3% of GNI*.</font><br/><br/><font color="#363636"> The re-emergence of a general Government surplus will contribute to an easing of the debt position.However, almost all of the improvement in the public finances is expected to be achieved through growth in nominal GNI*.  Our January forecast envisaged the general Government debt to be below 90% of GNI* in 2023, and fall further to 84.9% in 2024, having been 102.2% in 2021.  In euro terms, debt was only forecast to be 0.4% lower in 2024 relative to 2021, at &euro;231.2 billion.</font><br/><br/><font color="#363636"> The war in Ukraine raises many issues for the outlook and conduct of fiscal policy, spanning the immediate humanitarian response for those displaced by the war, mitigating the economic impact on the most vulnerable Irish households, and addressing medium-to-longer term implications.  I will briefly discuss some of these in a moment.</font><br/><br/><font color="#363636"> Before doing so I will mention some of the main risks to the current economic and fiscal outlook.  These can be summarised under three inter-related headings.  First, the escalation or prolongation of the war could worsen global supply conditions and dampen foreign demand.  Second, the scope for, and implications of, second-round or cost-push drivers of inflation emerging more forcefully.  Third, structural challenges for the public finances in light of already existing and emerging priorities that raise demands on Government resources.  Already existing priorities include the need to address infrastructure deficits in housing, climate action and the long-term costs of an ageing population.</font><br/><br/><font color="#363636"> This brings me to the overall budgetary stance in light of current circumstances.  The experience of the currently high rates of inflation is not uniform across the country.  Cost of living increases from higher food and energy prices tend to be larger for lower income, older and rural households.  This is because food and energy spending is a larger share of the weekly spending for these households.  It is appropriate for fiscal policy to reduce the impact of higher inflation on those households that are less able to cope with current circumstances.  Measures introduced in budget 2022 and afterwards will help to alleviate some of the cost of living increases.  The better than expected performance of the public finances last year has provided the Government with some additional space to fund this expenditure.  Nevertheless, with the public finances in a deficit position following Covid-19, this additional expenditure will be funded by borrowing.  If, for any reason, these measures became quasi-permanent then appropriate funding through current resources would have to be considered to avoid introducing a structural vulnerability in the public finances.</font><br/><br/><font color="#363636"> At the same time, pre-existing priorities in housing and climate action need to be addressed over the medium-term and at a time of inflationary pressures that are mostly externally driven.  While uncertainty over the outlook is particularly high, the nature of the economic shock arising from the war means that it remains likely that the economy will be reaching capacity constraints.  To ensure that the economy and public finances remain on a sustainable path over the medium term, the composition of fiscal policy may have to be adjusted to avoid excessive inflationary pressures domestically while simultaneously addressing these priorities for the community as a whole.  Tax and expenditure measures, which more explicitly support supply-side conditions, build resilience to future shocks across the economy and over the longer-term enhance the structural budgetary position, becoming a more immediate priority the longer energy and other commodity prices are expected to remain high.</font><br/><br/><font color="#363636"> In conclusion, the economy and the public finances have proven resilient through the pandemic.  As a result, both are overall relatively well positioned to address many of the challenges that may lie ahead.  However, the degree of uncertainty around the outlook is particularly high.  Careful management of the public finances in light of known and emerging priorities and challenges remains necessary.</font></p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Cassidy and Dr. O'Brien.  I thank them for the presentation in terms of the Central Bank's quarterly bulletin.  It is really timely.  Committees have discussed these matters for many years but this is obviously an issue that is being discussed in every village and town across the State.  The first thing on people's lips now is the impact inflation will have on the cost of food, home heating oil and energy, and how people are going to make ends meet.  The outline Dr. Cassidy gave is an important contribution to raising awareness about where we are going.  However, for many families, it will be very concerning because, just like we have pointed out, the impact of the war in Ukraine has not really been felt yet in terms of prices.  Gas prices have been announced by Bord G&aacute;is, for example, and some people think they are the result of the war in the Ukraine but they were not.  They are the result of the increase in the price of gas that happened last year and we are going to see significantly further increases.  I ask the delegation to elaborate on that matter.  The die has already been set for the wholesale price of gas where these operators buy a large proportion, or the majority, of their gas well in advance of consumer use.</p> <p>  The Central Bank mentioned in its quarter 1 bulletin that inflation was projected to be 4.5%.  Obviously, those numbers are out of date now even though they are only a couple of weeks old.  Where does the Central Bank see inflation for the year 2022?</p> <p>  The Central Bank has done a very important piece of work by breaking down inflation as best as it can for different types of households and different types of income quintiles.  I have engaged with the director general of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to have a better breakdown of inflation because, as we know from the work the Central Bank has done, inflation on the poorest households is about 1% higher than inflation on the most well-off households in the State.  Some of that is down to the fact that poorer income households use three times as much of their disposable income on energy than those in the top.  I am glad to see the CSO is about to prepare some technical work on this matter, which will be helpful.  Can the Central Bank estimate where it sees inflation for different income groups?  I ask because we are now looking at not just energy but some of the other staples such as bread as well as fuel, heating and electricity, which are increasing.  Given that social welfare rates were increased in the budget by less than 2.5%, what is the real impact on those who depend on a fixed income as a result of the levels of inflation?</p><p> My final question on this part is about the second-round effects that could spill into wider inflation in respect of goods and services later in the year.  Will Dr. Cassidy go into detail about the interconnectedness with Europe, Russia and Ukraine, as well as the impact second-round effects could have on the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#C00200"><p>I will try to address those issues in turn.  I fully agree with the Deputy's analysis that we saw evidence of significantly higher inflation during the second half of 2021, which related more so to the legacy of Covid and other global factors affecting energy markets.  Now we have a second wave exacerbating matters.  The official data that I quoted relates to February 2022 and, therefore, we will see a further uptick in inflation, particularly in the context of energy in light of the developments that we already know have happened.  A point I would note about energy inflation is the extreme volatility of wholesale gas prices in particular but also oil prices.  That can create additional problems and feed through to retail prices.</p> <p>  A third general point I wish to raise before I get into the answers more specifically, what we have not fully seen yet is a pass-through to food prices.  We have seen in recent months a modest uptick in overall food prices and a bit more of an uptick in elements of food prices relating to cereals, grains and oils.  There has been quite a sharp rate of increase in the past month or two.  There is no doubt that this has not yet fully passed through.  We will also see further pressures on food prices in the coming months.</p> <p>  The Deputy will understand that we are still working on these forecasts, but our current estimates suggest, in terms of the annual average, that it will be up between 1% and 2% over the year as a whole.  Whereas we were forecasting an average rate of 4.5% in our previous bulletin, this will likely be in the order of 5.5% to 6% on average.  We will have a more definite figure in two weeks' time.  As to the profile during the year, we expect to see the rate, which is currently 5.7%, increase and peak around the summer months.  Again, I apologise for presenting a range, but our estimates suggest that the inflation rate will peak in the summer in the range of 7.5% to 9%.  There is an expectation of a gradual decline during the second half of the year.  Importantly, we also expect the rate to remain higher than we previously expected throughout 2023.  Short-term effects in these markets will pass through on a more delayed basis to broader elements of the consumer price basket - this will lead on to the second part of the Deputy's question relating to second-round effects - and, therefore, we expect inflation to be somewhat higher during 2023.</p> <p>  In terms of the differential inflation rates, while the average inflation rate is 5.7%, we produced estimates of differential inflation rates for different parts of society that range from 5.1% to the highest of approximately 6.2%.  People who are experiencing the higher rates include lower income groups, older households and rural households.  If the rate averages at 5.5% to 6%, one can expect the average rate would be about 0.5% higher for the more affected groups, which in some respects may not seem like a lot.  If one looks at the corresponding incomes, however, it is a lot.  We believe the bill for the average household could be &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,300 higher than it would have been two years ago, which may be the best comparison.  Of course, for lower income households, that is a significant amount.  Estimates indicate that bills for food may be &euro;500 to &euro;600 higher if food price increases materialise as we expect.</p> <p>  When economists talk about second-round effects they often relate to the dynamic between prices and wages; high inflation leads to higher wages which in turn passes through to higher prices.  We are not yet seeing evidence of that.  We are not yet seeing any broad-based evidence of higher wages across the economy.  Where we expect this to show up is in gas and oil prices.  They are a key component of production and output across the economy.  That leads to higher production cost for most goods and services.  For some sectors in particular, that will pass through to higher prices for broader consumer goods and services.</p> <p>  I also mentioned developments in food prices.  Whether one considers that a second-round effect depends on what way one looks at it.  An important reason why food costs will increase is because of higher gas prices affecting fertiliser which affect food.  Therefore, to some extent it is also a higher second-round effect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#C00300"><p>I appreciate that.  My time is limited so I will just make a couple of points.  One of the most worrying impacts regarding this year is that it is not a blip.  It is not short term.  The ESRI is projecting 5% inflation for 2023.  Dr. Cassidy has said that he expects a higher rate of inflation.  That means what is happening now will be baked in and will get worse next year, which is problematic for low- and middle-income households in particular.</p> <p>  On the positive side, the Exchequer and the economy are going stronger.  The ESRI has projected an increase and that we will be in surplus by the end of the year.  In its quarterly bulletin, the Central Bank has projected an improvement in excess of &euro;4 billion since the budget last year.  I am not sure if the Central Bank is still in the same space as the ESRI.  Does Dr. Cassidy believe there is scope for further targeted interventions to support those who will be hardest hit as a result of the high levels of inflation?</p> <p>  Where does Dr. Cassidy see the European Central Bank, ECB, response going in regard to this?  Does he see the ECB looking at interest rate increases in the short to medium term?  Does he see the ECB shifting monetary policy, perhaps as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, or are we still looking at supply-side problems, the mismatch between supply and demand, and that it is more likely to result in no change in policy from the ECB in the short term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#C00400"><p>The Deputy is absolutely right about the improvement in the public finances.  We have estimated slightly different figures from the ESRI, which we will publish in a couple of weeks.  We probably see the economy remaining in deficit this year.  Previously, we expected a return to surplus next year.  We will probably still be looking at that but there is much uncertainty about how it will materialise.</p> <p>  In terms of what more could or should be done, all I can say is that given how things have developed, more measures may well be warranted or necessary.  That is a matter for the Government, however.  When one gets down to that type of decision, it is matter for elected representatives generally to debate.  The public finances were in a healthier position.  There were many improvements in recent years and there was a positive momentum coming into 2022, which leaves us better placed to address these shocks, which is a welcome development.</p> <p>  As to the ECB, I will restrict my comments to what it would say which is that while its focus is to achieve its price stability target, inflation of 2% over the medium term, it will not ignore current inflation developments.  While the Deputy is correct that it represents a supply-side shock, and the ECB can do nothing about global supply no more than about domestic policy, but because of the risk of second-round effects, the higher inflation is, the more likely it could pass through to underlying inflationary developments in the medium term.</p> <p>  The ECB published new forecasts two or three weeks ago that expect inflation to return to around target levels by 2024.  It is not forecasting excessive inflationary pressures in the coming years.  It also announced a moderation in asset purchases and the rate at which it will continue asset purchases until the summer of 2022.  It will announce at its next meeting in June what it will do in the third quarter.  It is emphasising optionality in the current circumstances given the high degree of uncertainty.  The ECB will undoubtedly remain absolutely committed its primary mandate that is price stability.  If there are signs that the medium-term outlook is for inflation above 2%, it will not hesitate to act.  However, on the other hand, if things go in the other direction from an inflation perspective, it will act in the other way.  The ECB is not committed.</p><p>It is maintaining its options open.  They will know a lot more in June. </p></speech>

It would reduce demand and cause a problem as a result of that and there would still be supply-side pressures.  Does Dr. Cassidy believe that analysis still stands today, or is that now changing because of the war in Ukraine and the impacts that will bring about?</p></speech>

What Professor Lane said, and what I am saying, is that moving monetary policy now will do nothing to the current rate of inflation.  It will not do it in the current timeframe.  It is a supply-side problem and monetary policy is a demand problem.  It will do nothing.  The higher inflation is now, the more likely it is that the medium-term forecast for the ECB will be even higher.  The current rate of inflation is relevant and is one of the factors the ECB looks at in making its decision.  If the current rate remains high, however, and the ECB does not expect this to pass through to the longer term, then that higher rate would not by itself be enough to change.  In addition to the current rate, the ECB will look at the headline rate over the medium term.  It also looks at the core underlying rate over the medium term, in other words, the rate that excludes energy prices.  It has set explicit conditions for all three of those.  What Professor Lane said is not inconsistent with what I am saying.  The ECB is looking at these three things at the same time.</p></speech>

To me, we are into a worst-case scenario in relation to Ukraine.  This is not going to end quickly.  Its economy has come to a complete standstill.  We are not finished with sanctions and we have not fully begun to feel the impact.  We have not taken the maximum number or anywhere near the maximum number of refugees from the conflict as yet.

We are looking at worse scenarios compared to the central scenario I mentioned in my opening response.  However, they are not worst-case scenarios.  We are looking at scenarios where there are even higher gas and oil prices in international markets for even longer than the market currently expects.  They are very bad scenarios, and we are looking at two such ones, but they are not worst-case scenarios.  All of them assume the conflict remains within Ukraine, for example.  There would be much worse scenarios than that and we do not have numbers around those.  We are developing some of these adverse scenarios.

It is probably easier for me to make generalities than give specific numbers.  In general, most of our baseline or benchmark forecasts would still see energy prices come down from their current rates over the course of the next couple of years.  Any situation like those mentioned by Deputy Lahart would probably be reflected in global energy prices being significantly higher than that, probably closer to their current levels than the benchmark expectation might be.  Dr. Cassidy mentioned that we are adding 1% to 2% to inflation this year as a result of currently available information.  If energy prices were expected to remain higher than they currently are for a longer period of time, we would be adding another 1% to 2% to the rate of inflation and doing something similar on the negative side to the growth rate.  You would expect the growth rate to be significantly lower than what we currently forecast or envisage in the context of the conflict as it is today.  Our previous forecasts had growth in the domestic economy of around 7% this year.  Based on current information, one could expect that growth to be around 1% to 2% lower when we come out with our forecast.  If energy prices were to remain at similar levels to what they are currently, as opposed to coming down, that would shave another 1% to 2% off that for next year.</p></speech>

Rather than looking at the euro amount, we prefer to look at the capacity to repay the debt and the best metric of that is debt as a share of income.  The current debt ratio as a share of income is around 100%.  There is no precise figure.  The days when people put a very exact figure on this are over.  We would certainly like that to be reduced towards 60% or something like that over a period of time.  We do not want a sudden knee-jerk reduction in debt.  The reason I made my first clarification is that that will happen through sustained growth in the economy rather than reducing the nominal amount of debt.  By increasing the income, the debt ratio will therefore reduce.  It is not a case of looking to reduce the amount of debt but of increasing income.</p></speech>

We can all see the challenges facing the Government.  There is real pressure coming from particular forces who argue every time there is a crisis, either with a small or a capital C, that the Government must respond with reductions across different areas.  Obviously if the Government reduces VAT or excise duty, at some point it will have to raise them again when the crisis is over and therein lies the difficulty.  The pandemic exacerbated the trend for increasing public debt but is that sustainable into the longer term, particularly with regard to health spending?  What is the Central Bank's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#E00200"><p>First, spending more money during a crisis is what one wants to do.  Economically that is what one wants to do, to sustain spending in the economy and to prevent hardship within the economy.  One of the reasons, if not the main reason, we argue for lowering the public debt ratio during good times is to build up the funds or the buffers to allow us to spend money during times like Covid or the war in Ukraine.  When a temporary shock hits the economy it is absolutely appropriate to diagnose who is most affected and for money to be spent to alleviate the hardship caused.  The lower the debt ratio is at the start of the crisis, the more the economy is able to do that while continuing to borrow on international markets.  We came into this crisis in much better shape than the crisis of 2010 to 2012, when international markets would not lend to us because they judged that our debt position was not necessarily sustainable.  The first point to emphasise is the importance of getting the debt lower when times are good.</p> <p>  The second point that is extremely important is the difference between a temporary shock hitting the economy and a permanent shock.  If a permanent shock hits the economy, then it is a very different matter in terms of the appropriate policy response.  To give an example in the current context, ultimately if higher energy prices are permanent and if the prices we see now persist forever, then for an energy importing economy like Ireland, the economy becomes permanently worse off and we have to pay that cost.  No Government policies can restore the previous cost of energy supply and the money to meet the extra costs cannot be borrowed indefinitely.  It then becomes a political decision on how the costs will be redistributed within society.  Permanent shocks are very different because we cannot borrow the money forever to pay for them and society needs to make a choice about how those costs will ultimately be redistributed or absorbed over the longer term.</p></speech>

I am not being stupid.  I understand the concept of a temporary shock but the current shock could potentially be a decade long before it works itself out.  Is that a permanent shock?</p></speech>

A temporary solution would be to temporarily reduce VAT or excise duties to get over a situation whereby prices are high for the next year or two.  However, if prices remain at their current high levels for the next ten years or 20 years, then having permanently reduced excise and VAT on energy is not going to be the solution to the problem.  Then we need to look at longer-term solutions to the problem.</p></speech>

On the last point about the nature of the energy price increases, Europe has substantially increased its renewable energy production.  I think I am correct in saying that 2020 was the first year in which the majority of electricity in Europe was produced renewably.  We have actually increased the renewable energy supply in Europe and in this country but that has not made a damn bit of difference to the cost of energy.  I ask Dr. Cassidy to explain that conundrum.  The narrative we are hearing from the Government is that faced with these shocks, we have to wean ourselves off our reliance on fossil fuels.  Now, for climate change reasons, we should do so anyway but there is an implication that if we do that, and develop more indigenous renewable energy, it will somehow lead to a reduction in the price of energy and electricity.  Is there any reason to believe that, other than the ideological assumption underpinning it?  It would be interesting to hear the Central Bank's response to that because when I look at the situation, given that the market is setting these prices regardless of where or how the energy or electricity is produced, there seems to be no evidence to support that suggestion.</p> <p>  The difficulty we have is that when we are talking about inflation and the cost of energy rising, there is an implication that we are all in this together in suffering the consequences, that this is a big problem for everybody.  Is it fair comment to say that it is not a big problem at all for those who produce energy?  Actually, they are doing extraordinarily well and this is a tale of two shocks.  There is the shock for the majority who have to buy the petrol, energy or electricity from the producers and suppliers but what we are witnessing is a bonanza in profit for those same producers and suppliers, whether the energy is renewable or fossil-fuel based.  That is actually what is happening here.  I would be interested to hear Dr. Cassidy's comments on that.  Is that an accurate description of what is happening in this country, in Europe and globally?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.45" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#E00900"><p>On the Deputy's first question, I agree.  I do not think that what we will see in the transition to renewables are lower prices or that this is their main intention.  The main intention of the transition to renewables away from fossil fuels relates to climate change objectives and, potentially, security of energy supply so that we become less reliant on international sources.  As far as I know, there is no evidence to suggest that this is being done to reduce the cost of energy.  Indeed renewables, at the moment at least, would be more expensive and there are potential inflationary effects in the shift to renewables.  I do not disagree with what Deputy Boyd Barrett is saying.  I am not very aware of the alternative argument, that it is being done for price reasons.</p> <p>  On the second issue, what Deputy Boyd Barrett is saying is also correct.  From a national perspective, we could look at it as the difference between energy exporting and energy importing countries.  This is a shock that benefits energy exporting countries at the expense of energy importing countries like Ireland.  That said, there is a shock to supply so it is not that energy exporting countries are able produce and sell the same amount of energy as they did previously and charge twice the price.  Certainly, the current situation benefits energy exporters at the expense of energy importers.  It is a terms of trade shock, I suppose and that is the nature of the shock.  </p> <p>  I would not say that it is the same within the energy sector.  I would not say it is the same for those selling energy, for example, energy retailers because they are paying the higher prices in order to purchase the energy and passing those on.  I do not have information on the extent to which they are passing those increases on or whether the increases are more or less than they are paying.  Certainly, the benefits of higher energy prices generally are felt by those producing the energy, the ultimate producers of it, at the expense of the energy importers or consumers.</p><p>I am not disagreeing with anything the Deputy is saying in that regard.</p></speech>

I think there are important implications of this.  In a globalised economy, the owners of the energy supplies are really the shareholders, who are not limited.  The companies will be based in a particular country, whether that is BP or Shell in Britain or Aramco in Saudi Arabia, but people with additional wealth in this country buy shares in these companies.  I often find the Central Bank's quarterly report at the beginning of the year fascinating, in which it shows the increases in household wealth, which have been pretty dramatic over the past ten years or so.  Many households in this country would be stunned to hear that household wealth had increased dramatically year on year for the past decade or so, but the Central Bank's reports demonstrate that.  That clearly indicates that very wealthy households have seen a very significant increase in their wealth.  Some of that is property based, given the rise in the value of property, but if I read the report at the beginning of the year correctly, it indicated that many of those increases were accounted for by increases in financial assets, that is, shares, dividends, savings and all that kind of stuff.</p> <p>  The wealthiest households in this country - this is probably an international pattern - have seen their wealth increase greatly.  Is it fair to say, therefore, that if they are shareholders in companies that are making significant profits, such as energy companies or arms companies, which have also been doing well recently, the inflation crisis is not a problem for them at all?  The increasing value of their investments, if they have investments in companies such as petrol, energy or arms companies, means they actually are benefiting from the inflation crisis that is crucifying everybody else.

According to the figures, by far the largest proportion of the increase in wealth relates to housing wealth.  The main distinction that could be drawn would be between those who have owned houses throughout recent years during the period of this increase in wealth against those who have not owned houses.<br/><br/>The second large increase has related to household savings.  There has been something of a distributional impact there.  Household savings have increased significantly since the outbreak of Covid and they have been concentrated among those sectors of the economy that have been less severely affected by Covid, where people have not lost their jobs but have not had the same opportunities to spend, so they have accumulated significant savings.  At the other end of the spectrum, those parts of the economy that were first to close did not accumulate the same level of savings and they tend to be dominated by lower-income workers.  Lower-income workers did not have the same opportunities to save as did higher-income workers.<br/><br/>In regard to the increase in the value of other financial assets, Ireland holds a very small share of financial assets outside of bank accounts and of property, which of course is non-financial.  Shares and so on constitute a very small overall proportion of the wealth in comparison with other countries and account for only a small proportion of the overall increase in wealth during that period.  It is true equity markets did well over a number of years, although not over recent years.  The current crisis is different from other fluctuations in oil prices whereby if oil prices increase, the oil producers make money, and <i>vice versa</i>.  This is complicated by the fact that many of the oil producers will have been negatively affected by developments in Russia too.  They may pull out of Russia and their businesses may be affected.  It will take a while to understand the implications of the current developments in Ukraine for energy companies generally.  As for the second part of the Deputy's question, suggesting the increase in wealth that has been recorded reflects the increase in value of shares in energy and oil companies, no, I really do not see that..</p></speech>

This predates Covid.  The Central Bank's reports show a consistent increase in net household wealth for the past ten years or so, with fairly dramatic increases pre-Covid.  It is interesting that is happening.  Most people, particularly with the increasing rate of inflation and so on but even more generally, will not have felt their household wealth has increased.  They will have been struggling already with the cost of living.  This suggests there is a layer of the population that has additional money and that has seen its household wealth increase.  Much of that relates to property, because these people are doing well out of the housing crisis, the high rents and so on, but they are also generating it from investments and savings.</p></speech>

The graph tracks very closely with household prices.  Over the past ten years, house prices have been increasing, while over the five years before that, they collapsed dramatically.  House prices are only now back to where they were in 2008.  Household wealth is determined much more than anything else by the value of a house, and in the case of people who own their own house, their wealth will increase when the value of that house increases.  That is what we are seeing to a greater extent than anything else.</p></speech>

I come from a rural area and see what is happening in rural Ireland with the explosions in the prices of fuel, grain supply, fertilisers and so on, and the impact they will have.  The short-term impact is such that the price of diesel and other fuel for cars has increased, as has the cost of heating and so on.  These increases in the cost of living mean people have less spending power.  There is also the issue of people on fixed incomes, who are again being negatively affected, and profoundly so, by the cost of living, heating their homes and all that goes with that.</p> <p>  Should we now consider taking very immediate measures by reducing VAT on these commodities in the short term to allow people to survive through the short term?  As for the long term, I expect we will see the full effects of the war in Ukraine when we reach the next harvest, from a farming point of view, and when we see how much has been produced, given the more than threefold increase in the price of the likes of fertiliser.  Buying 1 tonne of fertiliser, for example, will cost &euro;250 more than it did last week.  People are just not buying fertiliser to grow grass to feed cows to produce milk and the food we need because they cannot afford it.  We are in a perfect storm and that drives up prices and creates scarcity.  Should we now, as an emergency, consider cutting excise, VAT and carbon tax for the moment because of what is happening?</p> <p>  Moreover, should we help farmers by giving them a subvention to allow them to buy the fertiliser and seed they need to be able to create the food supply for feedstock and people for next winter?</p></speech>

We recently produced an analysis, based on December 2021 data, that confirms that rural communities are more heavily affected than urban communities because of the nature of the price increases we have seen.  The effective inflation rate in rural communities can be up to 0.5% higher than the average throughout the wider country.  It is possible it will get somewhat worse.</p><p>The analysis in December probably did not fully reflect what was coming down the line in terms of oil and gas prices, and fertiliser prices which will be a very important element of inflation this year.  Deputy Canney is, therefore, absolutely correct.</p><p> The Deputy is also correct about fixed incomes or those parts of the economy that are not going to see the same increases in earnings as maybe other parts of the economy.  Let us say the average rate of inflation this year is 6%.  If average earnings across the economy are increasing by between 3% and 4%, that means the average household is having a decline in real incomes of around 2%.  If somebody does not earn between 3% and 4% more and has the same income this year as last year, that is a much larger reduction in their purchasing power and real income during the year.  It is absolutely correct to say that rural communities are harder hit and that people on a fixed income or those who earn lower income increases experience larger declines in real incomes.</p><p> In terms of policy, given how things have developed, more measures may well be warranted or necessary.  That is a matter for Government, however, and it would be getting beyond our mandate for us to get into what specific policies may be introduced.</p><p> With regard to VAT, it is known that there are challenges with European fiscal rules.  We have a derogation for electricity and gas where the current rate is lower than the rate for other products and it could not return to that lower rate.  I am not an expert on European fiscal rules but it would be useful if any changes to those rules could be agreed at European level in order that one is operating within the framework.  To go beyond would really be to get into the policy sphere, and it is more appropriate that elective representatives rather than us discuss and debate that.</p></speech>

The way we are developing our offshore energy is way of track in the sense that, even with the announcement this week that seven projects may start the process of seeking planning permission, we probably will not see anything produced from that until 2028 or 2029.  Given the emergency and our reliance on outside supplies of energy, should we put in place emergency measures in the interim to ensure we can fast-track projects to deliver the green energy we all crave?</p> <p>  A good example of a project that has gone pear-shaped is the Derrybrien wind farm located in my constituency.  The ESB has now decided to decommission 70 wind power generating turbines because planning permission was not correct and the ESB has been told by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that substitute consent will not be given.  This decision flies in the face of what we are trying to create, namely, a secure green energy supply for the country.  Should we look at how we spread our resources around the country in terms of providing infrastructure, public transport and rail networks so that we can have connectivity, get people off the roads, out of their cars and into trains and have better options for people, including people who live in rural areas?  That is why people in rural areas are more affected by the inflation we are currently experiencing.</p> <p>  Fiscal rules were mentioned.  Does the Central Bank believe the fiscal rules that were relaxed during the recession should continue to be kept off the agenda until we see how the situation in Ukraine pans out?</p></speech>

I am not aware of the specific projects that he referred to.  At a more economy-wide level, a key challenge is that we need to attract more investors to build flexible, cleaner gas-fired generators to supplement what we will have from wind-generated sources of electricity.</p> <p>  In recent years, we have been moving from a reliance on fossil fuels towards more renewable sources of energy.  Already, around 40% of our electricity is generated from renewable sources.  At the same time, we still have a higher degree of reliance on fossil fuels.  As the last couple of years have suggested, the generation of wind-powered electricity can be volatile.  There can be shocks to that supply, whether that is due to weather conditions or for other reasons.  One risks, and we have seen that risk called out during last year, the situation where, in moving out of fossil fuels and closing oil or coal plants, one is not making up the difference and one does not have enough renewable sources of energy.  We have had that experience called out over the last couple of years.  I do not have an answer in terms of exact policies but we need to think about incentivising and attracting more investors to build flexible, clean gas-fired generators to go along with wind-generated energy.  That would help to continue to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and must happen.  At the same, we must reinforce energy supply to ensure we are not vulnerable to fluctuations in wind-powered energy.</p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. O'Brien, will respond to the question on fiscal rules.</p></speech>

I am sure, in the context of the relatively extreme situation we are now facing, that there will be some degree of flexibility considered by governments in Europe as a result of that.</p> <p>  In general, the Commission has taken this opportunity to reflect on reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, etc.  The opportunity we have is to make the framework overall more simple and effective, more cognisant of national economic peculiarities and developments and also more cognisant of some of the longer term issues the Deputy mentioned and to which Dr. Cassidy referred, including the overarching long-term priorities for the European Union overall around energy security, digitalisation and these kinds of issues, in order that the fiscal framework reflects these issues more effectively.  Certainly from our understanding, the European Council and the Commission are actively pursuing simplicity of roles and also making them more effective to reach longer term goals.  I think that would be a good avenue to take.</p></speech>

The witnesses have spoken about the impact of inflation on the cost of living.  I stress that the impact is not evenly distributed across the population and some communities are being hit harder than others.  People in rural communities need to do a lot more driving so are hit more by inflation, and the same applies to some people who are on fixed incomes.  The Central Bank has done some analysis on the various sectors and who is impacted more and by how much.  I am interested to know who is impacted less and is more cushioned from the cost of inflation and the rising costs of living.</p></speech>

It shows that those who are being hit disproportionately are lower income groups, people in rural compared with urban area and older people compared with younger people.  That primarily reflects the different shares of people's weekly expenditure that goes on energy products.  I will outline the figures I have for income groups.</p><p>The average amount of a person's income spent on energy in the economy is 8%.  The amount spent is 10% for the people with the lowest 20% of incomes and it is 6% for the highest 20% of incomes.  That is a significant share of the disposable income of lower income groups.  We think the average household energy bill this year could be &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,300 higher compared with two years ago.  Older people and people in rural areas spend a higher proportion on energy.  I do not have the breakdown for rural and urban areas, but the amount that lower income groups spend on their grocery bills is higher too.  I can confirm what the Deputy is saying.</p></speech>

It is on our website.  We can arrange to have it sent to the Deputy.  I gave the breakdown for energy.  I have the corresponding breakdown relating to food.  The average amount of a person's income spent on food is 21%.  It is 16% for the highest 20% of incomes, but the people with the lowest 20% of incomes spend 26% of their income on food.  There is some evidence of food price inflation.  If it becomes more widespread, there would be a distributional effect.  We will forward the Deputy the published analysis.</p></speech>

It breaks down overall expenditure on transport, energy, food and other goods and services.  It shows how one can create tailored inflation rates for younger or older, lower income or higher income, rural or urban, those with cars or those without cars, and homeowners or renters.  We provide tailored inflation rates to show that while 5.7% is the average inflation rate, some groups face a higher rate and some groups face a lower rate.  We estimate all of those.</p></speech>

It has been an interesting discussion so far.  Unfortunately, I have had to pop in between different meetings.  If I repeat something, please let me know.  These are extremely difficult times.  It is interesting to see the conversation in the media.  Even before the invasion of Ukraine, there was a conversation about rising inflation.  At that time, many media commentators seemed to think that interest rates would rise in the European Central Bank, ECB, although it was clear that it would not increase them.  The witnesses speak about rising inflation and the underlying causes being supply bottlenecks for energy and so on.  I do not know how making borrowing more expensive and reducing economic activity addresses that.  We already have the second highest mortgage interest rates in the EU, at more than double the EU average.  January saw the typical new mortgage rate increase by 0.7%, which was the largest monthly increase in almost five years.  High mortgage rates add more than &euro;2,200 a year to the cost of living in Ireland.  Does an interest rate increase spell more bad news for homeowners who are nearing the end of their fixed term and for potential homeowners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#H00700"><p>Earlier this month, the ECB announced its latest monetary policy stance and what it expects to happen.  It announced a reduction in the new asset purchases that it undertakes, that it will consider the future of asset purchases from the third quarter of this year, and that interest rates will only increase after asset purchases have stopped.  That does not mean that asset purchases will finish from the third quarter but that it will be considered only at that time, and interest rates will not increase until after that.  That is the official policy stance of the ECB.</p> <p>  Interest rates are abnormally low.  At some time, interest rates will normalise.  I will not put a timeframe on that.  A normalisation of interest rates will affect floating rate mortgage holders first.  Ultimately, it will affect those who have fixed rates of short duration.  It will transmit through much of the market and lead to higher payments.  We have looked at two scenarios.  A one percentage point interest rate increase would lead to an additional repayment of approximately &euro;130 each month.  A two percentage point increase would lead to an additional repayment of approximately &euro;260 a month.  That would add to repayment issues.  If that came along with the current severe pressures, that would make matters worse for households.  Higher interest rates from the ECB will not bring down the current rate of inflation, which is currently 5.9%.  That would not address the nature of the problem.  Monetary policy acts with a lag.  One cannot cure high inflation now.  Higher rates could ultimately lead to stronger underlying demand pressures over the medium term, which need to be contained, otherwise higher inflation can set in.</p></speech>

It is what I have been trying to say and sometimes shouting at the television.  It is sometimes frustrating to hear about inflation and to hear people saying that we need to increase interest rates.  It is nearly a reflexive reaction that people say without examining matters.  I am delighted.  I will quote Dr. Cassidy at length whenever I get the opportunity.  He will be sick of me talking about him.  I thank him for that.  It was a nice upturn.</p> <p>  Predicting financial downturns is tricky.  One metric that has a good predictive record is yield curve inversion.  An inverted yield curve is a situation in which long-term debt is considered less risky than short-term debt of the same credit quality.  In other words, it is seen as riskier to borrow short term than long term because it is expected that trouble is just around the corner.  I was looking at the USA's yield curve on Monday.  The five-year and ten-year yield curve was inverted, as was the three-year and ten-year yield curve.  The two-year and ten-year yield curve was just 19 base points away from inversion.  It seems that where the USA is concerned, the market is pricing in a high recession risk.  These inversions occur against a backdrop of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.  What are the witnesses' views on higher interest rates increasing the risk of recession in the EU?  What are the implications for Ireland, particularly with regard to the significant tax debt that has been warehoused and the significant number of companies experiencing cashflow problems at being at risk of going under?  We saw a large construction company go bust this week.  What are the implications for wage increases which, so far, have been concentrated in certain sectors where there has been strong demand, as Dr. Cassidy mentioned?  We hope that will spill over into other, lower paid sectors.</p></speech>

We do not see it in the euro area.  Traditionally, an inversion of the yield curve often indicates that markets expert a downturn in the future.  They expect that longer-term interest rates will be lower than shorter-term rates.  Therefore, at some stage in the future, the Central Bank will reduce interest rates.  The Central Bank usually reduces interest rates because economic conditions are bad.  The Deputy is right in what she suggests.  I am not sure at the moment and think other factors could be behind this.  I would not put it down to expectations relating to the economic outlook.</p><p>At the moment the expected pace of interest rate rises in the US is very sharp.  Unless things divert from the current path there will be a number of interest rate rises in the near term, during 2022, into 2023.  It reflects a number of things but as much as anything it may reflect the sharp short-term pace, which will then normalise, rather than the fact that the downturn indicates recession.  I couch that with much uncertainty.  There are many reasons why a yield curve could be inverted.  Many market expectations can be reflected in that.  I do not think that is the main reason it reflects.</p><p> In regard to the second point, did Deputy Farrell mean the impact if a recession was to happen here or if there was a downturn in the economy, the impact that would have here, or was it more about interest rates?</p></speech>

It would take a very large shock to move into much more negative territory than that.  Of course there are vulnerabilities around the economy coming out of Covid-19 and they will be exacerbated with additional stresses now, due to the current crisis.  We will know much more about this when the income supports that are benefiting firms that have been affected by Covid-19 stop.  We will then know much more about the vulnerabilities that exist.  Much is currently exposed by these firms.  We will know much more during the course of 2022 about what firms that are currently on income supports will no longer be viable when those supports are removed.  The situation will become much clearer in terms of the pressures the Deputy quite rightly highlighted.</p></speech>

A piece in <i>The Irish Times</i>recently stated that energy industry figures here were predicting that Irish electricity prices will rise by 40% to 50%.  Obviously that is attributed to external factors and as Dr. Cassidy noted in his opening statement, supply-side issues.  Russian gas supplies, from what I can see, have actually been increasing rather than decreasing and according to one source by as much as 40%.  I also checked the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s most recent report produced this month, which stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The OPEC+ alliance agreed on 2 March to stick with a modest, scheduled output rise ... insisting no supply shortage exists.  Saudi Arabia and the UAE &ndash; the only producers with substantial spare capacity &ndash; are, so far, showing no willingness to tap into their reserves. </blockquote> <p>So, if supplies have not reduced but have actually increased and production costs are unchanged, is it speculation about future prices that is driving it?  I would be interested to hear that because obviously I have heard about the price of oil and gas futures having risen sharply but as we know, futures are essentially bets on the future and we know the future is extremely uncertain as we saw in the last few months with the invasion of Ukraine.  Who could have really predicted that?  What role is monopoly pricing playing?  Is price gouging a factor? </p></speech>

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities is better placed.  We are seeing enormous price increases for households, whether at the petrol pump or for electricity and gas but they are on the back of very large increases in international gas and oil prices.  These figures change every day.  International oil prices could be up maybe about 30% on where they were two years ago.  International gas prices are up by several hundred percentage points, they have increased by multiples.  That is actually something of a difference between the current energy crisis and previous ones.  Previous energy crises have nearly always been dominated by fluctuations in oil prices.  Fluctuations in gas prices is quite new and it shows the reliance that all of us have on gas.</p> <p>  In terms of gas and electricity, the latest increases show annual increases of 22.3% in one and 27.8% in the other.  That was in February and does not take into consideration any of the latest increases so there will be still further increases on top of that.  I reiterate that this reflects what we have seen.  Whether there is less or more than full pass-on, it primarily reflects what we have seen in international markets.  </p> <p>  The futures are for both to remain high and then gradually moderate from the second half of the year.  That is what the futures are expecting but to remain much higher than would have been expected two to three years ago.  However the expectation in future markets is to remain high but to moderate during the second half of the year.  In making our own forecasts, we use future prices for oil and gas to reflect those.  The one thing I always say about future oil and gas prices is that history and experience show that they are useless at forecasting what actually happens with oil and gas but they are probably better than anything else.  The ECB and ourselves have done a great deal of work and have not found any better way of forecasting.  We have done all the models we can.  They are not accurate but in such a volatile market, it is very hard to predict what will happen. </p></speech>

I thank our guests and I will speak to the comments.  I have a question in regard to interest rate increases.  What are the most feared or the most obvious consequences in the event of there being interest rate increases in this country and across Europe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#J01100"><p>First of all, interest rates are abnormally low.  At some stage they will begin to normalise.  When they do, I firmly believe that the increases will be gradual and modest.  When we see this normalisation it will be at a modest pace so I certainly do not see scenarios where we will get very rapid increases in interest rates.  I will mention two effects.  Households will undoubtedly see an increase in mortgage repayments.  I quoted some figures whereby a 1% rise in interest rates would lead to an increase of around &euro;130 per month for the average mortgage holders.  Those most affected would be those on floating rates or tracker mortgages.  That would be the most obvious impact that households would feel.  From an economic perspective, higher interest rates also work to slow down business investment within the economy.  Interest rates are usually increased because the economy is beginning to grow at a faster rate than the Central Bank is comfortable with and that is being reflected and shown up in higher interest rates.  Higher interest rates slow the rate of economic growth overall because they slow household consumption, because households are paying more on mortgages and have pay more to borrow money.  Firms have to pay more to invest.  They are two main channels through which an economy is affected.</p></speech>

That confirms my own thinking on the issue.  The problem is that nearly all mortgages are the level now that the mortgage holder cannot pay any more and the next series of properties being built will be even more expensive, resulting in a total inability of the householder to fund any increase in their mortgage at all.  My question that follows on from that is what action, if any, can be taken to dissuade people, those in the appropriate section, from increasing interest rates?</p></speech>

The ECB has been given one mandate which is price stability, defined as keeping inflation at 2% over the medium term.  The ECB will and has only got that mandate and if it sees risk to that price stability objective then it will act appropriately.  That is the one thing on the ECB&rsquo;s mind.  That is over the medium term, over the two to three-year horizon.  It does not refer to what the inflation rate in the current month is.  It is a medium-term objective.</p><p>That is the mandate given to the ECB.  It makes a lot of sense as a mandate because we may not have seen high inflation until this year.  We have had an average rate of inflation of 0.5% over the past decade.  In recent months, we are now seeing inflation for the first time since 2006 or 2007.  It is easy to forget the dangers of high inflation but we are seeing them now.  If high inflation were to persist for a number of years, we would see much worse problems.  The ECB's actions are taken with the view and objective of keeping inflation contained at 2% and not allow it to get out of control.  If central banks do not act, experience clearly shows that inflation rates can get out of control.  Prices and wages can develop into this unfavourable dynamic with a spiral between the two, which is very damaging economically and very damaging for households and businesses.  The purpose of ECB actions is to prevent inflation getting out of control over the medium term and to prevent the problems we have now becoming embedded in the economy.  </p></speech>

The role of the governor, as a member of the ECB, is to contribute to setting monetary policy for the euro system as a whole and not to take into consideration inflation developments in any specific country.  The president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the president of the Banque de France and every other national central bank are also legally obliged to take into consideration inflation for the euro system as a whole.  At present, they are roughly equal.  Irish inflation is approximately the same as that in the euro area at present.  Sometimes, it can be more in one country than the average or less in another country.</p></speech>

Is there any mechanism to deal with the issue of price increases that are not forced by increased costs but are simply from those who are jumping onto the bandwagon and increasing prices on the basis that everybody is doing it, which will lead to disaster?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.86" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#K00700"><p>In fact, that is one of the ways inflation can take hold.  When inflation gets very high, the pricing power of firms can increase, and the capacity of firms to pass on higher prices and to increase prices further becomes all the greater.  That is one of the reasons it is so important to prevent inflation getting out of hand in the first place because it can lead to that unfavourable dynamic of increased pricing power for firms and inflation getting higher and higher.  It is not that the ECB has specific powers to prevent any firms from increasing prices, but by keeping overall inflation at modest levels it reduces the risk of what the Deputy described.  In any country, if there are any issues around competition or pricing powers within an individual market, there will be other authorities to deal with it.  That is not the role of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

I am running in and out to other meetings so apologies for that.  I thank Dr. Cassidy and Dr. O'Brien.  In his opening statement, Dr. Cassidy mentioned that rural households are more expensive to run.  How concerned is he about this and the borrowing aspect to sustain that cost?  I am also concerned that many people where I live in rural Ireland are quite elderly and there is a lot of fuel poverty and food poverty in the area.  How can we sustain costs in those areas?</p></speech>

In that regard, without giving any opinion on any particular policy, which is the role of elected representatives rather than us, policies will be more effective when they are targeted at those who are most affected.  Policies targeted at lower income groups, such as fuel allowance, and at the consumption of petrol, diesel or electricity, such as rebates and reductions on excise duties, are examples of targeted measures because they get directly to the problem.  I agree with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

Does it believe the current plans are sufficient in that regard?  Does it believe the economy currently has the capacity to absorb those levels of investment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#K01100"><p>That is a very important issue.  We have a very ambitious, appropriately so, national development plan, targeted at housing, climate action and other things, as the Deputy mentioned.  Recent developments make it more challenging.  In particular, we are seeing higher building costs and higher costs in construction, partly because of the effects of the Covid pandemic in respect of supply chain disruptions and partly because of how the energy crisis is feeding in to that.  If the costs of delivering on the national development plan for the next decade increase, then it becomes more difficult.  That is one thing.</p> <p>  The second issue is that some parts of that plan, though not all, will require quite significant additional labour over the lifespan of the plan, including building houses and retrofitting.  Some of that labour will need to be sourced from abroad so there is always some risk as to whether the economy can attract the necessary labour over the duration of the plan.  At present, we do not anticipate or forecast any deviation but if the economy gets closer to capacity, there are then risks in respect of costs and availability of labour, which are things that need to be monitored over the duration.   </p></speech>

What does Dr. Cassidy believe they might be?</p></speech>

Housing is particularly important for this country.  There is a clear housing deficit that is, leaving aside current developments, the most important social and economic challenge.  It is an absolute requirement to significantly increase the number of houses we supply.  That becomes more difficult because of the very significant increase in the cost of building a house that will materialise due to what we are seeing in global markets.</p></speech>

The unemployment rate is falling to the mid-4% level.  At that stage, the economy is operating close to full capacity.  As demand increases, the risk then is there is no capacity to supply more so higher demand just feeds through, not to more output, but into higher prices.  I will be clear that we do not see overheating now.  We are not forecasting that it will arise but the risk of overheating develops, in essence, the better an economy does.  We are forecasting the economy to do well and the risk of overheating increases as a result.  We flagged that as the main medium-term risk two or three months ago.  Unfortunately, events have overtaken that but it has not gone away.</p></speech>

We are at the end of the speaker list but I invite members who want to come back in to indicate, if they are online, by putting their hand up.  I see Deputy Boyd Barrett has already done so.  I will give people a chance to do that and ask my questions in the meantime.</p> <p>  I am aware that Ireland's exposure to Russia in terms of imports and exports, and Russian lenders and banking, is pretty low.  Russia obviously operates in a global context as well.  If Russian banks and banking firms default, will that have an impact on inter-bank interest rates?  What might that mean?  What would the impacts of that be?  Is there a significant concern around that and, more broadly, around the impact of a default by the Russian state?</p><p>I am interested that while Ireland is not particularly exposed, we might intersect with them in certain sectors.  For example, I suspect there is lots of Russian investment, and probably lots of Irish investment too, in the London property market.  Are there particular sectors like that which the Central Bank might be aware of?  There is that aspect.  I will follow up in terms of Ireland's exposure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#L00200"><p>It is a very interesting issue.  I would say that we see little risk from these.  Certainly, there are few direct links.  The channels that we see are, first, energy imports and second, a global overall economic slowdown to which we would be exposed.  They are, very clearly, for us the two main effects.</p> <p>  On the possibility of default by the Russian banks, I rely little bit more the European Central Bank analysis for this because they have a greater insight into the European banking system.  The Irish retail banks, the ones that matter for the stability of our financial system, have negligible exposures to Russia, Ukraine, or anything affected by that.  In Europe there are some banks that are more exposed than others.  There are some individual banks that could find the situation problematic because of their exposures but in terms of the overall banking system, they are not a significant enough part to cause concern for the financial stability overall.  I would say the same for Ireland.</p> <p>  The London property market is an interesting example.  I would say that there are localised sectoral concerns like that.  In terms of the impact on Ireland, or those issues affecting the economy, those risks would be lower than the ones that I mentioned earlier.  The financial links with Russia through special purpose vehicles do not have direct implications because there is no interlinkage with the domestic Irish economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#L00300"><p>To follow up on that, I have been reading through ESRI's spring statement and their publication.  One of the things they pick out is Ireland's vulnerability in respect of aircraft leasing.  We manage in the region of &euro;100 billion in assets.  While they have not yet done so, there has been a lot of discussion about the possibility of Russia seizing aircraft.  This might have a larger impact on the industry here.  This might impact the Irish national accounts through investment flows and imports.  What are Dr. Cassidy's thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022032300002#L00400"><p>Yes.  It is a good example of what we were getting at previously, which is some sectors being affected.  Undoubtedly, Ireland has a large part of that leasing business, with around 60% of the world's leased aircraft being managed from Ireland.  I believe that 18 of the world's top 20 companies are managed from Ireland.  This is having an effect.  I do not have to hand the value of the transactions that might be affected.  As to how it affect the Irish economy, individual leasing firms clearly will be affected. Some will be affected more as some are more exposed than others.  The Chairman has made a very useful distinction in the question.  The national accounts will be affected to an extent.  The national accounts are very volatile in Ireland.  One reason is that aircraft leasing developments can affect investment and import developments but in fact they do so in a way that has no relevance for the actual Irish economy.  This is why we make these distinctions and why, for example, we say that GDP is not particularly relevant.  The relevance with these figures is that they can cause distortions to the statistics but they would not cause any increase or effect on incomes and employment within the Irish economy.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Dr. Cassidy very helpfully touched on things such as the labour market.  What does the Central Bank consider to be some of the challenges?  We have gone beyond the 10,000 mark in welcoming Ukrainians to Ireland.  We are not really sure what the end number might be.  Let us say that it is half of the 1.9% that Ireland would be responsible for, were 10 million Ukrainians to be displaced.  Our figure would then be in the region of 100,000.  That is a huge number of people.  We have talked a lot today about the supply-side issue and housing.  Has the Central Bank started work on that or has it thought much about the impact on the supply side for services, housing and how it might feed into the labour market?  This is not something that only Ireland will experience.  The EU in general and everybody will be welcoming a huge number of people from Ukraine for who knows how long.  Might we see a particular approach from the EU as a group to provide funding or put in place some kind of supports and a financial strategy?</p></speech>

I am sure he will reflect that while there will be economic implications, our thinking mainly has been on the humanitarian issues around this.  There will be economic effects.</p></speech>

Obviously, there will be plans put in place - I am sure - by the Government to try to address the most immediate need of people coming into the country.  As was mentioned, over the longer term and the longer that people are expected to be here, this would also feed through into the general housing demand.  That would be an issue.</p> <p>  With regard to the labour market impact, one also has to take on board the likely demographic profile of those who are coming.  It is going to be those who are most vulnerable, younger children and older people. That will have implications in that the labour market impact might not be as significant as if they were patterns of normal migration.  In the context of whether this is going to be a significant issue for Europe overall, undoubtedly "Yes".  The sheer scale of the numbers involved means that it is going to be a significant issue.  Whether there would be a European level of response is a matter for governments and the European Council to consider.  First and foremost, yes, there will be implications.  There will also be implications from a public finances perspective.  The broad balance, from the conversations so far, is that there would certainly be capacity, given the flexibility around the performance of the public finances to address some of these most immediate humanitarian challenges.  The labour market impact pales into  insignificance given the immediate humanitarian concerns.</p></speech>

What is the Central Bank's view about our ability to do that?  Even pre-Ukraine, we were reaching the point where rents are completely unaffordable for most people, house prices are completely unaffordable, and the cost of construction has reached a point where the market at least is not really capable of doing any better than that.  It could not actually bring the prices below or to the level where the majority of people could afford them.  Now we are seeing another inflation crisis on top of that, which means that the cost of building materials and so on is going up further.  Is it not the case that we are absolutely goosed in our ability to do the most basic thing, the thing that the Central Bank representatives have certainly identified, and on which I and most people would concur, as an absolute priority?  We are completely goosed in our ability to deliver on this.  Even if we did have significant increases in labour from anywhere in the world, as alluded to by the Chairman, it does not really deal with the bottleneck that we had reached.  I have a very definite view of this, which is the unthinkable.  We are looking at catastrophic market failure.</p><p>It is absolute system failure.  The market just cannot deliver any more and we must start thinking about the unthinkable, which means nationalising whole sections and effectively doing war economy stuff in order to be able to deliver the most basic things.  Arguably, we are reaching similar points with energy and other key services and goods we need to simply sustain our society at all.  What we are facing with inflation and all that is simply a market not being able to deliver and we must consider going beyond the market if we are to meet those basic needs and demands.  I do not expect the officials to agree with my ideology but do they think we are at an existential kind of crossroads here, in that all the orthodoxies, rules and economic consensus have come up against a brick wall and we must think of radical measures outside the box if we are going to address these basic things?</p></speech>

I cannot agree with all of it.  Let us agree there is a serious issue with the supply of housing.  In the Housing for All plan there is such a high share of proposed building of social and affordable housing that it clearly reflects the nature of the problem and the fact there is not the expectation the market itself will produce these houses.  Clearly, with such a problem, you need a lot of social and affordable houses to be built in order that we can house our population.  There are issues with the building, development, cost and production of housing.  It is absolutely nothing to do with labour and the Deputy is right about that.  On the arguments for this around the planning and development issue, I am not an expert.  So much has been written.  Books have been written about it.  The nature of the problem lies there.  We need to be able to build houses better and smarter.  I would not give up on the ability of the market to do that.  It needs reforms within the housing sector that will allow the market to do that.  That is where you will get the most efficient housing market, which is not to leave aside that there will always be a need for social and affordable housing and for the Government to build houses itself.  There will always be a need for that but it needs to be side by side with an efficient, flourishing private market.  There also needs to be an emphasis on creating the conditions for that private market.  We have seen signs of optimism with housing supply building but in the short term, that might have glossed over some of the structural problems that need to be addressed.</p> <p>  I agree with so many elements of the argument but not with the idea the solution will be to remove the private element of the market.  As the Deputy suggested, I would not go towards that.</p></speech>

We will see changes in global financial markets, energy markets and other markets.  I do not know what the extent of those will be.  I do not know whether some of those would have happened anyway.  I do not know whether some will go to some degree and then come back a bit.  It is much too early to tell but it is certain we will see some longer-term effects.

As I do not see anybody else indicating, I might finish on a question I forgot during my original round.  It is linked to the issue of inflation for SMEs in Ireland.  I am thinking especially of micro-sized businesses.  It may be in the region of 90%.  A very high number-----</p></speech>

Traditionally, they are very slow to access credit in Ireland.  It is under 20%.  Is it fair to say it is a very small amount?  One report I saw said in a six-month period, only 11% of microbusinesses sought credit.  Is that something that is on the bank's radar?  I am aware we are undertaking a banking review and that is all being looked at but in this very uncertain period of high inflation, all sorts of businesses, especially retailers, are under pressure.  Is that continuing reluctance to access credit - quite low levels or small amounts of it - a concern with respect to holding onto our SMEs?</p></speech>

There are a couple of reasons.  We have seen a significant trend increase in non-bank lending to SMEs.  There is nothing wrong with that.</p></speech>

We also know it is not always credit.  Sometimes for the very smallest businesses, especially those with a degree of an entrepreneurial element to them, there may be venture capital or other types of non-traditional approaches.  It may not even be lending but taking a share in the business.  Often that is the case for a riskier start-up firm or one where there is not the same collateral, as such, for a bank to lend against.  While some firms have struggled, many firms globally have built up a lot of their own buffers, finances and own deposits.  There is much evidence on that in Ireland and globally.  The world has been awash with liquidity, while there are no interest rates to be earned by one investing one's money elsewhere.</p><p>There are different ways, which are not bad, by which firms have been able to get credit.  The concern would be if there was an issue with firms going to banks seeking credit and the credit not being available.  If there was a supply issue we would be more concerned about that.</p></speech>

The point the Chairman raised about demand is certainly an issue and it is quite stark.  It has been quite persistent for a number of years for various reasons.  Certainly on the microside, if businesses have been operating for a long time, there is a memory of what happened previously that could also influence behaviour.  There is the cash buffer Dr. Cassidy mentioned but there has also been, to a certain extent as we have seen particularly during the past two years, the success of the support schemes that have been put in place, which have basically masked some of the need potentially for accessing liquidity through other means but that will be an issue, as was alluded to earlier, when those support schemes come to be wound down.  Hopefully, the broad thrust of economic growth will ensure firms will be taken on and they will not need the supports but they will still need, as some evidence from colleagues who have done research on this in this bank would show, liquidity support in some way, shape or form, whether it would be come through State backed schemes such as through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, other schemes or through the private market unaided.  There is definitely a need for that.</p></speech>

Each individual sector will have different exposures, particularly to energy costs.  They will also have different operating models and needs for reaching certain profitability margins, etc., to keep going.  We would expect the capacity of firms to operate when their costs have been increasing would be challenging.  Some firms operate in sectors where they can more easily pass on those costs to their customers while others are not in that position.  We would expect there to be a little bit of an impact and it could be quite different across the different sectors.</p></speech>

Mr. Igor Pokojn&yacute;.  No doubt the ambassador would have been interested in and listening to the contributions to last week's meeting.  We had a marathon five-hour meeting and I thank the Vice Chairman, Deputy Howlin, for chairing it.  We want to create a better understanding of what is happening in the ambassador's country and we are looking forward to this discussion today.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have a note on privilege to read and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witness's statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his remarks.  It is imperative the witness complies with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask members partaking by MS teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are in the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I call on the ambassador to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Mr. Igor Pokojn&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022032300002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chair and members of the joint committee.  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs the Slovak Republic's response to Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>  This unjustified Russian military aggression on Ukraine is a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of international law.  It is an extremely difficult time for Ukraine as well as for all of Europe, especially in these days when the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia eight years ago was marked on 18 March.  Ukraine needs universal political support, including the possibility of EU membership as well as financial and humanitarian aid from the international community.  Slovakia has repeatedly proven by its deeds that it stands with Ukraine.  Slovakia strongly supports the prospect of Ukraine's possible EU membership.</p> <p>  With partners from Europe and beyond the Atlantic, it was agreed that it is necessary to isolate Russia further to end Putin's military aggression and return peace to the European Continent.  The Russian Federation and Belarus will bear responsibility for this unprecedented violation of international law.</p><p>Slovakia is ready to support anything that will make the Russian and Belarusian regimes change their behaviour and end the invasion of Ukraine.<br/><br/>As a clear situation of immediate and serious humanitarian urgency has emerged in Ukraine, Slovak authorities make extensive use of the option provided by Article 6 of the Schengen borders code and allow for the entry into Slovak territory of persons who do not otherwise fulfil the usual entry requirements, such as being in possession of visas.  Documents allowing for the identification of the travellers are being accepted even if they are expired or damaged.  Information about the options available to persons incoming from Ukraine is available and frequently updated at <i>ua.gov.sk</i>.<br/><br/>Slovakia, as a neighbouring country with Ukraine, has opened its border and has so far received more than 270,000 refugees, mostly women and children.  It is estimated that an average of up to 10,000 refugees are entering Slovakia each day.  Since Slovakia is a small country of 5 million people and its border with Ukraine is only 100 km long, measures are being deployed to handle this large influx of people fleeing war.  Since not only nationals of Ukraine are fleeing war, Slovakia, alongside other relevant countries, has thus far organised 15 repatriation flights to India, China, Egypt and Morocco with more than 2,000 refugees on board.  Thirty-four special humanitarian trains with almost 3,000 refugees were organised from the Slovak-Ukrainian border to the Czech Republic.<br/><br/>The so-called Lex Ukraine Bill adopted by the Slovak Parliament addresses the issues of health and social insurance for asylum seekers, their employment and the presence of NATO troops on our territory.  Refugees who wish to stay in Slovakia can either request asylum or temporary protection, which is a new legal status approved by the Slovak Parliament after Russia invaded Ukraine.  The fastest way for refugees to receive support is to ask for temporary protection, which allows people to not only stay in Slovakia but also to receive accommodation, food, healthcare and work permits.  If a refugee has temporary protection, his or her healthcare fee is covered by the state.  This includes emergencies as well as further medical examinations and treatment.  It is possible to ask for temporary protection at the Slovak borders or at the departments of the alien police.  These currently operate non-stop and are dedicated solely to Ukrainians fleeing their country.<br/><br/>Refugees who cross the border are met by volunteers and state institutions offering humanitarian aid.  There are heated tents where people can sit and rest, and volunteers provide food and warm drinks.  Diverse collections of donations assembled by Slovaks are freely available on the spot, comprising items such as nappies, toiletries, durable foods, clothes and toys.<br/><br/>Transport from the border crossing to temporary accommodation is co-ordinated on the spot.  There are buses, taxi services and even volunteers who come with their cars offer to drive people.  Some municipalities and bus services provide free shuttle services.  Free of charge are also buses used to transport people from villages near the Ukrainian border to bigger Slovak cities with better infrastructure.  Furthermore, free transport is available for Ukrainian refugees on the trains run by the national carrier, which is the vast majority of trains in Slovakia.<br/><br/>A refugee child can register for a kindergarten or school.  More than 1,000 Ukrainian children have been enrolled in Slovak kindergartens, primary and secondary schools since the war in Ukraine began.  The ministry of education has been preparing a one-off financial contribution for schools to cover the increased costs.  Slovak schools are also working on employing teachers from Ukraine.<br/><br/>There is a dedicated website created for refugees from Ukraine, where they can register and apply for jobs.<br/><br/>With thousands of Ukrainian refugees arriving in Slovakia every day, the burden on the Slovak healthcare system will increase and some patients will have to be relocated to other countries in the near future due to an overload.  We consider the lack of staff, medicines and medical supplies to be the main problems for the future.<br/><br/>For Slovakia, as part of the EU and NATO, it is of key importance to note that since the very beginning we have had clear plans on how to strengthen our defence, especially along the eastern wing of the EU and alliance.  There is an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Uzghorod that can be attacked.  The runway of this airport ends just 50 m from the border with Slovakia.  This as an example of why it is vital for Slovakia to enhance the defence of our eastern border.<br/><br/>Last week, the Slovak Parliament approved the NATO enhanced forward presence in Slovakia, allowing the presence of up to 2,100 NATO soldiers.  The NATO unit consists of Czech, Dutch, Polish, Slovenian, American and German soldiers.  This unit brings some important capabilities that Slovakia lacks at the moment, notably the Patriot air defence system.  The defence of Slovakia and the eastern flank of NATO was discussed during last week&rsquo;s visit of the US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, to Slovakia.  He met with President Zuzana aputov&aacute;, Prime Minister Eduard Heger and Defence Minister Jaroslav Na.  They declared both countries' readiness to help Ukraine defend itself.<br/><br/>Based on the evaluation of the Slovak intelligence services, the Slovak Republic expelled three diplomats and workers from the Russian embassy for their activities in violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.<br/><br/>It is essential to continue to provide war-torn Ukraine with many forms of aid, especially humanitarian assistance.  It is important that providing such aid be sustainable in the long term.  Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the war are coming to Slovakia.  I would like to highlight the exceptional wave of solidarity with refugees which Slovaks and many other nations, including Ireland, are showing.  I also thank the European Commission and EU member countries that have positively responded and shown interest in helping us in this difficult situation.  We will continue to widely support Ukraine.  It is not alone.  I thank the committee members for their attention and am open to any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about two issues in particular.  The scale of the humanitarian crisis is obviously very large and the numbers entering Slovakia on a daily basis are phenomenal.  We are having discussions about that issue here.  We are probably getting that influx of refugees a little later because Slovakia borders Ukraine and is much closer to the war.  How is Slovakia managing the accommodation situation?  What did Slovakia do to find extra accommodation.  What types of venues, if I can put it that way, is Slovakia using?  Has the ambassador any useful tips on how we can prepare and best help those people who are coming to the country?</p><p>Has the ambassador any concerns?  I have heard some unverified reports.  I cannot attest to the correctness of what I am about to say.  Because of the scale of the numbers of people moving from Ukraine to its neighbouring countries, there is <i>ad hoc</i>transportation to bring people to different locations and perhaps to ferry them to other transportation links or other countries.  I would ask this question of a representative of any country, but how is Slovakia verifying that transportation and has the ambassador any concerns about the trafficking of, in particular, vulnerable women?  I ask that question without accusing Slovakia of anything.  I have heard some stories.  Because of the necessity for transportation, it is difficult to vet people and carry out background checks.  Many people are offering their services for free.  It is a panicked situation because we need to get people away from the borders and reception centres and deliver them to other locations.  There is no way of checking individuals who are providing those services, most of whom, I am sure, are doing the best of work.  However, as with any crisis, one or two people are looking to do the wrong thing, if I can put it that way.</p></speech>

Mr. Igor Pokojn&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022032300002#D00300"><p>I thank the Senator.  We are using everything we have for accommodation.  It was very difficult at the beginning.  We are now using hotels and any other accommodation that is available and not in use.  It is not only state property.  Private property is also being used.  As I mentioned, the Lex Ukrainian Bill provides for how these people should be accommodated and how to help the people who are providing the accommodation.  We are using everything available.  The committee will understand that we did not have time to think it over beforehand.</p><p>On the way, issues are arising which are challenging and we are resolving them.  The answer is that we are using everything we have because we are a very small country.  Compared to Ireland, we are 5 million people.  The committee can imagine that it is really a huge influx of people.</p><p> Regarding transport and how we can secure transport, first of all, it should be noted that most of the transport is provided by the state and municipalities.  This transport is safe.  The other point is that usually with the transport provided for refugees, there are also some security measures taken.</p><p> I am not sure if I mentioned, for example, that people are entering even without valid documents or without visas.  I am talking about the other side, people entering Slovakia.  It does not mean that we are not checking all these people.  If there are people who have no documentation, they are not forced to stay out of Slovakia.  They are welcome in Slovakia.  Nevertheless, they are going to special centres where they are provided with humanitarian aid as well as go through the registration the process.  We know who is entering and we know mostly where they are going or where they are staying but at times it is difficult to say.  For example, I know many Ukrainians are arriving in Ireland on flights, especially from Poland, and I was approached by some Irish friends and colleagues.  Since the Slovak language and the Ukrainian language are very similar, I was asked to approach our community to ask if people had somewhere people could stay, especially during the St. Patrick's Day week because accommodation was all booked out.  What I am saying is that like here and like every country where there is a huge influx of refugees, Slovakia is doing practically everything to accommodate them and it is manageable so far.</p></speech>

I have been trying to write down this question.  In advance, I apologise if the question is offensive or if it is naive.  I suppose I am asking to be educated somewhat in respect of Slovakia.  My understanding is that Slovakia is an independent country but in the past, if I am not mistaken, it was within, or part of, the Soviet Union, whether it was forced to be or not.</p></speech>

Has Ukraine been fighting for independence since the wall fell?  What I saw over the past decade was that there was a struggle there.  There was unrest, although it was quite silent.  I have sometimes talked to my friends about this.  There was not much noise about the Ukrainian struggle a decade ago but now it is where it is at.  I am interested in the Slovak perspective.  Have the Ukrainians faced a similar struggle for independence since the wall fell?  Has Russia been trying to pull them in?</p></speech>

Have Ukrainians been looking for independence since the wall fell?  Has there always been that sense of Russia saying, "No, you are not going"?  I apologise for my question.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that we are quite a young country.  Like Ireland, Slovakia is 100 years old.  In 2018, we celebrated 100 years since the establishment of Czechoslovakia, by which I mean the first independent state of Czechs and Slovaks.  As Slovakia, we are independent from 1993.</p> <p>  If the Deputy remembers 1968, Czechoslovakia was an independent country.  During the Second World War, it was liberated by the Soviet army.  Until 1947, Czechoslovakia was not a communist or socialist country but then there were elections and Czechoslovakia became some kind of communist country at the time.  Nevertheless, Czechoslovakia tried to get out from under the influence of the Soviet Union in 1968 and we were invaded by Soviet troops and by troops from the Warsaw Pact.  I am saying this only to explain that we are really very sensitive to what is going on now in Ukraine.  We are not alone in having experienced this.  For example, in 1956, Hungary was in the same situation.  Poland was also in this situation.  The struggle to get out from under the influence of the former Soviet Union was experienced by all countries and this applies to Ukraine as well.</p> <p>  We were in a better situation after 1989, following the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe.  Ukraine was not so fortunate because Ukraine stayed under the influence of Russia.  This resulted in the annexation of Crimea and of Abkhazia.  One can see there are spots, or countries, that Russia has invaded or that are under Russian influence - to check on or control what is going on in these countries.  I am talking not only about Ukraine but about Georgia and the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, which, in English, is called Transnistria.  One can see that these attempts by Russia or some forces in Russia to control or to check neighbouring countries is still going on and these countries are trying to get rid of this influence.</p> <p>  I could not believe Russia would do something like this - a military invasion to bomb a neighbouring country - especially as Russians and Ukrainians fought for freedom together in the Second World War.  Czechoslovakia was liberated not only by the Russian army.  It was the Soviet army consisting of soldiers from all the former Soviet republics - the Baltic states, Ukraine, Georgia.</p> <p>  I am not sure if this is enough.</p></speech>

As much as this is becoming more real for us, it is much closer to Slovakia.  Slovakia is physically much closer to Ukraine and there is a particular relationship there.  I appreciate just how real it is.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, the ambassador spoke about the expulsion of three diplomats and workers from the Russian embassy for their activities.  I do not know how much detail the ambassador could go into, but could he give us some information in relation to that?  We have our own relationship with the Russian Embassy here.  A number of us would like to see considerable movement, if the ambassador knows what I mean, in respect of diplomats and possibly others.</p></speech>

It is a similar situation to that in Ireland.  It is the same in Slovakia.  It is the same in the Czech Republic.  To explain, usually when diplomats are expelled from a country there is no information except the usual statement that it was a violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.</p><p>This time a video was released in Slovakia and published.  There was a Russian diplomat - if I am not mistaken it was a deputy military attach&eacute; - who bribed and was giving money to a Slovak national for getting some secret information and getting access to other people with this secret information.  This is a laugh video.  It is quite long.  Personally, I was surprised that it was published but I fully understand why it was published.  Especially now, in this situation people should know why such steps are taken.  If you watch the video, you hear the discussion between the Russian diplomat and the Slovak national about what secret information and to what people with such information they would like to get access, and giving money.  It is all on the video.  There is no need to explain further.  This is the best explanation.</p></speech>

My follow-up relates to what has Slovakia been dealing with in relation to Russia over the past period.  We have a better notion now of hybrid and cyberattacks, etc., and even the relationship between the Russian state and some of its technical subcontractors that it can employ from time to time.  Given the situation, we would have our own fears now but Slovakia, as I said, is much closer.  Slovakia has a relationship with them that was not necessarily perfect.  I suppose my question is what has Slovakia done in relation to that.</p> <p>  Where does Slovakia sit in relation to this?  We are all guessing where Vladimir Putin is going.  We are not entirely sure.  We hope he opts for a way out of this and we end this disastrous war, but my question is where the Slovakian people are and where the Slovakian Government regarding the fears of what are the long-term plans of the present Russian regime.</p></speech>

In our region, we have also experienced in recent history war in the Balkans.  Unfortunately, this part of Europe is not immune to such violent issues.</p> <p>  As for our relationship with Russia, like everyone else, we really want correct relations.  Slovakia is very dependent on, for example, Russian raw materials such as oil and gas.  It is also for the economy very important to have good relations with Russia, and also with Ukraine.  We import a lot of raw materials from Ukraine.  Not only for our country, Slovakia, but for all of Europe - Germany as well - it is important to have very good relations, but not only good relations that "you are my boss and I will say do everything you will ask".</p></speech>

The central and eastern European countries are very exposed to cyberwar, but especially to disinformation campaigns.  There are huge disinformation campaigns.

First, the idea of a model "Lex Ukraine"  is one we might have a look at - codifying what refugees are entitled to in a legal framework - because part of the issue we have now is how, in a co-ordinated way, to provide information to people arriving here.  I am conscious that in his presentation, the ambassador tells us that 10,000 refugees a day are crossing into Slovakia.  We have had 10,000 in total so far and the scale is of an entirely different order.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  Slovakia provides, within this Lex Ukraine, the provision for people to work in Slovakia.  The information we seem to be getting is that many people, particularly moving as far as the neighbouring countries of Ukraine, in their mind at least have the notion that they will return home over the next few weeks or, at most, months.  Is Slovakia making provision for a long-term hosting of significant numbers?  Has the ambassador any notion how long refugees will stay in Slovakia?  There have been 270,000 refugees to date.  If the bombardment of Kyiv increases, there will be probably a great deal more.  How many will be long-stay residents of Slovakia?</p> <p>  In that context, is Slovakia working at a trans-European level to share the number of refugees across European countries on any structured basis?  I am conscious that the focus has to be on the wishes of the refugees themselves.  They cannot simply be transported to a country they know nothing about if they are unwilling to move but at the same time there is limited capacity, if we are talking about 10 million displaced people right now, for neighbouring countries to cope on their own.</p> <p>  What is the ambassador's expectation in terms of duration of stay?  Is it possible to have one?  Second, what level of co-ordination on a trans-European level is there for a sharing of accommodation across all member states and, indeed, beyond the member states of the European Union?</p></speech>

It is a really good question.  I would like to know the answer as well as to how long it will last.  Unfortunately, we have to be prepared for everything.</p><p>This is why we are trying to provide refugees with everything - not just with accommodation but also with jobs.  For example, as I mentioned, children are enrolled in Slovak schools.  It looks like Mr. Putin's plan to have a very fast blitzkrieg invasion of Ukraine to change the regime and that everything would be fine has not worked out.  It looks like it will take longer than the Russian regime would like.  It will be long term and unfortunately we need to be prepared for this.</p><p> Not all the people who are entering Slovakia are staying in Slovakia.  Many of these refugees are going to other countries.  Most of the first wave of refugees were Ukrainians who had relatives in Europe.</p></speech>

However, we do not know because once refugees enter Slovakia, they are cleared and they may go.  If they apply for asylum or temporary protection, we know that they are there and we take care of them.  However, many are just registering and going to Germany or other countries, even to Ireland.  We do not know, but we are preparing for everything.  At the EU level there was the activation of the temporary protection, which is a really historic step.  I am trying to find answers to how long it will be; there is no answer yet.  We hope it will be not so long, not only for our sake but especially for the sake of refugees.</p></speech>

The immediate neighbours have finite capacity.  Right now, the biggest burden is on Poland.  The ambassador can talk about providing school places, but it is not possible to provide infinite school places for millions of refugees.  While I hate the phrase, there will need to be burden sharing - a sharing of welcome across Europe.  How can we do that consistent with ensuring that people are allowed to move to countries they choose to move to?  Is that a challenge?</p></speech>

All European countries are working on something that will be permanent.  Following the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council there will be an EU summit.  We do not know the answer yet but we are working it.  European countries answered very swiftly and I am really happy that they are sharing the burden.  We do not have the problems we had with the migration process in 2015 and 2016.  No country has opted out and refused to take any refugees.  The response at the EU level is great and the burden is being shared.  Special humanitarian logistics hubs have been opened in countries neighbouring Ukraine - in Poland and Romania.  Two hubs have also opened in Slovakia recently.  This is one of the ways EU help is provided to Slovakia.</p></speech>

His country faces an extraordinary challenge with the refugee crisis.  A country with a population of 5 million has already received more than 270,000 displaced people.  This morning's exchange habes en useful to understand the practical and logistical problems because we are just suddenly experiencing those ourselves with the refugees who have come here.  We have challenges with accommodation, health, education and employment - all the issues the ambassador has just raised.  This morning's exchange is very useful to examine how Slovakia is dealing with these issues.</p> <p>  Obviously, the Slovak Republic is part of NATO.  How important is Slovakia's NATO membership for its security and defence?  The ambassador was earlier asked how fearful he was about the Russian Federation's intentions.  I would be interested to hear his views on that.</p> <p>  In his presentation, the ambassador rightly points out that the EU has provided financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and that it needs to examine Ukraine's membership of the EU.  The EU has obviously provided lethal weapons and non-lethal equipment to Ukraine through the European peace facility.  Does the ambassador believe the EU is doing enough for Ukraine?  Similar to my question about NATO, how important is EU membership to the Slovak Republic?  Does the ambassador see this entire conflict in terms of a battle for the survival of liberal democratic values and the threat to democracy?  How big an issue is that?  Is it a factor in what is happening in the ambassador's region at this time?  </p></speech>

We are a small nation.  We have had a violent experience and we are very sensitive.  The ambassadors of Poland or Romania also appeared before the committee.  I think they also mentioned they look with some discomfort to the history of their relationship with the former Soviet Union.  In this regard NATO is our main guarantee of security.  I am talking about Slovakia now.  We were really struggling to get into NATO as soon as possible and we are quite happy that we are there.  We are a small landlocked country neighbouring Ukraine with Russia not so far away.  We would be unable to defend ourselves by our own means.  For us, NATO membership is very important.  It is our crucial guarantee of security.</p> <p>  I mentioned the deployment of the enhanced NATO forces into Slovakia - the 2,100 NATO soldiers.  The deployment of this NATO unit into Slovakia is not only important for Slovakia's defence, but it is important as a signal to other countries, especially to Russia, that Slovakia is not alone just as other NATO countries are not alone.  If there is any aggression towards Slovakia, it will be aggression towards all of NATO.  It is very important to us to have this feeling of security and that we are not alone.</p> <p>  Our feelings are even stronger regarding our EU membership.  I have often compared Ireland to Slovakia.  We are two small countries, both with open economies.  We struggled for our independence.  We have spent approximately 100 years as independent countries.  There are many similarities.  It is good to be in good company with friends who can help us or we can help them.  Being an EU member is very important to us and it has helped us.  Slovakia improved in economic and social aspects.  It was a very good step for Slovakia to enter the EU.</p></speech>

Is there a common understanding in this context that enables a support system for small countries of similar size in the EU?</p></speech>

Instead, we are all equal partners, with the same vote as Germany or France.  Slovakia has only a few million people, so we cannot compare based on the number of inhabitants, but we have the same vote.  We can vote on what we like and what we do not, and our vote counts equally.  Regarding other small countries, and there has been no similar opportunity, more than a year ago, in February 2021, the Ireland-Slovakia Parliamentary Friendship Group was established in the Oireachtas.  The only contact we had at the time was during the video conferences.  This is the first time I have entered the Oireachtas buildings since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am happy to be here.  This is an example of our good relations because even during Covid-19, we were able to establish the Ireland-Slovakia Parliamentary Friendship Group.  Let us imagine that.  It was a time when everything was closed, but we managed it.  That means there are very good relations between countries, including between Slovakia and Ireland and with other countries as well.</p></speech>

It is fine, though, if His Excellency chooses not to answer.  Is the EU doing enough in respect of Ukraine?  Would the ambassador's view be that NATO looks after defence and the EU looks after all other issues?  I hope this question is clear.</p></speech>

Ireland is a neutral country and it is providing great help to Ukraine, but not any lethal weapons.  We fully understand the position of each country.  For us, however, it is important to be part of NATO.  The situation in Ukraine has demonstrated to other European countries that co-operation between different organisations is important, such as between NATO and the EU.  It is important that we work together.  I am aware there are different views on why we are trying to build military capabilities in the EU when we already have NATO.  We must, however, still co-operate, because we never know what will happen next.  The situation in Ukraine has shown this very clearly.  Nobody expected it.</p></speech>

I thank the ambassador for the presentation.  He clearly conveyed the immediacy and reality of what is happening and that 10,000 refugees are crossing the border into Slovakia daily.  It says much about the humanity of Slovakian, Polish and Irish people that we are willing to take in so many refugees amidst all this horror.  If just one positive thing has come out of this situation, it is this aspect.</p> <p>  I have two questions, but I will make a general comment first which relates to the last few questions and comments from Deputy Haughey and the Chair.  The ambassador spoke about Slovakia's struggle to escape from the influence of Russia.  I spent 15 years in the European Parliament, and it was not until I met people from Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Hungary and, indeed, Ukraine that I was able to gain some sense of their histories and why they jealously guard their independence, in just the same way we do ours.  I refer to the histories of those countries and the context from which they are coming.  I have come across some people who, certainly before this war started, had some sense that Ukraine was perhaps slightly ambivalent about Russian control.  The people I met did not understand, as the ambassador said, that countries wanted an equal partnership with Russia.  There is a feeling of being sisters and brothers, but that it must be an equal partnership.  Certainly, there has been a lack of understanding here about why countries like Slovakia are part of NATO and why they need to be part of that organisation.  I was taken by the ambassador's comments to the effect that he fully understands our neutrality.  It is extremely important to us, but it is also important that we fully understand Slovakia's situation and why it is part of NATO, and needs to be, for its security.</p> <p>  The subject of my first question was referred to by Senator Chambers when she spoke about human trafficking.  Commissioner Johansson said yesterday that the European Commission had activated a network of anti-trafficking co-ordinators.  I wonder if they have started to work.  With 10,000 people coming into Slovakia daily, it is extremely difficult, if not almost impossible, to manage that process and to put other structures in place at the same time.  We must, however, do our very best to protect people, and women and children in particular.  Has that process started?  Is anything happening in that regard?</p> <p>  My second question concerns what was said about employing teachers.  How is that initiative working?  Are there issues with language, etc.?  I refer to healthcare staff, because many of those will be coming into Slovakia as well.  Is the country in any way managing to integrate those people into its healthcare systems?  The ambassador almost mentioned that some of the main issues being faced relate to a lack of staff and medical supplies.  That is crucial.  Is any European mechanism in place, or being put in place, to try to ensure the availability of adequate supplies for countries such as Slovakia, Poland, etc., that are on the front line in receiving Ukrainian refugees?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Igor Pokojn&yacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022032300002#H00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for her kind words and for understanding our mutual positions.  Regarding human trafficking, frankly, I am not able say much now because I do not have information from on the ground.  Therefore, I am unable to comment on this topic.  I am sorry, but I do not wish to just make up something to tell the Deputy.  I do know that security is important to us and that we have experience with human trafficking.  As I mentioned, I worked as a consul in the UK, and we had many cases of human trafficking there at that time.  Therefore, I understand the problem and I know what the Deputy is talking about, but I am unable to say how the situation stands in respect to refugees now.  However, precautions are being taken because we are well aware of this issue and we have previous experience of it.</p> <p>  I turn now to the topic of employing teachers and what the Slovakian Ministry of Education is trying to do in this regard.  The Slovakian and Ukrainian languages are not the same; they are different.  It sounds like they are practically similar, but they are really different.  In the eastern part of Slovakia, however, people speak a language similar to Ukrainian.  Therefore, even before the war, we had some Ukrainian cultural institutions, such as Ukrainian theatre.</p><p>We had it before in Slovakia, especially in the eastern part.  This is nothing new for us.  The minister of education is working hard to have a mechanism as soon as possible.  You have to find these teachers because when such a huge influx of people enters a country and you are registering them, the first questions are "Are you well?" and "Do you need any help?"  The emotional situation of these people is very bad.  They just fled their own country.  They left everything behind.  It takes several days for them to realise where they are and to look at how they can help their countrymen.  </p><p> We experience lack of medical staff.  As yet, we are just starting to experience it but it will be a problem for us.  That is why it was discussed at EU level during the recent meeting of ministers of health.  They discussed what to do and how to do it.  People will have to be transported to other countries for medical services or surgery.  This is being discussed now.  We have and will have this problem.  Not only us, but all front-line countries will come across this problem.</p></speech>

That is something that can move.  It is to do with supply and logistics.  Is there anything in place at European level to try to ensure the medical supplies that are needed can move from one place to another?  If not, does the ambassador think there should be?</p></speech>

I mentioned the logistics hubs or humanitarian hubs that have been established in Poland, Romania and, now, Slovakia.  We have two hubs, one of which was opened just yesterday.  It is for the humanitarian route not only to Slovakia but also to Ukraine.  Ukraine is still living and a big part of it is still free.  Our consulate general in Ukraine left Kyiv but is still working in the eastern part of the country.  It is not only our diplomats, but diplomats from other countries as well.  We are working on delivering humanitarian aid to Ukraine.  There are such mechanisms at EU level.</p></speech>

I commend his country and Government on their response.  It is obviously very challenging because 270,000 refugees going into any country, fleeing war and persecution, is an awful lot.  An increase of about 5.5% in the population over four weeks can be expected to put huge pressures on systems.  The ambassador touched on how much pressure his country's health service is under at this point and into the future.  Does the ambassador have a figure for how many of the 270,000 refugees are still in the country?  How many have moved on to other countries?  I know it is very fluid when we are dealing with up to 10,000 additional refugees arriving every day.</p> <p>  Deputy Harkin touched on the major concern highlighted by the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, Yiva Johansson, when she spoke about the potential for human trafficking, particularly of children.  An estimated figure has been given for Romania of 500 unaccompanied minors or children having arrived there.  Does the ambassador have a figure for children or unaccompanied minors who have arrived in Slovakia?  I appreciate he did not have the full information as to what response is being taken or whether the actions that have been announced have been implemented yet, but he might have a rough figure.</p> <p>  Last week we had the ambassador's colleagues from a number of countries before the committee, including the Moldovan ambassador.  One thing she said that struck me was that they were only starting the conversations with some of the NGOs and international humanitarian groups, the likes of the Red Cross.  What action on the ground have those NGOs undertaken?  Is more assistance required from the humanitarian perspective?</p></speech>

We do not have the exact figure.</p> <p>  Regarding accompanied or unaccompanied minors, I do not have any information.  I believe there is such information but I do not have it right now so I cannot help with that.  There was a photo of a boy of about 10 years of age, who was unaccompanied.  It went through Twitter all over the world.  He had only a phone number and his name written on his hand.  He was received by Slovakia and, in a few days, the Slovak authorities were able to find his family living in Europe.  They are already together.  That is not an answer to the question.  There are such issues.  There are many unaccompanied minors but we are doing what we can.  The good thing is that the registering process is a good one.  No one can enter without us knowing who he or she is or where he or she is going, but I do not know the exact figure.</p> <p>  Regarding NGOs, crisis management is working in every country.  We had plans with crisis management from day one.  I highlight the role of NGOs.  In the first days, they played a huge role.  Then the state agencies and organisations came in and it all started like a fluent mechanism.  NGOs are important in any humanitarian crisis.  I am not saying it is most of them but a huge number of volunteers are not working with NGOs but just coming, bringing humanitarian aid and coming with their cars.  They are asking: "Have you somewhere to sleep?" and are saying "Come on, you can stay with me."  It is not that they just come and pick someone up and choose someone to stay with them.  It is a process.  You cannot just come to pick up a person.  There is a mechanism for this.</p> <p>  The question was about NGOs.  Yes, they are very important.  They played and will play a huge role in this.  </p></speech>

It concerns a move towards defence co-operation within the EU, the EU having its own defence capacity and how this would sit with NATO.  I discerned last week that there was concern that the defence of Georgia, Moldova and the rest of Europe is anchored on ensuring the presence of the United States and that anything that might be perceived as moving away from that would diminish the strength of the protection.  It is all well and good unless someone like Mr. Trump is elected or Mr. Trump is elected again.  Could one depend on the support of the United States in those circumstances?  It is a complicated question.  I do not know whether the ambassador has a view on how enhanced security arrangements within the EU might play against the issue of NATO.</p></speech>

Not only are there American soldiers but there are also other soldiers.  The enhanced NATO groups were established after 2014, after the annexation of Crimea.  Slovakian troops are also deployed in Baltic states.  Yes, Slovakia will support defence and regard being part of NATO as crucial.  Is that what the Deputy is asking about?

He has put on the table the conversation about possible US involvement or non-involvement in the future.  That brings up the wider question of possible Russian involvement in elections in Europe and other places, but that is for another day.  Putting European militarisation on the agenda and making moves on it at the minute probably only reflect the reality concerning European battlegroups and arrangements made under previous European treaties, etc.  However, considering that we want to make room for Ukraine to enter the EU, does putting these matters on the agenda make negotiation more difficult?  I hope Mr. Vladamir Putin will want a way out at some point and that there will be a negotiation.  I am not going to determine what that negotiation will entail, but we have all probably heard people state off the record at European gigs that we have a general idea where this could go.  It is on the agenda that the Russians will not accept Ukraine joining NATO.  Is there a difficulty in putting on the agenda the question of the EU setting itself up as, or highlighting the point of, a military alliance in that its doing so would become part of a negotiating gambit, just creating difficulties for Ukraine in the future?  I am not saying we should make things easy, because there is ultimately only one person at fault, namely, Vladimir Putin.  The big fear is that he is not looking for a negotiation or way out.  I hope he is, however.  Could we just be creating a difficulty by doing what I have described?</p></speech>

No conflict or war can be resolved without negotiations.  The European Union as a whole supports the negotiations.  At the end of the day, any deal reached between Russia and Ukraine should be acceptable to Ukraine.  President Zelenskiy already showed us there are some red lines that he is not willing to cross.</p> <p>  I am not part of the negotiations, but I heard Ukraine already admitted it will not be trying to apply to join the NATO alliance or any military organisation.  We cannot discuss it right now because we do not know what is going on.</p></speech>

Even in Ireland we can already see that something is going on with gas prices.  The impact will be on Europe as a whole and the rest of the world.  We support sanctions against Russia because we think it is one of the ways to eliminate Russian aggression.</p> <p>  The situation in Slovakia depends on Russian energy carriers.  There are two views.  On the one hand, this can accelerate our transition to carbon neutrality, which is good.  On the other hand, it will be very challenging and require mutual solidarity among EU countries.  As I mentioned, Slovakia is dependent on a supply of gas, oil or raw materials from the east.  Now it will rely on that coming from the west.  In this sense, Slovakia would be at the end of the supply chain.  </p> <p>  We support sanctions.  We think they will be challenging, but necessary.  They are painful not only for Russia.  They hit Russia where it hurts, and we can see that, but they also hit other countries.  Nevertheless, it is important to isolate Russia.  However, we will strongly support mutual action at an EU level in terms of the supply of raw materials.  We will not be alone.  We are all in the same boat.</p></speech>

On behalf of members, we are grateful for his contributions and helping us to develop a deeper understanding of the situation.  We will leave him with the final word.  He might attempt an answer on whether he sees a further escalation of the aggression in non-NATO aligned countries.  It is a speculative question, but that is a genuine fear.  Will the aggression grow or continue?</p> <p>  As a committee, we would like to acknowledge the role of Slovakia in providing the solidarity that is so evident against the backdrop of courage and fortitude on behalf of the Ukrainian people and the nightmare they are enduring.  I would like to acknowledge the solidarity of the ambassador's citizens in facing such adversity.  There is hope in his contribution today, such as his call for equality, like mindedness and working with people.  He made reference to the parameters of the European Union in terms of equality and a level playing field, which is what we are looking for.  </p> <p>  We are thankful for his contribution and message of hope.  However, as Deputy Harkin pointed out we have an immediate issue to deal with here and we are with the ambassador all of the way on that.  I ask for an attempted answer, having acknowledged his message of hope.  Is there a very real concern about a further escalation in non-NATO aligned countries?</p></speech>

We all hope that it will end as soon as possible, but unfortunately it does not look like that will happen because Russia is very clear that it wants to fulfil its aim to take control of Ukraine and it does not matter how that is being covered.  Ukraine and the rest of the democratic world is also very clear that they will not accept it.</p> <p>  The blitzkrieg has not happened for Russia, which means that it looks like it will take some time to get somewhere.  This is why sanctions are important.  Without support and finance for the war, Russia could not bear all of the burden.  We hope it will end as soon as possible, but we do not know how long it will take.  We can now see that the Russian military is targeting and bombing civilian areas and targets, such as hospitals, schools and residential areas.  I am afraid that in that sense things will escalate a little bit.  It is also perhaps a sign that Russians are trying to help themselves as much as possible by doing practically anything.  We hope it will end as soon as possible.  </p> <p>  I am really thankful for the opportunity to be here.  I consider this a very useful exchange of views.  It was also very useful for me to hear the views of the committee and what they think about this, because Ireland is on the western side of the European Union.  Nonetheless, it is also part of it, and is very involved in this process and helping the Ukrainian people as much as possible.  The positive side is that Ukraine is not alone and we are here to help and show an example of what we can do.  This is what the European Union is about, namely helping colleagues and people.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Once again, we will stay in touch.  We can learn from each other.  If it is possible, I ask him to send on information on how his department of education is working towards identifying Ukrainian teachers.  Marino College, in Deputy Haughey's constituency, has a very good migrant teacher programme which it has been working on for years.  It is looking to expand that.  Any information that the ambassador could give us in terms of identifying Ukrainian teachers might be of help to us.</p><p>I again thank him.  As a committee, we want to keep this issue very much on the agenda.  History is repeating itself, unfortunately.  I remember reading <i>Dynamo</i>, a football book set against the backdrop of 1942 when Operation Barbarossa was very much part of Kyiv.  At the time I read it, I thought all of this was behind us and would never happen again.  Reality bites, and it has bitten really hard this time.  </p><p>It is important for us as a country that is part of the European Union to not just show solidarity but to keep this issue very live on the agenda.  We will stay in touch with the ambassadors of individual countries along the eastern Baltic.  We had a great five-hour meeting last week.  We do not want to dip in and out of this issue; we want to have continuity because this is an important juncture in the history of the world.  We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainians.  We look forward to further engagement.</p><p>I thank the ambassador for his honesty and openness, and his diplomatic skills with some of the questions.

We had a very good discussion on Second Stage in the House and there is broad agreement on the Bill.  A number of amendments have been put down by others with a view to improving the Bill and I also have a significant number of amendments.  I have no doubt that we will have further changes on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  In essence, the purpose of the Bill is to transpose the 2019 EU directive on the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law and provides for a set of minimum standards for the protection of whistleblowers across the Union.  It amends Ireland's existing national whistleblower protection law, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, to give effect to the provisions of the directive and it also goes beyond that.  We are not just transposing the directive but we are providing for the establishment of an office of the protected disclosures commissioner in the Office of the Ombudsman.  I look forward to a good discussion today on committee stage and, hopefully, we can make progress on the Bill.</p></speech>

We will all remember what those people who came before our committee had to say with their own lived and personal experiences and how it had impacted them.  There is strengthening now in the making of protected disclosures and I and my colleague, Deputy Buckley, have also tabled amendments to the Bill.  We are happy to do anything that can strengthen and benefit those people who are going forward and making protected disclosures but we also have to think of those who have made previous protected disclosures and who have suffered greatly as a result.  We cannot have a situation where people are left behind and we need to ensure that there are always greater protections for whistleblowers because without whistleblowers in the past, there would have been many horrific situations that we would not have been aware of.  We need to commend all those people who have come forward.</p></speech>

This is a technical amendment to section 6(7) of the principal Act to remove the reference to subsection 7A of section 5 of the principal Act as it is to be repealed by section 3 of the Bill.  Section 5(7A) was inserted into the principal Act by the European Union (Protection of Trade Secrets) Regulations 2018, which provided for the transposition of the trades secrets directive, TSD.  The TSD required that the person who made a protected disclosure could only disclose information deemed to be a trade secret if they acted for the purpose of protecting the public interest.  Article 21.7 of the whistleblowing directive clarifies the legal position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the TSD on the one hand, and the protection of whistleblowers on the other, and makes clear that a person who makes a disclosure of a trade secret in accordance with the rules of the whistleblowing directive should not be subject to this public interest test.  Accordingly, this provision is being repealed.  This amendment tidies up the principal Act by removing a cross-reference to section 5(7A) that will be rendered redundant by its repeal by section 3.  These are, therefore, technical amendments.</p></speech>

I do not believe that the reporting requirements of this Bill are particularly onerous or that they place a significant administrative burden on companies.  I would be concerned that removing companies with less than 50 employees could cause greater risks.  Specifically, these kinds of companies can be dealing with very large sums of money but may have very few employees.</p><p>They might even be serving clients who could potentially be engaging in abuse or regulatory avoidance.  I am thinking of the Cum-Ex scandal, the revelations in the Panama Papers, the Russian connected special purpose vehicles using the IFSC and so on.  We have a situation where there could be large amounts of money and it could have a large impact but it would relate to firms with very small numbers of employees.  Therefore, it is important to include it for all firms and not limit it to more than 50 employees since some of these firms may have small numbers of employees but deal with large sums of money.</p></speech>

I have dealt with many protected disclosures and have raised some in the House with the Minister.  There are smaller companies with perhaps eight or 12 employees that have major contracts, with the HSE for example.  We said at the outset that we would try to be inclusive and to protect everybody.  I worry that if we exclude smaller companies, people will slip through the cracks and we will be back here again in 12 months with an amendment Bill trying to get these things resolved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022032300002#C00300"><p>I thank Deputies Farrell and Buckley for raising this issue and for their amendments.  This is something I have considered carefully and discussed with the officials at length.  Before setting out the reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments, I want to make it clear that the obligation on some employers to have internal channels and procedures is an administrative requirement separate from the right of workers to report wrongdoing to their employer.  Therefore, there is no diminution here of the rights of people to make a protected disclosure.</p> <p>  Section 6(1) of the Protected Disclosures Act provides that a worker is protected if they report a relevant wrongdoing to their employer.  This applies irrespective of the size of the organisation they work for and the Bill does not change this.  Therefore, regardless of whether their employer has a formal reporting channel or not, all workers, public and private, remain entitled to all of the protections of the legislation.  That is a fundamental point worth remembering.  Workers will also have access to supports such as the Transparency International Ireland Speak Up Helpline to help them in understanding how to make a report.</p> <p>  Implementing the requirements as regards internal reporting channels will create a compliance burden for industry.  The European Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment of the directive estimates that the initial set-up costs for a typical small to medium enterprise as being &euro;1,374 in the first year with an ongoing annual cost of &euro;1,054 in subsequent years.  That was based on estimates made in 2017 and with inflation the true cost may now be higher.  This is an issue that I have probed myself to try to understand the costs that are involved in setting up these channels and maintaining them.   </p> <p>  Implementing the requirements is not a simple matter of printing a generic policy document and posting it on a wall in an office.  The directive and the Bill are clear that internal channels must be designed, established and operated in a secure manner that protects the confidentiality of the reporting person and the information they have reported.  In practical terms, this will require firms to appoint and train dedicated staff to operate these channels.  It will require the deployment of dedicated, separate and secure channels such as mail boxes, encrypted emails or webforms and dedicated phone lines and voice messaging systems.  All of these will impose costs on organisations.  Blanket imposition of the requirement to have internal channels to all employers would therefore be disproportionate, particularly given the impact of the pandemic and Brexit on the SME sector in Ireland as well as the pressures they are facing from very high inflation, and unworkable in many situations, particularly for micro enterprises.</p> <p>  It is hard to see what benefit there is in imposing these elaborate requirements on very small local retailers such as the local sweet shop or on a plumber and his apprentice.  It could also create a compliance burden for some voluntary or member-led organisations with a small cohort of employees, particularly in the areas of sport, such as GAA clubs, golf clubs, rugby clubs and heritage and the arts.</p> <p>  Furthermore, article 8.7 of the directive provides that member states can only lower the threshold of 50 employees if they carry out a risk assessment and notify the European Commission accordingly.  The directive sets the floor at 50.  It is open to the member state to go below that but it would require the carrying out of a risk assessment.  This has not been done and, therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.</p> <p>  Section 8, by way of the insertion of a new subsection, provides for a regulation-making power to lower or remove the threshold for certain firms or categories of firms subject to a risk assessment and a public consultation.  Therefore, there is an enabling provision within the Bill that would empower the Minister to bring in a regulation that lowers the threshold.  I accept that there are some sectors involved in certain high-risk activities, as the Deputies have raised, which could benefit from being subject to this requirement.  Indeed, the directive and the Bill already provide that the threshold does not apply in the areas of financial services, aviation safety and oil and gas safety, for example, and, of course, there has never been a threshold in the public sector.  It only applies in the private sector.</p> <p>  A number of submissions from regulators during the public consultation on the general scheme of the Bill identified other areas where there may be benefits in lowering or abolishing the threshold.  For example, ComReg suggested that operators of premium rate phone lines should be put within the scope of this requirement.  A number of suggestions were also made at the pre-legislative scrutiny hearings regarding certain accountancy firms and some technology firms.  We recognise there may be some merit in that and that is why we have provided the enabling provision in the Bill that is before the committee today.</p></speech>

This was a key issue raised in the course of pre-legislative discussion and it also was raised by many speakers on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I gave a commitment to look further into the issue.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 provides that where persons who are employed in a public body have made a protected disclosure prior to this Bill coming into force, they shall be entitled to request feedback from their employer as to what action was taken on foot of their report.  This implements recommendation No. 27 of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.  Following discussions with the Attorney General, we have concluded that it will be possible to provide for retrospective application of the Bill for workers who have reported prior to this legislation's enactment but have suffered retaliation after enactment.  As I said, this is in line with the recommendation in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.  In addition, I have asked the Attorney General to see whether we can go further in this regard, particularly to consider whether retrospection might be possible for workers who have both reported and suffered penalisation before this Bill is enacted but have not yet applied to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the courts for protection.  This is a particularly difficult legal question and the Attorney General has asked for more time to consider its implications.</p><p>Accordingly, I have decided to defer proposals for amendments in this regard to Report Stage in order that we have the opportunity to examine and discuss the full suite of possible enhancements that can be made to the legislation.  As I said, I am committed to providing for retrospection for workers who have reported before enactment but suffered penalisation after enactment, which is what the committee sought in its pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations.  In addition, I am anxious to go further than that.  The delay in bringing forward amendments, which we will do on Report Stage, is to see whether we can, in fact, go further than the committee has recommended.  I have no doubt we will discuss this issue further on Report Stage.  I want to ensure we can stretch the boundaries of what is possible in regard to the retrospective application of this Bill to persons who have made disclosures, who may well have suffered detriment and penalisation and who are not satisfied with the outcome of the process in which they may have been involved.  It is a complex area and retrospective application of legislation is always difficult.  I have conveyed my view to the Attorney General that this is a very important issue on which I would like to make progress.  He is going to do all he can to see whether that is possible and, for that purpose, he has asked for time.  I expect to bring forward additional amendments on the retrospective application issue on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I am happy that we will discuss it further on Report Stage and see if that can be moved on.  I understand that the Minister has stated he will engage further with the Attorney General but anything that can be done to ensure it is retrospective needs to be done because it is so important that we protect those people who did what they did and who put themselves, their families and their livelihoods on the line to blow a whistle and make those protected disclosures.</p></speech>

It is welcome that he is open to discussing the matter further down the line, with the possibility of changes.  We dealt with a similar issue at the Committee on Public Petitions in the context of legacy and so on.  Through agreement and amendments in that regard, we set it up.  It was agreed that we could not be restrictive in respect of the retrospective timeline because that committee is the last stop for people who need to air their views or concerns.  I welcome that the Minister is open to change but I point out that it has already been done at the Committee on Public Petitions through a proper procedure and vote.  I welcome that.</p></speech>

There is a significant issue here.  I do not know how the Minister will get around it legally but effort has to be made by all concerned to recognise the problem we now have.  There are cases currently going through a settlement process in which a certain amount of bullying and intimidation is being applied to get an outcome.  The protected disclosure element is not being recognised by Departments.  These are Departments that are supposed to be leading in terms of legislation and the application of law.  That is quite frightening because it is the State allowing this to happen and paying the legal fees to allow it to happen.  That is wrong.  It is an abuse of power and taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  There are cases that have been before various Departments for years.  I refer to the episode of "RT&Eacute; Investigates" to be broadcast tonight.  Some cases have been with that Department for a considerable time but have not been resolved.  They are all being dealt with internally.  That is wrong.  I will be looking to the next step the Minister will take to determine how all those cases will be dealt with.  They have been stalled not by the whistleblowers but by the State itself using taxpayers' money to achieve the outcome it wants and to block in a very considerable way the whistleblowers and the advancing of the cases being made by those whistleblowers.  That is frightening.</p> <p>  The Minister heads up the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.   The committee previously asked how many cases have been settled and for how much by the various Departments that ended up on the steps of the courthouse.  We asked how many of those cases had a confidentiality clause forced on the whistleblower in the context of a settlement.  That is a significant piece of information that I would like to see as we go to the next Stage of analysing this legislation.  I would also like to know how many Ministers, not just in the current Government but also in previous Governments, received protected disclosures but sat on them.  How many Departments have not processed within the legal framework a protected disclosure?  The Committee of Public Accounts recently received correspondence regarding a whistleblower and named the whistleblower.  That is against the law and the legislation.</p> <p>  As a State, we seem to be presiding over an abuse of the current legislation and of taxpayers' money.  Departments seem to be sitting on cases and refusing to move on them for reasons not known to anyone.  The best trick in the book is to say to anyone inquiring about a whistleblower and the outcome of the case that it is being referred to the Garda.  There are cases in respect of which that statement was made in defence of the status of the case but the response of the Garda was that no case had been referred to it.  I do not think that is good enough.  The Minister and the Government have to take note of what is happening here.  We have to get to the bottom of the issues that all present have raised in the Chamber, at committee meetings and so on.  While this legislation may provide for the future, the manner in which the Minister addresses the retrospective nature of this is what we will be judged on because those people who made protected disclosures have been beaten up by the State and their lives have been ruined.  They have been named here.  They have come before the committee.  There have been cases where the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, has made a recommendation but the Department continues to try to defend itself with taxpayers' money.  How sick is that?  How wrong is it?  When it comes to this particular debate, I certainly will contribute more fully.  We have named names here.  I will not do so again today.  I ask the Minister to check with the various Departments on the questions I have raised and provide some sort of answers as we debate this on next Stage of the Bill.  </p> <p>  As regards the cases that remain to be dealt with, I am not saying all of them will be successful but I am saying to give them a chance.  These people are not making things up.  It may not be a sound piece of evidence that is being received but most of the whistleblowers I have encountered have come forward in good faith to try to improve the lot of the agency, Department or whatever it might be and they have been treated disgracefully by the State.  I really hope we have a fuller debate on this matter, with answers to those questions as we reach that point.  Do I take it the amendment is not being pursued now?</p></speech>

I will revert to it on Report Stage and add to it.</p> <p>  The amendment before us is a retrospective provision.  It is a start but it does not capture all the retrospective issues and the examples the Chairman and colleagues have raised.  I know that for many people, this is the kernel of the Bill.  It is about the ability to apply the additional protections retrospectively to people who have already suffered detriment.  These are whistleblowers who have done the State immeasurable service.  I am anxious to go as far as we possibly can within the legal limits to accommodate that.</p><p>That is the political commitment I am giving.  The Chairman asked that every effort be made.  I assure him that every effort is being made and will be made until this Bill has completed its journey to make it as robust as we can.</p><p> The amendment we are discussing provides that where a person who is employed in a public body has made a protected disclosure prior to this Bill coming into force, they shall be entitled to request feedback from their employer as to what action has been taken on foot of their report.  That was the specific recommendation in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.   We will be able to go further.  We have agreed with the Attorney General that it will be possible to provide for retrospective application of the Bill for workers who have reported prior to the enactment of the legislation but have suffered retaliation after enactment.  This is in line with the committee's recommendation in the report.  We hope to go further than that.</p><p> I have asked the Attorney General to look at retrospection for workers who have both reported a protected disclosure before the Bill is enacted and suffered penalisation, but have not yet applied to the WRC or the courts for protection.  I think many people find themselves in that category.  If they have applied and are in a process with the WRC or have a case before the courts, the Bill will not step in the way of that because they are advanced in the process.  This lines up with the example the Chairman gave a while ago.  If any new penalisation takes place, even if it relates to an old case, somebody is entitled to make a new protected disclosure.  The content of what they are disclosing should be different and new so that it is not the same as the one made under the old legislation.  If any new penalisation is taking place, for example in the resolution of their case, that could constitute a basis for a new protected disclosure that would come fully within the ambit of the new legislation once enacted.</p><p> We are teasing out all those issues with the Attorney General at the moment.  The amendment is a starting point and it establishes that there would be retrospection in certain instances.  We are looking to stretch that as far as we can in line with the issues that the Chairman and Deputies Farrell and Buckley, in particular, have raised.</p></speech>

We have discussed the real-life impact it can have on people and their families.  There can also be a reflexive reaction on the part of the employer to circle the waggons.  We have seen cases where they have cast aspersions on the motivation of the whistleblower and penalised them in the hope that they move on from that process.</p><p>Going externally to the media or the relevant Minister is often one way a whistleblower who felt those administrative barriers were being put in their way can try to circumvent this process, bring attention to the wrongdoing and, therefore, put pressure for it to be resolved.  We have major concerns with this new restrictive conditionality that is applied to going externally.  We feel it is not improving the process of justice.  While this is not directed at the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, in certain situations it could take a Minister off the hook for inaction.</p><p>Some of the witnesses who appeared before the committee outlined serious concerns over corruption and years later their cases remain unresolved.</p><p>It has taken them a long time and that has had an impact.  The concern about the delays is that many people will end up giving up before the wrongdoing is revealed.  The committee recommended that this conditionality be removed.  If I recall correctly, one of the experts who appeared at the committee believed it was quite regressive, hence the reason we have submitted our amendment.  </p></speech>

Again, my experience, even in the previous D&aacute;il, was one where people who came to me with protected disclosures did so as a last case scenario.  It was very difficult to get a reply from a Minister with responsibility in whatever was the relevant field concerning the protected disclosure.  I remember raising such an issue on the floor of the previous D&aacute;il and being told that it was a protected disclosure and what could the Minister do about it.  Those were the words of a former Taoiseach in the House.  I refer to my experience of the way whistleblowers are treated as well.  The biggest worry here, and Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell is right about this, is that the process is strung out for so long.  The financial pain is bad enough, but the mental torture and what happens to these whistleblowers is nothing short of degrading.  I suppose that is the word I will use, and that is being very polite.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned in the last section about going as far as is possible and getting additional protections.  This Bill, as we said from the outset, should be the strongest and the best that can be produced for the people doing this for the public right.  I raised a scenario with the Minister before regarding a situation where a whistleblower or whistleblowers come forward, a protected disclosure is made and the procedure is followed all the way to the top.  Apparently, regarding the issues raised, and here is the crux of this matter, there is no procedure, as it stands, to guarantee that the whistleblower or whistleblowers are being protected while the investigation is ongoing.  There is also no mechanism to truly find out if the issues reported have been resolved.  There is no corridor of inquiry there in that regard.  More important, sometimes misinformation is received back to say that the issues raised have been resolved, when additional protected disclosures state that the original complaint still stands and that the response given was misinformation.  </p> <p>  It is important to recognise that anything that weakens this legislation will be dangerous.  It is our responsibility to keep the Bill as strong as we can and to protect these people.  I say that because I would guess that most of us in the House have protected disclosures on our desks as it is.  They are not going to go away.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022032300002#G00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  The issue we are trying to address here is that the system currently does not work as intended.  We are trying to address that situation.  We are not preventing people from reporting concerns to a Minister.  In line with accepted best practice and in the spirit of the directive, we are merely requiring that a report should be made either to the person's employer or to a prescribed person first.  There are exceptions for emergencies or if the head of the public body concerned is directly complicit in the alleged wrongdoing.</p> <p>  For example, if an official in my Department at a level below that of Secretary General had concerns about the Secretary General, that person could come to me under the Bill as proposed.  That is absolutely fit and proper.  Otherwise, such concerns should come up through the line.  I think it is fair to say that the operation of the ministerial channel has been one of the most challenging areas of the implementation of the Act currently.  The intent behind the provision of a ministerial channel under the Act was to ensure that in the event of a public body failing to deal properly with an internal report, a worker in that public body would have the fallback option of reporting to the Minister.  In practice, there has been a tendency for reporting persons to either go to the Minister first or report simultaneously to their employer and the Minister.  </p> <p>  This practice of simultaneous or near-simultaneous reporting through different channels was raised as a concern by the Disclosures Tribunal, which recommended that the Oireachtas consider amending the legislation, so that when a report is made, the initial recipient is afforded a reasonable amount of time to act before the reporting person moves on to an alternative channel.  Additionally, Article 7 of the directive requires member states to encourage reporting internally in the first instance.  The introduction of a requirement that the reporting person should report using one of the other channels first is intended to address this issue, which is provided for within the directive.  We believe that allowing the Minister to refer disclosures to an independent expert - who will, as the members are aware, be the protected disclosures commissioner we are proposing to establish under the auspices of this Bill &ndash; with the requisite powers to take appropriate action as required, will deal with many of these issues and lead to protected disclosures being addressed in a more professional manner and to better outcomes, particularly for whistleblowers who report, and should appropriately be reporting, to the Minister.  </p> <p>  It may well be the case that the protected disclosures commissioner, having considered a protected disclosure that has been referred to him or her, will send that complaint to the Minister.  That is one possible outcome.  What we do not want to happen is a situation where there is a lack of clarity as to who exactly is responsible for dealing with a protected disclosure.  Often, a disclosure can go to multiple parties, including the Minister.  Therefore, a clear process must be in place regarding what happens when a protected disclosure comes in and who deals with it.  Equally, if such a disclosure does come into the Minister, it should be clear how the Minister should deal with it.  That is what we are seeking to address in the provisions of this Bill.  </p></speech>

My fear here, though, is that the Minister is saying this is a procedural thing and that certain channels should be set out for reporting these types of disclosures.  There seems, however, to be a gap in respect of when the procedural process is followed all the way to the top and the issues have not been addressed.  My problem is that if it is a governmental body or one paid for by public moneys that is responsible for seeing whether issues in protected disclosures have actually been dealt with, and the organisations concerned may not be fully truthful, what body or person then investigates?  Is that the type of situation where the procedure would be for a person to go to the relevant Minister to report the situation if he or she is not happy with the outcome?  Does the Minister understand where I am coming from?</p></speech>

It seems that issues in protected disclosures are still not being resolved, whether people go to a Minister or the Minister refers such disclosures to a body such as the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, for example.  The response comes back down the line to inform me, as a witness for the whistleblower, that the issues have been resolved.  Yet I know from the whistleblower that those issues have not been resolved.  Where does the avenue of procedural correction lie in that case?  That is where my concerns lie.  How do we strengthen and not weaken that aspect?  These powers are needed because sometimes it is the internal bodies that should be investigated as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022032300002#G00700"><p>To add to that, all of us in the House hear about cases that we come across or from individuals that we discuss issues with.  That could be to do with any area, such as banking or anything else.  We hear from whistleblowers, such as in respect of the tracker mortgage issue, for example.  We learn so much about how such things happened, why they happened and so on.  This is a great forum to articulate cases and remedies in the context of such cases to see if we can get that into law.  That is what I am trying to do here.</p> <p>  To go back to the last question posed and to link it to this one, let us take the example of what happens in a situation where a whistleblower has made the disclosure to the appropriate person and is then encouraged by the person to formalise the disclosure.  As the process proceeds over the years and is not dealt with, the matter then enters the legal realm.  That is what happens.  The agency concerned, and that could be the Department of Education, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, or whatever body, then circles the wagons and God help the poor unfortunate concerned when that happens.  The battle starts then and the degrading of the individual, which Deputy Buckley referred to, and the questioning of the integrity of that individual.</p><p>Then ill-health comes into it and all sorts of things happen.  In the course of this, the person decides he or she has not had any remedy, satisfaction or feedback as to whether the agency or entity being complained about has investigated the issues the person raised and that he or she is just simply being stonewalled.  This has happened.</p><p> Then, in later years, the person makes a submission, and Deputy Buckley gave an example, to the Minister.  The public sees the Minister as being the powerful individual over the entity concerned.  A person makes a report and protected disclosure to a Minister but nothing happens.  It then goes from the Minister back to the governing entity and then back to the entity the whistleblower is involved in or working for.  The outcome is a broken person who is not compensated fully and who has been bullied through the system to try to get a resolution and get it off the table.  There is no account as to whether the issues that were raised were dealt with.  To this day there are whistleblowers in this category.  They are waiting for it to be resolved.</p><p> The EU directive states that beyond an explicit prohibition of retaliation provided in law, it is crucial that reporting persons who suffer retaliation have access to legal remedies and compensation.  Unless they are willing to pay a fortune and run against the State they do not have access to legal remedies.  This is part of the problem.  The compensation is always something that will be disputed by the entity about which the complaint has been made.  These are existing cases I am speaking about.  The directive states the appropriate remedy in each case should be determined by the type of retaliation suffered and that the damage caused in such cases should be compensated in full according to the national law.  It states the appropriate remedy could take the form of action for reinstatement in the event of dismissal, transfer or demotion or of withholding of training or promotion.  If a protected disclosure causes a person on a combined salary of &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000 a year to be out sick that person loses all of this salary.</p><p> At the end of years and years of battling with the State agency or Department, the remedy does not in any way equate to the problems created for the person who made the protected disclosure in the first place.  Neither does it address the issues.  Nobody will tell the whistleblowers they were right or wrong or whatever.  It is just a battle against the legal team.  Only one case, which is from the private sector, ever ended up in court with regard to the legislation on protected disclosures because it costs too much to do it.  As we discuss the Bill we are risking throwing all of those individuals in the system under the bus because the system refuses to deal with it.  Somebody has to call a halt to this and insist that every Minister who ever took a protected disclosure from anyone should deal with it.  I do not want to open the coffers of the State to all of these people but they should be judged and there should be an outcome.  The EU directive mentions restoration of cancelled permit, licence or contract and compensation for actual and future losses, past wages and future loss of income, costs linked to a change of occupation, compensation for other economic damage such as legal expenses and costs of medical treatment and for intangible damage such as pain and suffering.  None of this is happening.  It is shocking.</p><p> As legislators we watch how legislation is created and passed in the D&aacute;il and the arguments we all have on either side of the debate.  Then we see it being abused.  It is just wrong.  There are cases like this and I am asking the Minister to look at them and inform himself on how people are being blackguarded and do something about it.  I have read from the EU directive and I can tell the Minister I do not know many agencies in the State that are abiding by that law.  This is why we will have an argument down the line about this.  I do not think any legislation, and this legislation in particular, should be passed without addressing what we have already in the system and without addressing the abuse being heaped on these people on a daily basis.  This abuse has nothing to do with the protected disclosure, by the way.  It is an abuse of power by the legal teams in the State on either side.  We have to ask ourselves why no case has been taken to the courts.  What is going on?  I can tell the Minister there are broken people watching us debating this and they are looking for an outcome.  Some of the outcomes being suggested to them are farcical and wrong and we have to address them.</p></speech>

We have all dealt with situations similar in nature to those that have been described.  There are two sides to it.  A <i>prima facie </i>case should be established so that people cannot unilaterally decide to blacken somebody's name or reputation.  We need to be careful about this.  However, there are situations that come to our attention as elected Members of the Houses and our only response is to raise it in the House and we should do so.  It is the only place we get the privilege to do so.  On the other hand there are cases where there is already in existence a body that is appropriate to deal with the situation.</p><p>I can think of a particular case where the House would not deal with something because it was more appropriate for another body to deal with it.  It cost the State an awful lot more because the case went to court and the individual won.  The cost was immeasurably greater than it would have been if the issue had been answered in the first instance.  There will be others I have no doubt about it.  I remember being involved in arguments with the people concerned and saying they should settle it quickly, acknowledge it and deal with it and do whatever had to be done.  This was not done.  I got lectures about the law and all sorts about what consequences were.  That was all nonsense.  In the long and the short of it, when the court made its decision and rightly so, the cost to the State was much greater than was anticipated at the beginning.  Somebody was doing something wrong.</p><p>There are such situations that come up from time to time.  The only way Members of the Oireachtas can deal with them is to table a parliamentary question.  If the question is not answered it means perhaps that behind the scenes the relevant Department said that it did not want to answer the question and it was none of its business.  It is all nonsense and the Chair has said this already.</p></speech>

Otherwise we are all breaking the law.  It is not that every whistleblower is right but the Minister owes it to whistleblowers to find out whether the complaints they are making are right or wrong.  If it involves another person being been complained about, the Minister also owes it to that person to ensure it is sorted.  I challenge the Minister to take some of the cases he may be aware of and look at them and find out for himself how bad it is.  We have made our points.</p></speech>

This amendment is about the deletion of lines 15 to 29 where we see the words, "emergency situation or a risk of irreversible damage".  Realistically, most protected disclosures are made in such situations.  It is very difficult for people and we have seen the significant impact it has had on them.  Putting this in is regressive.  Making anything more difficult for people who have done so much in the interest of everybody and for the betterment of our society and the way it works, which these lines do, should not be part of this Bill.</p></speech>

I fully understand and appreciate that many people are watching this debate.  They are looking at it through the lens of their own experiences which, in many instances, have not been good and they want to see a way forward provided through this legislation.  They expect the committee and the Oireachtas to bring about improvements.  That is exactly what we seek to do.</p> <p>  One of the main changes that will be introduced as a result of the enactment of this Bill is feedback and an outcome.  Under the existing Act, one makes a disclosure and does not have a legal right to an outcome.  One does not have a legal right to know how exactly it has been dealt with or to get any feedback.  That will be quite explicit in this Bill, which is a very important reform and a major step forward.</p> <p>  On the question of the ministerial channel and the related issues we have been teasing out, it cannot be considered in isolation from the role of the protected disclosures commissioner.  Let us call it the protected disclosures commissioner's office.  That office will be there to assist whistleblowers.  Whistleblowers will be able to contact the office to seek advice as to who is the appropriate prescribed person to refer a protected disclosure to.</p> <p>  It can be very difficult.  There are currently approximately 100 prescribed persons under the legislation.  If somebody at work sees something that he or she believes is very wrong and does not know where to turn, once this Bill is enacted, there will be a protected disclosures commissioner's office the person can contact.  The office will advise and guide the person as to who is the most appropriate prescribed person for that disclosure to be referred to.  That point is important and worth making.</p> <p>  In situations, which will be rare given there is a very large number of prescribed persons, in which the office cannot identify who the appropriate person is, it can deal with the protected disclosure, follow through and come to an ultimate determination in respect of it.  That is a very important change which will be made by this Bill once it is enacted, it is hoped, in the weeks and months ahead.</p> <p>  What we seek to do in respect of the ministerial channel is to make sure there is a proper process.  In reality, what will happen when a Minister receives a protected disclosure under the new regime, once the Bill is enacted, is it will be referred to the protected disclosures commissioner to assess who is the most appropriate prescribed person to deal with that disclosure.  It could well be the case that the most appropriate person is the Minister, in which case it will be referred back to him or her.  The Minister will then inherit all of the obligations under the new Act to consider, provide feedback and, ultimately, to come to a view as to the outcome of that protected disclosure.  Those points are important for context.</p> <p>  This is not in any way an effort to diminish the rights of people.  It actually strengthens them for all of those reasons.  They will now have a right to an outcome and feedback.  They have a right to have their case dealt with by somebody, be it a prescribed or suitable person designated by the commissioner or indeed the commissioner.  That represents significant progress for whistleblowers who, at present, operate in an environment which is not what it should be.</p> <p>  The Act was of its time.  It was groundbreaking for its time but it has been in operation for seven or eight years and we have seen its shortcomings.  We are using the opportunity of the transposition of this directive to try to improve it.  We are improving it, including in the treatment of the ministerial channel that is proposed.</p></speech>

Subsections (1)(a) and (5) of section 10B make reference to &ldquo;designated persons&rdquo; but do not define what these are.  As &quot;designated persons&rdquo; are also referred to and defined in sections 10C and 10D, without this clarification there is the possibility of confusion arising as regards who is a &ldquo;designated person&rdquo; under each of these sections.  Amendment No. 28 provides for the insertion of this definition of a designated person into section 10B.  The remaining amendments are of a technical nature to address consequential changes to numbering and cross-references to &ldquo;designated persons&rdquo; in the Bill.</p></speech>

This reflects a number of concerns raised with the Department since the Bill was published that this provision was too restrictive and could impede effective investigation of wrongdoing.  The key purpose behind this amendment is to ensure that the legislation does not in any way stand in the way of a prescribed person or the commissioner from taking such actions as they see fit to address the wrongdoing reported.  There have been issues with the duty to protect the identity of the reporting person.  The amendments that have been made to section 16 of the principal Act and the various provisions setting out conditions under which a report may be transmitted to a more suitable competent authority go a long way to addressing that.</p><p>I do not want to repeat the same mistakes as regards confidentiality that in the past led to some employers and prescribed persons being paralysed by the confidentiality provisions in the legislation as regards the actions they could take to address the wrongdoing reported.  This amendment provides the necessary clarification in this regard. </p></speech>

This implements recommendation 44 of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.</p><p>Article 17 of the directive makes clear that all reports be processed in a manner compliant with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and other data protection laws.  Since the GDPR applies universally, it was not originally considered necessary to make specific reference to this.  However, to implement the committee&rsquo;s recommendation on secure transmission of reports, this amendment makes it clear that data protection law applies generally to this legislation and specifically to the transmission of any reports to third parties. </p></speech>

This was proposed by the Ombudsman's office and is in line with the practice that has applied to the other bodies within the ombudsman family, that is, the Ombudsman, the Information Commissioner, the registrar of lobbying, the Standards in Public Office Commission and so on.  It also implements recommendation 42 of the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  It will be a significant help to us in getting better information and data on how the system is operating and on how protected disclosures are being dealt with.  The introduction of annual reporting is an important reform.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-23a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022032300002#L05200"><p>My main concluding remark is on something that has been the theme of today's meeting and all of our discussions, that is, the great sense of gratitude many members of the committee have for those people who have blown the whistle and done such really great service to the people and to the State.  Deputy Buckley and I strongly believe that everything that can be done to protect future whistleblowers, and, as has been discussed here today, those who have previously come forward, must be done and that they must be given all possible protection.  There is something very strange in people being penalised and given a difficult time for doing something that is in the public interest rather than in their own interest.  There are a lot of positives in this Bill.  We will discuss further amendments on Report Stage on things the Minister discussed earlier.  My main point is that we owe a debt of gratitude to those who have blown the whistle.</p></speech>

I also thank the members.  As has been said many times, the two most difficult things to do in this country are to tell the truth and to help people because you normally get punished for it.  This is important.  Everybody should be proud of what has already been achieved, even though nothing has been achieved.  We must be aware of the people outside here who have been persecuted, battered, beaten down, broken and had accusations made against them, yet still have the courage to stand up and do the right thing.  They have to be commended.  I thank the Minister and Deputy Farrell.</p></speech>

We have had a good discussion and that will continue in the D&aacute;il Chamber on Report Stage.  We have work to do on this side of the House on further amendments and so on, which I will say a word on in a moment.  I acknowledge the work of the committee at pre-legislative stage.  It made a difference and we put forward amendments to reflect key recommendations made by the committee.  It was a job well done and it strengthened and improved the Bill.</p> <p>  I echo the sentiment of the Chairman and other colleagues about the debt of gratitude we owe as a society to whistleblowers.  Words are easy but they want tangible action from Government and the system to support and vindicate them.  That is not to say every whistleblower is correct in respect of every allegation made.  Nobody is saying that, but where disclosures are made, there needs to be a clear and transparent process, an outcome and reasons for that outcome.  Instances of penalisation where people are punished for making a disclosure need to be dealt with strongly.  I am keen that we make progress in that space.</p> <p>  I will table amendments on Report Stage to give further retrospective application to the Bill.  There are a number of other areas where I am considering bringing amendments on Report Stage.  One area raised in the pre-legislative scrutiny report concerned the time limits for making complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I am looking into the issue with the WRC, the T&aacute;naiste's Department and the Attorney General and may make proposals on it on Report Stage.</p> <p>  I understand the HSE has sent the committee the reports on the interaction between the Protected Disclosures Act and the Health Acts.  My Department has also been furnished with a copy of this report, which it had not seen before.  My officials are examining it and I will consider if any Report Stage amendments in this regard are needed.   It may be more proper for the Minister for Health to bring such proposals, depending on which legislation needs to be changed.  We will consider that in the next week or two.</p> <p>  There are a number of areas of sectoral legislation where amendments on Report Stage may be required to clarify the relationship with this Bill.  My officials are in discussion with the Attorney General and the Departments involved.</p></speech>

The important things for a complainant are that there is a conclusion and outcome, that the complaint is investigated and that whether it is right or wrong is clarified in the course of it.  The wall of silence is not acceptable.  It is an old-fashioned idea that if you avoid it long enough, it will go away by itself.  A wrong does not go away by itself or with help.  The proposed legislation will deal with this in a meaningful way.  It will be an important contribution to labour law and law in general.  The important things are that the public can rely on it, realise they have done their job in so far as they can and it is up to somebody else to deal with it now, and that they see it being dealt with.</p></speech>

The pre-legislative scrutiny process has proven very worthwhile on this occasion.  Great thanks are due to members who contributed to that process and to bringing about a report which was helpful to the Minister and is reflected in the content of various amendments that came forward.  Good work has been done there.</p> <p>  The opinion of the committee is that the whistleblowers left in the system who have not been dealt with constitute a key piece that has to be dealt with.  I have raised some issues with the Minister and would love to see them addressed on the basis of fair play.  Will the Minister look back over the transcript of the meeting?  Some of the issues that emerged could be dealt with in the course of the debate in the D&aacute;il on Report and Final Stages.</p></speech>
